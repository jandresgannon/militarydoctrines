The full articulation of U.S. National Strategy requires the development and integration of each set of strategies into a comprehensive whole. The various instruments of U.S. national power and the strategies for their use do not stand alone; rather, they are inextricably linked and, to be effective, must be mutually supportive. Part I of this study provides the common starting point towards this end.  The overall study process will build upon this common starting point by means of individual study segments.  Part III of this study will consider the military component only.  The other components of U.S. national strategy as outlined above are the subject of companion studies being undertaken on an expeditious basis. Additional studies will also be undertaken concerning the role of intelligence, covert operations, and arms control in supporting the implementing strategies.

"5","South Korea",2000,"Cooperation And Conflict In Northeast Asia  Northeast Asian countries share a common understanding: 1 US and China now especially emerges as the key variable in the Northeast Asian affairs. Problems in the past, such as the bombing of the Chinese embassy by NATO fighter planes and the US House Representative's Cox Report, which raised suspicions of China's direct involvement in the stolen plans of highly confidential nuclear bombs and missiles, have aggravated their relationship. Furthermore, the US is pushing through the Congress a bill called the ""Taiwan Security Enhancement Act,"" over which China has expressed extreme displeasure. However, positive efforts have not been neglected as the bilateral agreement to secure China's eventual entrance into the World Trade Organization was recently signed and as renewed military exchanges began to reduce the built-up tension.  China also found some common ground with Japan. Both recognize the priority of economic progress and regional security and the symbolic significance of China's membership in the WTO. Progress, however, is offset by a serious territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu Islands) and by the highly intense tug-of-war for political influence in the region. Russia generally maintains an agreeable relationship with China, as both sides concur on the need for force reduction and to build confidence in their border region, contributing much to stability in Northeast Asia.  On the other hand, Russia's relations with Japan since the end of the Cold War has evolved into one of a strategically mapped out quid pro quo  cooperative system. A good example is the way both are approaching the problem of the Kurile Islands (Japan's ""Northern Territories"" ). A schematic design of economic exchanges, based on the Hashimoto-Yeltsin Plan, is in place, along with a diplomatic agreement, to ensure a peaceful resolution.  As is obvious from the previous discussions, the mood in Northeast Asia is upbeat, with clear signs of open cooperation for regional progress. But also as noted above, numerous elements of conflict remain to threaten this progress. Just one example is the latest revelation that, despite signs of reform, open policy, and all-around diplomacy, North Korea remains a threat because of the unresolved problems of nuclear and ballistic missiles.  Fortunately, the Inter-Korea summit in June of 2000, the first of its kind in 55 years, produced much hoped-for results, with increased exchanges and cooperation. The world community promises to keep a watchful eye on this development between the two nations.  ","section",34,"southkorea_2000_DefenseWhitePaper"
"6","Finland",2004,"  Central Asia and the Caucasus are becoming increasingly important for the stability of Europe. Not only the EU, but also the UN, the OSCE and other international organizations are targeting the region for action. The greatest challenge is to support the transition countries of the region in the social reforms that are required of them. Two important changes have taken place in the region in recent years: Russia, China, Iran and Turkey have become more active actors in the area, while the United States has established a presence in the region as a result of the war in Afghanistan and the fight against terrorism. The oil and gas reserves in the Caspian Sea are also helping to make Central Asia and the Southern Caucasus more attractive to outsiders.  The ‘frozen’ conflicts in the region, i.e. the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh between Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Southern Caucasus, the regional conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia and the Transdniestrian conflict in Moldova, all have their origins in the final years of Soviet hegemony. The decade after the cease-fire agreements has not produced progress in settling the conflicts. The war in Chechnya in the Northern Caucasus is still continuing.  Sub-Saharan Africa is becoming poorer and increasingly marginalized, which is creating instability in the region. There are several serious conflicts taking place in Africa, and the region will continue to need UN assistance and an increasing amount of EU assistance to alleviate its humanitarian catastrophes and to support stable and sustainable development.  In Asia there are many unsolved issues that have the potential for developing into wider conflicts. At the same time, Asia is a major operator in the world economy, and thus developments there have a significant impact on European and global security. Any heightening of tension around Taiwan may have global repercussions, and the situation in North Korea may also develop into a conflict if the country continues the development of nuclear weapons. The dispute on Kashmir between India and Pakistan has acquired a new dimension from the struggle against terrorism and the nuclear arsenals of the two countries. The stabilization of Afghanistan will require support from the international community for many years to come.  2.1.6 Global and cross-border security problems  Organized c ime drugs and human trafficking r,  Organized crime is increasingly operating across state borders. Organizations involved in drug crimes, human trafficking and various types of economic crime threaten the functioning of societies by trying to infiltrate their legal structures. They endanger international security by exploiting the openness of borders and by using failing states as bases and sources of influence.

"8","France",2008,"  This is the situation in the Horn of Africa, in the Great Lakes region, and in the region of the Sahel. In Asia, the risks of unresolved conflicts rooted in history could threaten international security on a large scale if they are not headed off: these include the Korean question, the Taiwanese question, and the question of Kashmir. With at least three declared nuclear powers (China, India and Pakistan) and the presence of two other major powers in the Far East (Russia and the United States), these risks are a cause for concern.  **_The new strategic situation and instability_**  _Globalisation is creating a world that is neither better nor more dan-_ _gerous than two decades ago. It does, on the other hand, foreshadow the_ _outlines of a distinctly more unstable international system, more out of_ control and hence more disquieting, calling for both more global and highly specific responses.  THE PROGRESSIVE SHIFT IN THE CENTRE OF STRATEGIC GRAVITY TOWARDS ASIA  Looking to 2025, Asia will be one of the major centres of international life, alongside Europe and America. New powers will have emerged, China and India foremost among them. More than half of the world’s population will be of Asian origin at that date, representing around 4.7 billion people. China is expected to become the world’s number one importer and exporter. Barring a major internal or international upset, China’s gross domestic product (GDP) and that of India could triple over the next two decades, and Asia could by then account for half of global oil consumption. This growing power, coupled with that of other emerging countries, foreshadows the outlines of a reshaped global economic and geopolitical system. The relative importance of the new powers, the scale of the interests at stake, and the competition for access to markets and resources, are modifying the global strategic equation. Asia’s rise is not without its fragilities, as is witnessed by the risks of economic overheating, the persistent underdevelopment of whole swathes of the population, and its exposure to major natural risks or ecological disasters. Nor is it irreversible, should one of the causes of potential conflict lead to war, which given the region’s conditions, could prove devastating. Consequently, Asia is one of the main regions   ","page",29,"france_2008_TheFrenchWhitePaperonDefenceandNationalSecurity"

The British diplomatic network in the US remains strong and close military cooperation, as was demonstrated in Libya, remains critical to the success of ongoing operations, including in Afghanistan.  Intelligence sharing, counter-terrorism cooperation and collaborative work on cyber operations has developed throughout the year.  In the longer term, the UK and US Joint Strategy Board announced during President Obama's visit in May will take a joint approach to long-term planning between the two nations. The SDSR committed to intensifying the defence and security relationship with France.  The November 2010 UK-France Summit saw the signing of two groundbreaking and wide-ranging defence and security cooperation treaties.  Close UK- No. of the may be and the state of the sub- French cooperation over Libya demonstrated the ability of the two nations' armed forces to work together, maximising capabilities in a complex, multinational setting.   The UK and France have also conducted two major exercises and have agreed a five-year exercise plan to develop the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force capability.  Advances in equipment cooperation include the establishment of a joint project office on Unmanned Air Systems.  As well as announcing the intention to strengthen relationships with our established closest allies, in September the FCO announced a Network Shift towards an expanded overseas network and deeper diplomatic relationships with Emerging Powers.  This involves extending the UK's diplomatic presence in China and India, with additional reinforcements in Brazil, Thailand, South Korea, North Korea, Mongolia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Angola, Botswana, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Panama, Peru, Pakistan, Vietnam, the Philippines and Taiwan.   It also involves opening new Embassies in South Sudan and Kyrgyzstan, reopening Embassies in Cote d'Ivoire, El Salvador and Madagascar and, in due course, opening a new Embassy in Somalia.  The programme is funded by savings from European posts and by reducing the footprint in Iraq and Afghanistan over time.  Ministers have also increased visits to key countries, including 80 visits to the Gulf in the last year, and formalised new arrangements, such as the UK-Turkey Strategic Partnership signed in Ankara by the two Prime Ministers in July 2010.   The UK's key role as a permanent member of the UN Security Council was emphasised by events in Libya and the leading role in gaining widespread support for UN SCR 1970 and UN SCR 1973 to protect the Libyan people.  The UK also promoted the role of the UN Secretary General's Special Representative for Libya and the Special Envoy for post conflict planning in providing a quick and integrated response. Other UNSCRs on North Korea, Cote d'Ivoire, Sudan/South Sudan and Somalia demonstrated the role the UN continues to play in addressing threats to international peace and security. NATO's role in enforcing UN resolutions through the No Fly Zone in Libya demonstrated the ability of the two organisations to work together towards international crises, within a wider coalition of willing participants.  The UK was a driving force in maintaining political will to sustain the NATO operation and will continue to invest in the reform of the NATO Command Structure and strongly support the Secretary General's efforts to improve NATO efficiency and effectiveness.  The UK continues to work closely with EU partners to ensure that, alongside NATO, Europe promotes shared security and prosperity interests. The UK has led the debate on tougher action on piracy while maintaining an activated national headquarters (HQ) at Northwood commanding EU Operation ATALANTA, the EU mission to counter piracy off the coast of Somalia.  The UK continues to press for stronger action in the Balkans and Afghanistan, while supporting greater EU capability development and better EU-NATO relations. The SDSR committed to producing integrated strategies for the countries and regions of greatest significance or risk.  For priority countries and regions, the NSC has approved these government-wide strategies for systematically pursuing wider national objectives.  These strategies are regularly reviewed to respond to ongoing developments and track progress towards objectives and drive individual country plans, which have been developed for each country where there is UK representation.  The SDSR committed to promoting the UK's economic interests through commercial diplomacy.  In May, the FCO published the Charter for Business, which set out how the diplomatic network will support the UK's economic interests overseas and help deliver growth.  Successes include opening markets in India worth £500 million, defending a UK company in Korea from a multi-million pound tax claim, and assisting a UK company in Qatar to secure business worth £2 billion. Commercial diplomacy efforts include support for British defence exports, including the highly capable Eurofighter Typhoon, which has made the final stages of several major export competitions and is now in service with six nations.  The UK has continued to champion multilateral trade liberalisation, encourage World Trade Organisation accessions and promote bilateral EU Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), such as the Korean FTA that came into force in July and is expected to net the UK £150 million per year.  The SDSR committed to focusing the UK's overall defence engagement, the use of defence capabilities to increase the UK's influence and understanding across the world.  In May the Foreign and Defence Secretaries announced a new defence engagement strategy to be published before the end of 2011, to ensure that UK maximises influence through use of defence assets and activities to support wider national goals of protecting our security, enhancing our prosperity and protecting UK  citizens.   The SDSR committed to establishing a National Space Security Policy.  To fulfil this, a Space Security team has been formed in the Cabinet Office and is working to publish a National Space Security Policy in 2012.  The SDSR committed to a system of lead Ministers, accountable to the NSC,  responsible for overseeing the co-ordination of SDSR implementation.  Over the last year, progress has been monitored by a cross-Government Implementation Board of senior officials, based in Cabinet Office and reporting to NSC.  This underscores the joint, whole-of-Government approach that the NSC continues to take on issues of national security.  The acid test of any defence and security strategy is its ability to deal with a crisis.  The UK's prompt and flexible military, diplomatic and stabilisation activity in Libya confirmed the validity of many of the key conclusions of the SDSR.  The outstanding performance of the Armed Forces and civilians demonstrated the UK's continued ability to project power flexibly and to take a leading role in shaping international events.  The UN, EU and NATO again demonstrated their centrality. The excellent political and military cooperation with France, other NATO and European partners and Gulf States demonstrated the vital importance of strengthening defence ties with existing allies and new partners in tackling defence and security.   The Government remains determined to update the NSC biannually on SDSR progress and will continue to provide public annual reports.  In 2012, there will be a further update to Parliament and, in line with the commitment in the National Security Strategy, a review of the National Security Risk Assessment.  .  and     and The Real Children Company of Children Company of Children Come of Childr","section",5,"uk_2011_SecurityReview"

Asia is unlikely to reach the level of European integration within the period analysed. However, the movement towards an Asian basket of currencies — if not a common currency — is more than a theoretical possibility. Integration in the security and defence fields is very unlikely in Asia. It is not clear if the protracted disputes (Taiwan, relations between China and Japan and between South Korea and North Korea) will be solved. Moreover competition for natural resources may become a new source of tension. The success of integration will determine the Asian states` attitude towards the US as a balancing power in the region. [83]  Table 1. Future development trends of the main international organisations   **NATO will remain a political–military alliance aimed at ensuring the protection of territories and interests** of its member states in the transatlantic area. The attention (active role) of the US in NATO will depend on concrete actions of European countries: whether they will demonstrate their support to the principle of burden sharing among allies, and whether they will properly contribute to NATO operations and the development of collective capabilities of the Alliance. Europe is very unlikely to become a single unit in the transatlantic relations (possible cleavages include Atlantism vs. Europeism, attitude towards Russia, etc.). The Central and Eastern European countries will preserve or even reinforce their attempts to maintain close bilateral relations with the US. There is almost no doubt that the Alliance will keep expanding: some European non-NATO countries are likely to join it. NATO is likely to strengthen its cooperation with partners: countries from the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, countries of the Mediterranean Dialogue (North Africa) and the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative, also the global partners Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. NATO will maintain individual cooperation agendas with Russia and Ukraine, but due to different reasons (remaining Russia’s hostility toward NATO, Ukraine’s geopolitical indecisiveness) these partnership relations may not avoid tensions. Except for countries from the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the question of membership of other NATO partners is unlikely to be considered. Even though collective defence commitments established by the Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty will remain the unifying principal of the members of the Alliance, NATO`s practical activities will be mostly oriented to crisis management. Other international actors such as China or Russia are likely to show increasing interest in competition with the Alliance for leadership in international operations.   The EU will remain the most integrated international organisation. However, despite ambitious goals, its further political integration may slow down because of many factors, including the prolonged Eurozone crisis. Disparities in the development of member states as well as different interests may strengthen the division of the EU into internal blocs (multi-speed integration). The EU common foreign, security and defence policy will continue to be built on the principles of intergovernmentalism and consensus and oriented primarily to the use of political, diplomatic and crisis management measures. The main obstacles to the stronger EU`s ‘hard power’ will remain the unwillingness of member states to relinquish their sovereignty in the defence policy even to  83 Ibid, p. 83–84.

Poland is considered a country in which corruption – understood as using one’s position or infl uence for personal gain – is quite common. According to global data from 2012 collected by Transparency International, Poland ranked 41[st] (out of 176 countries surveyed) and scored 58 points (on the scale of 0-100, where 0 means the highest index of corruption in the public sector) – table 1.

"12","Belgium",2019,"  ##### Asia-Pacific  Looking eastward, the rise of China as Asia's leading power has far-reaching consequences for the regional and global security outlook. In many ways, China remains a fragile power. A significant part of its population remains poor, its economy unbalanced, and the environmental challenges significant. Yet, most of its neighbours are either growing more slowly or are marred by more severe domestic challenges. China's share of Asia's economic production has grown from 14 percent in 2000 to 49 percent in 2018, and at the current growth rate could reach 57 percent in the next ten years.[23] China's share of Asia's defence spending is now 51 percent, meaning that it spends more on defence than its neighbours combined.  The security repercussions of China's ascent are manifold. China asserting its claims on Taiwan, adjacent seas and the contested border with India more assertively could lead to incidents and possibly armed conflicts. It remains to be seen how the United States will respond to China's challenge to its leadership. Growing distrust between the two powers already complicates international cooperation. It is clear that a new military arms race between the two is unfolding. This involves competition for military supremacy in the Pacific, exacerbates rivalry in space and cyberspace, and accelerates the development of new weapons, including all sorts of missile systems and unmanned combat vehicles. For the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union, countries must consider the prospect of a new major power war.  We are seeing the formation of a long Pacific front line, with lesser powers attempting to preserve their sovereignty and influence in between China and the United States. Regional tensions and great power politics are intertwined. From north to south, there is the territorial dispute between Russia and Japan, the uncertain outlook of North Korea as a nuclear power, tensions between China, Japan, and South Korea, partially over the East China Sea, Taiwan's struggle for autonomy, and the territorial conflicts in the South China Sea.  Unchecked, a rising China will also advance its interests more assertively beyond the Asia-Pacific region. The whole of Eurasia could turn into a single arena of great power competition. Countries like China, Russia, and Iran, despite mutual distrust, work together from the geographic centre, and are also challenging Western dominance in the maritime belt around Eurasia – from the Indian Ocean to the Arctic, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. China also challenges some of our constitutional values. While China's leadership initially insisted that all politics should remain domestic, the current leadership suggests that its authoritarian system offers a new option for other countries.[24] This new competition blends geo-economics and geopolitics. It is about economic means to advance political power, and vice versa.   ","page",29,"belgium_2019_SecurityReview"

The emphasis was put on the need to put politics aside and confront the virus devastating humankind. Simultaneously in China, the media, heavily controlled by the Communist Party, was actively defaming, demonising and ridiculing Western democracy, saying that only an authoritarian system like China could successfully defeat the virus. They failed to mention that the democratic and self-governing island of Taiwan was much more successful in managing the epidemic. During large ceremonies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait in May, events in Taipei could be held without masks, because the spread of the virus was under control. It is worth noting that Taiwan’s population density is twice as high as in   Hubei Province, where the first cases of coronavirus infection were recorded.  In addition to smearing the West, Chinese media praised the obedience of China’s people and their willingness to cooperate with the authorities during the spread of the virus. At the same time, thousands of Chinese citizens worldwide were on the brink of mental breakdown, having been barred from returning home. Following border closures, at first only the privileged few – diplomats, certain specialists, the odd delegation and students sent by the state to study abroad – could buy a ticket for the special flights run by a Chinese airline once a week.

"14","Spain",2021,"  ASIA-PACIFIC   The steady shift in the world’s centre of economic and strategic gravity towards Asia-Pacific makes this an area of interest for Spain.  The European Union has stated its commitment to the stability and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region, a key geographic area for international security, which is  experiencing rising geopolitical competition.  Maritime disputes in the South China Sea, tensions involving Taiwan, the conflict over Kashmir, and border disputes between India and China all introduce elements of regional instability, which are compounded by threats such as the development of nuclear weapons and delivery systems by the North Korea, and the spread of transnational jihadist terrorism.  Countries such as India and China are becoming increasingly relevant in international affairs. Moreover, regional initiatives such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement are expanding the region’s influence on the world’s economy.  China’s rise as a global power can be seen in its New Silk Road initiative, its technological dominance, and its growing investing presence in Latin America and Africa, as well as in European countries. In its relationship with Beijing, the European Union combines elements of systemic rivalry, areas of competition, and common global challenges such as climate change and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, which require cooperation.  The situation in Afghanistan after the US withdrawal could have a significant geopolitical impact, with the possible reconfiguration of relations, both globally and regionally. The potential deterioration of the humanitarian and human rights situation poses an additional challenge. Moreover, for Europe’s security it will be especially important to prevent the country from once again becoming a haven for terrorists and a hotbed of organized crime.

The outbreak of an armed conflict between the island of Taiwan and the People's Republic of China would risk causing catastrophic disruption of global political stability as well as the disruption of international trade and supply, production and value chains with significant consequences for Luxembourg.   Beyond the European continent, we are witnessing a hardening of the competition between the great powers – a competition that can be read as an expression of rivalry between opposing political systems (autocracies vs. democracies). In this context, both the EU and NATO have sought to redefine the nature of their relations with great powers that do not adhere to democratic principles. Thus, the EU's 2022 Strategic Compass notes that: “China is a _partner for cooperation, an economic competitor_ _and a systemic rival”._  The NATO Strategic Concept 2022, for its part, elaborates on the subject as follows: “The _People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) stated_ _ambitions and coercive policies challenge our_ _interests, security and values.
