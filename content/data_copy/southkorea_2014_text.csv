43312,"**Message from the Minister of National Defense**  Despite the difficult circumstances faced by our military in 2014, the Republic of Korea’s armed  forces joined the ranks of advanced nations’ elite fighting forces and created an “open barracks culture” to gain the trust of the public.  The Armed Forces of the Republic of Korea (ROK) have valiantly protected the nation from multiple  crises, including the Korean War, when sufficient quantities of adequate weaponry were unavailable, and provided the peninsula with stable security during the rapid push for modernization. At this hour, ROK troops are standing guard, preserving the peace and ensuring freedom for all citizens. Furthermore, our overseas peacekeeping and reconstruction missions are providing hope to millions of displaced families in dire need of the basic standards of life and elevating the stature of the ROK in the eyes of the world.  The threat to security on the Korean Peninsula has never been greater. North Korea is committed to  maintaining and training massive numbers of conventional forces while simultaneously advancing its asymmetric forces and weapons of mass destruction that shake the stability of the Korean Peninsula, Northeast Asia and the world.  Historical and territorial conflicts and a growing arms race have intensified among the countries of  Northeast Asia. Transnational and non-military threats, including terrorism, both at home and abroad, cyber-attacks, infectious diseases and massive natural disasters are ever increasing.  The ROK-U.S. Combined Defense System stands as a deterrent to provocations from North Korea and  other transnational and non-military threats. Should North Korea attempt any aggressive military action, the retaliation by our forces will be overwhelmingly swift and decisive. Our forces perform their duties in a disciplined environment that is both safe and conducive to mission readiness. Moral education and pragmatic education courses and training contribute to the creation of a confident, proud, and fully prepared soldier.  The bilateral military alliance of the Republic of Korea and the United States has gained strength and  resolve to deal with regional and global security issues through an expanding level of cooperation and a continued commitment to joint military exercises that strengthen readiness, thus developing into a comprehensive strategic alliance. Also, in order to deter nuclear and missile provocations from North Korea and to boost the rapid response capabilities necessary to deal with instability factors in Northeast Asia, we have reinforced bilateral and multilateral defense exchanges and cooperation with neighboring countries through hotlines that link defense and military authorities and active senior-level strategic dialogues.  The ROK Armed Forces established the ROK’s Defense Reform Basic Plan (2014-2030), which  reflects today’s internal and external security landscape and ever-changing defense environment. The plan’s precepts on defense reform policy ensure that our military structure is fully prepared for all contingencies of future wars and our defense management system is operationally efficient. Our Agency for Defense Development (ADD), a world-class defense research and development institution, is pursuing the development of defense science and technology, while vitalizing civilian-military cooperation through the transfer of defense technologies to the private sector.",page,4,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43313,"We think the starting point of strong armed forces is true military  discipline that safeguards the human rights of all personnel. Our “open barracks culture” represents a significant step in freeing our soldiers and their families from concerns about the fair and equitable treatment of all personnel. The efforts are not just to prevent incidents within the barracks but to fundamentally transform the spirit, culture and system of service members and to strengthen the foundation of our military by ensuring an “advanced elite military” stands ready to achieve victory against any enemy. Government-wide measures that guarantee human rights and build sound character among all service members, strengthen the leadership of junior officers and NCOs, open the closed doors of barracks, and create safe working conditions are being instituted in compliance with the recommendations of the Civil-Government-Military Barracks Culture Reform Committee.  We are strengthening the fundamentals by reinforcing our military readiness posture and formulating  a defense environment that best suits the needs of our service members, the bedrock of our combat strength. To stand ready for future uncertainties, we are strengthening independent defense capabilities and creating a favorable strategic environment for our national interests while preparing for the unification of Korea.  The 2014 Defense White Paper highlights the major achievements and defense policy modifications  made during the first two years of the Park Geun-hye administration, which chose “Construction of a Robust Security Posture” as one of the tenets of its national security strategy. This publication contains details on barracks culture reform, which is of great concern to all, our capability to respond to North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats, and the efforts to garner people’s confidence in force improvement projects. Details of regulatory reforms, National Defense 3.0, the normalization of abnormal practices, trust-building process on the Korean Peninsula, and initiatives pursued at the government-wide level are also included. This year’s version differs from previous publications in that it contains QR codes so that readers can watch videos related to the field of defense on their smartphones and gain a greater understanding of the content.  ways that are consistent with an “advanced elite military” and that enhance the ROK’s stature in the world. I would like to take this opportunity to ask for your continued support in the rebuilding of our military based on the concept of “Defense with a Robust Foundation, Defense Preparing for the Future.”  Thank you.   We will continue to firmly defend the Republic of Korea from all threats and perform our duties in  December 31, 2014  Han Min-koo  Minister of National Defense, Republic of Korea",page,5,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

43318,"**Section 1 Global Security Environment**  While the present international order dominated by the United States remains intact, many factors of chal­  lenges, such as the emergence of regional powers, are on the rise, calling for changes in such order. As  local conflicts are still occurring and transnational threats continue to proliferate, security uncertainty in  the international community is growing ever more. The magnitude of new security threats, including  economic instability and the changing patterns of future wars, is also increasing.  **1. U.S.-led International Order and Emergence of Regional Powers**  It is not likely that the post-Cold War international order to date will go through sudden  changes. However, factors of challenges that call for changes in the international order are on  the rise. The United States will continue to maintain its dominant position in spite of defense  budget cuts, based on its overwhelming military superiority, advanced scientific technology  and soft power. China is also likely to continue to strengthen its international status with its  rapidly growing economy. It will also play a crucial role in the process of realigning the  global security order while forming a “new type of great power relations”[1] with the United  States. Due to the EU’s pursuit of external expansion, Russia’s attempt to recover its past  influence, and the rise of India and Brazil as regional powers, cooperation and competition  among major nations will deepen and the international order will become more complex.  Also, middle powers, including the ROK, will play a bigger role in the international order.  **2. Ever-present Possibility of Local Conflicts**  Local conflicts are expected to continue around the world due to deeply rooted factors of  1 This is a suggestion made by China calling for respect for the core interests of the two countries based on mutual trust. It has as its  main ideas the prevention of clashes and confrontations, mutual respect, cooperation and co-prosperity.",page,10,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43319,"conflict surrounding territory, religion, race, etc. **Chart 1-1. Major Regions of Conflict**  In Europe, tensions are mounting between Russia and  the West (the United States and EU) in a geopolitical  conflict over Ukraine. The Ukrainian government **Syria**  decided not to conclude the trade agreement with the **Israel**  EU in November 2013, which brought large-scale  demonstrations against the government and resulted in **Somalia**  the resignation of the Yanukovych government in  February 2014. In March 2014, separatists pressed ahead  with a referendum on the secession of the Crimean  Peninsula, which was consequently annexed by Russia.  The annexation of Crimea by Russia triggered  **Ukraine**  **Syria**  **Iraq**  **Afghanistan** **Israel**  **Sudan**  **Somalia**  **South Sudan**  sanctions, notably by the United States and the EU, against Russia. Subsequent to the  Crimean Peninsula annexation, eastern parts of Ukraine joined the movement of secession,  leading to battles between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian rebels. The two  sides reached a cease-fire agreement in September 2014 in Minsk; however, the agreement  still harbors the seeds of instability as sporadic battles continue on.  Various conflicts and disputes continue in the Middle East. Three years after the U.S.  military declared the end of war and retreated from Iraq in 2011, the nation is suffering a  civil war that is growing more intense between government forces and the Islamic State of  Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), militant Islamic extremists. The Iraqi government formally asked  the United States to conduct air raids against the ISIL. The international community, with the  United States at the center, began to launch air raids on the ISIL in Iraq in August 2014. The  United States and some Middle East states expanded their range of raids on the ISIL to Syria  in September 2014. Efforts by the international community to avert bloodshed in the Syrian  civil war continue. The Syrian government agreed to abandon chemical weapons, which led  to the Geneva II Conference on Syria in January 2014 between the Syrian government and  the rebels (the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces). However,  the conference yielded no tangible results and reached an impasse. Amidst the stalled  Israeli–Palestinian peace talks, the “kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers” in  June and July of 2014 triggered armed conflicts in the Gaza Strip. Both sides agreed to a  cease-fire in August 2014 with active mediation efforts by the international community,  including the United States and Egypt. However, it appears that their disputes may be  rekindled.  In East Asia, territorial disputes over the South China Sea and the East China Sea have  surfaced as factors of security instability. The parties to the disputes dispatched naval vessels  and fighters into the disputed areas and conducted military exercises, causing tensions to",page,11,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43320,"escalate. The Philippines requested arbitration on the South China Sea from the International  Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in January 2014. In May, ASEAN[2] Foreign Ministers  expressed concern over the territorial disputes in the South China Sea and urged disputing  parties to refrain from aggressive actions.  In Afghanistan, the anti-terror war carried out by the NATO[3]-led International Security  Assistance Force (ISAF)[4] is in its final stage. NATO leaders gathered for the 2010 Lisbon  summit agreed to transfer the responsibility of maintaining public order to the Afghan  government no later than the end of 2014. The transfer has been in process since June 2013.  Since July 2010, the ROK government dispatched a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT)  and the Ashena Unit, whose mission was to protect the PRT, to Afghanistan to support  post-war reconstruction. The mission was successful, and all of the dispatched forces  returned in June 2014.  In Africa, disputes in various forms have instigated political and social instability. The  Jasmine Revolution that began in Tunisia in North Africa in December 2010 resulted in  regime changes in Egypt and Libya. Still, chaotic situations continue. In South Sudan, which  became independent in July 2011, conflicts among tribes have evolved into a civil war,  causing the international community to strengthen its efforts to put it to an end. The  Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)[5] began mediation in peace talks in  January 2014, and in May, the UN deployed an additional 5,000 troops to join the existing  7,000 to support public order. Ethnic conflicts in the Darfur region of Sudan are still  ongoing, and Abyei has become a disputed area with Sudan and South Sudan claiming their  governance over the area. In Somalia, instability persists as concerns over political chaos  remain following a lull in the civil war.  **3. Growing Security Uncertainty due to Proliferation of Transnational Threats**  Security threats have become more multifaceted and security uncertainty in the interna­  tional community has increased due to the proliferation of transnational threats.  Some nations, such as North Korea and Iran, have consistently developed nuclear weapons  and long-range ballistic missiles, posing threats to world peace and security. North Korea  2 Association of South-East Asian Nations  3 North Atlantic Treaty Organization  4 Multinational forces formed with a UN Security Council resolution toward the support of maintenance of public order and post-war  reconstruction in Afghanistan.  5 This is a regional cooperative body to pursue economic stability and development in East Africa and is composed of eight nations,  including Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda.",page,12,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

The UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2087[6] and Resolution 2094[7],  which prescribed high-intensity sanctions in response to North Korea’s missile launches and  its third nuclear test. Efforts by the international community to deter Iran’s nuclear  development are still in progress. The five permanent members of the UN Security Council  plus Germany (P5+1) and Iran agreed to the cessation of highly enriched uranium manufac­  turing in exchange for the partial lifting of economic sanctions in November 2013, and have  carried out follow-up negotiations since February 2014. The third Nuclear Security Summit  in The Hague, Netherlands in March 2014 allowed the leaders to discuss not only measures  to prevent the threat of nuclear terrorism, but also the prevention of illegal trade of nuclear  materials, protection of nuclear materials and related facilities, and nuclear safety.  For the past several years, the number of terrorist acts increased sharply in the Middle  East, North Africa, and Southwest Asia due to instabilities in those regions. The Country  Reports on Terrorism 2013 by the U.S. Department of State, released in April 2014, shows  that the number of terrorist attacks in 2013 reached about 9,700, a 43% increase over the  previous year. In particular, the need to strengthen the efforts of individual nations as well as  international cooperation in preparing against terrorism becomes greater considering that  terrorism combined with weapons of mass destruction (WMD) could pose a serious threat to  international security.  Joint measures among the international community are in higher demand as the  perpetrators of cyber-attacks have become organized and started targeting nations beyond  their previous targets such as individuals and enterprises, all of which has resulted in  heightened threats from cyber-attacks. The third Global Conference on Cyberspace was  convened in Seoul in October 2013 with participants from 87 nations and 18 international  institutions. The conference provided an opportunity for the participants to discuss ways to  collaborate among nations on cyber security, contributing to the enhancement of the interna­  tional cooperation system against cyber threats.  Securing sea lines of communication (SLOC) from pirates is also one of the important  pending security issues. The international community created the Contact Group on Piracy  6 The UN Security Council adopted this resolution in January 2013 immediately after the launch of a long-range missile by North Korea. It  expanded and strengthened the sanctions against North Korea, expressing the Council’s determination to take significant action in the event of a further provocation by North Korea.  7 The UN Security Council adopted this resolution in March 2013 immediately after North Korea’s third nuclear test. Its key points are the  banning of all new overseas activities by North Korean banks, cracking down on smuggling of bulk cash, and the full interdiction of transfer of goods that would contribute to weapons of mass destruction programs.",page,13,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43322,"off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS)[8] in order to strengthen counter-piracy cooperation among  nations. Presently, approximately 20 nations have dispatched naval vessels to Somali waters  and the Gulf of Aden. The ROK government also dispatched the Cheonghae Unit to Somali  waters in March 2009, contributing to securing safety in maritime transportation. According  to the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) under the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the number of piracy activities decreased to 264 in 2013 compared to 297 in 2012.  Large-scale natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis, together with infectious  diseases like the Ebola virus disease, have emerged as new security issues which warrant  joint effort from the international community. Typhoon Haiyan caused extensive damages to  the Philippines in November 2013. The international community sent rescue teams and aid  supplies to support recovery. The ROK government dispatched the Araw Contingent to the  Philippines to carry out reconstruction missions, including building restoration and medical  aid. West African nations such as Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have suffered massive  damages from the Ebola virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that more  than 19,000 people were infected as of December 2014, costing more than 7,500 lives. The  UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution to prevent the spread of the Ebola  virus in September 2014. The international community exerts various efforts by providing  not just medical personnel, medicine, and medical equipment, but also treatment facilities  and economic aid. The ROK government also sent medical personnel as part of humanitarian  assistance, thereby actively participating in the efforts of the international community.  **4. Various Threats against Security**  As interdependency among nations continues to grow as a result of globalization and  informatization, the possibility of cooperation among nations as well as the chances of  friction and conflicts also grow. The economy is at the forefront of such aspects. Imbalances  in economic development among different regions and nations have been aggravated. The  financial and fiscal crisis of one nation spills over to other nations and the international  community as a whole, magnifying the instability of the global economy. The instability of  the global economy combines with other problems such as poverty, exhaustion of resources,  terrorism, climate change, pollution and massive disasters, which affects the security of  individual nations.  8 Established to eliminate pirates in January 2009 by the U.S. Security Council Resolution 1851 and participated in by 60 nations,  including Somalia and other neighboring countries (Kenya, Yemen, Seychelles, Tanzania), major nations with interests (the ROK, U.S., China, Japan, UK, Russia, France), etc. Thirty international organizations and international maritime associations such as the UN, EU, International Maritime Organization and NATO are also participants.",page,14,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43323,"In the future, while traditional war still persists, various new forms of war will emerge as  technology develops and the possibility of small-scale war and local conflict increases.  Powerful states will conduct war in the form of information and technology warfare using  high-tech weapons to make long-range precision strikes and stealth attacks to keep casualties  to a minimum. Weak states and non-state actors will engage in war by utilizing combinations  of terrorism, asymmetric warfare, ideological war, and psychological war to overcome  relative gaps in military power. The future domains of war will include outer space and  cyberspace, with a mixture of kinetic warfare using military forces and non-kinetic warfare  such as cyber warfare.",page,15,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43324,"**Section 2 Security Environment of** **Northeast Asia**  In Northeast Asia the so-called “Asia’s Paradox” has been in place in which economic interdependency  grows without a commensurate level of advancement in security cooperation. Individual nations intend to  increase their influence and continue an arms race. With the United States presently maintaining military  superiority, China, Japan and Russia have strengthened their military power, focusing on naval and air  forces. The “Rebalance to the Asia-Pacific Region” strategy of the United States and the rise of China will  make their bilateral relations of cooperation and competition a key variable in the security order of North­  east Asia.  **1. Deepening Asia’s Paradox**  In Northeast Asia, the so-called “Asia’s Paradox” has continued, in which deepening  economic cooperation and interdependency is not met with a commensurate level of  advancement in security cooperation. Northeast Asia has emerged as the center of the global  economy. The second- and the third-largest economies in the world are located in this region,  and the size of the economies of the ROK, China and Japan combined represent approxi­  mately 23% of the global output. Economic cooperation expands as regional interdependency  deepens and discussion of local economic integration continues. On the other hand, due to  issues of conflicts such as historical perception, territorial rights, and North Korean nuclear  weapons and missiles, security uncertainties have intensified, but without a sufficient level  of security cooperation.  **2. Cooperation and Competition between the U.S. and China**  The direction of the U.S.-China relationship is expected to be the key variable in the  security order in Northeast Asia for a while. The rise of China and the “Rebalance to the  Asia-Pacific Region” strategy of the United States will make their strategic cooperation and  competition the most important factor in determining the stability of security in the region.  The United States and China will in general maintain strategic cooperative relations, sharing",page,16,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43325,"the goal of stability and peace in Northeast Asia. However, in the case that there are any  collisions of core national interests between them, conflicts could deepen.  As the dual relationship of strategic cooperation and competition between the United States  and China continues while Japan and Russia join the race toward increasing their national  interests and influence, instability and uncertainty are likely to intensify. Neighboring  countries increase their influence by bolstering military power, strengthening alliances and  cooperative relations, and taking the initiative in multilateral talks. As a result, an arms race  in the region is expected to grow further.  **3. Increasing Influence and Arms Race in the Region**   While the United States maintains its military superiority in Northeast Asia, China, Japan  and Russia have vied to build up their own military strengths, centering on naval and air  forces. In particular, competition among the nations in the region over outer space has grown  fierce.

43326,"**| The United States | The United States seeks a solution to carry out its “Rebalance to the**  Asia-Pacific Region” strategy successfully while reducing its defense budget. It has reduced  the size of its military, mainly the ground forces, while enhancing its long-distance power  projection ability, in the course of strengthening its military forces in the Asia-Pacific region  and cooperation with its alliances and partners. In March 2014, the United States released the  Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR)[1] reflecting the end of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  and the large-scale defense budget reduction. The Review presented defending the homeland,  building global security, power projection, and decisive victory as the core principles of its  national defense strategy.  In order to effectively respond to the Anti-Access and Area Denial (A2/AD)[2] strategy of  China, the United States has developed new concepts of operations, including the Air-Sea  Battle.[3] For that purpose, the United States has continued to build its naval and air force  strengths in the Asia-Pacific region.  The Army is reorganized in such a way as to conduct operations anywhere in the world  and remain prepared with high-level training and modernization. The number of regular  army service members will be reduced to 440,000-450,000 from 570,000, the maximum size  during wartime; however, special combat forces will be strengthened.  The Navy has consistently built on its strengths to satisfy its future strategic environment.  It plans to increase the number of vessels and deploy 60% of all naval vessels, including a  maximum of six aircraft carriers, to the Asia Pacific by 2020. Accordingly, the number of  vessels in the Asia Pacific will increase to 58 in 2015 and 67 in 2020 from 51 in 2014. The  Marine Corps will be reduced in size to 182,000 troops.  The Air Force is concentrating on securing next-generation fighters, aerial refueling  tankers, transport aircraft and long-range stealth bombers. In response to threats that are  becoming more sophisticated and precise, the Air Force is also focusing on the development  of avionics, weapon load, and tactics and training.  The United States will work toward strengthening security cooperation with its regional  alliances by 2023 and partners to carry out the “Rebalance to the Asia-Pacific Region”  strategy.

In Singapore, the United States plans to rotate up to  four littoral combat ships.  **| Japan | Japan established the National Security Council in December 2013 as the control**  tower for its diplomacy and security. It also set up the National Security Strategy in which it  presented Japan’s strategic guideline toward strengthening and expanding the nation’s role in  the international community and the concept of “proactive pacifism.”[4] In July 2014, the  Japanese government reinterpreted its constitution in such a way that Japan could exercise its  right of collective self-defense. In order to use the Self-Defense Forces against non-kinetic  infringements on disputed islands and contribute to international peacekeeping activities, it  took measures to expand the range of rear operations and use of arms. To extend the role of  the Self-Defense Forces, the Japanese government makes efforts to revise the Guidelines for  U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation.  In December 2013, Japan released the National Defense Program Guidelines[5] and the  Mid-Term Defense Program[6] and presented the concept of a “dynamic joint defense force.”  The dynamic joint defense force refers to a concept that is designed to respond to major  security threats: China’s military build-up and North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs.  Based on this concept, Japan intensifies its preparedness and military capabilities around the  islands in the southern part of the Japanese Archipelago. Japan strengthens not only the  U.S.-Japan alliance but also cooperation with the ROK, Australia and India.  The Ground Self-Defense Force has deployed the Coastal Surveillance Unit around the  Senkaku Islands (also known as the Diaoyu Islands) to monitor the area and is in the process  of creating the Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade to be in charge of amphibious  operations. It also plans to establish the Ground Central Command for a prompt and flexible  operation of divisions and brigades, the base unit of operations, and reorganize some  divisions and brigades into “maneuver divisions and brigades” for immediate response to  situations around the island areas.  The Maritime Self-Defense Force has set up a plan to strengthen its capabilities by 2023 by  increasing the number of frigates to 54, including an Izumo-class frigate of 19,500 tons, and   4 This is an initiative whereby Japan plans to proactively contribute to the maintenance and construction of regional and global peace.

Also,  improvements to existing frigates and transport ships are underway in order to command and  control amphibious operations and deploy and transport troops and supplies.  The Air Self-Defense Force newly established the Airborne Early Warning Group, an early  warning aircraft (E-2C) unit, in Okinawa in April 2014 to strengthen surveillance over the  island areas. To secure air superiority, it set up an additional F-15 fighter unit in Okinawa and  is about to field deploy new early warning aircraft, long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, new aerial refueling tankers and transport  aircraft, among others.  In an effort to prepare against cyber warfare, Japan established the Cyber Defense Unit  under the Ministry of Defense in March 2014, integrating the cyber warfare functions of the  Ground, Maritime and Air Self-Defense Forces. It also uses its Information Gathering  Satellites to detect signs of attack at an early stage as part of an effort to utilize outer space in  building a dynamic joint defense force. Such efforts contribute to comprehensive response  capabilities in connection with ballistic missile attacks. A special unit in charge of space  surveillance is also planned to be established to use outer space in a stable manner.  Japan has made efforts to extend the role of the Self-Defense Forces. In December 2013, it  dispatched the Maritime Self-Defense Force’s frigates to the CTF-151 combined maritime  forces off Somalia for the first time. Other operations include emergency support activities  such as support for the restoration of typhoon-stricken regions in the Philippines in  November 2013 and the dispatch of Japanese troops in the search efforts for the missing  Malaysian airplane in March 2014.  The Japanese government announced the “Three Principles on Transfer of Defense  Equipment and Technology,” which replaces the “Three Principles on Arms Export” in April  2014 to loosen restrictions on the export of weapons and military equipment. In order to  improve the performance of defense equipment and reduce costs, Japan has actively partic­  ipated in joint international development and production. It has also strengthened the level of  cooperation in the international defense industry in the name of contributing to global peace.  **| China | At the Third Plenum of the 18[th] Central Committee of the Communist Party of**  China in November 2013, China decided to set up the National Security Council to be the  control tower of China’s security policy, and launched the council in January 2014.  In its 2013 Defense White Paper, China made it clear that the goal and mission of its  defense policy is to defend its sovereignty, security and territories to guarantee the peaceful  development of the nation, and to maintain world peace and regional stability.

China’s defense spending has been the second-largest in the world next to the United States  since 2009. It has also modified its military system and organization while continuously  pursuing to eradicate corruption to establish discipline in the military.  To meet the strategic demands for maneuver operations and multi-dimensional attack and  defense, the Ground Force has developed army aviation units as well as mechanized and  special operation units. In the process, it has strengthened air-land integration, long-distance  maneuver and rapid response capabilities. In 2013, the Ground Force set up two additional  aviation regiments and two special warfare units. Also, division-class armored mechanized  units are now reorganized into regiment-class units.  The Navy is in pursuit of improving long-distance operation capabilities. In 2013, a total of  18 new surface combatants, including two destroyers, were commissioned. A new strategic  nuclear submarine (the Jin class, Type 094), equipped with JL-2 ballistic missiles with a  range of over 8,000 km, was added, raising the total number of strategic nuclear submarines  to four. The aircraft carrier Liaoning was deployed to the military port in Qingdao in  February 2013 and training is underway for field deployment. In May 2013, the Navy created  a carrier-based aircraft unit for the first time in its history and has systematically trained  pilots since then.  The Air Force develops advanced weapons, including new fighters, ground-to-air missiles,  and radar, in accordance with its strategy of “combined attack and defense.” It has continued  to develop stealth fighters since it successfully completed the test flight of the J-20 stealth  fighter in January 2011 and the first test flight of the lightweight J-31 stealth fighter in  October 2012. Also, air force modernization has been pursued continuously, including the  ongoing research and development of the Y-20 large military transport aircraft and the  integration of the new H-6K long-range strategic bomber into the force.  The 2[nd] Artillery Force controls nuclear and conventional ballistic missiles and focuses on  improving capabilities in relation to strategic threats, nuclear counter-attack and precision  strikes of conventional missiles. In December 2013, it test-launched the DF-41 strategic  missile and the JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missile.  As part of its efforts to become a space power, China successfully launched the Chang’e 3  probe and succeeded in landing the probe safely on the surface of the moon in December  2013.  7 This is a concept whereby naval and air force strengths are enhanced with advanced weapons to prepare against local wars in the field  of informatized warfare, which leads to victory in war and allows the achievement of the objective of national defense toward antiinvasion and unification.",page,21,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

In December 2013, it completed the second phase of  its defense reform, the “resolution of military welfare.” Since 2014, Russia has proceeded  with the Weapons System Acquisition Plan for the Russian Armed Forces 2020 that requires  a total of 758.5 billion U.S. dollars, with a focus on the creation of rapid reaction forces  against low-intensity conflicts and modernization of conventional military power while  maintaining a nuclear deterrence.  The Russian Ground Forces maintain a round-the-clock combat readiness posture by  simplifying its command system that fits the characteristics of modern warfare and  transforming its structure into a regiment-based standing army system. To project military  power promptly into disputed areas, it also works on the creation of rapid reaction forces  modeled after airborne troops. It also enhances high-tech forces such as next-generation  tanks (ARMATA, T-99), air defense missiles (BUK-M3) and ground-to-air missiles (TOR) in  order to prepare against local wars. As such, the Eastern Military District had modernized its  equipment and has been reorganized to enhance maneuverability.  The Navy has continuously strengthened its forces based on strong support from the  leadership. In 2013, it built two 19,400-ton Borei-class strategic nuclear submarines, one of  which was included into the Pacific Fleet. The Navy plans to additionally deploy one  strategic nuclear submarine and one French Mistral-class amphibious assault ship by 2014. In  order to operate the new Borei-class strategic nuclear submarine, which carries submarine launched ICBMs, the Navy is building a submarine base on the Kamchatka Peninsula.  The Air Force improves its precision strike and air defense capabilities. It plans to develop  fifth-generation stealth fighters (T-50, PAK-FA), with enhanced capabilities for long-range  operations and precision strikes, and uses them as the main fighters.

43332,"**Section 3 North Korean Situation and** **Military Threats**  North Korea has focused its energy on consolidating its monolithic rule and stabilizing its regime since Kim  Jong-un took over. It has constantly used provocation-dialogue tactics in order to take the initiative in  inter-Korean relations and escape from international sanctions and isolation. North Korea continues to  pose a serious threat to the ROK and the international community by developing WMD such as nuclear  weapons and ballistic missiles, reinforcing its conventional forces, conducting armed provocations in  enemy contact areas, and continuously carrying out provocations such as cyber-attacks and infiltration of  small UAVs.  **1. North Korean Situation**  **| Internal Situation | North Korea is a single-party dictatorship regime ruled by the**  Korean Workers’ Party (KWP), espousing a socialism based on its Juche ideology, Military  First ideology and so-called Kim Il-sung-Kim Jong-il-ism.[1]  After completing the power succession process in April 2012, the Kim Jong-un regime  focused on normalizing the weakened function of the KWP and strengthening its power by  changing the generations in the leadership ranks of the party, military and government. In  particular, Kim Jong-un publicly executed Jang Song-thaek, his uncle and political patron, in  December 2013 in an effort to solidify Kim’s monolithic rule. Also, Kim replaced Choe  Ryong-hae with Hwang Pyong-so in the position of the Director of the General Political  Bureau in April 2014. Such frequent reshuffling of leadership was done to consolidate the  direct ruling system centered on the new power elites.  In order to overcome chronic economic difficulties, North Korea began to pursue “new  economic management improvement measures”[2] immediately after the beginning of the Kim  Jong-un regime. The Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the KWP in March 2013  decided to adopt “a new strategic line on building nuclear armed forces and carrying out  1 This is a new ideology of leadership and governance of the Workers’ Party promulgated through the revision of the Regulations of the  Korean Workers’ Party on April 11, 2012.  2 This is a new economic policy pursued since 2012, of which the core policy is to expand the autonomy and incentives of individual  economic units, including cooperative farms and cooperative factories.",page,24,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43333,"economic construction simultaneously.” Nineteen Economic Development Zones were  designated in local provinces, and some of them are presently being developed. However, due  to the inherent limitations found in a socialist economic system, weak attraction of foreign  capital and lack of administrative capability, the outcome remains minimal.  Commercial transactions are growing, mostly around local market places called  “jangmadang.” Food production appears to be growing, with reserved rice being rationed out  to cover shortages, showing signs of improvement in its food situation. However, workers  below the middle class whose rations are limited still suffer food shortages.  In the areas bordering China, Chinese and other foreign commodities flow in actively and  interpersonal information exchanges take place through communication devices such as  mobile phones. Corruption and graft by government officials and the widening income gap  among the different classes create discontent among the people. Also, illegal activities and  aberrations such as drugs, prostitution and human trafficking are on the rise. In response to  such changes, North Korea has placed importance on internal control by stepping up  ideological education and surveillance by the public security agency and implementing  measures against defectors.  **| Policy Toward the South | North Korea aims to unify the Korean Peninsula under**  communism. To fulfill this goal, it has pursued provocation-dialogue tactics and a disguised  peace offensive which repeats a cycle of “provocation, dialogue, compensation, and another  provocation” in order to continuously develop nuclear weapons and missiles and secure  practical gains from the South under the objective of unifying the Korean Peninsula under  communism.  North Korea launched a long-range missile on December 12, 2012 and carried out its third  nuclear test on February 12, 2013. On March 5, it declared the Armistice Agreement invalid  in a statement issued by the spokesperson of the Supreme Command, and on March 8, it  declared it would scrap the Inter-Korean Non-Aggression Agreement in its entirety. Then on  March 30, North Korea issued a special statement in the name of its government, party and  groups announcing that the inter-Korean relationship had entered into a state of war. On  April 8, it issued a unilateral order that called for the withdrawal of the North Korean  workers in the Kaesong Industrial Complex, putting a halt to its operation that had lasted for  a decade.  Faced with the ROK government’s principle-based response toward North Korean  provocations and threats and pressure from the international community, North Korea  shifted to a dialogue mode with a visit by Choe Ryong-hae, the Director of the General  Political Bureau, to China in May 2013. The South and North agreed to reopen the Kaesong  Industrial Complex after seven meetings, beginning with a working-level meeting between",page,25,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43334,"the respective authorities on July 6, 2013. On August 23, the two Koreas agreed on the  reunion of separated families at a working-level contact; however, the reunion was unilat­  erally cancelled by North Korea on September 21, just four days prior to the scheduled date.  In 2014, North Korea conducted proactive  peace offensives, as Kim Jong-un suggested  the shaping of an environment for the  improvement of inter-Korean relations in his  New Year’s speech and North Korea’s National  Defense Com m ission a n nou nced its  “significant proposal.”[3] On February 5, a  South-North Red Cross working-level meeting  UAV found in Samcheok (April 2014)  reached an agreement on the reunion of  separated families once again, resulting in the first reunion in three years from February 20  to 25 at Mt. Kumkang. Even during the reunion period, North Korea repeatedly launched  rockets and ballistic missiles. In March and April 2014, small UAVs were found in such  places as Paju in Gyeonggi-do, Baengnyeongdo Island, and Samcheok in Gangwon-do.  North Korea conducted massive maritime firing near the Northern Limit Line (NLL)[4] of the  West Sea on March 31 and April 29, followed by artillery fire against an ROK naval vessel  on May 22. In particular, North Korea elevated tensions between the two Koreas by stepping  up the level of crude criticism against the presidents and governments of the ROK and the  United States after the declaration of the “Initiative for Peaceful Unification on the Korean  Peninsula[5]” by President Park Geun-hye in March and a state visit by U.S. President Barack  Obama in April.  On May 23, North Korea announced its plan  to participate in the Incheon Asian Games, and  on June 30, it resumed its peace offensives to  the South by making the National Defense  Commission’s “special proposal” in which it  restated the content of the National Defense  Commission’s significant proposal.

In particular, North Korea further elevated tensions by  carrying out surprise launches of a number of MRLs into the waters near the NLL in the  East Sea, and such launches were carried out from the region near the Military Demarcation  Line (MDL) adjacent to the East Sea that could be observed from the South.  On July 17, North Korea began to proceed with working-level meetings with South Korea  over the issue of sending athletes and a cheering squad to the Incheon Asian Games.  However, North Korea broke off the meetings with the excuse of South Korea’s policy of  accepting North Korean athletes in compliance with international practice and the  regulations of the Games. As it became difficult for North Korea to send a cheering squad  due to internal problems, it unilaterally notified the South on August 29 that it would cancel  its plan to send a cheering squad and stepped up the level of criticism toward South Korea  while blaming the South for the situation. Meanwhile, North Korea sought to turn the  situation around with an agreement to resume the second round of senior-level inter-Korean  talks when Hwang Pyong-so, the Director of the General Political Bureau, and Choe  Ryong-hae and Kim Yang-gon, the Secretaries of the KWP, made a surprise visit to the South  on the day of the closing ceremony of the Incheon Asian Games. However, just three days  after such agreement, a naval skirmish broke out near the NLL on October 7, and on October  10, North Korean soldiers fired at balloons released by ROK civil organizations. Using such  incidents as an excuse, North Korea proposed “exclusive emergency talks” to the ROK  government, and on October 15, a “senior-level inter-Korean military talk” took place, but  ended without any results. The frosty inter-Korean relationship remains strained.  Even after Kim Jong-un’s rise to power, North Korea has not shown any sincerity about  building mutual trust and improving the inter-Korean relationship, as it continues to foster  division in the ROK-U.S. Alliance and develop nuclear weapons and missiles as well as  conduct military threats with the objective of unifying the Korean Peninsula under  communism.  **| Foreign Policy | North Korea uses a dual policy in which it focuses on developing**  WMD, including nuclear weapons, while seeking to improve its relations with the interna­  tional community to escape from isolation.  The UN stepped up its sanctions against North Korea by adopting Resolutions 2087 and  2094 to respond to North Korea’s long-range missile launch on December 12, 2012 and its  third nuclear test conducted on February 12, 2013. Despite such measures, North Korea  continues to develop nuclear weapons and missiles, threatening the international community.  Since North Korea scrapped the “February 29 Agreement between the United States and",page,27,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43336,"North Korea”[6] by launching long-range missiles in April 2012, official dialogue between the  two has stopped. Seeking to be a nuclear power, North Korea openly declared its plan for a  fourth nuclear test and reactivated nuclear facilities in Yongbyon, posing a continuous threat  to the international community. At the same time, North Korea suggested resuming the  Six-Party Talks without conditions, and on June 16, 2013, through a significant statement by  a spokesperson for the National Defense Commission, it proposed to hold senior-level  bilateral talks with the United States. On December 18, 2014, the UN General Assembly  characterized North Korea’s human rights abuse as a crime against humanity and adopted the  “Resolution on North Korean Human Rights”[7] referring to taking the case to the Interna­  tional Criminal Court (ICC) to hold North Korea accountable. North Korea rejected the  resolution in its entirety and denounced the international community, including the ROK and  U.S. governments.  As North Korea launched long-range missiles and conducted its third nuclear test despite  China’s opposition, China has joined part of the sanctions against North Korea. In an effort to  recover its strained relationship with China and seek political and economic support, North  Korea sent Choe Ryong-hae as a special envoy to China in May 2013. Choe’s visit to China  brought Li Yuanchao, the Vice President of China, in return, showing signs of a restoration  of bilateral relations. However, their relationship became estranged again due to North  Korea’s unwillingness to give up its nuclear program and threats of its fourth nuclear test.  When Xi Jinping, the President of China, visited South Korea before North Korea on July 3,  2014, North Korea expressed its discontent through an indirect criticism toward China.  In the meantime, as isolation from the international community deepens due to China  joining in on the sanctions, North Korea has attempted to reduce its political and economic  reliance on China and strengthen its cooperative relationship, centering on economy, with  Russia. In November 2014, Choe Ryong-hae was sent to Russia as a special envoy to find  ways to promote North Korea’s bilateral relations with Russia in various sectors, including  politics, economy and military.  In addition, North Korea continues its contacts with Japan over issues such as Japanese  abductees and the repatriation of Japanese remains in North Korea. North Korea sought to  improve its relations with Japan by agreeing on May 29, 2014, to reinvestigate the Japanese  abductees issue on the condition that Japan lifts its sanctions against North Korea. However,  6 An agreement reached at the third U.S-North Korea High-level Talks held in Beijing from February 23 to 24, 2012. Under the agreement,  North Korea would take preliminary steps toward denuclearization and declare a moratorium on its nuclear and missile programs, cease its operation of nuclear facilities in Yongbyon, and permit IAEA investigators to return to North Korea. The United States agreed in return to provide nutrients amounting to 240,000 tons to North Korea.  7 The resolution was passed with 116 approvals, 20 dissents and 53 abstentions.

43337,"due to North Korea’s tepid response toward Japan’s demand for a fundamental solution to the  kidnapping issue, the prospects for the negotiations are unclear.  North Korea has increased its trade and cooperation with outer-regional countries such as  Syria and Cuba by increasing arms transactions and military exchanges.  **2. Military Strategy and Military Command Structure**   **| Military Strategy | While placing its top priority on the survival of its regime, North**  Korea seeks to achieve the fundamental objective of unifying the Korean Peninsula under  communism. To achieve this objective, North Korea maintains a military strategy based on  ideological war, surprise attacks, hybrid warfare and lightning warfare while seeking various  tactics. In particular, after taking over the regime, Kim Jong-un has strengthened the  readiness posture for not only local provocations, but also aggression.  In particular, in order to secure military superiority over the South, North Korea focuses  on reinforcing asymmetric forces such as WMD, including nuclear weapons, missiles,  long-range artillery, an underwater force, special operation forces, and cyber warfare units.  North Korea currently operates about 6,000 cyber warfare troops and conducts cyber  warfare, including the interruption of military operations and attacks against major national  infrastructure, to cause psychological and physical paralysis in the South. The performance  of their conventional weapons is also continuously upgraded.  **| Military Command Structure | Kim Jong-un exerts command and control over the**  North Korean military organization as the de facto head through his capacity as the Supreme  Commander of the Korean People’s Army, First Chairman of the National Defense  Commission and Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the KWP.  The National Defense Commission is the supreme entity on military guidance under the  Socialist Constitution of North Korea. The role of the Commission is to establish the major  policies of the regime and guide its defense policies, including building military strength.  Under its leadership, there are the General Political Bureau, General Staff Department and  Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces. The General Political Bureau oversees the military’s  party organization and political ideologies, while the General Staff Department exercises  command over military operations. The Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces represents  North Korea’s armed forces to the outside world and exercises administrative control over the  military, including diplomacy, logistics and finances.  The Party Central Military Commission “discusses and decides on measures to attain the  Party’s military line and policy” in compliance with the Regulations of the Korean Workers’",page,29,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

With 70% of the Ground Force positioned south of the Pyongyang-Wonsan line, North  Korea is maintaining a military posture capable of conducting a surprise attack at any time.  In particular, the 170 mm self-propelled guns and 240 mm MRLs in forward positions are  capable of surprise, massive concentrated fire on the Greater Seoul Metropolitan Area (GSMA). The 300 mm MRL currently under test development by North Korea is able to  reach the middle part of the ROK considering its maximum firing range. North Korea  reinforced its artillery forces, including 122 mm towed MRLs, in the coastal area north of  the NLL of the West Sea and frontline areas, while setting up covered trenches to enhance  survivability, and has forward deployed its mechanized units and amphibious and air combat  forces, all of which contribute to strengthening its capabilities to commit provocations and  attacks against the five islands in the West Sea and borders at any time. Equipment modern­  ization is also constantly pursued, such as replacing the existing T-54 and T-55, the main  tanks of the armored and mechanized units, with the Chonma-ho and Songun-ho tanks. In  addition, armored and mechanized forces are also being reinforced and redeployed, greatly",page,30,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43339,"strengthening their maneuver and strike capabilities and enhancing flexibility in operations.  Special operation forces are currently estimated at 200,000 strong. The special operation  forces have a diverse array of strategic, operational, and tactical units, including the 11[th]  Corps, the light infantry division of the forward corps, and light regiment of the forward  divisions. The role of these special operation forces is extended to cover infiltration into the  forward and rear areas to strike major units and facilities, assassinations of key personnel,  disruption of rear areas and hybrid operations. Infiltration is to be made during a war  through underground tunnels, holding areas for infiltration in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), submarines, Landing Craft Air Cushions (LCACs), AN-2 aircraft, helicopters and  various other methods. The key assets of the North Korean Ground Force are shown in Chart  1-4.  **Chart 1-4.

Of the North Korean Navy, 60% is forward deployed to the south of the Pyongyang Wonsan line, allowing it to maintain surprise attack capability. However, the geographic  separation of the Eastern and Western Fleets makes flexible operations difficult for the North  Korean Navy, while its composition of small, high-speed vessels further limits deep sea  operations.  Surface forces are mainly composed of small, high-speed vessels such as guided missile  boats, torpedo boats, patrol boats, and fire support patrol craft that will carry out missions  supporting Ground Force advancement in connection with ground operations, as well as  coastal defense missions. In particular, North Korea has built new mid- and large-size vessels  and various kinds of Very Slender Vessels (VSVs), enhancing its strike capability on the  surface of the sea.  Underwater forces are composed of about 70 Romeo-class submarines and submersibles.  The mission of these underwater forces is to disrupt sea lanes of communication, lay mines,  attack surface vessels, and support the infiltration of special operation forces. In particular,  North Korea is improving its capability for underwater attacks, as it appears to be building",page,31,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

Amphibious forces are composed of about 260 vessels, including LCACs and high-speed  landing craft. Their mission is to infiltrate special operation forces into rear areas to strike  major military and strategic facilities and secure crucial spots in coastal areas for landing.

Under the command there are four flight divisions, two tactical  transport brigades, two air force sniper brigades and air defense units.  The North Korean Air Force has positioned its forces in four different zones. Most North  Korean Air Force aircraft are outdated models. About 40% of the 820 combat aircraft are  forward deployed south of the Pyongyang-Wonsan line.  The Air Force is capable of launching surprise attacks against the ROK’s control and  command facilities, air defense assets and industrial facilities without further deployment or  adjustment of aircraft. AN-2 aircraft and helicopters can transport large-scale special  operation forces for infiltration. The Air Force has recently produced and deployed UAVs for  reconnaissance and strikes.  North Korea’s air defense system centers on the Air and Anti-Air Command, and it is  organized in an integrated manner by aircraft, ground-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft artillery  and radar air defense units. The primary air defense responsibility is delegated to the  respective air divisions that are in charge of each of the four divided zones of North Korea’s  airspace. SA-2 and SA-5 ground-to-air missiles are deployed in forward areas and east and  the west coastal areas, while SA-2 and SA-3 ground-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft  artilleries are concentrated around the Pyongyang area, forming a multilayer air defense  network.  In addition, ground controlled intercept bases, early warning bases and many other radar  air defense units are spread out across North Korea, allowing them to scan throughout the  Korean Peninsula.

It is  expected that their effort toward increasing asymmetric forces will continue in the future.   **| Reserve Forces | The reserve forces in North Korea are composed of the Reserve**  Military Training Unit, which is a subject of combat mobilization, the Worker-Peasant Red  Army established by workplace and region, the Red Youth Guard, which is a military organi­  zation in middle schools (advanced classes), and paramilitary units. The age eligibility of  mobilization is between 14 and 60 years old, which corresponds to 7.7 million people or  roughly 30% of the population.  The Reserve Military Training Unit consists of about 600,000 members who can play a key  role in augmenting the combat capability to the regular armed forces during a contingency.  The unit maintains a level of training that is commensurate with the regular armed forces.  The status of the reserve forces in North Korea is as shown in Chart 1-7.  **Chart 1-7.

North Korea secured nuclear materials obtained from the reprocessing spent fuel rods  after operating a 5 MWe reactor located in the Yongbyon nuclear facility in the 1980s. Then,  in October 2006, May 2009 and February 2013, North Korea conducted three nuclear tests. It  is estimated that North Korea possesses about 40 kg of plutonium that can be used to  produce nuclear weapons after several rounds of reprocessing spent fuel rods, and it is also  assessed that a highly enriched uranium (HEU) program is underway. North Korea’s ability  to miniaturize nuclear weapons also seems to have reached a considerable level.  Since beginning the development of ballistic missiles in the 1970s, North Korea produced  and fielded SCUD-B (range of 300 km) and SCUD-C (range of 500 km) missiles in the  mid-1980s. In the 1990s, North Korea tested and fielded the Nodong missile (range of 1,300  km), while in 2007, it fielded the Musudan missile (range of over 3,000 km). Following these  deployments, North Korea has gained direct strike capabilities against South Korea, Japan,  Guam, and other surrounding countries.  North Korea test-launched a Taepodong-1  missile in 1998 and Taepodong-2 in 2006. It is  estimated that North Korea has the ability to  threaten the continental United States with its  missiles as shown with five launches of  long-range missiles, including the ones in 2009  and in April and December 2012. The ranges  of North Korea’s missiles by type are shown in The new KN-08 missile made public in a military parade marking  Chart 1-8. the 60[th] anniversary of the Armistice Agreement (July 2013)  North Korea began producing chemical  weapons in the 1980s and it is estimated that it has about 2,500 to 5,000 tons in stock.

43346,"**Section 1 National Security Strategy**  The National Security Strategy is a national action plan covering the comprehensive and systematic use of  available resources and means to ensure national security. The National Vision of the Park Geun-hye  administration is to open a “New Era of Hope” in which the happiness of the people and national develop­  ment are put in a virtuous circle. To achieve the vision in the field of national security, the administration  has established the National Security Strategy. The Ministry of National Defense (MND) is concentrating  its efforts on attaining the National Security Strategy by proactively responding to ever-changing security  environments and supporting national policies by maintaining a solid security posture.  **1. National Vision and the National Security Objectives**  The National Vision of the ROK government is a “New Era of Hope” in which the  happiness of each individual becomes the bedrock of the development of the nation. This era  of hope is pursued in tandem with national development in a virtuous cycle. To realize this  vision, the government has established four principles of the administration: economic  revival, the happiness of the people, cultural enrichment and the establishment of a  foundation for peaceful unification. The establishment of a foundation for peaceful  unification is a priority that embraces the entire domain of security including national  defense, unification and diplomacy. To this end, the government has specified the National  Security Objectives: “safeguarding the territory and sovereignty of the ROK and ensuring the  safety of the people,” “establishing sustainable peace on the Korean Peninsula and preparing  for an era of unification,” and “promoting cooperation in Northeast Asia and contributing to  world peace and development.”  First, the government will concentrate its efforts on protecting the nation’s territory and  National Security Strategy e-book",page,38,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43347,"sovereignty and people’s lives and properties from multifaceted and complex threats such as  armed provocations by North Korea as well as current and future threats and transnational  threats.  Second, the government seeks to realize sustainable peace on the Korean Peninsula and  prepare for the era of unification by building trust between the two Koreas. Above all, the  government will make the utmost efforts to closely cooperate with neighboring countries and  the international community to induce North Korea to abandon its nuclear program and take  the right path. The ROK is, furthermore, committed to achieving the normalization and  stable development of inter-Korean relations and aims to bring unification to the Korean  Peninsula by building its determination, support and readiness for unification, from inside  and outside the ROK.  Third, the ROK government seeks to bolster national security by promoting cooperation in  Northeast Asia and contributing to world peace and development. The ROK first seeks to  build trust among the nations of the Northeast Asian region through dialogue and  cooperation, and transform the dynamics of conflict into a framework for cooperation. By  extending the energies of coexistence and reconciliation accumulated in Northeast Asia, the  government will induce cooperation with Eurasian nations and advance toward peace,  stability and shared prosperity in the wider region that encompasses Asia and Europe.  **2. Tenets of the National Security Strategy**   In order to achieve its National Security Objectives, the ROK government has set the tenets  of the National Security Strategy: “establishing a solid security posture,” “pursuing the  trust-building process on the Korean Peninsula,” and “promoting trust-based diplomacy.”  These are implementation strategies for defense, unification and diplomacy to establish a  foundation for peaceful unification.  First, strong national security is the basis for the very existence of the nation, improved  inter-Korean relations, and lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula. The ROK government  will also further strengthen a thorough response posture to deter provocations by North  Korea and sternly retaliate in response to any provocation by North Korea. The government  will also be equipped with the capability to effectively respond to North Korean nuclear  capabilities and missile threats. Any transnational threats such as terrorism, cyber-attacks,  and massive disasters, as well as current and future threats, will be responded to proactively  and preemptively. In order to enhance security capabilities, the government will expand  security cooperation by strengthening bilateral and multilateral cooperation through the  development of the ROK-U.S. Alliance and strategic cooperation with neighboring countries.",page,39,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43348,"Second, the trust-building process on the Korean Peninsula is a way to actively foster  peace. On a basis of trust, the ROK government will seek to encourage North Korea to  change, promote the normalization and development of inter-Korean relations, and achieve  lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula. The government will seek to lay the groundwork for  the gradual development of inter-Korean relations and peaceful unification by building trust  incrementally. This will be a balanced approach to ensure that national security is not  neglected on account of inter-Korean relations. The government will seek to implement  policies regarding North Korea and unification together with the people on a basis of public  consensus and support. And the government will strengthen cooperation with the interna­  tional community to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, establish peace on the Korean  Peninsula, and create an environment conducive to unification. The government aims to take  the strengths of the policies of previous administrations and build on them in a fitting way. In  the meantime, it seeks to resolve conflicts in society and forge consensus amongst the public  on issues related to North Korea and unification.  Third, the ROK government seeks to make full use of trust-based diplomacy to resolve the  so-called “Asia’s Paradox” in which the level of political and security cooperation lags far  behind the deepening economic interdependency. The Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation  Initiative (NAPCI) is a key policy for the realization of trust-based diplomacy in Northeast  Asia. Through this initiative, the ROK government seeks to establish a practice of  multilateral cooperation in the region starting with softer issues on which countries can  easily engage in cooperation, such as climate change, terrorism, drug trafficking and the  environment, and broaden the scope of cooperation to include more controversial issues. The  government will seek to build greater consensus on the need for North Korea to change, and  further strengthen cooperation with the international community to induce North Korea to  renounce nuclear development and promote human rights. In the process, the government  will explain to various countries about the legitimacy and necessity of unification to build  consensus and further consolidate support from the international community for unification.  As a middle power, the government will also strive to earn greater trust in the international  community by fully assuming its responsibilities and role in the international arena, and seek  to promote an attractive image of the nation.",page,40,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43349,"**Section 2 National Defense Policy**  The MND has set “Advanced Elite Military” as its vision in order to realize the National Security Objectives  and National Defense Objectives in rapidly changing security environments, outlining seven key Tenets of  the National Defense Policy towards its attainment. Furthermore, the MND has set “Defense with a Robust  Foundation, Defense Preparing for the Future” as the defense management objectives. To this end, the  MND has specified four priorities in defense management: “building a full-spectrum national defense  posture,” “strengthening future-oriented defense capability,” “developing the ROK-U.S. Alliance and  strengthening external defense cooperation,” and “creating a happy and advanced defense environment.”   **1. National Defense Objectives**  The National Defense Objectives are: “protecting the country from external military  threats and invasions,” “supporting peaceful unification,” and “contributing to regional  stability and world peace.” The specific interpretation of the objectives is as follows:  First, “protecting the country from external military threats and invasions” means being  prepared to meet the present military threats from North Korea and at the same time being  prepared to meet other potential threats to our peace and security. North Korea poses a  serious threat to our security by developing and increasing its large-scale conventional  arsenal, nuclear program, missiles and other weapons of mass destruction, and by continually  perpetrating acts of armed provocation such as the attack on the ROK Ship Cheonan and the  shelling of Yeonpyeongdo Island. As long as these threats persist, the North Korean regime  and its armed forces, which are the entities who pose these threats, will remain as our  enemies.  Second, “supporting peaceful unification” means contributing to a peaceful unification by  deterring war, alleviating military tensions, and establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula.  Third, “contributing to regional stability and world peace” means contributing to the  stability of Northeast Asia and world peace by advancing our friendly and cooperative  relationships with neighboring countries on the basis of the ROK-U.S. Alliance, and through  active participation in international peacekeeping operations.",page,41,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43350,"**2. National Defense Vision and Tenets of the National Defense Policy**  **| National Defense Vision | The ROK military has to build the capability and posture to**  achieve the National Vision, National Security Objectives, and National Defense Objectives  by responding effectively to various security threats amidst changing security environments.  In that regard, the MND has adopted “Advanced Elite Military” as its mid- to long-term  National Defense Vision. The term “advanced” refers to a military for the people in which all  troops have upright values and mindsets; a military culture trusted by the people is in place;  and a creative and effective defense operations system with excellent defense capabilities has  taken root, making it an exemplary model in the world. The term “elite” refers to a military  in which strong and brave troops are armed with the most optimal weapons and equipment;  trained as we fight; and ready to exert the best, unified combat power. The combined term  “advanced elite military” means a military that is elite, advanced and has the posture and  capability to fight against the enemy and win.  **| Tenets of the National Defense Policy | The ROK military has identified and is**  pursuing the following seven key Tenets of the National Defense Policy as its consistent  policy direction toward achieving the National Defense Vision: (1) Establishing a robust  defense posture; (2) Strengthening future-oriented self-defense capability; (3) Developing the  ROK-U.S. military alliance and reinforcing defense diplomacy and cooperation; (4)  Providing military measures and readiness in accordance with the changing inter-Korean  relationship; (5) Bolstering innovative defense management and promoting defense industry;  (6) Creating a proud and rewarding environment for military service; and (7) Implementing  defense policies focusing on respect for the people. To accomplish such tenets, the ROK  military will actively move ahead with “Creative Defense,” a new paradigm in which defense  strength is generated by incorporating creativeness, science and technology into national  defense management.

Four Priorities in Defense Management**  The ROK military has set “Defense with a Robust Foundation, Defense Preparing for the  Future” as the goal of defense management, in consideration of its National Defense Vision,  Tenets of the National Defense Policy, and security environments, among others. “Defense  with a Robust Foundation” refers to the concept of making all troops serve in the military  safely and happily with tightened discipline; creating an environment for national defense  where the troops can focus on their combat missions; and building a full-spectrum national  defense posture to fight off enemies through realistic education and training as well as  thorough combat preparation.  “Defense Preparing for the Future” refers to fostering an “advanced elite military” that can  contribute greatly to regional stability and world peace by shaping a favorable strategic  environment and building new defense capabilities whereby the ROK military can take the  initiative in defending and unifying the Korean Peninsula. To achieve such a goal, the ROK",page,43,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43352,"military has specified and is actively pursuing four priorities in defense management, which  are: “building a full-spectrum national defense posture,” “strengthening future-oriented  defense capability,” “developing the ROK-U.S. Alliance and strengthening external defense  cooperation,” and “creating a happy and advanced defense environment.”  **| Building a Full-spectrum National Defense Posture | Based on the ROK-U.S.**  Combined Defense System, the ROK military will effectively deter any local provocation  and aggression and retaliate decisively against any provocations, shattering the will to  conduct another provocation. In particular, the ROK military has strengthened deterrence  and response capabilities by developing the Tailored Deterrence Strategy (TDS)—a joint  strategy between the ROK and the United States—in the face of WMD threats from North  Korea, including nuclear weapons and missiles. The establishment of the “Kill Chain” and  the Korea Air and Missile Defense (KAMD) is also in progress to enhance response  capabilities in the early phase of war.  The ROK military will strengthen response capabilities in the face of potential threats and  will proactively and preemptively respond to any transnational and non-military threats. The  ROK military is concentrating its efforts to create a combat mission-oriented military  capable of achieving victory against the enemy. To achieve this goal, it has streamlined the  missions of field units and is pursuing the completeness of its combat capability.  Furthermore, the military is reinforcing mental strength so that our service members can  cultivate the traits of a warrior, patriotism, a clear idea on who our enemy is, a sound  personality and civic consciousness.  **| Strengthening Future-oriented Defense Capability | Based on the solid ROK-U.S.**  Combined Defense System, the ROK military is strengthening, among others, its defense  capability to secure the deterrence and response capabilities sufficient to shatter North  Korea’s will to provoke, and to proactively respond to any potential, transnational and  non-military threats. In addition, the ROK military has been implementing an effective  defense reform, aiming to develop the force structure into an elite one and to build a highly  efficient and advanced defense management system.  The ROK military will develop the Agency for Defense Development (ADD) into a  world-class defense research and development institute while pursuing active civilian military technology cooperation, such as transferring defense technology to the private  sector. Furthermore, it plans to train elite officers by fostering creative and leading figures  capable of “mission-oriented leadership,” and reinforcing a recruiting system for outstanding  human resources.",page,44,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43353,"**| Developing the ROK-U.S. Alliance and Strengthening External Defense Cooperation |**  Both the ROK and the United States are building a full-spectrum combined defense system  with stability and peace on the Korean Peninsula as the priority goal in an effort to be  prepared against the threats of various provocations from North Korea. The two nations have  effectively deterred North Korean nuclear and missile threats through the ROK-U.S. TDS.  They will also pursue a more stable wartime operational control (OPCON) transition, taking  into account the ROK military’s readiness to take the lead in the combined defense system as  well as the security environment. The ROK and the United States have made continued  efforts to strengthen the military alliance and have expanded the level and scope of  cooperation to resolve regional and global security issues, moving toward building a compre­  hensive strategic alliance.  Based on the ROK-U.S. Alliance, the ROK military will strengthen bilateral and  multilateral defense exchanges and cooperation with neighboring countries to deter  provocations from North Korea and stably manage regional uncertainties. It will also  improve strategic communications with neighboring countries by installing hotlines between  defense and military authorities and holding frequent senior-level strategic dialogues. The  ROK military will engage in international peacekeeping operations more actively in order to  contribute to global peace and stability.  **| Creating a Happy and Advanced Defense Environment | The ROK military is**  establishing an “open barracks culture” in which human rights are respected, discipline is  well maintained, and the military is trusted by the people. It is also creating an environment  in which service members can perform their military service in a productive manner through  personal development. Welfare for service members will be considerably improved to the  extent that service members’ cultural needs are met beyond mere daily convenience.  In an effort to improve the military’s medical support system, the ROK military will  improve barracks conditions which focus on the prevention of diseases and adjust the  functions of military hospitals to be more professional and specialized. The Armed Forces  Trauma Center will be established for the treatment of serious cases in need of intensive care  such as bullet wounds, burns, multiple fractures and so forth.  The ROK military is also planning to provide high-quality, tailored child care services in  consideration of the unique characteristics of military service, as part of the effort to  reinforce welfare programs for the families of service members. A legal and systemic  groundwork will follow to safeguard the motherhood of female service members.  There will be an increase in support for retired service members to guarantee their living  standards after retirement. Such arrangements will motivate incumbent members to focus on  their combat missions with pride and a sense of reward.",page,45,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

The ROK and the United States continue to develop the joint crisis management system by  revising the Crisis Action Standard Operating Procedures (CASOP), strengthening joint  crisis management exercises and improving interoperability in command, control, communi­  cations, computers, and intelligence (C4I).  **| Maintaining a Readiness Posture against Infiltration and Local Provocations | Since**  its third nuclear test in February 2013, North Korea has continuously heightened tension on  the Korean Peninsula by repeating rhetorical threats to turn Seoul and Washington into a  “sea of fire,” penetrating the Northern Limit Line (NLL) of the West Sea under the pretext of  patrolling fishing operations, and conducting military provocations by firing coastal artillery  shells into the waters near the NLL in the Northwest Islands area. Furthermore, North Korea  used small UAVs to illegally infiltrate into ROK territory and continued to launch multiple  rockets and missiles despite the condemnation of the international community. Recently,  North Korea fired at balloons carrying leaflets released by ROK civil organizations, and the  threat of electronic warfare and cyber threats such as GPS jamming and information system  attack are also present.  The ROK military has fully prepared immediate response forces considering North Korea’s  provocation trend and the changes in its force deployment and establishes a posture that is  capable of promptly, accurately and sufficiently responding to provocations with joint and  combined forces on site.  While developing operational plans against  fire provocations and surprise occupation of  the Northwest Islands by North Korea, the  ROK military is improving its detailed  response measures by analyzing North Korea’s  strengthened forces such as 240 mm multiple  rocket launchers (MRLs) and fire support  patrol crafts, and recent provocation  Minister of National Defense Han Min-koo inspecting the  indicators.

In order to strengthen the alert posture in the enemy contact areas, fences and surveillance  equipment are upgraded, and an advanced security system[14] is being established. The  military operates its surveillance and reconnaissance assets in an integrated manner and  tracks and manages targets. In addition, it is developing a response plan that can promptly  and accurately strike target areas and objects.  In response to the threat posed by small North Korean UAVs, the ROK military has further  reinforced its readiness posture by strengthening security and air surveillance, as well as  maintaining a robust Army aviation strike posture. In addition, the air defense operation  system is refined by adjusting detection and identification means and strengthening  education and training.  In the Greater Seoul Metropolitan Area (GSMA) and the rear area, the military is  improving its response plans by taking into account potential provocation threats such as  terror attacks on key national infrastructure and cyber-attacks. Since 2013, the Army Special  Warfare Command and the Marine Corps have been designated and operated as “Quick  Reaction Forces” in preparation against various terror attacks, and they regularly carry out  operational and training activities to prepare against attacks against national infrastructure  and security targets.  Also, a thorough readiness posture is maintained to resolutely safeguard the ROK territory,  territorial waters and airspace in the East, West and South Seas, including the five northwest  islands as well as Marado, Ulleungdo and Dokdo Islands.

By seizing the initiative in the  early phase of a war through the execution of effect-based simultaneous and integrated  operations, the ROK military shall paralyze North Korea’s warfighting capability and will,  and achieve a decisive victory in a short time. To enable such, the ROK military develops  doctrines that maximize combined operation[15] and joint operation[16] execution capabilities,  and implements realistic joint and combined exercise and training. Furthermore, by  maintaining a close coordination system between the ROK and the United States, the ROK  military has established a combined defense system in preparation against a potential  aggression by North Korea.  The ROK military will continue to maintain and reinforce a combined defense posture  capable of strongly responding to North Korean aggression provocations based on the robust  ROK-U.S. Alliance.  **| Establishing a Rapid Response Mobilization Posture | In order to actively respond to**  various changes such as downscaling of standing forces due to the reduction of military  resources, the ROK military builds up strong reserve forces to possess forces able to deter  war and strengthen war sustainment capability. To this end, the ROK military develops a  range of measures enabling the efficient mobilization of human and material resources  during wartime or national emergencies.  First, the mobilization system is improved to enable immediate combat upon mobilization.  There is a plan to amend the United Defense Act to enable the selective mobilization of  necessary resources while minimizing the impact on the public and national economy during  integrated defense situations such as local provocations, disasters or terrorist attacks. Mobili­  zation supplement battalions are organized under the homeland divisions and the Marine  Corps HQ with a full set of elements comprising troops, equipment and supplies to enable  timely reinforcement in case of massive losses in forward areas during wartime. To enable  mobilization reserve forces to immediately execute missions upon arrival at their designated  units, the ROK military is currently test operating a “regionalized resource management  system”[17] which designates reserve forces to receive training at the same military unit every  year.   15 Operations where forces from two or more countries collaborate according to an official agreement or treaty for a common long-term  objective.  16 Operations where two or more Services among the Army, Navy and Air Force organize a joint unit or joint task force (if necessary) to  achieve a common objective.  17 A system to manage resources per region by designating troop mobilization areas as Region 1 (Seoul, Incheon, Gyeonggi-do,  Gangwon-do) and Region 2 (south of Chungcheong-do).",page,57,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43366,"For the smooth mobilization of materials, the ROK military develops measures in  cooperation with the related agencies to check any changes of companies designated for  mobilization in real time and provide incentives to those companies that participate in  government procurement biddings. Furthermore, the military expands the appointment of  emergency planners who perform emergency readiness tasks at companies for mobilization  to promote the effectiveness of the material mobilization during wartime.  **3. Readiness Posture against Transnational and Non-military Threats**  **| Reinforcing a Readiness Posture against Terrorism | The ROK military published the**  “Military Terror Crisis Response Manual” in October 2013 based on the need to better  understand terrorism and to be able to respond against terrorism in a timely and appropriate  manner. Also, the military has designated and operates the Quick Reaction Forces (QRF) and  the CBRNE Special Force for Counter-terrorism to enable seamless initial actions during  counterterrorism operations. A “joint tactical discussion on counter-terrorism” is held  annually to share the latest domestic and overseas intelligence on terrorism and firmly  maintain a cooperation system, including effective response measures against terrorism.  In particular, the MND reinforces its readiness posture against biological agents during  naturally occurring biological threat situations and man-made bioterrorism attacks through  various efforts which include the conclusion of a mutual agreement with the Korea Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention in August 2014 aimed at enabling prompt and effective  responses against bioterrorism.  Readiness against terrorism threats heavily depends on the establishment of a cooperation  system among countries, as the responses and measures of a single country have limitations.  Therefore, the ROK and the United States have held an annual bioterrorism exercise called  “Able Response” since 2011 to improve joint response capabilities such as information  sharing and medical collaboration against potential biological terror attacks and natural  disease outbreaks on the Korean Peninsula.  The role of the military is expected to expand as the threat of terrorism increases. In order  to address such an increasing threat, the MND cooperates with the related agencies to  prepare against various terrorist threats, and actively participates in security cooperation  activities, thereby maintaining a close collaboration system with the international  community.  **| Establishing a Readiness Posture against Cyber Warfare | Cyber threats are**  becoming more sophisticated with the development of information and communication",page,58,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43367,"technology. The DDoS attack in July 2009, cyber terror in March 2013 and cyber attack in  June 2013 are prime examples of the severity of cyber threats.  The ROK military has developed the Master Plan for Defense Cyber Policy with the  objective of securing offensive defense and response capabilities as well as ensuring  complete victory in cyber warfare. Based on the master plan, the military is first modifying  related laws and regulations such as the United Defense Act and the National War Instruction  Guidance to conduct systematic and legal cyber operations. Second, the military has  published the “Joint Cyber Operations Manual” in advance to provide a unified guideline  necessary for engaging in cyber warfare that combines aspects from both physical and cyber  warfare. Third, the military has established a foundation for cyber operations by organizing a  new office that handles overall cyber operations in the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Fourth, the  military has created an environment enabling immediate response during a crisis by  amending manuals and establishing a cyber crisis management system for national defense.  Cyber experts are the core of cyber warfare. Accordingly, the ROK military is obtaining  cyber experts through various channels. In collaboration with the Ministry of Science, ICT  and Future Planning, the military will be able to utilize professional manpower trained in the  private sector starting from 2015. Korea University has established the Department of Cyber  Defense, which will foster specialized cyber experts from 2016. The MND is holding the  White Hat Contest annually in collaboration with the National Intelligence Service (NIS) to  discover cyber talents at an early stage as well as implementing manpower management  policies to utilize cyber specialists effectively.  In order to develop technologies related  to cyber warfare systematically, the  M ND has developed the Mid- to  Long-term Cyber Technology Roadmap.  At the same time, it is improving  countermeasures against new cyber  attacks and developing cyber intrusion ROK-U.S. Cyber Cooperation Working Group (February 2014)  tolerant systems[18] and other technologies.  As cyber warfare has no boundaries in time and space and it is difficult to identify friend  or foe, countermeasures from a single country have limitations. In response to such  limitations, the ROK is establishing a transnational cooperation system with friendly nations,  including the United States. Starting from 2014, the ROK and the United States are holding  the ROK-U.S. Cyber Cooperation Working Group twice a year to discuss issues such as  information sharing, cyber policy / strategy / doctrine, and ways to strengthen cooperation  18 Technology that maintains the core functions of core systems, even during cyber attacks.",page,59,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43368,"related to manpower/education/training. The MND also strives to lay a foundation for  multilateral cyber security cooperation. To this end, the Cyber Working Group (CyberWG)  was launched at the 2[nd] Seoul Defense Dialogue (SDD) in 2013, and the concept paper for the  CyberWG was discussed in 2014.  The ROK military will continue to reinforce its cyber warfare response capabilities in all  areas by establishing a cyber warfare execution system and operation doctrine, performing  research and development on response technologies, securing specialized manpower, and  establishing a transnational cooperative system.  **| Establishing a Readiness Posture against Disaster Threats | With the increase in**  damages caused by pirates in the seas near Somalia, the Cheonghae Unit of the ROK Navy  has executed counter-piracy operations since 2009, ensuring the safety of Korean vessels  operating in and around the Gulf of Aden.  To support recovery efforts from the damage caused by a typhoon in the Philippines, the  ROK military dispatched the Araw Contingent to the area in December 2013. Also, in March  2014, when the Malaysian government requested support in the search efforts to locate the  missing Malaysian airplane in the South China Sea, the ROK military dispatched two  aircraft.  As such, the ROK government not only collaborates with individual countries but also  actively engages in international cooperation to effectively respond to various newly  emerging disaster threats. The ROK also participates in the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)  and ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus),[19] which are multilateral  security forums held among Asia-Pacific countries to respond in unison to transnational and  non-military threats.  Under the ADMM-Plus there are six Experts’ Working Groups which deal with humani­  tarian assistance and disaster relief, maritime security, military medicine, counter-terrorism,  peacekeeping operations, and humanitarian mine action, respectively. The ROK government  not only actively participates in these venues but also carries out a leading role as it serves as  the co-chair with Cambodia of the peacekeeping operations group from 2014 to 2017.  19 This is a Defense Ministers’ conference in which 10 ASEAN member states and eight dialogue partners (ROK, United States, Japan,  China, Russia, India, Australia, and New Zealand) participate, and it is held every three years.",page,60,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

Since the 38[th]  SCM in 2006, right after North Korea’s first nuclear test, extended deterrence[3] has been  guaranteed.  The necessity to reinforce the existing extended deterrence strategy has increased as  security threats, such as North Korea’s second nuclear test in 2009, the attack against the  ROK Ship Cheonan and the shelling of Yeonpyeongdo Island in 2010, etc., have increased.  The ROK Minister of National Defense and the U.S. Secretary of Defense reached a mutual  agreement to develop the Tailored Deterrence Strategy through the Extended Deterrence   1 A concept of extended deterrence ensuring the security of non-nuclear ally nations with U.S. nuclear forces against threats posed by a  nuclear state.  2 The highest-level defense consultative body between the ROK and the United States, held annually, alternating in the ROK MND and the  U.S. Department of Defense.  3 The United States is providing deterrence forces such as a nuclear umbrella, conventional forces, and missile defense capabilities to  protect its allies from the enemy’s threats of nuclear weapons and WMD.",page,61,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

On October 2, 2013, after two years of  consultation, the ROK Minister of National Defense and U.S. Secretary of Defense signed on  the “ROK-U.S. Tailored Deterrence Strategy against North Korea’s nuclear and weapons of  mass destruction (WMD) threats” at the 45[th] SCM.  The Tailored Deterrence Strategy is a ROK-U.S. combined deterrence strategy with an  improved aspect of the existing concept of extended deterrence; it has been optimized to fit  the situation on the Korean Peninsula with a consideration of the characteristics of North  Korean government leaders and nuclear weapons and WMD. It includes applicable military  and non-military response options tailored to different phases of nuclear crises from the  phase of a threat of nuclear weapons or WMD to actual use. The significance of the Tailored  Deterrence Strategy lies in the fact that it establishes a basis for a combined response by fully  utilizing the deterrence means and ways of an allied nation to maximize the effect of the  Alliance capacity.  In order to maintain the credibility and capabilities of extended deterrence, the ROK  government will continue to specify the Tailored Deterrence Strategy while achieving its  effectiveness through close consultations with the United States.  **Chart 3-6.

43371,"Korean nuclear and missile threats.  First, the ROK and the United States established the concept and principles of the  “Comprehensive Alliance Counter-missile Operation” at the 46[th] SCM on October 23, 2014.  The purpose of this document is to strengthen the defense of the Korean Peninsula by  utilizing the Alliance’s capabilities against North Korean missile threats. The term “compre­  hensive” refers to improving the response capabilities against North Korean missile threats in  all areas of 4D (detect, defend, disrupt, and destroy).[5] The Alliance’s Comprehensive Counter missile Operation is an operational-level response concept established in accordance with the  strategic level Tailored Deterrence Strategy, and the Kill Chain and the KAMD system of the  ROK military constitute important elements in executing this operation.  Second, the ROK military has established the Kill Chain, capable of immediate “Find, Fix,  Target, and Engage,” to prepare effectively for North Korean missile threats. The Kill Chain  is a series of attack systems that fixes the location of a target by finding missile threats in  real time, targets with the means to effectively engage to destroy, and carries out the strike.  **Chart 3-7.

To enhance the  surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, the ROK military plans to introduce the Global  Hawk, which is a high-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle for reconnaissance, and procure  reconnaissance satellites as a mid- to long-term plan. In particular, the ROK military will   5 • Detect: Support for the efforts to defend, disrupt and destroy by managing information, surveillance and reconnaissance assets  -  Defense: Active and passive defense to minimize the damage and disruption to friendly forces  -  Disrupt: Kinetic and non-kinetic attacks against North Korea’s missile infrastructure  -  Destroy: Attacks against transporter erector launchers (TELs) and support assets",page,63,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43372,"gradually expand its military information and surveillance capabilities. It also plans to  acquire the capability to promptly strike fixed and mobile facilities related to nuclear  weapons and missiles throughout all domains of North Korea from the ground, sea and air.  To achieve this, it will enhance the accuracy, range, and power of existing ground-to-ground  missiles. By acquiring long-range air-to-surface missiles, medium-range air-to-surface  missiles, Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) and laser-guided bombs, fighters will be  able to carry out long-distance precision strikes. Also, the ROK military will improve the  performance of its submarine-to-surface and ship-to-surface missiles, and develop tactical  ship-to-surface missiles to reinforce its sea-based strike capability.  Third, the ROK military develops the KAMD to intercept missiles heading towards the  ROK territory. The KAMD system establishes a terminal-phase, lower tier overlapped  missile defense system in consideration of the battlefield environment of the Korean  Peninsula.  **Chart 3-8.

The battery that receives an order to intercept will track the missile with its own  radar to execute the interception. The ROK military plans to continuously acquire improved  Patriot missiles and medium-range surface-to-air missiles (M-SAM). Also, in order to  expand the defense area against ballistic missiles, it will develop long-range surface-to-air",page,64,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43373,"missiles (L-SAM) with an extended intercept range using domestic technology and deploy  them by the mid-2020s.  The ROK military will continuously enhance the effectiveness and credibility of its missile  response capabilities by identifying the development requirements of the Kill Chain and  KAMD system, and by discussing options to reinforce interoperability with the U.S. missile  defense system.  **2. Development of Response Capability against Chemical and Biological** **Threats**   North Korea has reinforced its chemical and biological attack capabilities and increased the  threat of attacks with various chemical and biological weapons using terrorism and diseases.  Thus, it has become important for the ROK military to be prepared with chemical, biological,  radiological, nuclear and high-yield explosive (CBRNE) response capability.  The ROK military has utilized ROK-U.S. combined information assets to monitor North  Korea’s facilities related to chemical and biological weapons and detect the signs of an attack  at an early stage to incapacitate any attempts. It has organized CBRNE units at each level to  maintain a prompt CBRNE operations support system. Also, it continues to secure defense  equipment and material and medical supplies, including preventive and therapeutic agents.  The ROK military conducts realistic exercises every year to prepare effectively for threats  from chemical and biological weapons, and also from naturally occurring threats such as  influenza A H1NI. The ROK and U.S. Defense and Health Ministries have carried out “Able  Response,” an annual government-wide biological response exercise, since 2011, in which  200 personnel from over 40 related offices of both countries participate. In 2012, the ROK-U.  S. Biological Defense Task Force was newly established to pursue cooperation issues arising  from Able Response.  The military plans to establish the Comprehensive Development Plan for Chemical and  Biological Threat Response Capability (tentative title) in the future to pursue a mid- to  long-term project in which it will develop the capability to prepare for and respond to  chemical and biological weapons, improve treatment and decontamination capability, and  develop R&D capability. Through this, the ROK military aims to improve its preparedness  against biochemical warfare and CBRNE terrorism to a higher level.",page,65,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43374,"**3. Development of Defense Space Power**  Space is indivisible from our daily life in various areas. Its military significance keeps  increasing in such areas as information gathering, satellite navigation and communications.  Such importance has prompted many nations to focus their energy on space development at a  national strategic level.  The MND announced the Base Plan for Defense Space Power Development in 2012. The  plan is aimed at constructing a system to effectively respond to North Korean WMD threats,  including nuclear weapons and missiles, and prepare for future warfare. Not only is the  MND complementing domestic laws and regulations related to building defense space power,  it is also building a management system by gradually acquiring space forces and training  space experts.  In June 2014, the Space Development Promotion Act was amended in cooperation with the  related government agencies. The Act was legislated in 2005 to establish a foundation to  carry out national space development projects in a systematic and efficient manner. At the  time of legislation, space security-related regulations were lacking in quality and quantity  due to the existence of a strong notion that space was for development and utilization in favor  of industry and science. The amendment in 2014 reinforced the provisions on space security  by specifying the establishment procedures for the space development plan in connection  with national security.  The MND constructs a cooperation system to contribute not only to national security, but  also to domestic industrial development and world peace through defense space power  development. Domestically, it reinforces civil-military cooperation to maximize the effects  of convergence and cooperation. Internationally, the MND holds periodic cooperative  council meetings with its U.S. counterpart to discuss various measures for space cooperation.  In particular, in September 2014, by concluding the MOU on Space Situational Awareness (SSA)[6] Service and Information Sharing, the ROK and the United States agreed to partake in  the efforts of the international community to guarantee the peaceful use and safety of space.  The MND will continue its efforts to expand the consensus on the importance of space  security and the necessity to construct a defense space power. It will also develop defense  space power through a phased approach, taking into consideration the development level of  national space power, financial capability and the security environment.  6 A concept of coping with collisions, crashes, and other dangers by ascertaining the situation of satellites, space wreckage, etc., that  rotate in space around the Earth by using space surveillance systems, such as optical or radar systems that are installed on the ground or in space.

43375,"**Section 3 Establishing an Integrated** **Civilian-Government-Military-Police** **Defense Posture**  On top of the military threat from North Korea, various security threats such as cyber-attacks, acts of  terrorism, and so on are ever increasing. To respond effectively to these threats, it is important to estab­  lish an improved, full-spectrum total security posture by constructing a close inter-agency cooperation  system, and integrate all national defense elements seamlessly. The military will continue to reinforce the  integrated civilian-government-military-police defense posture and develop the current integrated defense  concept into a full-spectrum total security concept in consideration of newly emerging threats such as  terrorism, cyber-attacks, etc.   **1. Management of Integrated Defense Organizations**  The government manages integrated defense organizations such as the Central Integrated  Defense Committee, Regional Integrated Defense Committee, Integrated Defense  Headquarters, and Integrated Defense Support Headquarters to establish an integrated  defense posture. The integrated defense command and support system are shown in Chart  3-9.  The Central Integrated Defense Committee is the highest decision-making organization  pertaining to integrated defense. It was established under the Office of the Prime Minister. It  deliberates and decides nation-level integrated defense policies, integrated defense operations  and training guidance and the declaration or lifting of integrated defense conditions.[1]  Regional Integrated Defense Committees are located in Seoul and 16 metropolitan cities and   1 This is a situation in phases, declared in response to infiltration, provocation or threats from an enemy.

43377,"such as the military, police, reserve forces, local governments and civil defense units.  **2. Development of an Integrated Defense Posture**   The ROK government reinforces the integrated defense posture to respond effectively to  the various security threats that have been increasing recently.  In 2013, a 24-hour integrated defense operation led by the police and performed during the  Hwarang Training[2] was reflected in training guidelines. In the past, upon the declaration of  an integrated defense situation, the military took the lead in carrying out the training  activities. However, the operation time led by the police was increased to utilize the  information capabilities, mobility, and scientific investigation skills of the police to prepare  for various threats such as terrorism.  To smoothly execute civilian-government-military-police integrated defense operations,  the government makes improvements to connectivity between the CCTV integrated control  tower installed in each municipality and the integrated defense situation room of the munici­  pality.  To improve the protection capability of major national facilities, a protection plan was  developed, including the management of the protection forces for each facility.  In 2014, the need to redefine the concept of  integrated defense was raised at the 47[th]  Central Integrated Defense Committee. Since  the concept of integrated defense was  established in the 1960s with the main focus  on penetration and provocation by North  Korea, the council plans to improve it to the  concept of full-spectrum total security to meet  47[th] Central Integrated Defense Committee (February 2014)  the new types of threats such as terrorism and  cyber-attacks.  2 A comprehensive rear area exercise conducted biannually to establish an integrated civilian-government-military-police defense  posture.",page,69,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43378,"**Section 4 Assuring Combat Readiness** **through Realistic Training**  The ROK military fosters talented personnel and training officers to become an elite group through various  policies such as reinforcing the professionalism of soldiers and acquiring a tailored workforce. On top of  reinforcing moral education for military personnel, the ROK military conducts scientific training to maxi­  mize the experience of battlefield situations, and reinforces realistic education and training by increasing  combined exercises and training led by the ROK military.  **1. Fostering Elite Officers and Professional Defense Personnel**  **| Acquiring and Managing Outstanding Personnel | Acquiring outstanding personnel in**  a stable manner is an essential element for the reconstruction of the troop structure centered  on officers. Accordingly, the ROK military pursues the expansion of tailored personnel  acquisition through university-military agreements, gradual expansion of the quota for  long-term service junior officers and NCOs, and early achievement of the targeted  percentage of female service members.  Based on agreements between the academic sector and the military, military studies and  non-commissioned officer courses are established, and the ROK military expands the  number of mid-term service officers and non-commissioned officers in the combat and  technology fields. Military studies courses are currently installed in 16 universities, and are  scheduled to be expanded to 20 universities by 2018. In the past, commissions and  scholarships were guaranteed to all military studies majors, but starting in 2013 they have to  be selected through competition with regular applicants in order to receive such benefits.  Non-commissioned officer courses are now installed in 53 junior colleges and will be  expanded centered on outstanding colleges that already offer non-commissioned officer  courses. Starting in 2015, the RNTC (Reserve NCO’s Training Corps) will be operated in six",page,70,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43379,"colleges as a pilot program to diversify the means to acquire non-commissioned officers and  improve the quality of non-commissioned officers.  By restructuring the number of officers, the ROK military will increase the long-term  service selection percentage to reinforce the professionalism of military officers. By reducing  the number of sergeants and first and second lieutenants, and increasing the number of first  sergeants and captains and majors, the military will continue to adjust the selection so that  28% of commissioned officers and 47% of the non-commissioned officers will be selected as  long-term servers by 2025, where 20% of commissioned officers and 25% of non-commis­  sioned officers were selected in 2013.  To utilize more outstanding female personnel in the defense area, the ROK military  expands the percentage of female soldiers. Initially, it planned to increase the percentage of  female soldiers to 7% of all commissioned officers and 5% of all non-commissioned officers  by 2020; however, this goal is expected to be attained earlier by 2015 for commissioned  officers and 2017 for non-commissioned officers. In 2014, not only were all training courses  opened to females by recruiting female cadets in the Korea Army Academy at Yeong-Cheon,  but also the military chaplain branch and three army combat branches (artillery, armored,  and air defense) were additionally opened to females to fully display their capabilities. Along  with the female personnel expansion, the military implements and improves systems to  protect maternity and support the balance between work and family in order to ensure a  favorable work environment.  **| Fostering Professional Defense Personnel | The MND fosters professional defense**  personnel to actively respond to changes in the ways of warfighting such as an accelerated  operation of advanced weapon systems, cyber warfare and space war. The professional  defense personnel are managed systematically, being divided into professional degree  education and overseas military education.  Doctoral degree education is focused on training professors, research personnel, and  special military technology personnel, and more than 30 candidates are selected annually.  Meanwhile, master’s degree education is focused on natural science, engineering, and  military and security areas, and over 180 candidates are selected every year.  Overseas military education is conducted with the purpose of learning military knowledge  from various nations and training regional professionals. Over 300 candidates are dispatched  annually to education institutions such as command and staff colleges, military branch  schools, and military academies in over 30 nations, including the United States, Japan, and  the UK. Recently, in connection with the improvement of the status of the ROK military and  expansion of the area of military diplomacy, those countries are diversified into the Middle  East, South America, and Africa.",page,71,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

Improvement and Settlement in the Development and Refresher Training** **System**  **| Optimizing the Goals, Contents and Methods of School Education | Soldiers should**  be able to perform their duties immediately after acquiring the core combat techniques, and  officers should cultivate combat command capability, education and training management  capability, and character guidance capability.  The education contents were changed from a subject-oriented education to a project-based  education based on tactical situations. The 22 subjects governed by the MND were  minimized to two subjects of moral education and military security so that education will be  done by focusing on the tactics and combat skills needed in the Army, Navy and Air Force.  The method of education is mostly focused on participation in and discussion of tactical  situations with a view to improve creativity and tactical understanding on the part of the  trainees.  **| Settlement of the Overall Evaluation System for Officer and Non-commissioned**  **Officer Candidates | The overall evaluation system for officer and non-commissioned**  officer candidates, which started in 2012, is a system that evaluates all commissioned and  non-commissioned officer candidates in training courses in the Army, Navy and Air Force,  and commissions only a select number of candidates who have fulfilled the qualification  standards.  Overall evaluation is conducted focusing on the required combat skills, tactical command,  and mental strength, and in order to raise the professionalism and transparency of the  evaluation, a reservist professional evaluation group is operated. Since the comprehensive  evaluation system for commissions started, educational participation and concentration levels  have been improved, and the cadets’ proactive self-study shows higher enthusiasm towards  education training.  An exclusive tactical instructor system is used by the Army College at the Joint Forces  Military University and nine branch schools of the Army. In this system, the instructor only  teaches basic combat principles and leads discussions regarding battlefield situations, and  then the students learn on their own through discussions among the student officers. As  discussion-oriented education focused on tactics takes place, the student officers’ compre­  hensive circumstantial judgment and problem-solving capabilities have been improved.  In the future, systems related to development and refresher training will continue to be  improved to contribute to the reinforcement of the command capability of junior officers and  NCOs.",page,72,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43381,"**3. Reinforcing Moral Education for Service Members**  In order to “foster combat-oriented warriors” who strive for victory, the ROK military  carries out moral education for service members focused on establishing proper values of  state and security while having a will to fight with a ready-to-fight attitude and military  spirit with the firm conviction of victory.  Accordingly, the military has integrated the dispersed moral education functions of the  Army, Navy and Air Force to set up the Defense Institute for Spiritual Force in 2013. After  the institute was founded, all the education and research functions relating to mental strength  were integrated for consistent and systematic education. The ROK military reinforces the  education by designating “military spirit” as the core education point in addition to the  existing values of state and security education, and by installing a new education course on  military spirit. This course promotes the cultivation of military spirit among lieutenant  colonel and major level officers from field units through discussion on the military spirit role  model and staff rides.  In 2013, the Textbook of Military Moral Education commonly used by all military  personnel was improved. In particular, this textbook was formatted in a manner that  instructors can more easily utilize during moral education by specifying a summary of the  lectures and education focus in the beginning, and by organizing the questions many service  members have into a Q&A format. The whole textbook has been modified to update the  education contents for each area, including the value of state, value of security and military  spirit. Additionally, by considering the viewpoint of a new generation of soldiers, the military  has produced various reference materials using video, animation, etc. It also adopted for the  first time in 2014 a presentation and discussion type of education where the service members  voluntarily participate in moral education so that the service members can take in the proper  values of state and security as their conviction. This is used and applied not only in the  educational institutions but also in the field units.   **4. Reinforcing Realistic Unit Training**  **| Unit Training | Unit training is carried out focusing on core subjects such as moral**  education, firing, physical training, and combat skills, thereby gaining complete proficiency  over combat activities, and half of the available time each year is used for unit training  focused on tactical training so that soldiers can perform in combat according to the  commander’s intentions.

43382,"reinforcing military law and human rights education combined with proficiency in combat  techniques and tactics. To maximize the effects of unit training, scientific training is  conducted using state-of-the-art science and technology, such as the Multiple Integrated  Laser Engagement System (MILES),[1] data communications, satellites, etc.  The military puts efforts into the advancement of education and training evaluation. For  this, the military has placed professional unit training evaluators in corps units to evaluate  unit training in a more objective and professional manner.  By establishing practical interlocking unit management plans and weekly training  schedules, unit management changes are minimized so that all unit members can foresee the  training and prepare themselves.  The ROK military is integrating small-scale training sites that are scattered about so that  the weapon systems being fielded in consideration of the operational environment can  function optimally. It is also laying the groundwork for realistic training by preparing  optimized training aids in a package format depending on the type of training.  The military is guaranteeing the conditions required for the military to become fully  combat duty-oriented by regulating temporary transfers of troops at the battalion level or  lower and including post-training maintenance activities as part of the training period  thereby preventing the imposition of additional tasks during maintenance activities.  **| Major Training of the Army, Navy and Air Force |** **The Army conducts realistic**  training to foster a strong army equipped with the “capability and posture of complete  victory.”  The Army improves combat mission performance standards in phases by differentiating  the goals of individual units after setting the direction of unit training, first by diagnosing the  unit standard through evaluation. Unit training is carried out by focusing on scientific  training, such as training using the MILES, the Battle Command Training Program (BCTP),  and simulator training.  The training using the MILES is performed at the platoon to brigade level, and in various  unit types such as infantry units, mechanized units, and special warfare units. For the  regiment-level training performed by the Korea Combat Training Center, the training field  will be expanded to 14 times the size of Yeouido (18 km×16 km) by 2016, and plans are  underway to develop various kinds of weapon systems that support the brigade level, such as  1 Combat training equipment that uses advanced  optics technology, such as a laser launcher and detector.

The BCTP is a training program that uses computer simulation to enhance the combat  command capability of the commanders and staff officers. Through training, the  commanders and staff officers become proficient in unit commanding procedures at each  level and integrated combat force management capability. Starting in 2014, the Army has  conducted the BCTP in a simulated situation that highly resembles the battlefield by linking  a war game simulation system with the C4I system. In the future, an integrated training  system is planned to be established that links the computer simulation technique and actual  maneuvering underground.  Simulator training is used for firing, control, and tactical simulation in virtual  environments. It is currently provided for training in fostering education and unit training.  Simulation-training centers will be built at the corps and division level in the future through  which individual training and battlefield function training will be developed.  Along with these, to maximize the integrated combat capability in the battalion and below  units, the Army reinforces cooperative training, and performing combined training, with the  U.S. armed forces in CBRNE operations, counter-fire operations, air assault operations and  counter-terrorism operations.  **The Nav y** car ries out realistic  maritime training that takes into account  the battlefield environment of the waters  in the East, West and South Seas.

Component training is a basic training, and it is carried out based on the characteristics of the  combat environment, such as anti-surface, anti-submarine, air defense, amphibious and  maritime air operations. Maritime training is a specialized training, such as maneuver  training, Northwest Islands defense training, Northern Limit Line local provocation joint  response training, and maritime interdiction training. In the maritime training, cutting-edge  surface combatants, submarines, amphibious ships, maritime patrol aircraft, and maritime  operations and utility helicopters participate.  Combined training is divided into the ROK-U.S. combined training to strengthen the  combined defense system, and multilateral combined training to increase military  cooperation and humanitarian assistance. Among the various ROK-U.S. combined training  there are maritime counter-SOF training, anti-submarine maritime search training, anti-sub­  marine warfare training, amphibious operations training, mine warfare training, special  warfare operations training, and submarine operations training. Multilateral combined  training exercises include the Cobra Gold Exercise, Western Pacific Mine Counter Measure  Exercise (WPMCMEX), Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise, anti-ballistic missile  training, and Search and Rescue Exercise (SAREX) with the surrounding countries,  including Japan, China and Russia.

The Taegeuk Exercise is a  theater-level command post exercise carried out every year under the command of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff to increase the military’s peacetime and wartime operational execution  capability, and to meet the development requirements for joint forces and unit structure.  After the transition of armistice operational control (OPCON) in 1994, the Joint Chiefs of  Staff started the Taegeuk Exercise in 1995 to increase its independent operation execution  capability. Since 1999, even operational command units (corps level) have participated in the  Taegeuk Exercise, and now it has truly become a theater-level command post exercise led by  the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  In the Taegeuk Exercise, the theater-level joint operations simulation model is utilized for  realistic training. In 2013, the military constructed an operational execution system  according to the enemy’s threat levels, and starting in 2014, the exercise has been conducted  with a focus on operational execution procedure proficiency against various threats,  including local provocations.  The Hoguk Training is a theater- and  operational command-level field training  exercise carried out every year led by the Joint  Chiefs of Staff to increase the operational  execution capability of large-scale units. In  1988, the training, previously carried out  separately by the Army, Navy and Air Force,  was integrated as the “Tongil Training,” and  River crossing assault during the Hoguk Training  then the name was changed to “Hoguk  Training” in 1996. To effectively prepare for enemy threats, the training was divided into  training controlled by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and training delegated to the operations  commands in 2014.  The Hwarang Training is a comprehensive training in the rear area under the command of  the Integrated Defense Headquarters in which all national defense elements participate, such  as the civilian sector, government, military and police. This training is carried out with a  focus on becoming proficient in the procedures of the operational plans during wartime and  peacetime and establishing an integrated civilian-government-military-police defense  posture. The Hwarang Training is becoming realistic integrated defense training as it has  been conducted in line with the schedule and situations of the Chungmu Training[2] since  2 A comprehensive exercise performed by integrated civilian, government, and military personnel under the responsibility of the head of  a local city or provincial government to establish the local security posture.",page,79,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

In the future, the ROK military will continue to improve its joint exercise and training  execution measures in order to cultivate an independent theater operation execution  capability and to acquire a reflexive response capability based on periodic and repeated  training.  **| Combined Exercise and Training | The Key Resolve (KR) exercise and Foal Eagle (FE)**  training are a ROK-U.S. combined theater-level command post exercise (CPX)[3] and a field  training exercise (FTX) conducted during the first half of every year.  The Key Resolve exercise focuses on  examining the combined defense posture and  improving the proficiency of warfighting  procedures. In 2013, the ROK military  improved its capability to lead theater-level  combined exercises as the ROK Joint Chiefs of  Staff assumed the leading role to carry out  exercise planning, control, and after-action  Key Resolve (KR) exercise  review (AAR).  The Foal Eagle training is a field training exercise focused on enhancing ROK-U.S.  combined operations and rear area protection capabilities. Since 2008, it has been carried out  in an integrated manner with the Key Resolve exercise. In 2014, it was held with multina­  tional combined forces for the first time as Australian forces participated with a  company-level unit.  The Ulchi Freedom Guardian (UFG) exercise is a ROK-U.S. theater-level command post  exercise conducted during the second half of every year. Through this exercise, the ROK  military improves its independent response capability and the ROK-U.S. combined response  capabilities against local provocations by North Korea, and reinforces the ROK-U.S.  combined warfighting capabilities against an aggression. Starting from 2013, in particular,  the administrative bodies of cities, counties, districts and above participate in the crisis  management portion of the exercise, which improves the overall outcome of the exercise.  According to the conditions-based wartime operation control (OPCON) transition plan, the  ROK and the United States will explore options to developed future-oriented combined  exercises.  3 This is an exercise for the commanders and staff organization in each unit to practice the mission execution of their respective units.

43392,"**Section 1 Refinement and Development** **of Defense Reform**  The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has established the Defense Reform Basic Plan (2014-2030),  which reflects changes in the domestic and foreign security situations and national defense environments  to foster an “advanced elite military.” Defense reform is pushed forward with the primary goal of securing  the capability to respond against North Korean threats in the short- to mid-term, and reinforcing the  defense capability against potential threats while preparing for the era of unification in the long term. Mili­  tary structure reform will transform the structure into one that is capable of executing offensive integrated  operations in an informationized high-tech network-centric environment suitable for future warfare.  Defense management reform will also be proceeded to establish a highly efficient advanced defense  management system.  **1. Progress of Defense Reform**  In December 2005, the MND established the Defense Reform Basic Plan (2006-2020) to  transform the “manpower-oriented quantitative military structure” into an “information- and  knowledge-oriented qualitative military structure.”  Since then, the MND has modified and amended the basic plan in two- to three-year cycles  in accordance with the analysis and assessment results on the domestic and foreign security  situations and the progress of defense reform based on the National Defense Reform Act.  In June 2009, the MND established the Defense Reform Basic Plan (2009-2020), which  reflects the response system against military threats including North Korea’s long-range  missile launches and its second nuclear test, and other potential non-military threats.  In August 2012, the Defense Reform Basic Plan (2012-2030) was established to  Defense Reform Basic Plan (2014-2030) e-book",page,84,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43393,"additionally reflect the changes in the domestic and foreign security environment and  various military threats from North Korea such as the attack against the ROK Ship Cheonan  and shelling of Yeonpyeong Island. In this plan, the target year for defense reform was  modified from 2020 to 2030, considering the development of defense science technology and  changes in the defense environment, such as existing and future threats.  After 2013, the necessity to prepare a deterrent force to respond against North Korea’s  provocation threats and asymmetric force buildup was raised. Also, the need to transform  into a structure which not only allows a timely and proactive response under the changing  warfighting paradigm but also reduces the response time in detecting, deciding, and striking  through network development was brought up. Also, defense reform needed to be modified  since a low birthrate and rapid aging of society limit the sustainment of the quantitative  military structure, and the increase in public welfare requirements hinder the stable securing  of the defense budget.  Against this backdrop, in March 2014, the Defense Reform Basic Plan (2014-2030) was  established, reflecting the security situation changes while maintaining the basic principles  of the Defense Reform Basic Plan (2012-2030) to secure the motivational drive for defense  reform. The military structure will transform into an elite force structure which has the  proper capability to simultaneously respond against North Korean asymmetric threats, local  provocations and aggression threats, and with a larger number of officers and NCOs to  prepare for the reduction of military resources. In the defense management area, an advanced  defense management system with high efficiency will be established by improving combat  power through realistic education and training and effective personnel management, and  through innovative logistics management by improving the mobilization system, shaping  elite reserve forces, and improving the logistics system. The major achievements of defense  reform from 2013 to 2014 are shown in Chart 4-1.  **Chart 4-1.

43395,"To develop the Joint Chiefs of Staff into a structure that is prepared against future enemy  threats and suited for the operational environment, the command organizations will be  optimized by reinforcing the ROK-U.S. combined information analysis function and  considering the reduction of standing troops. The timing of the reorganization will be  decided in conjunction with the progress of the conditions-based wartime operational control (OPCON) transition.  **| Troop Structure | For the troop structure, the capability to simultaneously respond**  against North Korea’s asymmetric forces, local provocations and aggression threats will be  primarily ensured, and the size of the standing troops will be reduced to 522,000 by 2022.  The size of the standing troops will gradually be reduced in a practical manner considering  the fielding date of the advanced weapon systems.  By increasing the ratio of officers and NCOs, an elite troop structure will be established.  The target ratio of officers and NCOs in the Army, Navy, and Air Force by 2025 is at least  40%. To meet the requirements of future wars, the Army will be reduced to 387,000 to make  an elite military with an information- and technology-oriented qualitative advanced  structure, and the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force will be restructured within the existing  size of troops.

A ground  intelligence group, intelligence communications group, and service support group will be  task-organized to support ground operations, and the mountain brigade will be organized to  rapidly maneuver in the eastern mountainous area to destroy the enemy.  The regional corps, as the highest tactical echelon of ground operations, defends the  forward area of responsibility at each axis, and will be reinforced to be operated as the main  unit in offensive operations. In order to enhance counter-fire operations capabilities, the Air  Force’s Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) and aviation groups, air defense artillery  groups, and logistics support brigade will be organized for each corps to reinforce combat  support capability. Such tailored reorganization will be done in consideration of the eastern  and western operational environments.  The maneuver corps will be employed as the main echelon in multi-dimensional,  high-speed maneuver warfare as the strategic and operational reserve unit. In considering the  geographical features of the Korean Peninsula, its reorganization will center on mechanized  infantry divisions in order to rapidly respond to operational environment changes.  According to such a reorganization plan, a corps-oriented operations execution system  with the concept of a mini field army will be established. In particular, by primarily  reinforcing the frontline units, combat execution capability will be significantly enhanced.  The Navy will not only prepare against the existing threats by securing the integrated  operating capability for the multi-dimensional forces of surface, underwater, and aviation,  but will also be developed into a structure capable of protecting full-spectrum national  interests such as the protection of sea lines of communications and maritime resources.

Direction of Defense Management Reform**  In order to improve education and training, a comprehensive scientific training site will be  established to make live-fire and maneuvering possible in diverse combat situations. As for  the personnel management system, university-military agreements will be expanded to  satisfy the military’s demand for outstanding personnel with tailored talent. Additionally, the  quota structure will be improved by increasing the selection rate for long-term service junior  officers and NCOs.  To improve the mobilization system, a regionalized resource management system will be  established for the mobilized reserve forces, and the related statutes will be modified to  immediately mobilize the required forces in times of contingency. To shape strong, elite  reserve forces, a part-time service system for officer reservists will be established in phases  by 2020, and the establishment of a reserve force management agency by 2023 will be  actively reviewed to efficiently manage the reserve forces. For the reserve force training  sites, 208 battalion-level training sites will be integrated into 44 brigade-level training sites  by 2024 to establish a realistic training system using a scientific training system.  To innovate logistics management, the current multi-level military logistics system will be  simplified into a one-stop concept logistics support system by 2016. The military executive  agency system will be expanded, and the use of civilian resources in combat service support  functions, such as replacing non-combat military vehicles with commercial vehicles in a  phased manner, will also be expanded.  The transparency, professionalism, and efficiency of the defense force improvement  projects will be enhanced, and all phases of weapon system requirement proposal,  acquisition, and maintenance will be managed in an integrated manner. In particular, the  scientific analytical capability for proposed requirements will be enhanced. Also, the Agency  for Defense Development (ADD) will be developed into a global research institution for  future core technology development.  Cyber warfare response capability will be reinforced by establishing a comprehensive  development plan and improving the related laws and systems.  The level of welfare for military personnel will be enhanced to allow our service members  to focus solely on combat missions. An optimum reward system for career service members  will be established, and by 2017, it is planned to raise soldiers’ salaries to double that of 2012.  To foster an advanced barracks culture, military community centers and indoor gyms will be  built, and the number of professional counselors for soldiers will be expanded to be employed  at the regiment level. Also, social compensation, such as acknowledging military service  experience as school credits, will be increased.

To this end, the  ROK military has established and promotes a force buildup plan to realize a joint military strategy and joint  operations concept based on the assessment of strategic environments on the Korean Peninsula and the  analysis of existing and potential threats.   **1. Basic Direction of Force Buildup**  The MND strengthens the military force in each category to effectively and appropriately  prepare against North Korea and other potential threats while primarily acquiring the force  to prepare against North Korean threats.  In terms of battlefield awareness, the MND will reinforce strategic surveillance and  reconnaissance capabilities for the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity, and improve the  battlefield visualization capability at each echelon. In order to achieve this goal, the MND  will gradually acquire various types of manned and unmanned reconnaissance aircraft and  multipurpose satellites.  In command and control, the capabilities to share battlefield situations in real time and  support command decisions will be acquired. The interoperability of the command and  control systems in each field and echelon will be improved, and the survivability and  protection capability from kinetic and cyber attacks will also be enhanced.  The ground forces will acquire maneuver and strike capabilities to conduct offensive  maneuver warfare. As the operational area of responsibility of each unit expands, maneuver,  fire, protection and precision strike capabilities will be improved, and an automated combat  system will be acquired. K-2 tanks, K-9 self-propelled guns, next-generation multiple launch  rocket system (MLRS), Korea Utility Helicopter (KUH), and missiles capable of striking the  entire area of North Korea will also be continuously acquired.  The naval forces will acquire maritime control capability for the surrounding area and the",page,93,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43402,"capability of executing multi-dimensional, high-speed amphibious operations. With the  continued increase in challenges against the ROK’s sea sovereignty and interests, the ROK  Navy will acquire the surface, underwater, and aviation forces to effectively address these  challenges. Aegis destroyers, next-generation destroyers, and next-generation submarines  will be fielded, and in conjunction with these acquisitions, the Submarine Command will be  established. Also, the Maritime Task Flotilla will be reorganized over the long term. The  amphibious forces will additionally integrate large transport ships and amphibious  helicopters, and a marine brigade will be established for the integrated defense of Jeju Island.  Also, the Marine Aviation Group will be established.  The air forces will secure air superiority for the defense of the Korean Peninsula and  acquire long-range precision strike capability against strategic targets. By acquiring the  FA-50, next-generation fighter (F-X), and Korea fighter (KF-X) in phases, the ROK Air Force  will improve its independent air operations execution capability. Aerial refueling tankers,  precision-guided weapons, and space-based surveillance power will also be acquired to  improve long-range air operations and all-weather strike capability.  The protection forces will improve the defense capability against aircraft and ballistic  missiles as well as the protection capability against chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear  and high-yield explosive (CBRNE) attacks. To establish the Korea Air and Missile Defense (KAMD) system, ballistic missile defense forces, such as medium- and long-range air  defense guided weapons, will be continuously acquired. To reduce casualties and facility  damage and to ensure survivability in the case of North Korea’s nuclear and weapons of mass  destruction attacks, protection capability will be enhanced and follow-up management  capability will be improved in phases.  **2.

First, the key forces will be reinforced to prepare against North Korea’s asymmetric forces  and aggression threats. In order to accomplish this, the Kill Chain and Korea Air and Missile  Defense (KAMD) will be established in good time by acquiring long-range air-to-ground  guided missiles and long-range ground-to-air guided weapons. The capability to prepare against  asymmetric threats and to respond against North Korea’s aggression will be continuously  reinforced by acquiring counter-fire radar, aircraft GPS disruption prevention systems, etc.  Second, to prevent a vacuum due to force reduction following defense reform, the vital  forces in unit reorganization will be secured in good time. To overcome the expansion of  areas of operations and inferiority in the number of forces, military forces will be reinforced",page,95,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43404,"by focusing on surveillance, reconnaissance, maneuver, and precision strike capabilities by  acquiring battalion-level reconnaissance UAVs, upgraded 105 mm howitzer and  multi-function observation devices, and improving the day-and-night close combat  capabilities of field units at the battalion level and below.  Third, the key capabilities to reinforce self-defense capacity will be acquired. In order to  accomplish this, a networked command, control, and communication system will be  established through a next-generation military satellite communication system, and rapid  maneuver and strike capabilities will be acquired by operating large attack helicopters. The  maritime control and amphibious operations capability will be reinforced with next-gen­  eration amphibious ships, and air superiority and long-range operations capability will be  realized with aerial refueling tankers.  For this aim, a total of 322 defense force improvement projects will be carried out from  2015 to 2019. Among these, 103 will be new projects.  The ROK military will design a mid- to long-term road map to acquire military forces that  “can see earlier and farther, and make decisions to strike faster” by considering the various  future threats, battlefield environment changes, and science technology development trends.  **Chart 4-10.

43405,"**Section 3 Shaping Elite Reserve Forces** **and Enhancing War Sustainment Capability**  The reserve forces are the key forces for deterring war during peacetime and for winning wars in contin­  gencies. As such, in order to strengthen the reserve forces to the level of standing forces, the military  focuses its energy on improving the efficiency of mobilization of troops and supplies, modernizing combat  equipment and materials, and modifying the training methods and conditions of the reservists. The MND  also innovatively improves the procurement, maintenance support, and logistics systems; integrates and  utilizes the available resources of the private sector, government, and military, both domestic and foreign;  and expands international logistics cooperation to enhance war sustainment capability.   **1. Shaping Elite Reserve Forces**  **| Enhancing Efficiency of the Mobilization System of Troops and Materials | Since**  2013, the MND has been experimenting with an expansion plan for the management and  assignment of troop mobilization resources from managing by postal address to managing by  region.[1] When mobilization resources are managed by region, there is an advantage of  improving combat strength because appropriate specialties are assigned to fulfill mobili­  zation requirements, while mobilization assignment unit changes are minimized.  To assess the mobilization requirements for materials responsibly, mobilization  requirement deliberation committees have been formed and are operated at each echelon. By  collaborating with related departments such as the National Tax Service and the Ministry of  Public Safety and Security, plans to check the changes of companies for mobilization in real  time and giving incentives to companies in participating in government procurement bidding  are being pursued.  To enhance the efficiency of reserve force resource management and training as well as the  troops and materials mobilization system, a defense mobilization information system[2] has  been established in phases since 2006. Phase 1, which is the management of reservists, and   1 Dividing the troop mobilization assignment areas into Region 1 (Seoul, Incheon, Gyeonggi-do, and Gangwon-do) and Region 2 (south of  Chungcheong-do).  2 An information system performing the automated functions of prompt, precise mobilization plans, resource management, mobilization  execution, and other work processes for mobilization resources from the MND to subordinate units.",page,97,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43406,"phase 2, which is the personnel mobilization, have been completed along with phase 3, which  is the materials mobilization. Phase 4 is the development of a “mobilization capability  analysis model,” and it is expected to be completed in 2016.  Mobilization supplement battalions with troops, equipment and supplies have been  organized. If large-scale losses occur in the forward divisions and corps during wartime,  mobilization supplement battalions complete with troops, equipment, supplies, and  ammunition will be deployed to immediately supplement for the losses. By 2016, 168 mobili­  zation supplement battalions will be established in the rear area to be deployed to the forward  area during contingencies.  To command and control the mobilization of troops and materials, the MND considers  establishing a mobilization executive agency directly under the MND after 2018. The agency  will provide integrated management and verification of mobilization requirements during  peacetime, and will coordinate and control to smoothly mobilize various personnel and  materials in wartime.  The MND pursues the amendment of the United Defense Act to respond in a timely way  against North Korean threats that are difficult to predict, such as the shelling of Yeonpy­  eongdo Island, and to prevent the escalation of war. Such an amendment will make partial  mobilization orders possible even during an integrated defense situation.  Legal and institutional mechanisms will be prepared for the troops and materials mobili­  zation system to immediately perform its missions, and there will be active cooperation with  the related agencies to use the necessary resources at the time needed.  **| Reservists Organization and**  **Resource Management | Reservists**  are classified into either the mobilized  reserve force or the homeland defense  reserve force depending on their mission.  The mobilized reservists are mainly  composed of reservists who are in their Reserve force training  first to fourth year after being discharged  from their active service. They are mobilized as supplemental personnel for the extension  Public advertisement for the reserve forces",page,98,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43407,"and establishment of active service units or mobilized in the case of troop losses to conduct  operational missions. The homeland defense reservists are composed of reservists in their  fifth to eighth year after being discharged, and they conduct homeland defense operations in  designated areas or workplaces.  In accordance with the Military Personnel Management Act, retired officers, warrant  officers, and non-commissioned officers are obligated to be part of the reservists until they  reach the full retirement age for their respective ranks. For enlisted service members, they  are part of the reservists for eight years after they are discharged. ROK citizens over the age  of 18 and under age 60 who are not incorporated into the reserve forces can apply to become  homeland defense reservists. As of September 2014, approximately 6,300 female reservists  and 1,200 special warfare reservists are serving as members of the homeland defense reserve  force.  The number of reservists is 2,970,000 as of September 2014, and the reservists are  organized into local reserve units in town (eup), township (myeon) and neighborhood (dong),  and workplace reserve units.  The MND will efficiently manage the reservists as an axis of national total war along with  the standing force by maintaining the appropriate number of reservists and differentiating  training and management methods for reservists according to the number of years after their  active service.  **| Enhancement of Execution Capability of Homeland Defense Operations | Old**  personal firearms and crew-served weapons owned by the homeland defense reservists are  replaced with new models. By 2016, the Carbine rifles that still exist in some units will be  entirely replaced with M16A1 rifles, and the gas masks and bulletproof helmets necessary for  individual protection will be acquired 100% by 2017.  By 2020, communications equipment will have been improved with new models to make it  possible to execute integrated civilian-government-military-police operations, enhancing the  homeland defense operation capabilities of the homeland defense reserve forces.  For units with a low organization rate in peacetime to smoothly conduct their missions in  wartime, a part-time service system for reserve cadres is used for such units. In peacetime,  combat strength is maintained by recalling officer reservists for 20 days a year to participate  in resource management and unit training; therefore they can promptly conduct their  missions when they are mobilized. To organize reserve cadres as the homeland platoon  leaders of reserve companies, the Establishment of Homeland Reserve Forces Act has been  amended to expand the reserve cadre organization areas from town (eup), township (myeon)  and neighborhood (dong) to city (si), county (gun) and district (gu).  In connection with the military structure reorganization, reserve force management",page,99,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43408,"agencies[3] will be modified. Homeland defense operations will be efficiently controlled by  organizing homeland local units as mid-command organizations between battalions and  reserve companies, and reserve companies will be combined or disbanded based on the  number of resources and operational area conditions. The reduced manpower due to the  combination or disbandment of reserve companies will be transformed into newly  established mobilization support groups and reserve force training units. The rank system for  civilian workers in the military that manage the reserve forces will be subdivided from the  existing 5[th] and 7[th] grades into a 4-9 system to enhance the efficiency of personnel  management and revitalize the organization.  **| Improvement of Training Methods and Conditions for Reservists | The MND**  conducts reserve force training for all reservists except training-deferred reservists.[4] Reserve  force training is divided into mobilization training, supplementary mobilization reserve  training, and homeland defense basic training. The reserve force training schedule  categorized by type is shown in Chart 4-11.  **Chart 4-11.

43409,"Starting in 2014, a pass system by measurement and early release system have been  expanded throughout the country to increase the effectiveness of reserve force training. By  measuring the training results with an evaluation checklist, incentives such as early release  and breaks are given. When there are a large number of excellent trainees, up to 30% are  granted early release.  The training sites for mobilization training were changed from separate training sites to the  mission conduct area of each unit to enable training to fit realistic situations. In one battalion  for each regiment of a mobilization division, units are organized the same as during wartime  to conduct Ssangyong training.  Starting in 2013, test operation of a scientific training site that can realistically train  reservists began. The military plans to acquire 44 scientific training sites throughout the  country to conduct scientific reserve force training at the regiment level by 2024.  At the training sites, up-to-date combat training equipment such as the Multiple Integrated  Laser Engagement System (MILES) and imagery firing simulation training equipment will  be installed, and the training sites will be operated efficiently to minimize waiting time and  accommodate rotational training.  To ensure the economic activities of reservists who cannot attend training during  weekdays, the weekend training schedule has been expanded. A nationwide reserve force  training system[5] is operated in which reservists can be trained at the location of their choice.  Three major inconveniences in reserve force training system regarding meals, transpor­  tation, and training site amenities have also been improved.  To improve the quality of the meals provided, menus are continuously reflecting reservists’  tastes, and mobile food trucks are operated.  The transportation allowance was increased from 4,000 won in 2012 to 5,000 won in 2014,  and the transportation allowance for roll call participants is also paid for. The training  allowance for reserve force training participants will be increased annually and will be at  30,000 won by 2018. For additional training, the training allowance will be paid with consid­  eration of the active duty officer’s salary.  Reservist amenities have been improved by renovating old reservist cafeterias and  installing exercise equipment and amenities in reserve force training sites so that local  residents can also use them.  The conditions and environment for reserve force training will be improved through  political efforts and budget allocation so that the reservists can solely concentrate on the  training.  5 This is a system to allow reservists to be able to train at reserve force training sites in other locations when there is an occupational or  other reason.",page,101,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43410,"**2. Enhancing War Sustainment Capability**  **| Procurement Innovation | Procurement innovation is pursued to stably supply**  high-quality military materials in due time and at an appropriate price for each unit. Practice  assignments were derived by conducting management diagnosis for defense force  management in 2013. Starting in 2014, those assignments are carried out with pilot projects  by launching the Logistics Innovation Committee.  To smoothly procure repair parts from overseas, vendors are systematically managed from  the weapon system acquisition step, and the process is improved by identifying the cause for  items that were not procured.  The military has greatly expanded the scope of military specifications disclosure, which  can be an entry barrier for new vendors, so that many vendors can participate in the  procurement.  The military has also diversified contract methods to suit the characteristics of each item.  To stably procure military materials at the appropriate time, “long-term consecutive  contracts”[6] have been expanded, and a “multiple award schedule (MAS)”[7] is applied to  supply appropriate products for the demanding forces. To stably supply repair parts, a  “performance-added basic ordering agreement (PABOA) system”[8] is also applied.  Based on the results of the pilot projects, the procurement goals will be specified to expand  to full scale starting in 2015.  **| Improvement of Maintenance Support System | As weapon systems get more**  high-tech, precise and complex, it is necessary to establish a national maintenance support  system that integrates civilian and military assets. By utilizing the specialized maintenance  capabilities of the military and private sector, the military can prevent overlapping  investments and improve maintenance efficiency, and thus the continuous growth of the  defense industry will be made possible once the private sector connects production and  maintenance. To accomplish this, the military has adopted various advanced systems and  utilizes civilian resources.  6 This is a contract system in accordance with Article 21 of the Act on Contracts to which the State is a Party, in which annual plans are  established for products manufactured for several years to decide the entire project scale at the time of the contract and order the products each year within the budget for the year.  7 This is a contract system in accordance with Article 46 of the Defense Acquisition Program Act, in which, at the time of procuring  military materials, the contracting agency has to conclude unit price contracts with two or more vendors that supply the same or similar products with the same or similar quality and function. Then, the demanding forces select the product and the selected vendor supplies the products.  8 This is a system in which, at the time of concluding a contract to supply repair parts for a weapon system, a contract term no longer  than five years and a limited budget are set, and the military orders the repair parts as needed within the set budget. The vendors are rewarded based on their supply performance.",page,102,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43411,"First, the Performance-Based Logistics (PBL) system[9] is expanded. The result of using the  system from 2010 to 2013 showed that the procurement period for repair parts was reduced.  Therefore, in 2014, the application range of the system, which was mainly used for air  weapon systems, was expanded to ground and naval equipment such as the Cheonma  detection and tracking equipment. Also, as it was applied in the management and  maintenance steps after the acquisition of weapon systems, its efficiency is now increased by  being applied to the acquisition step. It was first applied for FA-50 light attack aircraft, and it  will be expanded to major weapon systems that will be acquired in the future.  Second, management of “field maintenance support centers” is pursued for prompt  maintenance support in areas where major combat units are concentrated by utilizing the  technology and resources of private maintenance service companies. Companies have been  invited for the pilot project and target equipment was selected in 2014, and in 2015, the  military plans to operate a pilot maintenance facility in the northern Gyeonggi-do area.  Based on the results of the pilot project, the rates of combat equipment operation will be  improved by additionally establishing such facilities in Gangwon-do; it will also contribute  to vitalizing the local economy. The management concept of the field maintenance support  centers is shown in Chart 4-12.  **Chart 4-12.

The results of support are evaluated and contractors are rewarded based on their performance.",page,103,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43412,"Third, to mitigate problems regarding the acquisition, operation, and inventory  management of repair parts, the repair part operation system has undergone thorough  innovation since 2014. To precisely estimate the demand for repair parts, a requirement  estimation model will be developed by 2016 for each type of equipment with scientific  methodology for use. The developed model has been tested after verification since 2014, and  the equipment to which it is applied will gradually be expanded. In order to reduce the total  amount of the repair part stock and respond to changes in demand more effectively, a system  of central control and regulation of inventory in real time is established by resetting the  inventory level for each item and managing the records of each repair part.  In the future, a national maintenance support system will be established to support the  weapon system development trend, and the repair part operation system will be innovated to  increase rates of equipment operation and ensure combat strength.  **| Improvement of User-oriented Military Logistics System | To enhance war**  sustainment capability, the logistics system is important to provide support at the right time  to meet the demands of the combat units. The MND pursues various policies to improve the  system.  First, the supply time for the user, combat units, has been significantly reduced. The  Logistics Command directly supplies military materials to each division, and the division  gathers and delivers the logistics requests of the regiments. Therefore, the supply support  system has been simplified from the existing four or five steps to two or three steps. This  will reduce the average user waiting time from nine to 15 days to two to seven days.  Second, the MND plans on establishing a “field management automation system for  logistics materials” by 2016 and an “integrated logistics information system” by 2017 to  monitor logistics assets such as equipment, material, and ammunition in real time. In 2014,  phase one of a pilot project was conducted with the First Logistics Support Command and  the Second Corps of the Army, and phase two will be pursued with one Navy fleet and one  Air Force wing in 2015. The MND plans to pursue this across the armed forces in 2016 by  supplementing the related systems based on the results of the pilot project. The field  management automation system for logistics materials is a system that reduces processing  time by applying barcode scanning and mobile technology in the process of import,  inspection, storage and release. The integrated logistics information system combines  equipment maintenance, defense materials, and the Defense Ammunition Information  System for the Army, Navy, and Air Force; it can be used from the MND to company/",page,104,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43413,"squadron-level units. Fifteen logistics work areas[10] will be standardized and applied to the  system, and various functions such as wartime and peacetime situation conversion will be  included. The concept layout of the integrated logistics information system is shown in Chart  4-13.  **Chart 4-13.

This is a system where  the user unit sends requests directly to the vendor to receive military supplies. The result of  using this system showed that the waiting time for user units has been reduced from 17-25  days to nine days on average. By receiving high-quality supplies, the satisfaction of the units  was increased, and the exhaustion of inventory and passing of expiration dates could be  avoided by requesting the amounts needed by the units. The MND will continuously expand  the application scope and number of items to enhance the effect of the prime vendor system.  In the future, the MND plans to continuously supplement various policies and systems  such as improving the military logistics system and expanding the prime vendor system to  maximize the military’s combat readiness posture and war sustainment capability.  10 Requirements, planning and budgets, procurement, funds, properties, payments, transportation,  storage, inspections and tests, equipment operation, maintenance and management, disposal handling, command evaluations, common support, and lists and specifications.

43414,"**| Force Support System Development | Force support systems[11] occupy 92% of military**  logistics, but do not keep up with the development speed of weapon systems.  First, in order to establish an agency that can carry out systematic research and  development for force support systems, the groundwork has been in progress by a dedicated  organization since 2013.  The “Force Support System Acquisition Guidance” and the “Defense Force Support System  Project Plan” were published in 2013 to simplify the work process and reinforce the  connection between the requirement planning and budget compilation of the force support  systems.  Joint cooperative projects, including mountain bikes, aviation clothing, and the  establishment of an avian control system, have been conducted with related agencies such as  the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy and the Small and Medium Business Adminis­  tration. By holding force support system development conferences since 2009, industry-aca­  demic-research institution cooperation has been reinforced.  In the future, the quality of the force support systems will be improved by adopting sophis­  ticated civilian technology, and improvement efforts such as fielding a force support system  at the right time will be reinforced.  **| Reinforcing International Logistics Cooperation | To enhance war sustainment**  capability, there is a need not only to use domestic military and civilian resources efficiently,  but also to secure endorsements and support from allies and friendly nations. In order to do  so, the MND has reinforced the reciprocal logistics cooperation relationship with the United  States according to security environment changes on the Korean Peninsula. The ROK-U.S.  Logistics Cooperation Committee (LCC), which is a subcommittee of the Security Consul­  tative Meeting (SCM), has served as a way to reinforce cooperation and discuss matters  regarding logistics, such as repair parts, ammunition, and fuel support, for both countries  since it was held for the first time in 1979. The 45[th] meeting was in 2014.  In 1991, the ROK and the United States concluded the Umbrella Agreement between the  ROK and U.S. concerning Wartime Host Nation Support (WHNS UA) to increase the  defense capability on the Korean Peninsula by supporting the rapid deployment of U.S.  augmentation forces during wartime. Both countries are also pursuing the conclusion of the  Memorandum of Agreement between the ROK and U.S. concerning Wartime Host Nation  Support (WHNS MOA) to specify the responsibilities of defense cost sharing, etc.  11 All elements to support the combat performance of troops and weapons (other than weapon systems), such as equipment, materials,  general facilities, resource management, and base system software.

Therefore, the MND develops  a defense informatization development framework and establishes a sophisticated information and  communications infrastructure and information system. To respond effectively against cyber threats,  cyber security capability is also reinforced.   **1. Developing Defense Informatization System and Introducing Advanced Infor­** **mation Technology**  **| Improvement of Defense Informatization Planning Documents and Instructions |**  The MND revised the “Defense Informatization Basic Plan” in March 2014, reflecting the  direction of defense informatization, changing security environments and ICT development  trends. The plan is the highest-level planning document based on the Act on Establishment of  Infrastructure for Informatization of National Defense and Management of Informational  Resources for National Defense (Defense Informatization Act) enacted in 2010, providing the  direction of development for mid- to long-term defense informatization.  According to the Defense Informatization Act, a “Defense Informatization Implementation  Plan” has been established every year since 2012 to carry out informatization projects. This  plan, based on the Defense Informatization Basic Plan and the defense budget operation plan,  is the budget execution plan for the year when it was established.  The Directive for Defense Informatization Affairs, which was issued in 2011 to establish  the operational procedures and standards required for implementing the Defense Informati­  zation Act, was revised in July 2014 to improve it according to the performance results and  internal and external environmental changes.

The Defense Experiment project is done to introduce new civilian IT in the defense area  and distribute it to all the military by phase after evaluating its appropriateness. Since 2007,  three or four tasks have been selected and processed every year.  In April 2012, the MND concluded a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of  Knowledge and Economy (now the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning) to carry  forward the government-wide IT Convergence R&D Cooperation project. The MND  discovers the target objective tasks; the military tests and evaluates the developed  technology; and the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning supports the budget.  Currently, four tasks, including “simulation development for the tactical proficiency of small  units,” are being pursued.  To respond promptly to IT convergence paradigm changes and to improve expertise and  efficiency in the area of new IT, organizations dedicated to defense IT convergence and  technology support organizations specializing in new IT were designated and have been  operating since 2013.  In the future, pilot projects will be pushed forward by discovering new services for the  convergence of new ICT with national defense, such as the Internet of Things,[1] cloud  computing, big data[2] and mobile technology, with enhanced security to realize a “Creative  Defense.”  **2.

43419,"The Military Broadband Convergence Network (MBCN), established in 2011, has been  optimized and developed into a system maintained and managed by an expert operator.  Based on this, wired information communication networks will be consolidated by phase to  become a unified system.  A project to consolidate defense information resources, such as the servers and application  systems distributed in the Army, Navy, and Air Force as well as in government agencies, was  completed in December 2014, and it enabled more efficient management for information  resources. In particular, by establishing facilities with ensured survivability, such as  quakeproof and security functions, dualization and robust data protection, a stable informati­  zation service can be provided in both peacetime and wartime.  In the future, reflecting the trends in ICT development, a cloud computing environment  will be established and developed into a wireless- and mobile-oriented information  communication environment.  **| Establishing Information Systems and Ensuring Interoperability | Defense informa­**  tization contributes to the realization of the national defense vision and objectives by  developing information systems for the battlefield and resource management areas. The  resource management information system focuses on new developments and upgrades based  on defense architecture. In the future, it is planned to be developed focusing on services  based on the integrated environment of defense computing resources. The battlefield  management information system will be continuously upgraded by identifying improvement  requirements for each function. It also prepares for the wartime operational control  (OPCON) transition to include the ROK military-led Allied Korea Joint Command and  Control System (AKJCCS).  In order to ensure interoperability among all battlefield elements, the MND is establishing  an authentication test evaluation system and securing necessary expertise with a goal to  activate the interoperability evaluation authentication system based on international  standards by 2016. To achieve this goal, a master plan was designed in June 2013, and the  “Joint Interoperability Technology Center,” which is an executing organization for interoper­  ability test evaluation, was designated in September 2013 as the military executive agency;  thus, the necessary expertise and independence were achieved.

The MND has prepared a systematic foundation to respond against cyber threats by  establishing the Cyber Security Master Plan of National Defense and adopting the “Cyber  Security Assessment of National Defense” system to protect cyberspace.  The security mission execution system of the Computer Emergency Response Team  (CERT)[5] is developed for each echelon, and a customized educational system and cyber  simulation training center is operated to reinforce the expertise of the CERT personnel.  To reinforce international cooperation against transnational cyber threats, an MOU on  Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense between the ROK and the United  States has been concluded, and information exchange and cooperation with friendly nations,  such as the ROK-Australia Information Communication Technology Forum, is also actively  promoted.  In the future, a multi-layered cyber security strategy will be developed in connection with  network-centric operations, and cyber security measures will be prepared in advance to  utilize advanced information technology in a timely manner.  **| Sophistication of Information Protection Systems | The MND continuously improves**  its multi-level and multi-layered protection systems, such as antivirus systems, to protect  systems from cyber threats during peacetime and wartime.  In 2013, the control over major servers and networks was reinforced by establishing a  real-time cyber threat response system, and in 2014, personal data protection software and  encoding systems were supplemented. In particular, to prepare against the possible abuse of  smart phones due to their wide use, measures have been established to prevent military data  leakage through communication devices.  A strategy to rapidly develop and apply core cyber security technologies specialized for  defense is developed, and efforts are made to secure the required budget.  5 The CERT is an organization that prevents or instantly responds to computer or network emergencies with a comprehensive control  system for information protection.",page,112,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

The ROK and the United States reinforce their collective defense endeav­  ors and cope jointly with transnational security threats such as cyber threats and weapons of mass  destruction (WMD) based on the principles of the ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty, thereby contributing to  world peace and stability. In addition, the two nations pursue various initiatives to not only ensure a stable  stationing environment for the U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) but also enhance mutual understanding between  the ROK and the United States. In the future, the ROK-U.S. Alliance will be further developed based on the  trust that has continued from the past.  **1. Developing into a Comprehensive Strategic Alliance**  **| Actualization of a Vision for the ROK-U.S. Alliance | The ROK-U.S. Alliance dawned**  during the Korean War, and it is based on the ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty, which was  concluded in October 1953 between the Republic of Korea and the United States. For over 60  years, the ROK-U.S. Alliance has been a firm foundation and driving force for the ROK to  achieve a liberal democracy and economic prosperity in the face of persistent North Korean  threats and provocations.  As an alliance forged in blood through the Korean War, the ROK and the United States  have been partners for prosperity for more than 60 years as “valued allies” that now  transcend a military alliance. The ROK-U.S. Alliance has been the foundation for peace and  prosperity not only on the Korean Peninsula, but also in the Asia-Pacific region and the  world. Today, the Alliance has been upgraded to a comprehensive strategic alliance that goes  beyond security cooperation based on a broad range of cooperation in politics, economy,  culture, and personnel exchanges.  The “Joint Vision for the ROK-U.S. Alliance” of 2009 was a key initiative that developed  the ROK-U.S. Alliance into a comprehensive alliance. The ROK and the United States  decided to pursue cooperation that incorporates military, diplomacy, security, economy,  society, and culture in a mutually beneficial manner while sharing common values such as  liberal democracy, human rights and a market economy. In addition, they reached an  agreement to develop the Alliance so that it contributes to the peace and prosperity of not",page,116,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

In 2010, based on the Joint Vision for the ROK-U.S. Alliance and the ROK-U.S. Mutual  Defense Treaty, the “Guidelines for ROK-U.S. Defense Cooperation” was concluded to  pursue the joint vision. The ROK-U.S. Alliance serves as a linchpin not only for the stability  of the Korean Peninsula, but also for peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and the  ROK and the United States will keep on improving the Alliance so that it is capable of  responding to the new security challenges of the 21[st] century.  To commemorate the 60[th] anniversary of the  ROK-U.S. Alliance, President Park Geun-hye  and President Barack Obama held a summit on  May 7, 2013, and adopted a joint declaration to  celebrate the 60 years of the Alliance and joint  prosperity between the ROK and the United  States.

The ROK and the United States share information and reinforce exchanges in cyber policy,  strategy, doctrine and training by concluding the Terms of Reference for the ROK-U.S. Cyber  Cooperation Working Group in 2012. Also, the Terms of Reference for ROK-U.S. Defense  Space Cooperation was concluded in 2012 to enhance the cooperation of both countries for  defense space capability reinforcement.  The Alliance’s geographical scope of cooperation also expands to East Asia and to the  world. In East Asia, the ROK and the United States cooperate not only in humanitarian  assistance and disaster relief, but also in reinforcing regional security cooperation, such as  the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus).  Nuclear security summits, combined counter-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden,  ROK-U.S. combined search and rescue exercises, PSI exercises, and cooperation in  peacekeeping operations are also conducted.  Also, the ROK and the United States will contribute to the peace and stability of Northeast  Asia and the world by continuously expanding the areas of cooperation for the Alliance.  **2. Maintaining a Firm ROK-U.S. Combined Defense Posture**  The purpose of the existence of the ROK-U.S. Alliance is to deter North Korean  provocations and maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula. The militaries of the two  countries maintain a combined defense posture that deters North Korean provocations and  aggression, and defeats provocations when they occur.  The military forces of both countries respond to North Korean threats by categorizing  them into peacetime threats, local provocations, aggression, and asymmetric provocations.  In peacetime, the ROK and the United States develops plans for operations while  reinforcing combined exercises. To maintain an effective combined defense posture, they  operate various consultative bodies such as the Security Consultative Meeting (SCM),  Korea-U.S. Integrated Defense Dialogue (KIDD),[3] and the ROK-U.S. Military Committee  Meeting (MCM).[4]  The ROK-U.S. militaries develop operational plans and gain proficiency in these plans  through combined exercises to prepare against local provocations.

The ROK and the United States completed the “ROK-U.S. Combined  Counter-Provocation Plan (CPP)” in March 2013 to rapidly and effectively respond to North  Korea’s local provocations. ROK-U.S. combined exercises are also conducted regularly,  applying the most realistic scenarios to manage and respond to any crisis.  From March to April in 2013, immediately after North Korea’s third nuclear test, strategic  deterrence was achieved by rapidly deploying B-2 and B-52 strategic bombers, F-22  fifth-generation fighters, submarines, and aircraft carriers to the Korean Peninsula.  To prepare against aggression, the ROK and the United States continuously develop  combined operational plans, and carry out ROK-U.S. combined exercises annually to gain  proficiency in the plans and to verify the plans. The Key Resolve exercise and Foal Eagle  training, which are ROK-U.S. combined exercises, are performed in the first half of every year,  and the Ulchi Freedom Guardian (UFG) exercise is performed in the second half of every year.  The ROK and the United States have agreed to organize a ROK-U.S. combined division to  reinforce the tactical-level combined defense posture. The division will maintain a wartime  mission posture in peacetime by carrying out combined exercises and developing doctrines,  and executing various missions according to operational plans for wartime. The ROK-U.S.  combined division will contribute to the combined defense posture by vitalizing the  tactical-level combined exercises during peacetime, and will present an opportunity to  enhance the combined operations execution capabilities of the ROK military in the future.  The ROK and the United States decided to keep the USFK counter-fire forces north of the  Han River to respond more effectively to the intensifying threat posed by North Korean  long-range artillery. The USFK counter-fire forces will relocate to Camp Humphreys,  Pyeongtaek, when the ROK counter-fire forces reinforcement plan is completed and their  capabilities are verified. The ROK military plans to complete the reinforcement of its  counter-fire forces by the mid-2020s.  Additionally, the ROK and the United States prepare against the North Korean  provocations using asymmetric forces, including nuclear weapons and missiles. The United  States provides the ROK with extended deterrence by utilizing all spectrums of military  capabilities, including a nuclear umbrella, conventional strikes, and missile defense  capabilities against North Korean WMD threats. The ROK and the United States further  refined the extended deterrence strategy, and developed and signed the “Tailored Deterrence  Strategy” (TDS) prepared against North Korean nuclear and WMD threats in October 2013.  Based on this, the two countries enhance the reliability of the extended deterrence by  establishing tailored strategies for various North Korean WMD threats.  In the future, combined operational plans will be refined through regular combined  exercises and training, and the combined defense posture will be continuously reinforced by  stably managing alliance issues through various defense consultative bodies.",page,119,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

Ensuring a Stable Stationing Environment for United States Forces Korea**  **| USFK Base Relocation | USFK base relocation is a project that consolidates USFK**  bases scattered throughout the country into two hub bases in Pyeongtaek and Daegu. This is  designed to ensure the balanced development of the ROK territory and stable stationing  environment for the USFK.  The USFK base relocation project consists of two plans: the Yongsan Relocation Plan  (YRP)[5] for the relocation of the USFK headquarters in Yongsan to Pyeongtaek; and the Land  Partnership Plan (LPP)[6] for the relocation of the U.S. 2[nd] Infantry Division located in  Dongducheon and Uijeongbu to Pyeongtaek. According to the principles specifying that  relocation costs are to be paid by the requesting party, the relocation costs for the YRP are to  be paid by the ROK, and costs for the LPP are paid by the United States. In May 2003, the  two Presidents agreed to relocate the Yongsan Garrison earlier than planned, and the  execution of the plan took off at full scale after the “Agreement between the Republic of  Korea and the United States of America on the Relocation of United States Forces from the  Seoul Metropolitan Area” was concluded in 2004. Since the initiating of the LPP based on  the “Agreement between the Republic of Korea and the United States of America for the  Land Partnership Plan” in 2002 and the expansion of the relocation criteria through the  “Revised Agreement between the Republic of Korea and the United States of America for the  Land Partnership Plan” in 2004, the LPP has been on course in terms of implementation.  In March 2007, the ROK and the United States concluded a “Facility Master Plan” that  governs the relocation of major USFK bases such as the Yongsan Garrison and the U.S. 2[nd ]  Infantry Division to Pyeongtaek. At present, base foundation works and the construction of  infrastructure such as roads, electricity, gas and waterworks are either completed or in  progress, and many other construction projects are on plan. In accordance with the “Special  Act on Support, etc. for Pyeongtaek-si, etc. Following Relocation of U.S. Military Bases in  Korea,” the construction of residential support facilities and amenities including roads,  waterworks, sewerage facilities, and town halls for the residents in Pyeongtaek who were  displaced due to the relocation are also underway. In the process of relocating the USFK  bases, 51 bases have been returned to the ROK as of September 2014, and 29 additional bases  will be returned.  In the future, the ROK and the United States will pursue the project in a timely manner  while resolving any issues that could arise during the execution of the YRP and the LPP, as  both countries recognize the importance of relocating and returning USFK bases.  5 It was signed on October 26, 2004 by the ROK and the United States.  6 The ROK and the United States concluded a letter of intent during the 33[rd] Security Consultative Meeting held in 2001.",page,120,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43429,"**| Negotiations on Defense Burden Sharing | Defense burden sharing refers to the ROK**  government bearing a portion of the total stationing costs of the USFK, which plays an  important role in the defense of the Korean Peninsula. According to Article 5 of the Status of  Forces Agreement (SOFA) concluded by the ROK and the United States in 1966, the United  States is to bear the stationing costs of the USFK, and the ROK is to grant facilities and sites.  However, until 1991, the United States not only covered the stationing costs but also provided  funds for the construction of necessary facilities in consideration of the economic situation of  the ROK at the time.  In 1991, the ROK and the United States concluded the Special Measures Agreement (SMA)  relating to Article 5 of the SOFA with the consideration of the financial conditions of the  ROK government, and since then, the ROK has been sharing a portion of the USFK’s  stationing costs.  The ROK and U.S. governments started the ninth SMA negotiations in May 2013. The two  countries came to an agreement in January 2014 with a comprehensive consideration of the  ROK’s financial capacity, ensuring a stable stationing environment for the USFK,  maintaining the combined defense posture, and enhancing accountability and transparency  in executing the burden sharing funds.  The effective period of the validity of the ninth SMA is five years, and in the first year of  enforcement, 2014, the total contribution was 920 billion won. In order to enhance  transparency and accountability in executing the burden sharing funds, the ROK and the  United States agreed on a comprehensive system improvement of the burden sharing  program.

43433,"**Section 2 Wartime OPCON Transition that** **Contributes to the Reinforcement of the** **ROK-U.S. Combined Defense Posture**  The ROK and the United States agreed on a “conditions-based wartime operational control transition”  during the 46[th] Security Consultative Meeting (SCM) held in Washington, D.C. on October 23, 2014. The  two countries will enhance the completeness of the wartime operational control (OPCON) transition by  establishing a new and strong combined defense system to deter war on the Korean Peninsula and ensure  the security of the ROK in contingencies until the wartime OPCON transition takes place.   **1. Background and History**  Discussions between the ROK and the United States on the transition of OPCON began in  the late 1980s. The ROK and the United States agreed at the 13[th] ROK-U.S. Military  Committee Meeting (MCM) in 1991 to transfer the armistice OPCON (peacetime OPCON)  over the ROK military sometime between 1993 and 1995. In 1993, the two countries agreed  to “transfer armistice OPCON over the ROK military units to the Chairman of the ROK Joint  Chiefs of Staff (JCS) as of December 1, 1994,” at the 15[th] MCM and the 25[th] SCM.  Consequently, armistice OPCON was transferred to the ROK military on December 1, 1994.  Discussions on the wartime OPCON transition began after the year 2000, to develop a  combined command structure which corresponds with the changed security environment  involving the growth of the ROK’s national power and the ROK military’s improved  capabilities, and U.S. military reform including that of the USFK.  Discussions on the wartime OPCON transition was fully initiated with an agreement to  accelerate discussions on command relations and wartime OPCON reached at the 37[th] SCM  on October 21, 2005. The ROK and the United States agreed on the basic principles for  wartime OPCON transition during a ROK-U.S. summit on September 16, 2006, and on  February 23, 2007, the ROK Defense Minister and the U.S. Secretary of Defense agreed on  the transfer date of April 17, 2012.  At a Permanent Military Committee (PMC) meeting on June 28, 2007, the Chairman of the",page,125,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43434,"ROK JCS and the Senior U.S. Military Officer Assigned to Korea (SUSMOAK) signed the  “Strategic Transition Plan” (STP)[1] to transfer wartime OPCON from the ROK-U.S. Combined  Forces Command (CFC) to the ROK JCS. The plan, approved by both the ROK Defense  Minister and the U.S. Secretary of Defense on November 7, at the 39[th] SCM, provided a  concrete basis for implementing wartime OPCON transition.  North Korea’s series of military provocations, including its second nuclear test and a  long-range missile launch in 2009 and the attack on the ROK Ship Cheonan in 2010,  heightened tension on the Korean Peninsula, and the instability of the North Korean regime  was deepened with the failure of their currency reform and deteriorating health of Kim  Jong-il. The year 2012 was a period of high volatility in terms of politics and security, with  leadership changes in several countries in the region, including the ROK. Against this  backdrop, there was growing public concern that the transition of wartime OPCON should be  postponed, and consequently, the ROK government raised the need to adjust the timing of the  wartime OPCON transition to the U.S. government. As a result, it was agreed at the ROK-U.S.  summit on June 26, 2010 that the timing of the wartime OPCON transition would be  readjusted from April 17, 2012 to December 1, 2015.  The ROK Minister of National Defense and the U.S. Secretary of Defense signed the  Strategic Alliance 2015 (SA 2015)[2] at the 42[nd] SCM in October 2010, which includes the  military actions for the wartime OPCON transition and the development plan for alliance  initiatives.  Since then, the security situation on the Korean Peninsula has faced a new juncture with  North Korea’s continuous nuclear and missile threats, such as two long-range missile  launches in April and December 2012, and its third nuclear test in February 2013. Concern  about the potential of a misjudgment by Kim Jong-un’s regime if wartime OPCON was  transferred during such security situations was raised.  Therefore, at the 45[th] SCM on October 2,  2013, the two countries agreed that the ROK  and the United States would consult at a  working level to reach a final agreement in the  next SCM. By organizing a ROK-U.S. working  group, and through numerous consultations,  the final agreement was made to implement  the “conditions-based wartime operational 46[th] Security Consultative Meeting (October 2014)  1 This is a ROK-U.S. combined strategic document containing tasks and milestones leading up to the wartime OPCON transition.  2 This is a ROK-U.S. combined strategic document to replace the existing STP, which is the standard document for the wartime OPCON  transition.

Currently, the MND operates the Combined Defense Transformation Group (CDTG),  directly under the Chairman of the ROK JCS, to seamlessly pursue the tasks regarding the  wartime OPCON transition.  **Chart 5-4.

Major Progress**  Based on the SA 2015, the ROK and the United States systematically prepare for the  wartime OPCON transition in various areas such as planning, organization, capabilities and  systems, exercises and certification.  The ROK and the United States operates a whole-of-government “combined implemen­  tation governance system,” addressing not only the military aspects, but also alliance  initiatives, as shown in Chart 5-5. It is composed of three subcommittees which are military  transition, planning and policy, and alliance management. The implementation status of  related tasks is regularly evaluated at the subcommittees, the steering committee, the  Strategic Alliance Working Group (SAWG), the Military Committee (MC), and the SCM.",page,127,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

The progress in each area is summarized below.  **| Planning | The ROK and the United States are developing a MOA for Alliance Crisis**  Management which will be applied after the wartime OPCON transition to operate the  ROK-U.S. Alliance effectively in times of crisis on the Korean Peninsula. The operational  plans that will be applied in wartime are being developed under close consultation based on  the joint planning system and procedures agreed by the ROK and the United States.  **| Organization | A new alliance military command structure is established so that the**  ROK military is able to lead theater operations on the Korean Peninsula. At first, the ROK  and the United States decided to organize two theater commands, the ROK JCS and the  USFK, but perceived that a unified combined command structure with reinforced military  efficiency was needed. Accordingly, the concept of a future command structure where the  ROK military takes command was agreed to at the 45[th] SCM in October 2013. Based on this  agreement, the organization and command relations of the future combined theater command  and combined component commands are developed.  **| Capabilities and Systems | The ROK military secures the necessary critical military**  capabilities to lead the combined defense and has established a roadmap to accomplish this  initiative. The U.S. military agreed to continuously provide the required capabilities until the  ROK military is able to fully lead theater operations. The ROK military developed the Allied  Korea Joint Command and Control System (AKJCCS), which is required to lead combined  operations, and works to build interoperability between the AKJCSS and the ROK-U.S. C4I  systems.",page,128,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43437,"**| Exercises and Certification | The ROK and the United States will evaluate and**  supplement the mission readiness and capabilities of the future combined theater command  and combined component commands through combined exercises and certification, in which  the new future command structure is applied. The ROK military executes necessary tasks by  stages, such as building a Joint Warfighting Simulation Center, developing a theater-level  function model, and acquiring exercise experts to establish the foundation for combined  exercises led by the ROK JCS. A certification plan is also developed so that the ROK and  U.S. experts can jointly evaluate the new command system on its capability to perform the  actual missions.  **| Strategic Documents | When the wartime OPCON transition is executed, documents**  that regulate the new combined command structure and the ROK-U.S. strategic dialogue  system such as the SCM and MCM have to be newly prepared. Accordingly, the Terms of  Reference (TOR)[3] and Strategic Directive[4] No. 3 are being drafted to replace the old TOR  and Strategic Directive No. 2 which were drafted upon the armistice OPCON transition in  1994.   **| Alliance Initiatives | Major alliance initiatives include the relocation of USFK and**  strategic communications.[5] The relocation of USFK is implemented in two parts: the  Yongsan Relocation Plan (YRP) and the Land Partnership Plan (LPP), which consolidates  USFK facilities scattered throughout the country. Coordination meetings for strategic  communications are held every six months to update important agendas and main messages,  and a detailed quarterly implementation plan and evaluation system are established.  **3. Conditions-based Wartime Operational Control Transition**   In May 2013, the Presidents of the ROK and the United States agreed that the wartime  OPCON transition should proceed in a way that strengthens combined defense capability,  and the ROK MND officially proposed to the U.S. Department of Defense to revisit the  existing plan for the wartime OPCON transition, which is to be executed in 2015.  3 These are the strategic guidelines of the ROK Ministry of National Defense and U.S. Secretary of Defense to regulate the combined  defense system, being the highest-level strategic document sent down to the MC from the SCM.  4 This is a directive of strategic guidelines based on the Terms of Reference, and is a strategic document sent to the theater command  from the MC.  5 A joint effort to induce changes in awareness, belief, and actions of major players by using all elements and means of national power in  order to establish a favorable environment to reach the nation’s strategic objective.",page,129,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43438,"The major content of the proposal was to change the “time-based wartime OPCON  transition” to a “conditions-based” transition. “Conditions-based wartime OPCON transition”  means to decide the transition time according to whether or not the conditions both countries  agreed to are satisfied, rather than setting a specific date such as April 17, 2012, or December  1, 2015, as previously determined. In other words, both countries decided to execute the  wartime OPCON transition in a more stable manner by setting the ROK military’s military  readiness and security situations to lead the combined defense after the wartime OPCON  transition as conditions that need to be met.  In the 45[th] SCM in 2013, the ROK Defense Minister and U.S. Defense Secretary  emphasized that the combined defense posture has to be maintained strongly and thoroughly  with the systematic execution of wartime OPCON transition while focusing on the dynamic  security situations including North Korean nuclear and missile threats. Additionally, they  agreed to consult on the conditions and timing of transition.  In April 2014, the two Presidents of the ROK and the United States shared the  understanding that the timing for wartime OPCON transition can be reconsidered by  considering the security environment on the Korean Peninsula and in the region, and urged  their teams to continue to work hard to determine the appropriate timing and conditions. In  October of the same year, the ROK Ministry of National Defense and the U.S. Department of  Defense agreed to implement the conditions-based wartime OPCON transition while  developing the current ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command[6] to a new Future Command (tentative name)[7] led by the ROK military based on the Future Command Structure concept  at the 46[th] SCM. Also, they determined the mid-2020s to be the estimated date for securing  capabilities to meet the conditions for transition[8] as agreed by the ROK and the United  States, and decided that the National Authorities of the two countries will make the final  determination on the appropriate timing for the wartime OPCON transition based on the  assessment of the conditions and SCM’s recommendation.  The ROK and the United States have decided to jointly develop a new strategic document  prior to the 47[th] SCM in 2015 to replace the current SA 2015 in preparation for the future  wartime OPCON transition. Furthermore, the two countries decided to maintain CFC  headquarters, which was initially planned to be disestablished by December 1, 2015, at the  current Yongsan Garrison with an appropriate level of personnel and facilities until the  6 The Commander is a U.S. general, while the Deputy Commander is a ROK general.  7 The Commander is a ROK general, while the Deputy Commander is a U.S. general.  8 1) To secure the military capabilities required to lead the ROK-U.S. combined defense after the wartime OPCON transition.

43440,"**Section 3 Expansion of Defense Diplomacy** **and Cooperation**  The MND enhances peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia by pursuing bilat­  eral and multilateral cooperation with neighboring countries based on the ROK-U.S. Alliance. Also, the ROK  contributes to the global peace by expanding the boundaries of defense diplomacy to Southeast Asia, the  Middle East, Central and South America, and Africa, and by actively participating in multilateral security  consultative bodies.  **1. Enhancing Defense Exchanges and Cooperation with Neighboring Countries**  **| Defense Exchanges and Cooperation with Japan | The ROK and Japan share the basic**  values of liberal democracy and a market economy, and cooperate for the peace and  prosperity of not only the Northeast Asia region, but also the world.  The two countries have periodically held  defense minister-level meetings since 1994. In  the 14[th] meeting in 2009, the two countries  concluded the Letter of Intent on Defense  Exchanges between the Republic of Korea and  Japan. In the 15[th] meeting in 2011, the two  countries agreed to enhance cooperation to  respond to the North Korean provocations and ROK-Japan Vice Defense Ministers’ meeting (October 2014)  for humanitarian disaster relief. In the Seoul  Defense Dialogue (SDD) held in October 2014, the Vice Defense Ministers of the ROK and  Japan met to exchange opinions on defense exchanges and cooperation between the two  countries and agreed to keep making efforts for the stable development of the ROK-Japan  relationship.  In addition, the two countries are widening their understanding of each other through  defense policy talks, defense exchanges and cooperation talks, and security policy consul­  tative meetings. Academic exchanges are also made periodically. In December 2013, the",page,132,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43441,"eighth Search and Rescue Exercise (SAREX) was conducted to enhance cooperation in the  area of disaster relief.  However, some Japanese political leaders’ regressive perception of history and unjust claim  of dominion over Dokdo Island become obstacles to the future-oriented development of the  relationship between the two countries.  The MND will stringently respond to Japan’s unjust claims on Dokdo Island while contin­  uously cooperating in major security issues, including North Korean nuclear threats, for the  peace and stability of Northeast Asia.  **| Defense Exchanges and Cooperation with China | The ROK and China have**  developed their relationship[1] in various areas, such as politics, economy, society, and culture,  since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1992. In particular, ever since the  relationship was upgraded to a “strategic cooperative partnership” in May 2008, defense  exchanges and cooperation between the two countries have been more active.  In June 2013, President Park Geun-hye reaffirmed the principle of zero tolerance toward  North Korea’s nuclear weapons in a ROK-China summit with President Xi Jinping, and  ensured China’s support for the ROK’s policy towards North Korea. They have agreed to  establish a comprehensive and multi-layered strategic communication channel in the political  and security areas by adopting the “ROK-China Joint Statement for Future Vision.”  In June 2013, the Chairman of the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) visited China to meet  with the PLA Chief of General Staff of China. The Chairman of the ROK JCS visited the  Chinese fleet and inspected the hotline by using a direct phone line between the navies of  both countries.  In August 2013, using the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus) as an  opportunity, the ROK and Chinese Defense Ministers held a meeting. Both representatives  shared that peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula will be impossible as long as North  Korea possesses nuclear weapons, and they decided to continue on enhancing communi­  cation and cooperation for the stability of the region. During the third Defense Strategic  Dialogue in November 2013, future-oriented defense exchanges and cooperation  development measures, including a plan to expand military education and exchanges, were  discussed based on the perception that exchanges between young officers are the foundation  to improve defense and military relations for both countries. As a result, not only were  language courses opened for the partner country, but ROK military officers were also sent to   1 Friendly cooperative relationship (1992), Cooperative partnership (1998), Comprehensive cooperative relationship (2000),  Comprehensive cooperative partnership (2003), Strategic cooperative partnership (2008), Mature strategic cooperative partnership (2014).",page,133,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

In July 2014, the two countries held a  ROK-China summit in Seoul and laid out a  way ahead to establish a “mature strategic  cooperative partnership” through their joint  statement. By maintaining the stable  development of military relations between the  Signing the MOU for installing a direct phone line between the  two countries, they have decided to contribute two Defense Ministries (July 2014)  to the peace and stability of the region based on mutual understanding and trust. In July of  the same year, the two countries discussed a specific action plan regarding the issues agreed  upon during the summit through the fourth Defense Strategic Dialogue held in Beijing. As a  result, an MOU was concluded to install a direct phone line between the defense ministries  of both countries, and mutual exchange visits of young officers from the ROK and China  were carried out. During the ROK-China summit held in Beijing in November 2014, they  agreed to pursue joint efforts for the denuclearization of North Korea.  Additionally, in 2014, ROK-China relations are being improved by expanding exchanges in  various areas, such as the repatriation of Chinese soldiers’ remains, the first visiting  performance of the Korean National Military Symphony to China, meetings between JCS  strategic branches, exchange visits between ROK-China military athletic squads, and  exchanges by military research and education institutes.  The ROK MND will strive to contribute to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula  and in Northeast Asia by continuously expanding defense exchanges and cooperation with  China to satisfy the mature strategic cooperative partnership between the ROK and China.  **| Defense Cooperation with Russia | Since the beginning of diplomatic relations in**  1990, the relationship between the ROK and Russia[2] has improved in a wide array of areas  such as politics, economy, energy, science and technology. Ever since the two countries’  relationship was elevated to a “strategic cooperative partnership” in 2008, the ROK and  Russia have been strengthening their cooperation to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue  and to enhance the substantive cooperation between the ROK and Russia through the  Nuclear Security Summit in March 2012, the G20 Summit in September 2013, and the  bilateral summit held in Seoul in November 2013.

43443,"understanding on the need for expanding  military cooperation, and continue discussions  to conclude a military cooperation agreement  that can systematically support it.  In the ROK-Russia summit in 2013, both  countries came to an understanding that active  coordination to pursue defense technology  cooperation is necessary, with the perception  ROK-Russia Vice Defense Ministers’ meeting (October 2013)  that bilateral defense technology cooperation  is an important mission to support the relationship between the two countries.  To enhance trust between the two countries, the ROK and Russia are expanding exchanges  of senior-level personnel. In particular, the visit of the ROK Vice Minister of National  Defense to Russia in October 2013 was the first military senior-level visit in four years, and  was an opportunity to reinforce strategic communications regarding military cooperation.  In addition, through JCS chief director-level dialogue and joint military committee  meetings, the two countries enhance mutual understanding, continue to develop their  military cooperation relationship at the working level, and broaden the scope of their  understanding through exchanges between units and commissioned education.  The ROK MND will develop the relationship between the two countries to one that can  contribute to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia by  expanding defense exchange cooperation with Russia and enhancing the friendship between  the two countries.  **2. Expanding Defense Exchanges and Cooperation with Key Countries in Each** **Region**   **| Southeast Asia and Oceania | The ROK MND actively pursues senior-level military**  exchanges, defense industry exports and cooperation with countries in Southeast Asia and  Oceania.  President Park Geun-hye visited Vietnam in September 2013, and had a summit with  Vietnamese President Truong Tan Sang. In this summit, the two Presidents agreed to  enhance defense cooperation by regularly holding a defense strategic dialogue and expanding  defense industry cooperation. In March 2014, cooperation enhancement measures with  regard to new security issues such as defense industry cooperation expansion, and cyber  security and peacekeeping operations were discussed in a ROK-Vietnam Defense Ministers’  dialogue. In July of the same year, measures to vitalize defense exchanges and cooperation",page,135,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43444,"and defense industry cooperation were discussed in the third ROK-Vietnam Defense  Strategic Dialogue. In this meeting, a legal and systematic foundation for exchanges and  cooperation which will actively progress between the two countries in the future was  established by signing the ROK-Vietnam MOU on the Protection of Classified Military  Information.  Taking the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in October 2013 as an  opportunity, President Park Geun-hye visited Indonesia and held a summit with President  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. The two Presidents discussed the smooth progress of current  export projects such as Korean advanced trainers and submarines, and measures to expand  defense industry cooperation between the two countries. In particular, by concluding the  ROK-Indonesia Defense Cooperation Agreement, a systematic foundation for the national  defense and defense industry cooperation of both countries was established.  The ROK and Philippines concluded the MOU on Defense Cooperation during President  Benigno Aquino’s visit to Korea in October 2013. Accordingly, in December 2013, the ROK  Araw Contingent was deployed to support the Philippines in typhoon damage recovery, and  12 FA-50 light attack aircraft were exported to the Philippines in March 2014.  To expand the scope of defense diplomacy, defense exchanges and cooperation are  expanded with the ASEAN countries, such as Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos. In particular,  during the ROK-Singapore Defense Strategic Dialogue in October 2013, support for the  ROK’s policy towards North Korea was reaffirmed, and both sides agreed to continue with  maritime security cooperation, including the cooperation for counter-piracy activities in the  Gulf of Aden in Somalia.  The first ROK-Australia Foreign and Defense Ministers’ Meeting (2+2 meeting) in July  2013 upgraded the diplomacy and security cooperation with Australia to the next level. After  the meeting, the two countries’ Foreign and Defense Ministers presented a joint statement  whose main contents were on holding the meeting biannually, and expanding bilateral and  multilateral cooperation with major countries in the region. In the ROK-Australia summit in  April 2014, the Vision Statement for a Safe, Peaceful and Prosperous Future between ROK  and Australia was announced, thereby proposing a future way ahead for cooperation between  the two countries in the areas of diplomacy and security. Also, in October 2014 in the third  ROK-Australia Defense Ministers’ meeting, both Ministers had a discussion regarding the  vitalization of combined exercises and military education exchanges, cooperation in interna­  tional peacekeeping operations, and defense industry cooperation. In the future, the two  countries will strengthen mutual assistance to respond to issues on the Korean Peninsula and  in the region, and put forward efforts to substantively cooperate in the areas of national  defense and the defense industry.

By enhancing  cooperation with the Southeast Asian countries that are members of ASEAN in the area of  defense, the ROK actively takes part in joint efforts to safeguard the peace and stability in  the region.  **| Southwest Asia | The ROK government revitalizes its national defense and defense**  industry exchanges and cooperation with Southwest Asian nations such as India and Pakistan  through Korea National Defense University graduate student exchange visits, commissioned  education programs, and joint defense industry and logistics committees.  In January 2014, President Park Geun-hye visited India and held a summit with Indian  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The two leaders agreed to pursue mutually beneficial  defense industry cooperation and prepared to establish military confidence by concluding a  General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA). After the inauguration of  the government of Narendra Modi, using the East Asia Summit in November 2014 as an  opportunity, the ROK and India decided to enhance defense cooperation in comprehensive  areas, such as security, nuclear energy, the defense industry, and science and technology  during a summit held in Myanmar.  The ROK MND will continuously pursue the exchanges of senior-level officials and  regular meetings with Southwest Asian countries, expand understanding in areas of mutual  interest, and elevate the level of cooperation to a more substantive one beyond the current  level of exchanges.   **| Central Asia | Most Central Asian countries became part of the Commonwealth of**  Independent States (CIS)[3] after achieving their independence from the former USSR. The  Central Asian countries have achieved political stability and economic growth by reorga­  nizing national systems for over 20 years after their independence, and their defense  cooperation with the ROK has significantly improved after bilateral diplomatic relations were  established.  The ROK and Kazakhstan concluded an MOU on Defense Exchanges and Cooperation in  September 2010, and held defense policy talks in Astana, Kazakhstan in November 2011 and  in Seoul in November 2012.  The ROK and Uzbekistan concluded an MOU on Defense Industry and Logistics  Cooperation in February 2010 which strengthened cooperative relations by expanding the  opportunities for ROK companies to enter the Uzbekistan defense industry market.

An MOU on Defense Exchanges and Cooperation was concluded with Azerbaijan in  December 2013 to establish a foundation to enhance defense exchanges and cooperation.  Defense exchanges and cooperation have also been expanded with Mongolia in various  areas, including personnel, education and academic exchanges, and participation in the  Khaan Quest exercise.[4]  **| The Middle East | The Middle East is a critical region for securing energy resources and**  for potential contracts for major national projects such as defense industry exports and  reconstruction projects. As the importance of cooperation with Middle Eastern countries is  increasing, national defense and defense industry cooperation is being expanded.  In February 2013, the ROK Defense Minister visited Saudi Arabia and established a  foundation for defense cooperation by concluding the ROK-Saudi Arabia Defense  Cooperation Agreement. In May 2013, the Commander of the Saudi Arabian Army visited  Korea and discussed measures to expand military exchanges and cooperation for the two  countries with the ROK Vice Defense Minister. In September, the representatives of the  Ministry of National Guard of Saudi Arabia visited Korea, discussed measures with the ROK  military, and visited the Special Warfare Command and defense industry companies.  In October 2013, the Vice Defense Minister of Libya attended the Seoul International  Aerospace & Defense Exhibition (ADEX), discussed opening a Libyan military attaché  office in Korea, and agreed to expand defense industry cooperation. It was also decided to  conclude an MOU on Defense Industry and Logistics Cooperation.  As the recent security environment in the Middle East is worsening, major countries in the  Gulf region such as the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia desire to expand  exchanges and cooperation with the ROK in the area of special warfare. The ROK also  expands defense cooperation in many ways, such as transferring the ROK military’s  advanced systems through personnel exchanges.  **| Europe | The ROK is developing amicable and cooperative relations with traditional**  friendly Western European nations to stably secure international support for security issues  on the Korean Peninsula. Moreover, the ROK is substantively expanding defense cooperation  with Eastern and Northern European nations.  In April 2013, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Secretary General of NATO, visited Korea and  4 This was a bilateral exercise of the United States and Mongolia but became a multilateral exercise in 2006.

In May, the Deputy Commander in Chief of Turkey visited Korea  and reaffirmed the traditional friendship between the ROK and Turkey.  In particular, in 2013, talks with senior officials from numerous European nations took  place on the occasion of various events, such as the ADEX and the Seoul Defense Dialogue (SDD). In October, when the President of Poland visited Korea, the Vice Defense Minister of  Poland accompanied the President and signed the ROK-Poland Defense Cooperation  Agreement. In November, the Defense Minister of Hungary visited Korea and discussed  measures for defense industry cooperation.  In October 2014, taking the third SDD as an opportunity, the ROK exchanged opinions on  global security issues, including the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia, with the Deputy  Secretary General of NATO Alexander Vershbow and officials from the European Union’s  European External Action Service.  The ROK held regular defense policy talks with Germany and the United Kingdom in  February and November 2014, respectively, to solidify the friendly and amicable relations  with both countries.  In June 2013, the Defense Ministers of Norway and the ROK exchanged opinions  regarding the Northern Sea Route. In September, the Vice Defense Minister of Finland  visited Korea for the first time to commemorate the 40[th] anniversary of the opening of  ROK-Finland diplomatic relations and discussed measures for defense exchanges and  cooperation with the ROK Vice Defense Minister. In December 2013, opinions regarding  education exchanges and an MOU on Defense Industry and Logistics Cooperation were  exchanged during the fourth ROK-Sweden defense policy talks.  **| Central and South America and Canada | Since Central and South America and**  Canada are achieving continuous economic growth based on their abundant resources,  exchanges and cooperation in the defense industry area are expected to be expanded.  During the second ROK-Columbia defense policy meeting in July 2013, the Vice Defense  Ministers of the two countries agreed to proceed with cooperation in various areas such as  cyber security, mine and explosives removal, and information exchanges regarding logistics.  In November 2013, the Defense Minister of Peru visited Korea to participate in the  ROK-Peru Defense Ministers’ dialogue and the first ROK-Peru defense policy meeting. His  visit to Korea was more meaningful because it occurred on the 50[th] anniversary of diplomatic  relations between the two countries. Both Defense Ministers agreed to develop national  defense and defense industry cooperation, including the KT-1 aircraft export project.

The ROK MND will pursue diverse cooperation in the areas of defense and the defense  industry with major countries in the region as a future-oriented partner.  **| Africa | Africa is receiving much global attention as a supplier of natural and energy**  resources.  The ROK MND discussed measures to enhance national defense and defense industry  cooperation with the Defense Minister and the Vice Defense Minister of Botswana when  they visited Korea in October 2013 to attend the ADEX. In November 2013, the ROK defense  cooperation agency visited Botswana to hold a working-level meeting for national defense  and defense industry cooperation and materialized the discussion in detail. In February 2014,  Botswana announced to the international community its intent to sever all diplomatic  relations with North Korea by quoting the UN Report on Human Rights in North Korea.  The ROK MND will pursue the establishment of a foundation for defense exchanges and  cooperation with major African countries while considering the internal situations of Africa  and global views.  **3. Multilateral Security Cooperation**  Various multilateral security cooperation activities are underway to establish peace and  stability in the region through the enhancement of defense cooperation among the countries  in the region. Currently, to induce the active participation of related countries, cooperation  activities are being pursued starting in areas with common security interests in which it is  comparatively easy to develop a common understanding on the need for cooperation. In  particular, multilateral security cooperation is actively being developed centering around  transnational and non-military security threats such as terrorism, piracy, and large-scale  natural disasters.  Since 2013, the ROK MND has expanded its domain of multilateral security cooperation  by attending the Halifax International Security Forum (HISF),[5] which is the largest  multilateral security cooperation consultative group in North America, while actively partic­  ipating in regional multilateral security cooperation activities to garner support for the  security policy of the ROK.

The SDD discusses security issues that arise every  year, with the slogan “Cooperation for Security and Peace.”  The second SDD was held from November 11 to 13, 2013. The number of participating  countries increased by six compared to 2012 as 20 countries and three international organi­  zations participated during the second SDD, and it contributed to peace on the Korean  Peninsula by enhancing the understanding and cooperation of the international community  towards the security situation on the Korean Peninsula.  The third SDD was held from October 29 to 31, 2014, and 24 countries and three interna­  tional organizations participated. Under the key theme “From Conflict to Cooperation:  Measures for Trust-building among Asia-Pacific Countries.” The third SDD was organized  with five different agendas: The unification of the Korean Peninsula, conflict prevention,  humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, maritime security, and cyber security. In  particular in 2014, a Cyber Working Group was officially introduced to establish a  foundation as a multilateral security cooperation dialogue platform in the area of cyber  security in the Asia-Pacific region.  The success of the third SDD allowed the SDD to consolidate its stature as a multilateral  security dialogue platform participated by vice defense minister-level officials of the  Asia-Pacific region.

Through bilateral meetings with major countries such as the United States, the ROK  Defense Minister discussed measures for national defense and defense industry cooperation  and enhanced the international community’s understanding of the situation on the Korean  Peninsula. In the 12[th] and 13[th] security summits held in 2013 and 2014, respectively, the ROK  Defense Minister explained the security situation on the Korean Peninsula to the represen­  tatives of participating countries and secured the international community’s support for the  ROK government’s policy towards North Korea.  **| ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus | The ROK Defense Minister has been**  attending the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus) since it was first held  in Hanoi, Vietnam in October 2010.  During the second ADMM-Plus in August 2013, the ROK Defense Minister emphasized  the importance of multilateral security cooperation among countries in the region and the  denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula under the theme of “the development of regional  multilateral security cooperation and security situations on the Korean Peninsula.” A  document expressing the resolute will of the international community towards the “denucle­  arization of North Korea and compliance with the UN Security Council’s resolutions” was  unanimously adopted for the Chairman’s statement; it was an opportunity to reaffirm the  international community’s resolve to denuclearize North Korea.  **| Other Multilateral Security Cooperative Meetings | The ROK MND has been**  expanding its role in the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) since it started participation in  1996. The ROK co-chaired the ARF Inter-Sessional Meeting on Maritime Security with  Indonesia from 2012 until 2014, and co-hosted the ARF Disaster Relief Exercise (DiREx)  with Thailand in 2013.  The ROK MND is also participating in the Jakarta International Defense Dialogue  (JIDD).[7] In March 2013, the Vice Chairman of the JCS attended the third JIDD and gave a  speech on “evolving threats and challenges in Asia Pacific.” The Vice Minister of the MND  attended the fourth JIDD in March 2014 and gave a speech on the theme of “establishing  maritime cooperation for security and stability.”  6 A multilateral security dialogue that has been held in the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore every year since 2002 by the International  Institute for Strategic Studies.

The defense cooperation that has been merely focusing on alliances and bilateral  relationships centered on the Asia Pacific countries is expanding its scope to comprehensive  multilateral security cooperation. By actively participating in multilateral security  cooperation activities, the ROK government will share its position with other countries to  maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia with related  countries, and will keep putting forward effort to expand support for the ROK’s security  policies.  **4. International Non-proliferation and Counter-proliferation Activities**   The international community strengthens the international regime to prevent the prolif­  eration of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), conventional weapons and their means of  delivery. In March 2013, the UN adopted the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)[10] to regulate the  trade in conventional weapons across the entire world, and reinforces the export control of  strategic items or commodities.[11] The ROK has been actively participating in the non-prolif­  eration agreements and the multilateral export control system since its admission in the UN  in 1991.  **| International Non-proliferation Activities | The ROK government has fulfilled its**  responsibilities as a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) since its  membership in 1975, and actively participates in the international community’s efforts to  prevent nuclear proliferation.

As of  2014, the ROK military has transferred its highly advanced chemical protection technology  to 230 chemical protection officials from 54 Asian member states.  The ROK is also participating in the Wassenaar Arrangement[12] and the Arms Trade Treaty,  which are multilateral export control systems on conventional weapons. However, taking into  consideration the security situations of the existing military threats of North Korea, the ROK  is not participating in the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention (Ottawa Treaty) and the  Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM), which prohibit using mines and cluster munitions  altogether. But since the ROK is in agreement with the humanitarian need for these  agreements, it is participating in the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW)  and fulfilling the duties. The ROK is also actively participating in the humanitarian efforts of  the global community by supporting the UN Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine  Action.  The ROK government will continuously contribute to international peace and security by  complying with international regimes and observing mandates, such as domestic legislation  of the Arms Trade Treaty, and by actively participating in the efforts of the international  community for disarmament and non-proliferation.  **| International Counter-proliferation Activities | In order to respond to potential**  biological threats on the Korean Peninsula, the ROK and the United States have conducted  the annual “Able Response” exercise, which is a ROK-U.S. combined biological defense  exercise, since 2011. In 2014, a tabletop exercise, functional exercise, and senior-level  seminar were conducted with 50 related institutions of the ROK and United States. Through  the Able Response exercise, the ROK has inspected the national integrated response system  against biological threats, and greatly improved the combined biological defense capabilities  by actively complementing areas in need of refinement.  The ROK government officially became a member of the Proliferation Security Initiative  (PSI) in May 2009 in order to actively participate in the international endeavor to prevent the  proliferation of WMD. The PSI was founded in 2003 by the United States, and 104 countries  are participating as of September 2014.  In 2010 and 2012, the ROK hosted the PSI exercises; discussed the prevention of WMD  proliferation, seizures and disposal; and conducted maritime interdiction training.

Against this backdrop, in October 2009, the ROK government announced its plan to deploy  a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) and security unit. Accordingly, with the consent of  the National Assembly in February 2010, the ROK government deployed the Afghanistan  reconstruction support team (Ashena Unit) of approximately 350 troops to Parwan Province  in July 2010 to support the safe reconstruction missions of the ROK PRT. The major duties of  the Ashena Unit were to protect the activities of the ROK PRT and its base.  The ROK PRT successfully accomplished its  missions in the areas of public health and  medicine after its deployment in 2010. In  recognition of the efforts put in by the ROK  PRT, the Afghanistan government and the  local residents call the ROK PRT “Korean  brothers of Afghanistan,” and praised the ROK  PRT highly for its exemplary reconstruction  PRT escort operation  activities. The Ashena Unit protected the  reconstruction activities of the PRT seamlessly without any loss or damage during more than  1,800 escort and surveillance operations.  The Ashena Unit fully withdrew in late June 2014 along with the PRT when their activities  were completed in the first half of 2014. The major activities of the Ashena Unit are as shown  in Chart 5-12.  **Chart 5-12.

Defense Cooperation Activities**   Defense cooperation activities include defense exchange cooperation activities in the  noncombatant arena such as education and training, humanitarian assistance, and disaster  relief, by deploying the ROK forces to non-conflict areas where there is no risk of battle and  safety is secured for the service members based upon a request from a certain country. This  is a new form of deployment that is different from UN peacekeeping operations or MNF  peace operations.

The Akh Unit provides education and training to the UAE special warfare units, conducts  combined exercise and training with the UAE forces and protects ROK citizens in contin­  gencies. The Akh Unit succeeded in improving the operation execution capabilities of the  UAE special warfare units by concentrating on training the UAE forces in their areas of  weakness such as counter-terrorism marksmanship, infiltration techniques and physical  training. Also, through desert training in high temperatures and a dry environment that our  forces cannot experience in the ROK as well as training using the high-tech facilities and  equipment of the UAE military, the ROK military’s capabilities for combined special  operations in the Middle East have improved a great deal.  The ROK and UAE have engaged in active exchanges and cooperation in various defense  areas since the deployment of the Akh Unit.

In December 2013, in  response to an official request from the  Philippine government, the ROK government  dispatched the Joint Support Group for the  Philippines (Araw Contingent) composed of  approximately 530 troops, including an  Typhoon damage restoration support in the Philippines  engineering unit and medical unit, upon the  consent of the National Assembly.  The Araw Contingent is the first ROK unit dispatched based on a request by a disaster stricken country, and not on a request by a UN peacekeeping force or multinational force.  Also, it is the first joint unit to be deployed that includes the Army, Navy, Air Force, and  Marine Corps. It conducts missions that include reorganizing disaster areas, restoring public  facilities, providing medical support, carrying out disease control activities, operating a  heavy equipment vocational school, and carrying out activities to spread pro-Korea  sentiment in Tacloban where the typhoon damage was the worst.  Among Asian countries, the Philippines was the first country to send combat troops when  the Korean War began, and the deployment of the Araw Contingent shows goodwill to return  the favor to the Philippines.  The Araw Contingent is fully focused on restoration activities under the slogan “Repaying  the Sacrifice Made in Blood with Our Sweat Drops.” It helps Korea to be recognized as “a  country that helps with a sincere heart” by the Philippine government and people, and was  praised as “a successful example of disaster relief activities” by the UN and other interna­  tional organizations. The Araw Contingent is scheduled to withdraw in December 2014 after  successfully completing its missions of normalizing the local functions earlier than  scheduled and providing disaster relief support.

More than 10 countries, including the  United States, the UK, Japan, China, and Australia, participated in the search operation  based on humanitarianism. The ROK government deployed a maritime search support unit  for the missing Malaysian aircraft consisting of one Navy P-3 aircraft, one Air Force C-130  aircraft, and 39 personnel to Malaysia on March 15, 2014.  As the aircraft was later found to have crashed into the Indian Ocean southwest of  Australia, the wreckage search operation was shifted to that area. The ROK forces partic­  ipated in the operation led by Australia, and performed maritime search missions for 196  hours in a total of 21 flights before their return on May 2.  Even though they did not discover any wreckage of the missing aircraft in the maritime  search operation, the ROK forces, despite their short preparation period, performed their  tasks admirably in the prolonged, overseas multinational search operation.  **| Deployment of Military Medical Personnel to Respond to the Ebola Outbreak | As**  the spread of the Ebola virus raised the international urgency of deploying medical personnel  to prevent its spread, the ROK government decided to dispatch a medical team consisting of  civil and military medical personnel.  The ROK military dispatched the military medical personnel along with the civilian  medical personnel to Sierra Leone, which is one of the countries that are most severely  affected by the outbreak in West Africa. The deployment period is from December 2014 to  March 2015. A military medical team of five personnel (two medical officers and three  nursing officers) will be dispatched three times, which makes the total number of personnel  15.  **4. Expanding the Foundation for Participation in PKOs**  The ROK military contributes to promote world peace and improve the status of the ROK  and its national stature through participation in PKOs. It also exerts its efforts to expand its  participation in PKOs by establishing a legal and systematic foundation for PKOs and  expanding its role in multilateral security consultative bodies.  **| Establishing a Legal Basis for Overseas Deployments | In January 2010, the ROK**  government legislated the United Nations Peacekeeping Operations Participation Act to  establish a legal basis to pursue deployments for UN peacekeeping operations more",page,154,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

A legislative bill to establish a legal  basis for various overseas deployment activities, the bill for “the Act on the Armed Forces’  Participation in Overseas Deployment Activities,” was proposed in June 2013, and it is being  deliberated by the National Assembly. When this bill is legislated, the procedure and  contents of the ROK’s overseas deployment will be more clearly specified, and it is expected  to increase the transparency and predictability of overseas deployment activities.  **| Operation of a Standing Unit for Overseas Deployment | Since December 2009, a**  standing unit for overseas deployment of approximately 3,000 troops has been in operation  so that deployment can take place within one or two months after any PKO mission is  granted. The standing unit consists of a dedicated deployment unit, a designated reserve unit,  and special designated unit, each consisting of approximately 1,000 troops. The dedicated  deployment unit is the first one to prepare for deployment in the event a need for deployment  arises. In July 2010, the International Peace Support Standby Force (IPSSF, Onnuri Unit)[9]  was established to serve as a unit solely devoted to overseas deployment. The designated  reserve unit prepares for the rotation of deployed personnel or additional deployment, and the  special designated unit prepares for various deployment requirements.

The PKO Center is exclusively responsible for providing pre-deployment education to the  key officers of a deployed unit and individually dispatched personnel, and conducts commis­  sioned education for overseas deployed police officers. Once the mission of the deployed unit  or individually deployed personnel is completed, the PKO Center publishes and distributes to  the relevant offices a booklet on the lessons learned from the deployment and after-action  reports.  In November 2013, the UN staff course of the PKO Center acquired an education  certificate from the UN’s Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), obtaining  universal recognition for the educational expertise of the center.

However, there has been no significant progress in building inter-Korean military  confidence due to the continuous threats and provocations by North Korea. The Ministry of National  Defense (MND) makes efforts to establish sustainable peace through the military’s support for the estab­  lishment of the DMZ World Eco-Peace Park and the improvement of the arms control policy. It also  prepares for unification by cultivating professional unification experts. When inter-Korean relations  improve in the future, the MND will keep pace with the exchanges and cooperation and gradually take  measures to build inter-Korean military confidence.  **1. Military Confidence Building in Consideration of the Improvement of** **Inter-Korean Relationship**  The ROK government promotes the trust-building process on the Korean Peninsula in  order to improve the inter-Korean relationship, establish peace on the Korean Peninsula, and  set the foundation for unification by building trust between South and North Korea based on  robust national security. The ROK military provides military support for the government’s  policy toward North Korea. However, despite the ROK’s efforts, there has been no significant  progress in inter-Korean trust-building due to the various threats and military provocations  continuously posed by North Korea.  Prior to the inauguration of the Park Geun-hye administration, North Korea launched a  long-range missile on December 12, 2012 and pushed ahead with its third nuclear test on  February 12, 2013. In March of 2013, North Korea declared that it would abolish the  Armistice Agreement and the Inter-Korean Non-Aggression Agreement and nullify the Joint  Promotional video for the trust-building process on the Korean Peninsula",page,160,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43469,"Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, using the Key Resolve (KR)  exercise and Foal Eagle (FE) training as a pretext. As a follow-up measure, North Korea  severed the Panmunjom hotline as well as the inter-Korean military communication lines. In  April, North Korea continued to heighten the tension, as it withdrew all of its workers from  the Kaesong Industrial Complex and put a halt to its operation. In spite of these provocations  by North Korea, the ROK government adhered to the consistent principles of the  trust-building process on the Korean Peninsula while in close cooperation with the interna­  tional community, and urged North Korea to behave appropriately. Meanwhile, North Korea  attempted to turn to appeasement through a visit by Choe Ryong-hae, the Director of the  General Political Bureau, to China in May as a special envoy. Through seven working-level  talks between the respective authorities after the shutdown of the Kaesong Industrial  Complex, South and North Korea agreed to reconnect the inter-Korean military communi­  cation line in the western corridor starting from September 6, 2013 and also normalize the  Kaesong Industrial Complex starting from September 16, 2013. South and North Korea set  up the Inter-Korean Joint Committee for the Kaesong Industrial Complex to continue to  discuss major policies and issues regarding the operation of the complex.  In 2014, North Korea called for the improvement of the inter-Korean relationship in a New  Year’s address. It continued to make a series of peace offensives, including a “significant  proposal” by the National Defense Commission (NDC) made on January 16, 2014,  senior-level inter-Korean talks held on February 12 and 14, a separated families’ reunion  event held from February 20 to 25, the NDC’s “special proposal” on June 30, which repeated  the terms of the “significant proposal,” and a North Korean government statement made on  July 7. However, North Korea conducted the provocation-dialogue tactics which carry out  peace offensives, threats and provocations at the same time. North Korea launched  short-range missiles onto the East Sea on February 21 while the separated families’ reunion  event was taking place, and persistently fired 270 short- and intermediate-range missiles  since February. In addition, North Korea infiltrated small UAVs, threatened to conduct a  fourth nuclear test, and demanded for the abandonment of the ROK-U.S. combined exercises.  Although North Korea appeared to take a proactive attitude towards the improvement of  the inter-Korean relationship through the Incheon Asian Games, it maintained its dual policy  by posing threats and provocations at the same time. It sent Hwang Pyong-so, the Director of  the General Political Bureau, Choe Ryong-hae and Kim Yang-gon, the Secretaries of the  Korean Workers’ Party, to the ROK to attend the closing ceremony of the Incheon Asian  Games. They also had a luncheon meeting with the senior ROK officials, including Kim  Kwan-jin, the Director of National Security. They agreed to hold a second round of  senior-level inter-Korean talks at the end of October or beginning of November. However, a  naval engagement broke out on October 7, when a North Korean patrol boat violated the",page,161,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43470,"Northern Limit Line (NLL) in the West Sea. On October 10, North Korean soldiers fired  anti-aircraft guns at the balloons released by the ROK’s civic organizations in Yeoncheon,  and some of the rounds fell on ROK military camps and civilian residential areas. North  Korea used this incident as a pretext to propose “exclusive emergency talks” with Kim  Kwan-jin, the Director of National Security; however, the ROK government responded with a  revised proposal to hold “senior-level inter-Korean military talks.”  On October 15, 2014, a senior-level  inter-Korean military talk was held at the  Peace House in Panmunjom. The ROK  delegation was headed by Yoo Jeh-seung, the  Deputy Minister for Policy, MND, and the  North Korean delegation was represented by  Kim Yong-chol, the Chief Secretary of the  NDC Secretariat and Director of the  Senior-level inter-Korean military talk (October 2014)  Reconnaissance General Bureau. North Korea  raised issues such as the prevention of clashes in the West Sea and sending leaflets into  North Korea by the ROK civic organizations, while the ROK government emphasized that  North Korea respect and adhere to the NLL and highlighted North Korea’s responsibility for  the attack against the ROK Ship Cheonan and shelling of Yeonpyeongdo Island. Also, the  ROK proposed to open an inter-Korean military hotline. The meeting ended without any  results as North Korea claimed that the ROK government refused the proposals.  On October 16, 2014, the day after the senior-level inter-Korean military talk, North Korea  disclosed the meeting results in a distorted way through a public report by the Korean  Central News Agency (KCNA) and shifted the blame for the strained inter-Korean  relationship to the ROK government. Additionally, on October 18 and 19, North Korea  heightened the military tension not only by violating the Military Demarcation Line (MDL)  in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on the western and central fronts in spite of the ROK  military’s warning, but also by even firing guns towards the ROK. Eventually, North Korea  rejected the second round of senior-level inter-Korean talks, citing the balloon releases  conducted by the ROK civic organizations as an excuse, and continues to threaten and  condemn the ROK.  The ROK government makes it clear that North Korea cannot gain anything through  threats and provocations, while consistently promoting the trust-building process on the  Korean Peninsula which helps build trust through dialogue and cooperation. The ROK will  continue to drive the trust-building process on the Korean Peninsula to encourage North  Korea to make the right choice and cease threats and military provocations against the ROK.

Support for the Establishment of the DMZ World Eco-Peace Park[1]**   The DMZ was established in accordance with the Armistice Agreement concluded on July  27, 1953 to avoid military collision between South and North Korea. However, due to the  military confrontation between South and North Korea, the DMZ has turned into one of the  most heavily armed areas in the world, packed with various military facilities, heavy  weapons, landmines, etc.  The ROK government promotes the establishment of the DMZ World Eco-Peace Park to  create a space where we could foster peace and trust by transforming a certain portion of the  DMZ into a park and opening it to South and North Korean residents and also to the world.  President Park Geun-hye announced the “DMZ World Peace Park Project” for the first time  in her speech at the joint session of the United States Congress on May 8, 2013 and again  mentioned the necessity for driving this project when she announced the “Initiative for  Peaceful Unification on the Korean Peninsula” in Dresden, Germany on March 28, 2014. She  proposed the establishment of the park to North Korea in her address on the occasion of the  68[th] anniversary of the ROK Independence on August 15, 2013. Additionally, in the 69[th]  session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on September 24, 2014, she proposed  to North Korea that South and North Korea should jointly build the DMZ World Eco-Peace  Park.  The DMZ World Eco-Peace Park is expected to turn the DMZ, an iconic area that  represents the Cold War and conflict, into a space of peace and reconciliation, thereby  contributing greatly to both the improvement of the inter-Korean relationship and military  confidence building.  The ROK government formed the “DMZ World Eco-Peace Park Project Team” within the  Ministry of Unification. Additionally, it organized a government-wide joint task force to  discuss all matters related to diplomacy, military, the environment, and culture in a  systematic way, and outlined a master plan after conducting on-site visits, gathering experts’  opinions and consulting with the related agencies.  The ROK MND is providing active support for the establishment of the DMZ World  1 Originally, it was called the “DMZ World Peace Park,” but was renamed the “DMZ World Eco-Peace Park” by adding the concept of  ecology in an address by President Park Geun-hye at the General Assembly of the United Nations on September 24, 2014.",page,163,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

In particular, it focuses on minimizing the negative  effects on national security that could potentially be caused by the excessive modification of  operational plans or rearrangement of military facilities. To achieve this, the ROK MND is  laying out various options so that the measures to ensure military stability could be primarily  applied.  The ROK government plans to resume coordination with North Korea at an appropriate  time while closely monitoring the development of inter-Korean relations. Once the project  takes off, the MND, in close coordination with the United Nations Command (UNC), will  take follow-up actions in the military area, including negotiations with North Korea and  measures to ensure military stability.  **3. Development of Arms Control Policy and Establishment of Military Founda­** **tion in Preparation for Unification**  The ROK government has continuously made various efforts for arms control to ensure  military stability on the Korean Peninsula. However, due to the perpetual provocations made  by North Korea, including the attack against the ROK Ship Cheonan and shelling at Yeonpy­  eongdo Island, inter-Korean military confidence, even at the basic level, is not being  achieved. Sincerity must be guaranteed and the capability to implement the agreement must  be improved to achieve inter-Korean arms control.  The ROK MND is actively participating in major international arms control systems such  as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).  This enables the ROK government to enhance its credibility and transparency in the interna­  tional community and also carry out efforts to uphold national interests.  The ROK government has continuously improved the conditions for arms control by using  various methods such as interconnections between military and non-military areas.  In order to collect public opinion related to arms control policy and reflect the opinions of  experts, the ROK government issues publications such as the “East Asian Strategic Review”  and “Arms Control on the Korean Peninsula.” It also holds the Seoul Defense Dialogue (SDD) annually, mainly with countries in the Asia-Pacific region, to contribute to  trust-building and peace settlement on the Korean Peninsula.  Additionally, the ROK government has reinforced the capability to verify arms control led  by the Korea Arms Control Verification Agency. It operates verification training sessions in  cooperation with the related domestic agencies to develop professional personnel. Also, it",page,164,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43473,"conducts ROK-U.S. combined inspection training and maintains exchanges and cooperation  with U.S. and German arms control verification organizations in order to learn the verifi­  cation capability of advanced countries. The MND will establish a system to respond to  military talks at any time by cultivating experts for military talks and conducting mock  meetings in preparation for the improvement of the inter-Korean relationship. Based on such  efforts, the ROK military prepares for unification which will open up a new era on the  Korean Peninsula. The ROK government has set up the Presidential Committee for  Unification Preparation, a national organization for unification preparation, to drive the  practical preparations for unification. The ROK military also makes systematic preparations  for unification by cultivating professional personnel and enhancing military capabilities in  conjunction with the ROK government’s unification policy. The ROK will manage the  security situation on the Korean Peninsula in a stable manner and set the conditions for  unification by thoroughly preparing for any types of situations that could occur within the  framework of the inter-Korean relationship.",page,165,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43474,"**Section 2 Ensuring Inter-Korean Exchanges** **and Cooperation, and Providing Humanitarian** **Assistance**  The MND provides military support to the trust-building process on the Korean Peninsula by offering mili­  tary assurance to inter-Korean exchange and cooperation projects and also by making efforts to solve the  issues regarding ROK prisoners of war (POWs). From a humanitarian perspective, the ROK government  repatriated Chinese soldiers’ remains which had been buried in the ROK, and also plans to discuss South North joint remains recovery with a high priority once conditions are set.  **1. Military Assurance to Inter-Korean Exchange and Cooperation Projects**  Inter-Korean exchange and cooperation projects have been drastically reduced since the  imposition of the “May 24 Measures,”[1] which were announced by the ROK government in a  legitimate response against North Korea’s attack on the ROK Ship Cheonan in 2010. Despite  promoting the trust-building process on the Korean Peninsula, there has not been much  progress in the inter-Korean exchange and cooperation projects due to continued North  Korean threats and provocations. The ROK military provides military assurance to the  inter-Korean exchange and cooperation projects such as the operation of the Kaesong  Industrial Complex and reunion of separated families, and is maintaining a firm readiness  posture to immediately respond to contingencies.  **| Military Assurance to Inter-Korean Crossings | Direct inter-Korean crossings have**  been carried out via land, sea, and air routes. However, since the imposition of the May 24  Measures, only the crossings by land are being allowed. Crossings by land are carried out  through roads and railroads within the Joint Administrative Areas in the western and eastern  corridors; however, crossings through railroads have been suspended since December 2008.  1 The main contents of the measures include: prohibiting North Korean ships from sailing in South Korean waters, halting all North-South  trade, banning visits by South Koreans to North Korea, prohibiting new investment by South Koreans in North Korea, etc.",page,166,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43475,"The crossings through the Joint Administrative Area in the western corridor have been  carried out consistently except for the period when the operation of the Kaesong Industrial  Complex was halted (April 8–September 16, 2013). The Joint Administrative Area in the  eastern corridor is used in case there is a need for crossing, such as the separated families’  reunion event held in February 2014.  The ROK military consults with the UNC and the North Korean military about crossing  plans in accordance with the Armistice Agreement and inter-Korean agreements. It also  provides security and convoys for the inter-Korean crossings. It will continue to protect the  safety and property of the people by preparing for any contingencies and providing  consistent support for inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation.  **| Operations of Inter-Korean Military Communication Lines | South and North Korea**  have established a communication system between their respective military situation rooms  in the eastern and western corridors. Through the military communication lines, they  exchange information related to crossings as well as faxes between the respective military  authorities. Although suspension and reopening has been repeated unilaterally by North  Korea, the communication lines continue to serve as the inter-Korean communication  channel.  Since May 31, 2011, when North Korea suspended the military communication lines in the  eastern corridor and shut down its liaison office in Mt. Kumgang, only the military  communication lines in the western corridor have been operated. On March 27, 2013, North  Korea cut off the military communication lines in the western corridor as well, which were  used for entering the Kaesong Industrial Complex. On April 8, it announced the temporary  suspension of the complex. Starting from on September 16, operation of the Kaesong  Industrial Complex was resumed through working-level inter-Korean talks. The ROK MND  participated in the subcommittee for crossing, communication, and customs, which falls  under the Inter-Korean Joint Committee for the Kaesong Industrial Complex, and held  consultations with North Korea to reopen the military communication lines on September 6.  North Korea requested the ROK to provide materials and equipment for the purpose of  ensuring stable communications. The ROK provided North Korea with fax machines,  vehicles and fuel twice in January 2014 and another two times in February. The ROK  military will maintain the inter-Korean military communication lines in a stable manner  even in the future, utilizing it as communication channel for mutual interests including the  inter-Korean exchange and cooperation projects.",page,167,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43476,"**2. Resolving the ROK POW Issue**  The ROK government has designated the ROK POW issue as one of the key national tasks  in order to resolve it as a top priority. However, it is experiencing difficulties in finding  fundamental solutions because North Korea has continued to adhere to the claim that all  ROK POWs were transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and that there  are no ROK POWs detained in North Korea after the POW exchanges in the 1950s.  **| ROK POWs: Whereabouts, Family Reunions and Repatriation | The ROK government**  has continuously proposed to North Korea to discuss and resolve issues related to confirming  the fate and whereabouts of ROK POWs and their repatriation as a top-priority issue from an  inter-Korean reconciliation and humanitarian perspective.  During the Inter-Korean Ministerial-level Talks and Inter-Korean Red Cross Talks  following the Inter-Korean Summit in June 2000, the two Koreas agreed to discuss and  resolve the issue of ROK POWs in conjunction with the issue of separated families. In  February 2006, during the seventh Inter-Korean Red Cross Talks, an agreement was reached  “to discuss and resolve the issue of confirming the fate and whereabouts of those who went  missing during and after the war as part of the separated families issue,” and this principle  was reconfirmed during the 20[th] Inter-Korean Ministerial-level Talks in February 2007 and  the eighth Inter-Korean Red Cross Talks in April 2007. The fate and whereabouts of 20  POWs were identified according to the agreement on reunions of separated families in  February 2013. As of 2014, the fate and whereabouts of 41 ROK POWs have been identified  through the separated families’ reunion events, and 17 of them were reunited with their  families from the ROK.  Meanwhile, the ROK government is putting forward efforts for the safe repatriation of  ROK POWs and their families who escaped from North Korea and fled to third countries.  When the escapes of ROK POWs and their families from North Korea are confirmed, the  ROK government first ensures their personal safety from the perspective of protecting ROK  nationals living abroad and exerts diplomatic efforts to repatriate them to the ROK as soon as  possible. Recently, the repatriation of ROK POW remains has begun, and the ROK  government is taking measures to support it.  From 1994 to 2014, 80 ROK POWs and approximately 430 POW family members returned  to the ROK after escaping from North Korea and fleeing to third countries. Since 2011, the  repatriation of ROK POWs has not been made at all due to the aging of the ROK POWs and  North Korea’s reinforcement of surveillance to prevent escapes from North Korea. The status  of the repatriated ROK POWs is shown in Chart 6-1.",page,168,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

The ROK MND is implementing a wide range of  policies that support the stable and fast resettlement of the ROK POWs in the ROK and allow  them to happily live the remainder of their lives.  In accordance with the Act on the Repatriation, Treatment of the Republic of Korea Armed  Forces Prisoners of War enacted in 1998, the MND provides wages, housing support,  pension and financial support for medical care to POWs who have returned to the ROK.  Moreover, the families of the POWs who died in North Korea are registered as “families of  the ROK POWs” on top of being designated as North Korean defectors and receive separate  support funds per household.  In 2013, the Act on the Repatriation, Treatment of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces  Prisoners of War was revised in order to address shortfalls discovered in the process of  enforcing the law and improve the support system for ROK POWs. The support funds will be  paid in the form of a pension instead of a lump sum, and rental housing will be provided as  part of housing support to ensure the stable lives and resettlement of the ROK POWs.  Recently, there have been some cases where the repatriation of ROK POW remains were  conducted through individuals’ own efforts. Therefore, a revision of the legislation is being  made to support such cases within reasonable capacity.  Furthermore, the MND is putting forth efforts to understand the difficulties that the ROK  POWs face during the process of settling down by conducting household visits and providing  them with emotional support through hosting roundtables with POWs and their families on a  regular basis.  The MND plans to exert efforts to fundamentally resolve the issue of ROK POWs, and will  continue to confirm the fate and whereabouts of the POWs and facilitate reunions of POWs  and their families through the separated families’ reunion events. Moreover, diplomatic  efforts such as enhancing cooperation with third countries will continue in order to ensure  the safety of the ROK POWs and their family members who fled from North Korea. Also,  various types of support policies will be continuously developed and modified to ensure the  stable resettlement of the returned POWs and their families in the ROK.",page,169,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43478,"**3. Repatriation of Chinese Soldiers’ Remains and South-North Joint Remains** **Recovery**  The MND has separately buried and maintained the remains of North Korean soldiers and  Chinese soldiers found in the process of excavating the remains of ROK service members  killed in action during the Korean War in the cemetery for Korean People’s Army (KPA) and  Chinese People’s Volunteers (CPV) in Paju, Gyeonggi-do. From 1981 to 1997, 43 sets of  Chinese soldiers’ remains were sent back to China through the UNC Military Armistice  Commission (MAC); however, since then the repatriation of remains has been suspended as  North Korea rejected the acceptance of remains for the purpose of nullifying the Armistice  Agreement.  President Park Geun-hye proposed the repatriation of Chinese soldiers’ remains in a  humanitarian spirit when she visited China in June 2013. In November 2013, China accepted  this proposal and the ROK and China held several discussions that led to the agreement on  repatriating the Chinese soldiers’ remains prior to the Chinese Qingming Festival on April 5,  2014.  The MND prepared for the repatriation by committing 14,000 man-days in excavating,  drying, and cleaning the remains. On March 28, 2014, the transfer ceremony for the 437 sets  of Chinese soldiers’ remains was held at the Incheon International Airport with the ROK and  Chinese government officials in attendance. Any additional remains of Chinese soldiers that  are found during excavation will be sent back to China on a yearly basis following the same  procedure.  The repatriation of Chinese soldiers’  remains is considered to be a new  m i le s t o n e fo r t h e t a ke - of f a n d  development of t he ROK- Ch i na  relationship by healing the scars of the  past between the two countries.

43482,"**Section 1 Enhancement of the Efficiency** **of Defense Budget Management**  It is critical to secure an adequate budget amount for national defense in order to consolidate the defense  posture and execute stable defense reforms. The Ministry of National Defense (MND) exerts efforts to  secure an adequate defense budget and to manage it efficiently. Moreover, the MND strives to further  increase management efficiency and expand the use of civilian resources in all aspects of national defense  to maximize the value within the limited defense budget.  **1. Securing an Adequate Defense Budget**  **| Changes in Defense Budget Allocation | Due to the perpetual military threat posed by**  North Korea, the strengthening of military power by neighboring countries in Northeast Asia  and changes in the military environment, the need to increase the ROK defense budget is  growing. However, the ratio of the defense budget to the ROK’s gross domestic product  (GDP), as well as to the entire government budget, is decreasing. As of 2014, the defense  budget accounted for 2.38% of GDP and 14.4% of the government budget. This trend is  shown in Chart 7-1.  **Chart 7-1.

In addition to the threats of nuclear tests and launches of missiles and multiple  rocket launchers (MRLs), North Korea is heightening the level of new threats with UAV  infiltration and increased cyber-attacks. Failure to respond effectively to these kinds of  security crises on the Korean Peninsula can have a negative impact on the ROK’s economy.  For the ROK, although the defense budget to GDP ratio is higher than the world average of  2.11%, it is lower than that of major nations involved in conflicts or military confrontations  such as the United States, Russia and Israel. The defense budget to GDP ratios of the major  nations involved in conflicts or military confrontations are shown in Chart 7-2.  **Chart 7-2.

As such,  securing an adequate budget for national defense is critical to support it.   **| Desired Effects of Securing an Adequate Defense Budget | An adequate amount of**  investment in the defense budget produces a public goods called “national security,” which  provides the foundation for people to conduct economic activities with reassurance.  Moreover, the defense budget makes a contribution to the national economy by creating  various economic effects which exceed the investment amount. For example, defense  expenditure of 1 billion won creates positive economic spillover effects such as generating  1.68 billion won in production, creating an added value of 780 million won, and generating  the effect of 12.3 new employments.  **Chart 7-3.

Additionally, the main exports of the defense  industry have been diversified from ammunition and small arms to vessels, aircraft, etc.  From a domestic point of view, defense industry exports create quality jobs which in turn  provide a stable foundation for the growth of the defense industry; from an international  point of view, defense industry exports promote diplomatic and economic cooperation as  well as military exchanges. It also has various spillover effects such as contributing to the  development of the nation’s science and technology by transferring advanced technologies to  the private sector.  The MND strives for securing an adequate national defense budget while recognizing the  importance of the defense budget.  **2.

43485,"The force operating costs, which amounted to 25 trillion, 196 billion won, or 70% of the  total defense budget, increased 3.6% compared to 2013. In order to establish a robust defense  posture that the ROK people can rely on, the requirements to continuously enhance operation  and security facilities and strengthen the combat capabilities of field units by securing new  bulletproof helmets, parachutes and functional winter garments, and replacing old sleeping  bags, have been reflected. Additionally, in order to ensure logistics support capabilities, the  requirements for core equipment maintenance and repair parts have been reflected, and the  conditions for combat support will also be improved by modernizing outdated logistics  support facilities such as maintenance areas, ammunition storage and armories. Also, a  realistic training and education system will be established by securing comprehensive  training sites corresponding to actual battlefield situations.  The requirements to reinforce future-oriented defense capabilities in accordance with the  changing strategic environment have been also reflected. The troop structure will be  streamlined in order to build an elite force focusing on cadres. Additionally, strong reserve  forces will be built up by improving the environment for the training of reserve forces and  increasing the training allowances paid to reservists.  The requirements to improve the work environment for service members have been  reflected to ensure a rewarding military service experience. The monthly salary for enlisted  members has been increased by 15% according to a plan to double it by 2017. The unit cost of  meals has been increased, and more civilian cooks have been hired to provide service  members with varied and delicious meals. Efforts have been made to improve the national  defense medical support system, e.g., by expanding the scope of service members eligible for  vaccination and enhancing first aid supplies. Also, a priority has been put on projects for  improving service environments for service members such as the repair and renovation of old  military barracks and enhancement of convenience facilities.  The force improvement budget amounted to 10 trillion, 509.6 billion won, which is a 3.3%  increase compared to 2013. An amount of 1 trillion, 177.1 billion won was allocated to 21  projects, including a long-range air-to-surface missile system for the early establishment of  the Kill Chain and Korea Air and Missile Defense (KAMD), which are intended to counter  North Korea’s asymmetric threats such as nuclear and missile threats.  Also, an amount of 1 trillion, 99.5 billion won was allocated to 27 projects, including a  GOP advanced security system, to counter North Korea’s local provocations. A total of 7  trillion, 345.8 billion won was allocated to projects for acquiring next-generation MLRS,  frigates, and fighters (F-X) in order to establish a self-reliant defense posture. As such,  investments are made consistently to build up elite military forces and ensure preparation  against both existing and potential threats.

43486,"the budget for 2015. In particular, it will actively reflect the requirements for strengthening  disaster preparedness and safety management, assuring human rights for service members,  and improving barracks culture as well.  **| 2015-2019 Mid-term Defense Program | The budget allocated to the 2015-2019**  Mid-term Defense Program amounts to 222.9 trillion won, reflecting an increase of 5.6% for  force operation, an increase of 10.6% for force improvement, and an increase of 7.2% for the  total defense budget on average for the mid-term period.  Regarding force operating costs, the budget allocation has focused on switching to an elite  troop structure, establishing a complete military readiness posture, improving the welfare of  service members, and removing welfare blind spots.  In connection with the reduction in troop size, a priority has been put on the requirement  for an augmentation of cadres to ensure the exertion of substantive combat power. Essential  supplies and equipment are to be reinforced in battalion- and below-level combat units in  order to guarantee the survivability of service members. Operation and security facilities are  to be strengthened to reinforce the readiness posture in enemy contact areas such as GPs and  GOPs. The combat gear for reserve forces will be reinforced and training conditions will be  improved to enable the reserve forces to exert combat power equivalent to that of active duty  forces. Lastly, to enhance the morale and welfare of service members, improvements will be  made such as increasing the monthly salary for enlisted members, expanding cultural  facilities in military barracks, improving living conditions for service members, and  enhancing the military medical support system.  Regarding force improvement, the budget allocation has focused on strengthening core  combat power to deter North Korean threat of an aggression and local provocations, securing  vital forces in unit reorganization to execute the ROK military’s defense reform,  strengthening the core capabilities to establish a self-reliant defense posture, and carrying out  creative national defense research and development (R&D).  Preparedness against an aggression in enemy contact areas has been reinforced by building  up the Kill Chain and KAMD and deploying counter-battery detection radar. Additionally,  efforts will be made to enhance the ROK military’s surveillance, reconnaissance, and  command and control capabilities, and improve its maneuver and precision strike capabilities  while acquiring the essential forces required to enhance the combat power of field units. The  naval strength required to strengthen the capabilities for protecting sea lines of communi­  cation (SLOC) and for amphibious operations will be acquired, as well as the air power  needed to achieve air superiority and acquire long-distance operational capabilities.  Moreover, investments will be expanded to acquire defense science and technology  capabilities corresponding to the level of advanced countries, and also to develop the Agency",page,178,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

The MND has operated the Defense Management Efficiency Inspection Committee,  consisting of civilian and military experts and chaired by the Vice Minister of National  Defense, since 2013. Through this committee, the “Defense Management Efficiency Plan” for  the efficient management of the budget, organization, and personnel has been established,  and the committee checks the progress of the plan. The organizations subject to this plan  have also been expanded from the Army, Navy, and Air Force to the military units and  defense institutions directly under the MND.  In order to maximize the value of defense expenditures, not only will efforts be made to  save the budget, but projects which can link the combat readiness posture with the tenets of  the national defense policy will also be selected and continuously pursued.   **| Operation of Military Executive Agencies | The MND has designated institutions that**  carry out business management and execution-type activities as military executive agencies  in order to continuously promote efficient defense management.",page,179,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43488,"The military executive agency system selects the heads of agencies through a process of  open recruitment inside and outside of the military, provides them with autonomy in organi­  zation, personnel and finance, and makes them responsible for the performance of the  agency. Since the system was first pilot-operated in 2009, it has been expanded steadily to  include 18 institutions in the maintenance, supply, medical and printing areas designated and  operated as military executive agencies in 2014.  The military executive agency system has continuously created tangible results, such as  productivity growth and an improved service level. The Korea Armed Forces Printing &  Publishing Depot has achieved a 56.8% increase in annual production since it was designated  as a military executive agency in 2009. The Armed Forces Capital Hospital has been able to  provide service members with improved service, such as reducing the pre-operation waiting  time by 76.1%. Since it was designated as a military executive agency it has made  outstanding achievements by obtaining 19 external certifications, 62 awards and 34 patents.  **4. Efficient Use of Civilian Resources**  In connection with the troop reduction plan for defense reform, the MND strives to utilize  civilian human resources and funds efficiently in noncombatant areas such as logistics,  installation and welfare, while concentrating the limited military service resources on  combat missions.  The MND prepares the “Basic Plan for the Use of Civilian Resources in Defense” every  five years so that the utilization of civilian resources can be linked to mid- to long-term  human and financial resource planning. The Basic Plan for the Use of Civilian Resources in  Defense (2014-2018) aims to save 200 billion won of the defense budget in noncombatant  areas by utilizing personnel, capital and civilian management techniques in a synchronized  manner, and reinvest the saved amount in other national defense areas efficiently. With the  use of civilian resources, the quality of national defense service will be improved by  increasing the equipment operation rate, improving the quality of meals and enhancing the  professionalism in education.  Various efforts are put forward to use civilian resources in an efficient way. Since 2012,  some military units have contracted out service support activities such as laundry, waste  collection and repair services to civilian companies. This is intended to reduce active-duty  personnel in the units by entrusting noncombatant services to the private sector, and will be  introduced to all supply support units by 2017.

43490,"**Section 2 Strengthening Competitiveness** **of Force Improvement Projects**  To conduct force improvement projects that require an enormous budget in an efficient and transparent  way is the public desire and also one of the main tasks of the national defense policy. The MND made  amendments to the Defense Acquisition Program Act in 2014 to adjust functions among agencies and  strengthen the functions of requirement review, analysis and evaluation. In particular, it is preparing  comprehensive improvement measures by making an overall review of the project management system,  expertise, project information management and the check and monitoring system in order to innovate  force improvement projects and gain the people’s trust.  **1. Efficient Execution of Force Improvement Projects**  **| Revision of the Defense Acquisition Program Act | According to the Defense**  Acquisition Program Act, as revised in 2014, the MND is responsible for the policy function  of force improvement projects and the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA)  is in charge of the execution function of force improvement projects.  **Chart 7-7.

This function coordination between agencies  will lead to the systematic and efficient execution of force improvement projects and enhance  the expertise of each agency.  **| Strengthening the Requirement Review Function | The MND strengthens the**  requirement review, by which the adequacy and validity of the requirements decided by the  JCS from a military point of view are reviewed, in consideration of the budget and the  national defense policy.  Currently, a Force Requirements Review Committee (FRRC),[1] composed of the civil  sector, government and military, performs the requirement review. It performs reasonable  allocation of the national defense budget by reflecting the results of the requirement review  when planning the mid-term defense program.  Chart 7-8 shows the requirement review framework. The Force Requirements Review  Committee reviewed a total of 56 requirements from 2011 to September 2014 and suggested  adjusting the quantity demanded, the operational performance and the timing of fielding  regarding 29 requirements.  The MND will develop the review methods more precisely and systemically to ensure a  reasonable requirement review.   **Chart 7-8.

43492,"in 2013.  The MND identifies areas for improvements in the policies and systems of force  improvement projects through analysis and evaluation. In 2013, it was able to institutionalize  the process of field tests[2] by analyzing the status of fielding evaluation. Once the system for  field tests is established, it will be possible to introduce weapon systems in accordance with  the requirements of each Service, and the integrity of the weapon systems is estimated to be  considerably improved. Also, the information sharing system is improved to ensure that the  results of analysis and evaluation can be easily utilized in the subsequent phases.  The MND will strengthen the function of analysis and evaluation by reinforcing the  personnel for objective and scientific analysis and evaluation and expanding the  infrastructure to enhance the expertise of these personnel.  **2. Enhancing the ROK People’s Trust in Force Improvement Projects**  The issues of corruption and poor management regarding some force improvement projects  have recently been raised by the media and the National Assembly. The MND diagnoses the  causes of corruption and poor management and prepares countermeasures across all areas,  including the project management system, expertise in duty execution, management of  project information, and the check and monitoring system.  **| Improvement of Project Management System | An efficient improvement in the**  project management system is necessary to prevent corruption related to costs and poor  project management.  The low-bid procurement system will be improved in order for the ROK military to secure  weapons with optimal performance at reasonable costs. The review system will be reinforced  at each step, such as requirement planning, acquisition method, and testing and evaluation of  weapon systems, to introduce a project management system centered on technology and  capability that can ensure quality and performance.  **| Enhancement of Expertise in Duty Execution | Since the acquisition process for**  weapon systems is technically difficult and has complicated procedures, a personnel  management system based on expertise is to be established together with a training system.  2 The test is performed on initial production and procurement items. The Service with the requirement operates the weapon system first  so that it can identify restrictions related to field operation early. The DAPA decides on the follow-on mass production or procurement based on the results of this test.",page,184,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43493,"Various measures will be implemented to maintain a balanced expertise in overall duty  execution: For example, personnel exchanges in the area of acquisition will be promoted  among the MND, JCS, Army, Navy Air Force and DAPA, and a career path system will be  introduced by applying training and career development.  **| Expansion of Project Information Disclosure | Due to the characteristics of defense**  projects containing a lot of confidential materials, only a limited number of persons have  access to and manage project information. While the information that must be protected by  the military continues to be protected to prevent illegal trading of information, the disclosure  of information regarding projects and contracts has been significantly expanded.  The openness of the force improvement projects will be enhanced by encouraging the  participation of civilian experts in each project step, while the military expertise required for  the defense projects is maintained.   **| Strengthening the Check and Monitoring System and Punishment | In order to**  prevent corruption related to defense projects, there is a need to develop a system to check  and monitor the overall project process.  Thus, the MND has expanded the reward system for reporting corruption and has been  preparing concrete measures to eradicate the illegal employment of retirees. At the same  time, it has reinforced anti-corruption education and benchmarked agencies with a high level  of integrity to promote a culture of integrity. It also plans to improve legal measures to  strengthen the guidelines for punishment regarding bribery.",page,185,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43494,"**Section 3 Creative Defense R&D and Promotion** **of the Defense Industry**  The ROK military strengthens the ROK’s defense capabilities and contributes to the development of the  national economy by promoting defense research and development (R&D) and the defense industry.  Against this backdrop, it expands investment in R&D and promotes policies to improve the efficiency of  R&D and enhance civilian capabilities by developing core technologies based on a selection and concen­  tration strategy and technology exchanges between the private sector and the military. This will serve as a  key driving force for the creative economy in the national defense area by creating a virtuous circle of R&D  and defense export growth.  **1. Creative Defense R&D**  **| Defense R&D Corresponding to the**  **Development of Creative Economy |**  Investment in defense R&D has been  expanded to establish policies that place a  priority on domestic R&D and the virtuous  circle of “technology development first,  followed by system development,” in order to  raise the level of the ROK’s defense science President Park Geun-hye’s visit to the Agency for Defense  and technology to be the best in the world.

Additionally, creative and challenging research  projects are selected and are being implemented to develop new weapon systems in the areas  of unmanned systems, robots, etc. for national defense and to secure original, core  technologies which will lead the future warfare.  **| Increase in Defense R&D Expenditures and Development of Core Technologies | In**  2014, defense R&D expenditures amounted to 6.5% of the defense budget. In order to  acquire the capabilities for the independent development of national security and advanced  weapon systems, the defense R&D expenditure will be increased to 8.5% of the defense  budget by 2018, and to 15% of the defense budget in the long term.  In order to develop high value-added core technologies, which have a high level of  technical difficulty and are monopolized by advanced countries, investment in core  technologies will be increased to 10% of the defense R&D budget by 2018, and to 15% of the  defense R&D budget in the long term. With these initiatives, the ROK will be able to respond  against North Korean threats more effectively, prepare against future warfare, strengthen the  defense science and technology capability, and stimulate the development of related  industries.   **| Advancement of Defense R&D System | The ROK military carries out various policies**  to develop the defense R&D system.  First, it selects research projects based on requirement planning by the ROK JCS as well as  a survey of the national and international technology level, while publicly seeking research  projects from the military, the Agency for Defense Development (ADD), the Defense Agency  for Technology and Quality (DTaQ), and industry-academic cooperation as well. This will  create the conditions to discover creative projects and link the advanced science technology  of the private sector to the military.  Second, it strengthens R&D capabilities. It expands opportunities for the education of  defense R&D personnel and has reorganized the ADD to be suitable to develop core  technologies, concentrating its research capabilities on strategic weapons and new  technologies. By establishing the Technical Support Center for National Defense Industry  attached to the ADD in May 2014, it provides civilian companies with technical support  when they develop general weapon systems.  Third, it improves the evaluation system for defense R&D. It has made mandatory the  evaluation of R&D projects and the R&D investment results. It has also made defense R&D  projects go through preliminary, interim and post evaluations. However, if an agency or  company carried out an R&D project sincerely but failed due to the difficulty of the R&D  project, the agency or company can be exempt from responsibility, which is intended to leave",page,187,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43496,"the door open for creative and challenging R&D. The MND plans to continuously improve  the evaluation system to promote creative and challenging R&D in the national defense area  and expand the openness of the R&D.  **| Reinforcement of Civilian-Military Technology Cooperation | Since the Civil-Military**  Technology Cooperation Project Promotion Act was revised in 2013, all the ministries and  agencies related to R&D have participated in civilian-military technology cooperation  projects. The effect of cooperation between the ROK military, which has accumulated  advanced defense technologies, and the private sector, which possesses a high level of  science technology, is expected to be enormous. The military applies state-of-the-art  technologies of the private sector to national defense by promoting Advanced Concept  Technology Demonstration (ACTD) projects. In May 2014, the Korea Defense Technology  Exhibition was held under the joint sponsorship of the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future  Planning, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, and the Defense Acquisition Program  Administration, which provided an opportunity to encourage civilian-military technology  cooperation. Technology transfers to the private sector are actively encouraged by opening  defense science technologies to the public through the Defense Technology Marketplace[1] and  spinning off the patented technologies. Also, defense R&D led by industry-academic  cooperation is expanded to encourage the participation of talented personnel from the private  sector.  The MND plans to promote civilian-military technology cooperation more actively so that  it can strengthen defense capabilities and industrial competitiveness, and contribute to the  development of the national economy.  **| Expansion of International Joint Technology Development | The MND carries out**  technology cooperation with six countries, including the United States and UK, to acquire  cutting-edge core technologies in the defense area. It expands international cooperation  through various forms such as the introduction and export of technology and joint  development considering the technology level of each partner country.  International joint technology development has been actively carried out since 2011; three  projects have been successfully completed, five projects are ongoing, and new projects are  waiting to be discovered.  The MND will actively expand the target countries and scope of cooperation as interna­  tional joint technology development helps to save development costs during the R&D process  and to allow exploration of new export markets.  1 An online marketplace created to transfer advanced defense science technologies to the private sector (http://dtims.dtaq.re.kr)",page,188,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

Promotion of Defense Industry**  **| Expanded Opportunities to Participate in**  **the Defense Industry | In order to promote**  competition within the domestic defense  industry, the scope of the defense material and  business designation system, [2] which was  designed to give a priority to specific  companies, has been reduced. The partici­  pation of new companies is encouraged by Korea Defense Technology Exhibition (May 2014)  disclosing the information needed to  participate in the defense industry to the public. Also, information sharing systems, including  the defense import and export support information system, have been established for  government ministries, private companies and research institutes to easily search for and use  defense industry information. Based on these initiatives, competitive conditions in the  domestic defense industry will be improved.   **| Fostering Global Hidden Champions in the Defense Industry | The MND supports**  domestic companies in the defense industry in their efforts to acquire global competi­  tiveness. It encourages the participation of the private sector in defense research and  development in order to have companies lead in development, production and quality  management. Also, the ROK government strengthens support in areas where there are  difficulties in attracting private investments and strategic areas such as core components and  software. It provides small and medium-sized companies that have export potential and  technological competitiveness with customized support packages that include technology  development, consulting support, and the establishment of export and marketing strategies.  Additionally, it plans to enhance the core competencies of defense industry companies and  foster specialized companies equipped with the scale and expertise that could be competitive  in the global market.  **| Customized Export Policies | In order to develop the defense industry into an export**  industry, customized export policies in consideration of the characteristics of the purchasing  countries are implemented.

43502,"**Section 1 Establishment of an Open** **Barracks Culture Trusted by People**  The Ministry of National Defense (MND) implements various policies to thoroughly evaluate the current  barracks culture and establish an open barracks culture trusted by people in a bid to fundamentally  resolve the identified problems, including malicious accidents in barracks, evil practices such as beatings  and cruel treatment, and slackened discipline. In particular, the ROK government prepares govern­  ment-wide measures to protect the human rights of service members, build proper character, enhance the  leadership of junior officers and NCOs, overcome the closed nature of barracks life, and create a safe  environment. The ROK government will continue to innovate the barracks culture by amending the related  laws and systems.  **1. Concept of Barracks Culture Innovation**  **| Vision and Objectives | Barracks culture innovation sets its vision on “contributing to**  building an advanced elite military” and has been implemented with the objective to  “establish an open barracks culture trusted by people.” “Trust from people” can be earned by  establishing safe, healthy barracks where parents and families feel comfortable sending their  sons and daughters as human rights are respected and laws and regulations are observed  without cover-ups or hiding. “Open barracks” refer to barracks that actively communicate  with the people and society within an acceptable capacity to overcome the closed nature of  barracks that separate them from society.  **| Implementation Focus | In order to achieve the vision and objectives of barracks**  culture innovation, the MND aims for the values of “autonomy and discipline, safety and  communication, human rights and character,” which are the basics for the military, and is   Promotional video for the establishment of an open barracks culture   Promotional video for the Defense Help Call",page,194,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43503,"innovating with a focus on five critical points: (1) Safe and sound barracks, (2) Open  barracks that communicate with society, (3) Barracks where human rights are guaranteed, (4)  Barracks where autonomy and responsibility are harmonized, and (5) Strong and disciplined  barracks.  When major incidents occurred in the past, the military carried out tasks to eradicate  irrationalities in the barracks, prevent such accidents, and establish an advanced barracks  culture. This effort led to positive results highlighted by the improvement of forces and unit  management system, and the enhancement of the military service conditions and  environment. However, the military failed to sufficiently reflect the voices from the people  who demanded the reinforcement of legal and systematic mechanisms to clean out violence  in the barracks, improvement of the leadership of junior officers and NCOs, establishment of  a social reward system for military service, and expansion of openness and communications  to overcome the military’s closed culture.  Based on the public demands and lessons learned during the past efforts to improve  barracks culture, the MND prepares substantive options to innovate barracks life and show  respect for human rights under the condition that it accepts the common values cherished by  a democratic society while maintaining the unique characteristics of the military, which is  the last bastion of national defense.  **2. Diagnosis of Barracks Culture**   **| Values and Awareness ‌| Social changes such as the development of democracy, rising**  level of education, increase of skilled professionals, and efforts to improve barracks culture  since the 1990s paved the way for the gradual progress in human rights awareness and  reasonable leadership inside the barracks. “Command based on rank and authority” is  changing to “command by setting an example, command based on respect for human rights,  and leadership focused on communication, sympathy and autonomy,” while barracks culture  is shifting from “absolute obedience” to “ legitimate direction and order based on laws and  regulations.”  However, despite such changes, there are still people who misunderstand that human rights  can be ignored to maintain operational discipline. In addition, deep-rooted bad practices and  slackened discipline, which repeatedly cause similar malicious accidents, still remain to be  resolved.  **| Laws, Systems and Standards | The ROK military installed and has operated a human**  rights department since 2005 and included the ensuring of human rights for service members",page,195,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43504,"on the list of barracks culture improvement tasks. In 2006, the ROK military imposed legal  accountability by clearly stating directions for barracks culture improvement in the National  Defense Reform Act. Military investigation, inspection and disciplinary actions are  developing in a direction that guarantees administrative procedural rights as in general  judicial proceedings.  Recently, there has been an increasing demand for legally ensuring or limiting service  members’ basic rights defined in the Military Code of Conduct in accordance with the  Constitution. The awareness that unit management must be carried out by law, not by the  arbitrary commands of commanders, is also spreading within and outside of the military.  **| Behavior and Lifestyle | The number and level of demand for training and education**  courses and subjects are increasing in order to nurture strong, combat-oriented forces. In  addition, the need to expand education on human rights, character, and socialization required  for national development and social life during military service is increasing as well. More  attention from society and transparency regarding unit management are required, while the  officers’ force management burden grows heavier due to the shortened service period, high  troop replacement and circulation rate, and the enlistment of service members who  experience social problems such as being social outcasts and depression.  **| Living Conditions and Environment | The basic concept of the barracks is shifting from**  an “accommodation space” to a “living space,” and more efforts to reduce the gap in the level  of welfare between the military and society are required. The military’s medical system is  under continuous improvement and the early expansion of the emergency medical evacuation  system, equipment, and capabilities is urgent. It is also required to ensure conditions for  productive military service to allow service members to concentrate on their own military  duties and at the same time prepare for their future after discharge through self-development.  **3. Measures for Barracks Culture Innovation**  **| Safe and Sound Barracks | The MND seeks various measures to make the service**  environment healthier and safer in order to make sure parents feel comfortable in sending  their sons and daughters to the military. To this end, the enlistment of personnel disqualified  for active service among those who are obligated to serve in the military will be actively  prevented by improving the Military Manpower Administration’s psychological examination  tools, increasing the number of personnel in charge of psychological examinations, and  revising the rules on physical checkups for conscription. A customized management system",page,196,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43505,"for maladjusted service members will also be  established by developing the “Sociometric  Test of Interpersonal Relationship”[1] for service  members, strengthening the professionalism of  counselors for soldiers, and increasing the  number of counselors. Safety blind spots in the  barracks will be minimized by expanding the  installation of CCTV in battalion-level units,  Counseling session with a professional counselor for soldiers  and leadership blind spots will also be  minimized by integrating remote units and barracks facilities into the battalion-level camps.  Improvements will be sought continuously for all service members to fulfill their duties in an  environment where safety is guaranteed by strengthening access to medical service to take  care of patients in remote units and reinforcing emergency medical personnel, equipment and  supplies.  **| Open Barracks That Communicate with Society | The ROK military intends to**  establish “open barracks that communicate with society” to promote a culture of mutual  respect and consideration, ensure communications to overcome the sense of disconnection  from society, and guarantee productive military service. For this purpose, communication  channels between parents and units will be established by creating Internet communities and  SNS pages, operating receive-only cell phones for common use, expanding installation of  public video telephones, etc. Also, by developing a reward system for mandatory service  members, establishing a “defense talent donation bank” aimed at character building and  self-development support for service members, and expanding the system to recognize the  service period as college credits, the ROK military will set the conditions for society to  recognize the value of military service.   **| Barracks Where Human Rights Are Guaranteed | Based on the awareness that human**  rights are the foundation of military discipline, the ROK military will establish “barracks that  guarantee human rights” by creating a legal and institutional environment and culture that  ensures human rights in the military. The military will shape the conditions that allow  service members to cultivate their character focused on respecting human dignity by  enhancing character building in schools and military units, expanding the reading coaching  1 Psychological examination tools that complement the limits of the existing self-report test.

43506,"program, and establishing military libraries in  the remote units. Measures to protect the  human rights of service members will also be  put in place through the enactment and  revision of related laws such as the  development of the Framework Act on  Militar y Ser vice (tentative title) and  enforcement of punishment for assault and  Military’s human rights education (August 2014)  battery within barracks. Human rights  awareness by the service members will be enhanced through education on human rights and  military laws with an increased number of professional lecturers for human rights education  besides judicial officers. At the same time, the scope of command and supervision responsi­  bility regarding accidents in each unit will be redefined. Distrust in the military’s handling of  incidents will be mitigated by developing an incident handling procedure manual which  expands civil involvement in the process of dealing with cases.  **| Barracks Where Autonomy and Responsibility Are Harmonized | “Barracks where**  autonomy and responsibility are harmonized” will be established so that service members act  autonomously within the given boundaries based on their sense of ownership and capability  and take responsibility for their actions. To this end, a concept of operation for military  barracks based on autonomy and responsibility and a code of conduct for barracks life will  be established. Also, verbal violence will be prevented by a culture in which communication  based on mutual respect among service members is promoted. Old and small barracks in the  GOPs will be modernized quickly, and the unit management area will be gradually  transferred to the private service sector after taking the available budget into consideration.  By implementing a system that allows soldiers to choose their leave dates and granting visits  to GOP border patrol units on holidays and regular units on weekdays, the ROK military  encourages service members to be more active so that they can mitigate their sense of  isolation and disconnection from society.  **| Strong and Disciplined Barracks | The principle of rewarding good conduct and**  punishing evildoing will be applied in accordance with the laws and regulations in order to  cultivate elite forces to fight and win against the enemy, which is the military’s purpose for  existence. In addition, “strong and disciplined barracks” will be established by improving the  officers’ leadership and setting an example. To this end, the number of newly appointed  officers will be greatly reduced, and a competition and evaluation system for universities in  agreement with academic-military partnerships will be introduced to prevent officer qualifi­",page,198,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

A system to remove  disqualified personnel at an early stage will be put in place by imposing strict evaluation  standards such as a commission requirement evaluation to screen the disqualified personnel.  “Military ethics” will be introduced as a core subject in the candidate and refresher education  to allow service members to be equipped with the proper military values. A customized  specialty granting system for soldiers based on “personal wishes and capabilities” will be  introduced to place the right personnel in the right positions by considering the soldiers’  capabilities. The act of disrupting command structure and hindering the harmony and unity  of units will be eradicated and subject to strict punishment to establish “units that fight and  win” by ensuring trust and solidarity between the heads and their subordinates while the  command authority is firmly established and respected.,page,199,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43508,"**Section 2 Improvement of Welfare for** **Service Members**  The development of the 2[nd] Military Personnel Welfare Basic Plan in 2013 presented an opportunity for  new hope and a vision for the improvement of the quality of life and welfare of military personnel. Based  on this, the ROK military enhances the basic welfare such as food, clothing and shelter, modernizes  barracks facilities, expands the infrastructure for welfare, and increases support for military families to  allow service members to concentrate on their mission of safeguarding their nation.  **1. Establishment of the 2[nd] Military Personnel Welfare Basic Plan**  The MND established the 2[nd] Military Personnel Welfare Basic Plan (2013-2017)[1] in 2013  based on the Framework Act on Military Welfare. The plan is composed of 77 detailed tasks  in seven categories, including soldier welfare, outplacement support, residence support, and  family welfare, based on the achievements and thresholds highlighted by the 1[st] Military  Personnel Welfare Basic Plan established in 2009.  The MND will double the salary for soldiers by 2017 compared to that of 2012 and improve  the compensation system, such as providing insurance for those who passed away during  military service. Regarding the payroll system for military personnel, the MND works to  modify the system to reflect distinct characteristics such as rank, mission, and work  environment in the system. The MND will also develop special enemy contact area  allowances, maritime duty allowances, air crew allowances, and hazardous duty allowances  after considering the risk of their stationed areas and duties.

Also, the MND plans to consistently improve old military residences and  increase the standard amount of military housing lease loans for private residences while  expanding child care centers and cooperative child care spaces in military residences. The  MND will bridge the cultural gap between those working in large cities and those working in  remote areas to provide more cultural benefits for military personnel working in remote  areas.  As such, the 2[nd] Military Personnel Welfare Basic Plan becomes the basis on which  military welfare policies are implemented in a systematic and integrated way. It is expected  that the level of welfare for military personnel will be elevated to one where service members  can feel honored and be proud of their military service.  **Chart 8-1.

To address this issue, a buffering pad was applied inside the helmet and  the chin band was upgraded to better fasten the helmet. Such improvement will reduce  combat fatigue and provide greater protection from external shocks.  The ROK military will continue to research and develop clothing and personal equipment  to prepare for the future battlefield environment as well as supply them early to contribute to  the enhancement of combat capabilities.  **| Supplying Hygienic, Safe Meals | The ROK military offers safe, nutritious and**  well-balanced meals to service members to ensure their health and combat power.  When planning menus, the ROK military applies 3,100 kcal, which is higher than the  recommended 2,600 kcal per day for ordinary people, considering the greater amount of  physical activities carried out by service members such as education and training. It also  gradually increases the basic meal allowance for service members to provide various main  meals, high-quality snacks and desserts that are attuned to the tastes of young service  members.",page,202,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

Therefore, nothing is more important than the safety and hygiene of meals.  For this reason, the ROK military enhances safety and hygiene management by phase from  signing the food supplies contract to serving meals.  When making a contract for food supplies, the ROK military prefers Hazard Analysis  Critical Control Point System (HACCP)-certified companies and conducts joint hygiene  inspections of the contractors that supply to the military twice a year in cooperation with the  Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS), etc. When any problem occurs with food  supplies, the ROK military reports the case to the MFDS and the relevant local government  so that the materials can be retrieved and discarded, while the companies involved are  strictly excluded from military food supply contracts. In the future, the ROK military will  establish 11 modernized military food supply centers in each region by 2019 so that food  materials can be delivered in a refrigerated or frozen state from producers to military units,  thereby enhancing the safety and hygiene management of meals.   **| Military Barracks Modernization | The MND refurbishes the military barracks to**  ensure a convenient living environment for the young service members.  2 Net food material cost, including the cost for main meals, snacks and dessert.",page,203,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

During Phase 1 (2003-2009), old and confined barracks in  the forward and remote areas constructed prior to 1982 were improved first. During Phase 2 (2010-2012), barracks constructed after 1983 were renovated and expanded. Phase 3 (2013-)  of the project is improving additional barracks according to the Defense Reform Basic Plan (2014-2030).  With the project for military barracks modernization, the living area per person has been  expanded from 2.3 ㎡ in platoon-sized, floor-type rooms to 6.3 ㎡ in squad-sized, bed-type  rooms.

Expansion of Welfare Infrastructure for Service Members**  The MND makes efforts to expand and improve military welfare facilities by considering  the characteristics of military service which involve long standby duty and the fact that most  of the units are located on islands and in mountainous areas.  The MND established the MND Welfare Agency by integrating the welfare agencies of the  Army, Navy and Air Force in 2010, and allows service members to enjoy more benefits by  enhancing the efficiency of welfare management and improving the conditions of each  welfare facility. In March 2014, the MND completed the construction of the MND  Convention Center within the MND complex and is expected to build additional welfare  facilities and residence buildings such as the MND culture and research center, military  apartments, and dormitories for service members’ children in Wirye New Town by 2016,  thereby greatly improving the conditions of leisure, welfare and residence for service  members.  The MND implements a renovation project for outdated welfare centers and military",page,204,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43513,"supermarkets. As for the units that are planned  to be shut down or relocated, and therefore the  project for military barracks modernization is  not applied, the MND has built military  community centers. The military community  centers have various convenience facilities  such as libraries, cyber knowledge information  facilities, singing rooms, snack bars, and  Soldiers participating in the reading program  barber shops where service members can  spend their free time in a healthy and sound way.  The MND has supplied exercise equipment to the fitness centers to improve the service  members’ conditions for physical training. By establishing an exercise equipment supply plan  according to the size of units, the MND provided exercise equipment to 694 units in 2012  and 1,512 units in 2013. In addition, the MND established 311 futsal fields for units on  islands and in forward and remote areas between 2013 and 2014.  To enhance the fairness of welfare benefits, the MND plans to build additional welfare  facilities with a focus on areas that are falling behind in terms of welfare condition. In  forward areas, the MND plans to establish welfare facilities for soldiers only and reestablish  the Korean Army hotel in Seoul by 2017 to provide accommodations for soldiers during  off-post visits. It also plans to improve welfare for service members and their families living  in remote island areas by constructing an integrated welfare center on Baengnyeongdo  Island.  In the future, the MND will continue to improve the welfare infrastructure for service  members by listening to the voices of service members and conducting satisfaction surveys  on a regular basis.  **4. Expansion of Military Family Support Policies**   **| Expansion of Military Child Care Facilities | In order to improve the poor child care**  conditions for the children of service members, the MND has secured child care facilities by  phases in conjunction with the military residence construction plan. The MND has been  operating 64 military child care centers as of September 2014 and plans to raise the number  to 180 or more by 2020. The criteria for building child care centers in forward areas was  revised from units with 100 or more military households to those with 15 or more children  who require daycare.  In areas where the installation of child care centers is limited, the MND establishes",page,205,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43514,"“cooperative child care spaces” in military residences in coordination with the Ministry of  Gender Equality and Family. In these cooperative child care spaces parents can share  information on child care, while children can play with others in a safe and comfortable  environment. The MND opened the first cooperative child care space in Cheolwon,  Gangwon-do in December 2013, and plans to increase the number to 15 by 2016.  **| Expansion of the Military Residence Support Project | Stable residence support is the**  most important element of family welfare for service members who frequently move and  work in remote areas.  The MND supports military residences for  service members by establishing the legal  grounds for residence suppor t in the  Framework Act on Military Welfare, and  continues to improve outdated, small  residences. For those who cannot move into  military housings, the MND provides lease  loans for private residences, and from 2015, it  Military child care center  matches the standard amount of loans to the  realistic level of the market price for a lease by region.  The MND also implements various policies to increase the number of career service  members that own houses. Therefore, the MND amended the Framework Act on Military  Welfare and the Rules on Housing Supply in order to provide service members who are  non-homeowners and have been in the military for at least 10 years with opportunities to  have priority and preference in special housing. With such amendments, the MND has  supplied about 3,760 houses from 2007 to September 2014 and plans to provide 1,400 more  in the public housing site in Wirye New Town located in the Greater Seoul Metropolitan  Area (GSMA).  **| Establishment of Boarding Schools for Military Children | Career service members**  have long faced the challenge of providing quality education for their children, as they  frequently relocate and often work in small and remote areas.  To provide stable education for military children, the MND established Hanmin High  School, a boarding school, in March 2014. Since the children studying in this school can  focus on their studies without worrying about being transferred, their parents can better  concentrate on their military duties. This is expected to greatly contribute to enhancing the  morale of career service members and recruiting talented human resources. As the school  can accommodate only 5% of military children who are about to enter high school, it is",page,206,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

The  ROK military will enhance the health of service members and their combat capabilities by developing a  defense medical system that is trusted by the service members and the people.  **1. Disease Prevention and Early Diagnosis**  **| Tailored Control of Infectious Diseases | The MND has established a control**  management system for infectious diseases by considering the outbreak cycles of major  infectious diseases, and continues to expand the types and coverage of vaccines for service  members.  Previously, Hepatitis A vaccination was only administered to the trainees in some recruit  training battalions in forward areas; however, the vaccination is now administered to all  Army service members working in Gangwon-do and Gyeonggi-do. Also, the vaccination for  pertussis is administered when vaccinations for tetanus and diphtheria are given.  Considering that immunity is usually developed 15 days after vaccination, the MND will  look into options to maximize the effects of vaccination by administering them early for  service members before they join the military.  **| Health Counseling for New Recruits and Modification of Medical Checkups for**  **Corporals | The ROK military continues to execute a system in which new recruits go**  24 hours in a field hospital",page,208,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

Also, in 2012,  the ROK military test-operated a system in which corporals receive medical checkups  equivalent to that provided by the National Health Service to identify and treat diseases at an  early stage. As this system started to be implemented in full swing since 2013, more  examination surgeons were put in place. If anything suspicious is detected from the  checkups, it is double-checked by a surgeon, and the patients are hospitalized if needed.  **2.

In the past, only the limited evacuation assets available for use attached to the  patient’s unit were used for evacuation. However, an improvement was made to widen the  range of evacuation assets to include military and government helicopters and various other  assets.  Currently, the ROK military is evacuating patients using utility helicopters that are  equipped only with first aid equipment; however, it will introduce helicopters solely  dedicated to the purpose of medical evacuation by 2019 to provide treatment for emergency  patients during evacuation.  **| Vitalizing Civil-Government-Military Cooperation on Medical Treatment | The MND**  concluded agreements with the Ministry of Public Safety and Security and the Korean Red  Cross to cooperate in the field of emergency patient evacuation and emergency treatment  education. The military hospitals and division-level medical units of the Army, Navy and Air  Force are also effectively responding to emergency patients based on medical treatment  agreements concluded with civilian hospitals located in their closest proximity. In particular,  the Marine Corps HQ concluded an agreement with the city of Incheon to provide medical  support for local residents of Baengnyeongdo Island such as treatments for ear, nose, throat  and eyes, and CT scanning.

43522,"their duties, and compensate for opportunity costs due to the mandatory military service.  The military service compensation point system was developed to provide those who  faithfully completed their services with extra points when they search for jobs. The system  was first introduced in 1961; however, it was abolished by the ROK Constitutional Court in  December 1999, as they decided that the system was unconstitutional. Unfortunately, the  abolition of the point system caused many problems including the demoralization of service  members conducting mandatory service and the weakening of justification for the mandatory  military service.  The MND is pushing to reintroduce the military service compensation point system to find  ways to support those who have completed their military services and inspire pride in their  fulfillment of military duties. The National Assembly is also reviewing the “Revision of the  Military Service Act” which was proposed as legislation sponsored by lawmakers. The  contents of the legislation reflect the intent of the judgment of unconstitutionality in 1999,  and include providing a certain level of extra points to individuals applying for public  positions, limiting the ratio of recipients of the points being accepted to the total accepted,  and restricting the period or number of times for receiving benefits of extra points. The  MND is working to find the middle ground on this matter by carefully listening to the  various opinions related to the system.  **3. Operating Military Pension System that Reflects the Uniqueness of Military** **Service**  A military pension system was introduced to contribute to the stable living conditions and  improved welfare of career service members by providing them and their families with  monetary compensation once they retire after their faithful service period. The pension  system also provides the service members or their families with monetary compensation if  the service member retires or passes away due to physical or mental problems, or receives  medical treatment due to diseases or injuries acquired while on duty.  **| Characteristics of the Military Pension System | Service members work under harsh**  conditions while risking their lives, and they usually retire between the ages of 45 and 56,  when the level of their living expenditures is the highest. As such, the military pension  system is intended to provide social insurance and livelihood security as well as national  compensation for their services.  The military pension plays a crucial role in allowing service members to focus on their  duties while enduring harsh work conditions without worrying about their lives after",page,214,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43523,"retirement. In particular, the military pension can also be seen as a national security expense  necessary to acquire a capable workforce in the military. Advanced countries also provide  more preferential benefits to the military pension compared to the other public pension  programs in consideration of such characteristics of the military pension.  **| Efforts towards Financial Stabilization | Because the military pension was first paid**  out in 1961, which was during the early stage of its introduction, the military pension system  did not have the opportunity to accumulate enough funding. Therefore, most of the pension  payments have been appropriated by the national budget.  The MND has continuously improved the pension system to stabilize funding. Through the  Military Pension Act revised in 2013, it has raised the amount of contributions and shares  borne by service members as well as the government, and contributed to the stabilization of  pension funding by demanding service members with more than 33 years of service to pay  contributions. At the same time, however, the MND decided to maintain the timing and the  amount of pensions to be paid out at the current level, considering the unique characteristics  of military service.   **| Enhancing the Efficiency of the Pension Payment System | The MND makes efforts**  to improve recipient satisfaction and administrative efficiency by making precise payments  and closely collaborating with the relevant administrative agencies. In July 2013, to better  protect the livelihood for pension recipients, the MND decided to allow them to receive their  pension payment in cash, which is usually remitted to savings accounts only, in case their  savings accounts are seized. From May 2014, the MND started to issue a card-type pension  certificate equipped with a bank transaction function in order to enhance the dignity and  satisfaction of pension recipients.",page,215,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

43526,"**Section 1 Improvement of Defense Regulations** **and the Public’s Rights and Benefits**  The ROK military makes efforts to improve defense regulations and promote people’s rights and benefits  to the extent that military operations are not affected with the goal of coexistence between the public and  the military. First of all, it modifies defense regulations to resolve people’s inconveniences and protect  their property rights, and improves abnormal practices and systems which have accumulated for a long  time in the field of national defense. As the areas surrounding military installations become urbanized, the  ROK military adjusts military installation protection zones and improves related systems in a reasonable  manner. It also comes up with measures related to military airbase relocation and noise prevention in  consideration of public demands and consistently makes efforts to operate the military in an environmen­  tally friendly manner.  **1. Improvement of Regulations and Normalization of Abnormal Practices**  **| Improving Regulations Pertaining to National Defense | The basic direction of the**  MND’s regulatory reform is to resolve people’s inconveniences and protect their property  rights to the extent that military operations are not adversely affected. The MND actively  implements its regulatory reform in consideration of the uniqueness of the ROK’s security  conditions. In 2013, the MND contributed to enhancing people’s convenience and invigo­  rating the economy by making improvements in various areas such as adjusting military  installation protection zones and improving the related systems, enhancing the military  supply system of the MND Welfare Agency, and expanding the commercialization of  military supplies. In 2014, the MND also made efforts to adjust military installation  protection zones and improve the related systems, adjust various requirements for  employment, and upgrade systems to invigorate defense exports by selecting them as major  tasks.  To prevent unnecessary regulations from being added in the defense area, the MND  utilizes an internal regulatory reform committee to review the appropriateness of the  regulation when there is a need to add or reinforce regulations pertaining to laws. In 2014, by  organizing a defense regulatory reform task force, the MND established the Regulatory  Reform Implementation Plan and identified major tasks. It continues to monitor the  implementation progress on a regular basis. As part of the reforms, the MND convened an  open forum in which the public participated and made an overall review of regulations",page,218,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43527,"pertaining to defense legislation.  In 2014, the MND identified contents regarding regulations by reviewing not only the  relevant laws but also the internal rules of the ministry as well as the Army, Navy and Air  Force, and is continuing to modify the regulations that need improvement.  In September 2013, a contest inviting ideas and proposals from the public was held for the  first time by the MND in order to effectively resolve people’s inconveniences. It also operates  a bulletin board on the MND’s website to collect various ideas and opinions from the public.  The MND will continue to make efforts in a variety of ways so that the people can  personally feel the effects of regulatory reform.  **| Normalization of Abnormal Practices | The MND strives to realize a clean and**  transparent defense by reforming abnormal practices and systems that have accumulated in  the defense area according to the government’s policy to implement “normalization of  abnormal practices.”  The MND makes efforts to handle fatal accidents in a fair and transparent manner by  selecting “improving reliability in the handling of fatal accidents in the military” as one of  the major tasks for the normalization of abnormal practices. In May 2014, the MND  strengthened the privileges of those who died during military service by granting funeral and  ceremonial procedures equivalent to those who died in the line of duty.  In September 2014, the MND established the “Central Distinguished Service Mortality  Evaluation Committee” with the majority of the committee members being selected from the  outside by amending the Instructions for Distinguished Service Casualty Process. Thus, by  allowing the committee to review the first trial decisions of the Army, Navy and Air Force,  the MND resolved the controversy over impartiality and unified the standards that are used  to determine the retrials.  As the number of bodies and remains left untaken by families for a long time are  increasing, problems pertaining to the treatment of the deceased have started to occur.  Against this backdrop, the MND has established a task force to encourage the bereaved  families to take the bodies and remains.  For those who died during military service, the MND actively promotes a plan to expand  the scope of subjects to be buried at the national cemetery if the government fails to prove  that the death has nothing to do with military duty.  By selecting “improving the unauthorized use of private and public land and utilizing idle  land in military installations” as a normalization task, the MND will take the necessary  measures to solve problems such as buying, setting up surface rights on, or leasing required  land while returning unnecessary land. It will also systematically classify the idle land in  military installations and sell them or transfer them to the Ministry of Strategy and Finance,",page,219,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43528,"or utilize them in phases.  The MND implements the task of “eradicating defense supplies corruption,” which has  long been raised in the area of defense capability improvement, as part of the efforts to  normalize abnormal practices. In February 2014, the MND built a cooperative network with  certified test agencies to block forgery and falsification of test records and establish  measures to prevent their recurrence. It also promotes the legislation of the Fair Cost Price  Act, which includes the compulsory submission of cost price data, investigation of cost price  data, and redemption of illicit gains, while reforming the cost price management system,  including expanding outsourcing and the cost price information system.  Regarding negotiated contracts with veterans’ affairs and welfare organizations, the MND  stimulates competition among organizations by checking their faithfulness in implementing  contracts. For weapons system purchase projects, the MND strengthens transparency in  selecting contractors by newly adding credit ratings to the evaluation list. It also enhances  regular checkups and prevention systems by expanding internal inspections and ombudsman  activities.  In the military administration area, the MND has adjusted the mandatory service age  standard for those with obligations to support, those with the ability for self-support, and  those who are dependents to a realistic level by strengthening the standard for reduction of or  exemption from military service due to difficulties in making a living, and the standard for  exemption from physical checkups for conscription for the disabled. Also, individuals who  were exempt from military service as a disabled person without receiving a military service  physical checkup will now have to fulfill their military service if their disability condition  improves.  To resolve the problem of artistic personnel being concentrated in certain areas, the MND  has reformed the enrollment standard for artistic personnel and mandated that artistic and  sports personnel donate their talent to culturally underprivileged communities. In addition,  the MND strives to promote equity and fairness in the fulfillment of military service by  establishing grounds to manage the fulfillment of military service by entertainers and  athletes who draw public attention. It has developed a system to prevent and crack down on  military service exemption cases due to intentional physical damage and deception, and  strengthens public relations activities in order to establish a sound barracks culture.  In order to implement the normalization of abnormal practices, the MND has internally set  three areas for improvement: “breaking down outmoded conventions and improving culture,”  “reforming customs” and “improving systems” and has carried out tasks such as “managing  the talent pool based on capabilities,” “strengthening personal information protection,”  “establishing a horizontal contract culture,” and “improving the management procedure for  donated funds and gifts.”",page,220,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43529,"The MND will continue to identify normalization tasks through internal proposals, public  idea contests, etc. in order to fundamentally correct inappropriate practices and systems in  the defense area, which in turn contributes to building a strong military focused on combat  missions.  **2. Streamlining Regulations Related to Military Installation Protection Zones**   **| Reasonable Management of Military Installation Protection Zones | As the military**  operational environment is changing, the MND adjusted the Civilian Control Line from 15  km to 10 km from the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) in 2008 to guarantee the property  rights of the people. Since then, a total of 356.57 million ㎡ of land has been removed from  the list of military installation protection zones, while a total of 302.57 million ㎡ of  controlled protection zones[1] have been downgraded to restricted protection zones[2] from 2008  to 2014.  **Chart 9-1.

43530,"The MND will continue to reduce and adjust the military installation protection zones to  the extent that military operations are not affected so as to contribute to protecting the  people’s property rights and the development of local communities.  **| Improving Systems Pertaining to Military Installation Protection Zones | The MND**  is continuously amending the laws pertaining to the utilization of land by the people along  with the removal and relaxing of military installation protection zones. The MND shortened  the period of consultation from 30 to 15 days in the case of construction of buildings that do  not exceed the height restriction within flight safety zones by revising the Directive on the  Management of Military Bases and Military Installation Protection Zones in 2013. The  MND also introduced a preliminary counseling system that provides information on  necessary documents, procedures, and acceptable height prior to consultation. It will  continue to seek improvements in the systems such as disclosing the height restriction  information within the flight safety zones on the Internet in order to prevent buildings  exceeding the height limit from being designed.  **| Resolving Problems Pertaining to Regulations through Civil, Government and**  **Military Cooperation | The MND held meetings with the local governments of**  Gyeonggi-do, Gangwon-do, etc. in April and May 2014 to streamline regulations pertaining  to military installations that are substantially affecting local residents. Through these  meetings, the MND has identified 70 tasks to carry out, including the expansion of housing  in military installation protection zones. To implement these tasks with a focus on actual  work sites, the MND operates a working-level consultative group for regulatory  improvement among the MND, local governments and military units. It will substantially  resolve issues related to regulations by collecting the opinions of local residents through a  thorough site investigation.  **| Adjusting the Ammunition Safety Distance and Relocating Ammunition Facilities |**  In the areas near ammunition facilities, the MND sets a minimum safety distance to protect  the lives and properties of local residents living nearby. It is inevitable that personal property  rights such as building extensions to existing buildings are partially limited to some extent  within the safety distance. Local residents are consistently demanding that the military  relocate ammunition facilities or reduce the safety distance. Accordingly, the MND carries  out a study on safety standards for ammunition and explosive materials in cooperation with  the Agency for Defense Development to protect the people’s property rights and utilize land  efficiently. Accordingly, in order to adjust the ammunition safety distance, the MND actively  strives to guarantee the people’s property rights by building underground ammunition storage",page,222,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43531,"facilities and optimizing the amount of ammunition to be stored.  **3. Relocation of Military Airbases and Noise Prevention Measures**   The Special Act on Military Airbase Relocation and Support was enacted in 2013 to  resolve public complaints about noise from military airbases and infringement of people’s  property rights due to limitations on development.  To enforce the Special Act, the MND established the Military Airbase Relocation Bureau  in 2014. The bureau reviews proposals on military airbase relocation suggested by local  governments by considering the efficiency of operation execution, degree of damage caused  by noise, funding method, etc.[3] The MND operates an advisory group and evaluation  committee consisting of experts from different fields under the leadership of the head of the  Military Airbase Relocation Bureau to evaluate the suggested proposals in an objective and  fair manner.  The MND operates a consultative group for conflict management which consists of  representatives from the MND, military, local governments, and local residents in order to  handle conflicts that occur during the implementation of relocation projects. The consultative  group will play a role in preventing potential conflicts between the military and locals to  facilitate the implementation of projects.  The MND pursues the enactment of the Military Airbase Noise Prevention and Affected  Areas Assistance Act to resolve noise issues in areas near airbases and shooting ranges. The  proposed act stipulates the establishment of a noise prevention committee, measurements of  noise levels, and support policies for the areas affected by noise after being designated and  proclaimed as an affected area.  Besides the act’s enactment, the MND will continue to make efforts to reduce noise from  military airbases and shooting ranges by installing noise prevention facilities, improving  flight procedures, altering flight routes, restricting night flights and shooting training, and  avoiding highly populated areas when making flights.  3 Military airbase relocation procedure: Suggestion of relocation (the head of the local government that is currently housing the military  airbase) → Review of the relocation suggestion (by the Defense Minister) → Selection of potential relocation sites → Deliberation on selection of potential relocation sites (by the relocation site selection committee) → Establishment and deliberation on support plan for areas close to the relocation site (by the relocation project support committee) → Announcement of relocation site selection → Resident vote and application to bid (the head of the local government of the potential relocation site) → Deliberation on selection of relocation site → Implementation of relocation and support works.",page,223,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43532,"**4. Eco-Friendly Military Management**  **| Expanding and Improving the Military’s Basic Environmental Facilities | The ROK**  military operates basic environmental facilities to prevent environmental contamination  generated by the military from damaging neighboring areas. It strengthens cooperation with  local governments so that domestic sewage can be treated in the local governments’ public  sewage treatment facilities.  The MND has installed bank dikes that block off oil leakage from oil storage facilities as  well as auto oil leakage detection systems to manage the soil environment. It also regularly  conducts tests on the level of contamination around the areas adjacent to the facilities. The  MND carries out soil environment assessments prior to the relocation and shutdown of  military units and takes necessary measures according to the assessment results.  **| Environmental Purification Activities for Returned USFK Bases | The MND carries**  out thorough environmental inspections of returned USFK bases to identify possible soil  pollution. If soil pollution is detected, it deals with the case according to domestic environ­  mental laws. A total of 51 USFK bases have been returned as of September 2014. For 17  returned bases that exceeded the domestic environmental pollution limit, the MND  completed pollution purification projects and eased concerns over soil pollution in the  returned USFK bases by disclosing the purification process to local residents, civic groups  and the media and giving on-site explanations. The MND will implement pollution purifi­  cation projects for the USFK bases that are scheduled to be returned after the construction of  a USFK base in Pyeongtaek is completed if their pollution levels exceed the domestic  environmental pollution standard.  **| Improving Working Conditions for Service Members and Establishing Measures to**  **Reduce Harmful Substances | The MND improves the environment of the facilities**  where service members live in order to prevent them from being exposed to harmful  substances. A 2013 investigation result of radon (Rn) concentrations in military barracks  showed that 498 out of 3,357 investigation points were over the acceptable level of 148 Bq/㎥.  The MND plans to improve those barracks that exceeded the standard by 2016. It is also  investigating approximately 2,100 barracks which were not included in the previous investi­  gation.  The MND also improves the environment to protect the health of indoor shooting range  operators. It plans to complete an improvement project for 35 shooting ranges that exceeded  0.05 mg/㎥, the lead concentration limit in the air, in the 2014 survey by 2015 and apply a  new facility standard for newly established ranges starting from 2016.",page,224,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43533,"**Section 2 Enhancement of Benefits for** **War Veterans and Service Members Killed** **in Action**  The MND demonstrates the nation’s strong will to carry out the responsibility for “taking care of those who  have sacrificed themselves for the nation until the end” through patriots and veterans affairs projects,  including the Korean War remains recovery project. For this, the MND enhances the benefits for war veter­  ans and improves compensation systems to make sure that those who died or were disabled while  conducting their official duties are properly rewarded.   **1. Recovery of Korean War Remains**  The MND founded the MND Agency for KIA  Recovery and Identification (MAKRI) in January 2007  and operates it as a special agency for the recovery of war  remains. Currently, there are approximately 200  personnel working in five divisions, which include  planning, investigation, recovery, identification, and  support, and eight recovery teams.  To accelerate the recovery of Korean War remains, the  MND reinforced the investigation and identification staff  by adding four professional exploration staff members  and an identification staff member in 2013 and another  Recovery and collection of war remains  investigation staff member in 2014 while adopting three  types of identification equipment, including full-body X-ray scanners.

The  personal identifications of 91 war KIAs have additionally been confirmed. To find more  remains while war veterans and bereaved families are alive, the MND has established an  intensive recovery system at the corps level based on the basic survey results of the locations  of remains.

Through  this effort, they established scientific grounds for calculation criteria for the number of  remains and the target number for recovery. In particular, in 2014, MAKRI received interna­  tional recognition for its professionalism by applying stable isotope analysis[1] in identifying  the nationality of unidentified war remains.  1 A technique to determine the geographic origin (Korea or North America) of remains by analyzing bone structures in the body (body  bones, teeth) which are formed differently according to lifestyles and eating habits.",page,226,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43535,"Despite its short 10-year history, the remains recovery project has shown rapid  development, and its experience and techniques have reached a level that is globally  recognized. Recently, the ROK military supported the recovery and identification of those  missing during the Libyan Revolution upon the Libyan government’s request.[2]  The MND will strive to implement the nation’s unlimited responsibility by reinforcing  professionals for the MAKRI and further developing remains recovery technologies.  **2. Reinforcing Benefits and Uplifting Honor for War Veterans**   The MND makes efforts to reinforce the privileges of Korean War veterans for their  sacrifice and dedication while uplifting their honor.  The MND is registering non-military personnel who took part in the Korean War as  meritorious individuals through the “deliberation committee for verification of participation  in war.” The MND supports these individuals by providing various benefits such as an  honorary allowance for participating in the war, a support fund from local governments,  placement of meritorious individuals and their spouses in the national cemetery, reduced  medical costs at veterans’ hospitals, and special allocation of national housing.  The MND has implemented various activities such as improving facilities in the Seoul  National Cemetery so that it is more public friendly, and invigorating training programs  designed to promote patriotism.  I n 2014, i n celebrat ion of t he 60 [t h]  anniversary of the Korean War, the MND  selected the “Incheon Landing Operations,”  “Battle of the Nakdonggang River District”  and “Battle of the Chuncheon District” as the  th ree major victor y com memoration  ceremonies. At these victory commemoration  ceremonies, equipment exhibitions, experience  Incheon Landing Operations victory commemoration  programs, battle reenactment events, etc. were ceremony (September 2014)  provided to raise the spirit of victory for the  public and uplift the sense of honor and pride for war veterans.  As described above, the MND will continue to raise the patriotism of the people and  inherit the sacrifices and contributions that the war veterans have made by developing  2 A support team for the identification of missing persons in Libya, consisting of seven MAKRI personnel, was deployed to Libya (from  July 2, 2012 to July 28, 2014).",page,227,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43536,"policies to improve respectful treatment and honor for war veterans and holding various  commemoration events.  **3. Strengthening the Nation’s Responsibility towards the Deceased and Dis­** **abled Service Members**  The MND improves its compensation systems to provide appropriate compensation for  those who died or were disabled while executing their official duties.  Until recently, disability compensation was provided for those rated Grade 1 to Grade 7  with mental or physical disabilities. However, the scope of beneficiaries was expanded to  Grade 9 by amending the Enforcement Decree of the Military Pension Act in 2013, which in  turn improved the fairness of the compensation systems. With this, service members who  retire from the military with Grade 8 to 9 mental or physical disabilities that were incurred  during the execution of official duties are also entitled to receive compensation for their  disabilities.  To strengthen compensation for self-inflicted deaths, in 2012, the MND has revised the  Instructions for Distinguished Service Casualty Process so that self-inflicted deaths can also  be recognized as those who died in the line of duty if the deaths were related to official  duties. In addition, reexamination can be conducted if the cause of death is recommended to  be death while on duty by other government agencies such as the Anti-Corruption & Civil  Rights Commission and the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. From October  2014, the MND has established a reexamination committee which was previously operated in  the Army, Navy and Air Force, and more than half of the members of the committee are  composed of civilians such as experts on human rights, lawyers, and forensic science  specialists. It also improves compensation systems for those who died in the military in line  with society’s elevated awareness of human rights such as easing the standard for acknowl­  edging self-inflicted deaths as those who died in the line of duty by considering the Supreme  Court’s decision regarding the correlation between self-inflicted death and official duties.  The MND will continue to improve the related systems to strengthen the nation’s responsi­  bilities towards service members who sacrificed themselves for the country.",page,228,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43537,"**Section 3 Development of the Public** **Disaster and Safety Support System**  The ROK military, as the armed forces of the people, actively strives to protect the lives and property of  the public in the case of national disasters. To this end, it refines its response manuals to ensure that  disasters are managed in a systematic manner throughout the whole process of disaster prevention,  preparation, response and restoration. Furthermore, the ROK military reinforces the disaster readiness  posture by conducting exercises and education.   **1. Establishment of the Public Disaster Support System**  **| Civil-Government-Military Cooperation System to Prepare for Disasters | The ROK**  military establishes a disaster support system for the people in cooperation with disaster  management agencies such as the Ministry of Public Safety and Security (MPSS) and the  Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT), and local governments.  First, the ROK military refines the “crisis response action manual by disaster type” in  cooperation with disaster management agencies. It develops crisis response capabilities by  actively participating in the Safe Korea Exercise (SKX) held by the MPSS, applying the  manual to actual exercises, and updating the manual based on the lessons learned.  Second, the ROK military maintains a crisis readiness posture to respond to possible  disasters by operating more than 400 disaster status control centers in each unit of the Army,  Navy and Air Force. When local governments or local fire stations request support from  associated local military units, they take action in a timely and appropriate manner according  to the discretion of the unit commanders. The MND controls and supervises the overall  process of support.  Third, the ROK military strengthens disaster response training for personnel carrying out  disaster-related duties. As the types of disasters are currently becoming more diversified and  complex, a high level of professionalism in disaster response is required. Accordingly, the  MND carries out professional training for personnel carrying out disaster-related duties in  the Army, Navy and Air Force every April.",page,229,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

The ROK military  deployed approximately 59,000 troops and 200  pieces of equipment to actively support the  slaughter of the infected livestock, operation of  temporary control posts, quarantine activities,  _Sewol ferry incident rescue support (April 2014)_  etc.  In February 2014, record snowfall left some of the residents of the eastern coast area  isolated, causing serious damages. The ROK military urgently deployed a total of approxi­  mately 120,000 troops and 2,000 pieces of equipment and swiftly implemented snow removal  operations while providing medical support for residents in isolated areas, making  passageways and supplying daily necessities.  In April 2014, when the Sewol ferry incident occurred, the ROK military deployed troops,  including the Ship Salvage Unit (SSU), and equipment, including vessels and aircraft, and  actively supported after-accident activities in close cooperation with the related organi­  zations.  The status of disaster damage restoration support provided for the last five years is shown  in Chart 9-6.

Establishing Overseas Disaster Relief Support System and Strengthening** **Cooperation**  Major disasters in several overseas countries recently have caused so much damage that  one country alone cannot bear the burden, requiring the international community to provide  humanitarian assistance collectively.  The ROK government plays a role as a member of the international community as seen by  the enactment of the Overseas Emergency Relief Act in 2007 to provide emergency relief aid  to foreign countries. The ROK military established the “military transport aircraft mission  support system for overseas emergency relief” in May 2010 so that it can provide support  within 48 hours if a disaster occurs in any of the 15 Asian countries. To this end, the ROK  military has organized the Korea Disaster Relief Team (KDRT) and carries out response  training and transport aircraft capacity verification exercises annually.  In July 2012, the ROK military verified its overseas transport capabilities and, in March  2013, it conducted response training in preparation for the third ASEAN Regional Forum  Disaster Relief Exercise (ARF DiREx). In May 2013, in the third exercise co-hosted by the  ROK and Thailand, the largest number of personnel ever participated, including approxi­  mately 1,800 personnel from 27 countries and around 240 disaster relief personnel from the  ROK. The ROK Army’s specialized disaster relief unit and the Navy’s Ship Salvage Unit (SSU) have successfully executed search and rescue operations in cooperation with other  participating countries, including the United States and Australia, which enhanced the ROK  military’s disaster relief capabilities through humanitarian assistance.  In November 2013, when Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines, the ROK military swiftly  transported the KDRT and supplies by using transport aircraft. It also airlifted disaster relief  goods to the disaster-stricken areas in the Philippines and transported local people and",page,232,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

43542,"**Section 4 Improvement of the Military** **Service System and Military Administration**  The MND improves the military service system and military administration to strengthen the military’s  combat capabilities and create an environment where military duty is fulfilled in a fair manner. To improve  fairness and efficiency in carrying out military service duties, the MND develops military service systems  such as a recruiting system and switchover service and alternative service systems. It also continuously  refines its military administration procedures by carrying out various initiatives such as establishing  measures to prevent the evasion of military duties and establishing a thorough checkup system for  conscription.  **1. Development of the Military Service System**  **| Reducing the Military Service Period for Enlisted Service Members | The MND**  implements the “reduction of the military service period for enlisted service members” as  one of the national goals to alleviate the burden of military duties on the people. However,  various prerequisites need to be satisfied such as improving security circumstances,  establishing measures to prevent the proficiency degradation of enlisted service members,  and acquiring the appropriate defense budget to increase the number of non-commissioned  officers and improve incentives for officers and non-commissioned officers. The MND will  review the issue of reducing the military service period for enlisted service members in the  mid and long term by considering the fulfillment of these conditions.  **Chart 9-8. Changes in Military Service Period for Enlisted Service Members**  Unit: Months  |Year|1953|1959|1962|1968|1977|1979|1984|1990|1993|1994|2003|2004|2008|2011| |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---| |Army and Marine Corps|36|33|30|36|33|33|30|30|26|26|24|24|18|21| |Navy|36|36|36|39|39|35|35|32|30|28|26|26|20|23| |Air Force|36|36|36|39|39|35|35|35|30|30|28|27|21|24|    **| Improving the Recruiting System | The MND has implemented a “salaried volunteer**",page,234,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43543,"servicemen system” since January 2008 to prevent the weakening of the military’s combat  capabilities due to a lack of skilled service members, which is a result of the reduced military  service period for enlisted service members.  Salaried volunteer servicemen are classified into two categories, as shown in Chart 9-9.  Combat and technically proficient soldiers (Type I) are selected from the regular troops with  a high proficiency level, and they serve as staff sergeants for six to 18 months according to  their wish after their mandatory service as a regular service member is completed. Advanced  equipment operators (Type II) are selected from the civilian pool prior to enlistment, and  these troops serve for three years from the day of enlistment. They serve as regular troops  during their mandatory service period, but upon completion of this period, they serve the  remainder of the three years as staff sergeants.  **Chart 9-9. Status of Salaried Volunteer Servicemen System by Type**  |Category|Selected by|Service Period|Service Area|Payment*| |---|---|---|---|---| |Combat and technically proficient soldiers (Type I)|Army, Navy and Air Force|6-18 months|Combat and technically proficient positions|Approx. 1.35 million won per month| |Advanced equipment operators (Type II)|Military Manpower Administration|3 years|Advanced equipment operating positions|Approx. 1.95 million won per month|   *[ Based on the third-class salary for staff sergeants in 2014]  Due to the lack of applicants for the advanced equipment operator category, mainly caused  by the relatively long service period, the MND expands the eligible application pool to active  service members. It continues to make efforts to improve working conditions by gradually  increasing the short-term staff sergeant promotion rate for salaried volunteer servicemen  whose experience and qualities are sufficiently verified and pursuing the provision of  overtime allowances.  From 2014, the MND has implemented the “tailored specialist system”[1] to expand opportu­  nities to serve as technical specialists for military service candidates with educational  backgrounds of a high school education or less who rarely serve as technical specialists. The  tailored specialist system will be test-operated in the Army for two years from 2014 and  expanded to the Navy and Air Force in the future.   1 This is a recruitment system especially for military service candidates with educational backgrounds  of a high school education or less. In this system, selected service members can receive the technical training that fits their aptitude, fulfill their military duty as technical specialists and easily join society later, such as by getting a job.

43544,"**| Improving the Switchover Service and Alternative Service Systems | The**  switchover service[2] and alternative service[3] systems currently in force will be maintained at  the current level until 2015. Starting from 2016, the MND will improve the systems by  considering the future security environment and the military manpower supply prospect that  takes into account the low birth rate and population ageing.  To set up the right concept for a social service system, the title of “public service  personnel” was changed to “social service personnel” in 2013. The social service personnel  are first deployed in social service areas such as social welfare, health and medical treatment  rather than in administrative support areas. The MND continuously improves the system by  deploying more field guidance personnel and strengthening counseling service to solve  difficult situations for social service personnel and get them to focus better on the areas  concerned.  Meanwhile, for skilled industrial personnel, the MND stably provides the tailored  manpower required for work sites by deploying vocational high school and meister high  school graduates. Technical research personnel are no longer assigned to large enterprises,  but to small and medium-sized companies, which is contributing to the easing of manpower  shortfalls in the industrial sector.  **| Expanding Support of National Health Insurance from Government Funding |**  Questions on the equitable treatment of military service members have been raised since  full-time reservists[4] and social service personnel have to pay their national health insurance  premiums out of pocket despite the fact that they get paid the same amount as active service  members and are also completing their military services.  To resolve the issue, the MND established legal grounds to support insurance premiums  for full-time reservists and social service personnel through government funding in 2013,  which came into effect in 2014, and enabled these service members who are not allowed to  do economic activities to complete their duties stably.  2 This system allows military service members to serve as enlisted police, enlisted maritime police, or enlisted firefighters instead of  active duty service members.  3 The purpose of this system is to efficiently utilize those excess military service members who are remaining after all active duty  positions are filled to carry out activities for the public good equivalent to active duty service.  4 This refers to persons who enlist as active duty service members, complete basic military training and are assigned as reservists. They  execute homeland defense duties and related support missions.",page,236,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43545,"**2. Improvement of Military Administration**  **| Creating an Environment for Fair Military Service Fulfillment | The MND has**  introduced the “military service records disclosure system for public officials with grade 4 or  higher”[5] to satisfy the people’s right to know and enhance transparency and reliability in  carrying out military service duties by revealing the military service records of public  officials and their lineal descendants.  However, many people are still looking with distrust at the fulfillment of military service  by those who attract much social attention such as high-ranking public officials and their  lineal descendants, celebrities, and athletes. To resolve this, the MND is looking into  introducing the “intensive military service records management system for military service  candidates of public interest” as a national task.  The MND has implemented the “renowned military service family enhancement project”  since 2004 to help those who diligently completed their military duties to take pride in it and  be respected socially. Renowned military service families are selected from those families  with three generations of active military service, and they benefit by getting discounts at  museums, hospitals, condominiums, etc.  The MND implements a variety of policies to create a social climate in which those who  have faithfully completed their military duties are respected, and to improve social  awareness towards the fulfillment of mandatory military service.   **Chart 9-10.

Starting from April 2012, MMA officials were mandated with special judicial police  authority and investigated military service evasion cases, which resulted in a crackdown on  93 alleged military service evaders as of November 2014.  The MND plans to exert continuous efforts to boost fairness and transparency in carrying  out military service by making institutional improvements to prevent the evasion of military  service.  **|  Improving the Conscription Checkup System | The MND has continuously improved**  the checkup system for conscription in order to ensure fairness in military duty assignments  and recruit elite personnel.  It has continuously augmented advanced medical equipment and professional medical  personnel to enable precise physical psychological checkups, and will continue to secure  more equipment and human resources for more precise checkups.  In addition, the MND plans to improve the rules for physical checkups in a reasonable  manner to recruit elite personnel by strengthening the standard for active service eligibility  pertaining to major diseases, including psychological disorders.",page,238,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43547,"**Section 5 Strengthening Communications** **with the Public**  The trust and support of the people are becoming more important than anything else in successfully  implementing defense policies, as society becomes more transparent and open. The MND actively imple­  ments “National Defense 3.0” and strengthens communications with the public to realize defense policies  that the people can experience and trust.   **1. Implementing National Defense 3.0**  The MND implements National Defense 3.0 by considering the unique characteristic of  national defense while carrying out “Government 3.0,”[1] the ROK government’s foundation for  the operation of state affairs. National Defense 3.0 refers to a new defense administration  paradigm designed to realize robust security by managing organizations efficiently and  proactively responding to changes based on the key values of “openness,” “communication,”  “cooperation” and “integration.”  National Defense 3.0 places emphasis on innovation in the way of working, improvement  of public information and data quality, tailored and integrated defense service for customer  groups, and civilian-government-military cooperation. In the 2014 National Defense 3.0 Best  Practice Competition, the top honor went to the “reasonable mitigation of regulations through  local government-Ministry of National Defense-Joint Chiefs of Staff cooperation,” which  sought reasonable ways to regulate by building cooperative systems among relevant  personnel. Disclosure of military environment clean-up projects and related technologies to  the civilian sector was also introduced as one of the best practices under Government 3.0  since the values created by information disclosure were recognized.  The MND has held various National Defense 3.0 events such as “Policy Briefing for   1 A paradigm for government operation that provides tailored services to the people and support for the “Creative Economy” by disclosing  public information and removing partitions among government agencies for cooperation.",page,239,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

It has been  actively utilizing imaging media and social media (social network services and Internet  sites), which are currently leading the popular culture.  The MND delivers positive images of the military by using imaging media familiar to the  people such as music videos and entertainment programs.  The MND social media, which was introduced in 2010, is also rapidly growing.

The number of subscribers to the MND social media accounts has  increased five-fold to 220,000 as of September 2014 compared to late 2012.  In addition, the MND has implemented various programs that people can participate in and  provide various responses at the site where the program is being carried out. The MND helps  children become familiar with and cultivate a positive image of the military from childhood  by hosting the “Experience!

What is the Air Defense Identification Zone?**  The Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) refers to a specified airspace over land and water that  requires the identification, location confirmation and control of aircraft for the purpose of national security.[1] The ADIZ was established for the first time in 1950 by the United States, which recognized the seriousness of threats to national security by unidentified flying objects.  Since the ADIZ is not clearly specified in international law in terms of its meaning and authority, it differs  from the concept of airspace where the exclusive sovereignty of the nation of jurisdiction exercises influence. It is difficult, therefore, to apply exclusive jurisdiction over an ADIZ. However, approximately 30 nations, including the United States, UK and Japan, have established and operate ADIZs, thus presently making it a part of international practices.  The ROK government set forth the legal grounds for establishing an ADIZ in Article 9 of the Act on the  Operation, etc. of Military Aircraft, enacted in 2007, which states that “the Minister of National Defense shall establish and administer air defense identification zones.”  **2. Background of Establishment** **FIRs of the ROK and Neighboring Countries** **and Adjustment of the KADIZ**  The Korea Air Defense Identification Zone Pyongyang FIR  (KADIZ) was set up on March 22, 1951 by the U.S. Pacific Air Forces during the Korean War to Shenyang FIR  **East Sea**  prepare against air strikes from the Chinese Dokdo People’s Volunteers (CPV).

The west boundary of the JADIZ included the waters off Ieodo. This raised a problem for the ROK because it meant that the ROK had to go through prior consul­ tation with Japan to conduct search and rescue activities when disasters occurred in the ROK’s FIR outside of the KADIZ, although such activities would take place within the ROK’s FIR.  In addition, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which took effect in 1994, extended the range of  territorial waters from 3 NM to 12 NM, which made part of the ROK’s airspace to the south of Marado and Hongdo Islands become included in the JADIZ. To rectify the problems, the ROK government continued discussions with its counterparts in the United States and Japan to have the KADIZ correspond with the Incheon FIR.  However, in the course of negotiations between the ROK and the United States, and between the ROK  and Japan, the United States insisted that such issues involving the KADIZ and JADIZ should be resolved solely between the ROK and Japan. However, Japan practically rejected even the consultation itself, thus preventing the negotiations from moving forward.  **West Sea**  **KADIZ and JADIZ in the Past** **Progress of the KADIZ**  **March** U.S. Pacific Air Forces established the KADIZ. **22, 1951**  **East Sea**  Japanese government announced the JADIZ, which  **Korea Air Defense** Dokdo **1969** includes Ieodo. **Identification Zone (KADIZ)**  UN Convention on the Law of the Sea took effect.

43554,"**3. Progress of the KADIZ Adjustment**  The Park Geun-hye administration adjusted the KADIZ in a way that complies with international norms  and practices while enhancing mutual trust and cooperation with neighboring countries.  Immediately after November 23, 2013, when China declared the East China Sea ADIZ, the ROK  government held a national security policy steering meeting to discuss the way ahead. The ROK government expressed its regret that part of the East China Sea ADIZ overlapped with the KADIZ and made it clear that the ROK’s jurisdiction over the waters off Ieodo would never be affected and that the nations concerned must strive to enhance mutual trust.  On November 27, the ROK government decided to adjust the KADIZ and officially delivered its position to  China on the following day at the ROK-China Defense Strategic Dialogue. After that, the Ministry of National Defense took the initiative by having close consultations with relevant ministries and preparing the government’s plan for the adjustment of the KADIZ at the national security policy steering meeting on December 1.  ■ ROK Government’s Position during the ROK-China Defense Strategic Dialogue  (1) ‌Considering the trust between the ROK and China, it is  truly regrettable that prior consultations did not take place regarding China’s ADIZ, which even overlaps with the KADIZ in some parts and includes Ieodo. This is unacceptable from the ROK side.  (2) ‌Regardless of the establishment of ADIZs by  neighboring countries, the ROK’s jurisdiction over Ieodo and surrounding waters will not be affected.  (3) ‌We demand that China adjust the areas overlapping  with the KADIZ. We also consider expanding the ROK-China Defense Strategic Dialogue (November 2013) KADIZ to protect our national interests.  (4) ‌We are concerned about the potential build-up of military tensions due to measures taken by China. It is necessary to have  discussions among the nations concerned to enhance trust and alleviate tensions.  Based on the applicable laws related to ADIZs, **Notification No. 2013-449 of the Ministry of National Defense**  the ROK government set the range of the new  The Korea Air Defense Identification Zone (KADIZ) is amended and an­  KADIZ after reviewing the uniqueness of military nounced as follows in accordance with Article 2(2) of the Enforcement  Decree of the Act on the Operation, etc. of Military Aircraft.  air operations, the range of FIR in accordance December 12, 2013 with the Aviation Act, international practices, Minister of National Defense etc. The adjustment of the KADIZ was made in a 1.

43555,"was formally announced on December 8.  The Ministry of National Defense made a notification on the new KADIZ by issuing Notification No.  2013-449 in the Notice to Airman on December 10 and in the official gazette on December 12. The new KADIZ went into effect at 14:00 on December 15 after seven days of preparation. It was the first adjustment of the KADIZ in 62 years since its establishment by the U.S. Air Force in 1951.  ■ Statement to the Press Conference about the KADIZ Adjustment  The ROK government decided to adjust the range of the Korea Air Defense Identification Zone (KADIZ) as of December 8,  2013, based on the applicable laws related to Air Defense Identification Zones, after reviewing the uniqueness of military air operations, the range of the Flight Information Region (FIR) in accordance with the Aviation Act, international practices, etc.  The new KADIZ is now adjusted in such a way that the southern part of the KADIZ corresponds to the Incheon FIR, which is  internationally accepted and does not overlap with neighboring countries. This adjusted zone includes the airspace above the waters off Ieodo and the airspace of the southern part of Marado and Hongdo Islands, both of which belong to our territory.  The new KADIZ will be notified in such a way that it can take effect as of December 15, after seven days of preparation, in  consideration of the required time for notification and dissemination through the official gazette and the Notice to Airman.  The adjustment of the KADIZ at this time is in compliance with the existing international aviation order and international  norms, and does not pose any restrictions on civil flights or infringe on the airspace and interests of neighboring countries.  The ROK government made sufficient explanation to the nations concerned prior to today’s announcement. The ROK government will continue to consult with neighboring countries regarding necessary measures to prevent any  accidental military collisions from occurring within the newly adjusted KADIZ and secure the safety of aircraft.  The ROK government will continue to make efforts to build mutual trust and enhance cooperation with relevant nations by  enhancing the safety of flights in the region.  Official announcement of the KADIZ adjustment (December 2013)  **4. Significance of the KADIZ Adjustment**  The adjustment of the KADIZ for the first time in 62 years carries significance in the following three  aspects:  First, the adjusted KADIZ includes part of the airspace over Marado and Hongdo Islands, both of which  are ROK territories, and the airspace above the waters off Ieodo, which is under the ROK’s jurisdiction. With the adjustment, the ROK’s control over the territory, territorial waters and jurisdictional waters to the south of the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) was strengthened, which can ensure such activities conducive to the ROK’s national interests.  Second, with the adjustment of the KADIZ, an air defense buffer zone is now secured to defend the",page,247,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

Formation of E-737 AEW&Cs and F-15K fighters flying Navy P-3C flying patrol above Ieodo patrol over the southern part of Jeju Island  Third, the rearrangement of the southern boundary of the KADIZ to correspond with the Incheon FIR  ensured the international aviation order and safety of civil flights while enhancing trust with neighboring countries.  The ROK government has overcome the unexpected security crisis situation in such a way as to defend  national interests and improve the nation’s stature on the world stage based on a firm resolve and sense of responsibility. It could also secure the support and trust of the people toward the principle and vision of the security policy the ROK government upholds. At the same time the ROK government contributed to improving its sovereignty and establishing trust with neighboring countries by settling sensitive national security issues in a calm and thorough manner.  **KADIZ (Before December 15, 2013)** **KADIZ (After December 15, 2013)**  **North Korea** **Pyongyang FIR** **North Korea** **Pyongyang FIR**  **Shenyang FIR** **NLL** **East Sea** **Shenyang FIR** **NLL** **East Sea**  **NLL** **NLL**  Dokdo Dokdo  **Republic of Korea** **Republic of Korea**  **Shanghai FIR** **West Sea** **Shanghai FIR** **West Sea**  **South Sea** **South Sea**  **Legend**  **Legend** **KADIZ (previous)**  **Ieodo** **KADIZ** **Ieodo** **KADIZ (adjusted)**  **Fukuoka** **Incheon FIR** **Fukuoka** **Incheon FIR** **Shanghai FIR** **FIR** **JADIZ** **Shanghai FIR** **FIR** **JADIZ**  **China’s ADIZ** **China’s ADIZ**",page,248,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43557,"**Special Appendix 2**  **Seoul Defense Dialogue**  The ROK MND has hosted the Seoul Defense Dialogue (SDD), a vice defense minister-level multilateral  defense dialogue among the nations of the Asia-Pacific region, since 2012. The SDD has been improved and developed, building on the “Inter-Korean Arms Control Seminar” that began in 1991. The SDD has established a reputation for itself as a venue for the highest-level multilateral defense dialogue in Northeast Asia that deals with substantial security issues in the Asia-Pacific region and explores ways for combined responses, and is continuing to expand its roles.  Discussions about creating a multilateral defense dialogue similar to the SDD have continued since the  end of the 1980s as transnational and non-military security threats surfaced with the end of the Cold War. The ROK, for its part, proposed the Northeast Asia Peace Council at a UN conference in 1988, followed by another proposal for the NorthEAst Security Dialogue (NEASeD) at the ASEAN Regional Forum in 1994. Presently, multilateral defense dialogues in the Asia-Pacific region take place in various forms, including the ASEAN Regional Forum, the Asia Security Summit (ASS), the Jakarta International Defense Dialogue (JIDD), the Halifax International Security Forum (HISF) in Canada, the International Security Forum in Russia, and the Xiangshan Forum in China.  **1. Overview**  **| Background | With the increase of transnational threats that cannot be dealt with at the level of** individual nations, multilateral defense dialogues are on the rise to improve the security environment and build military confidence in the Asia-Pacific region, including the Korean Peninsula.  In 1991, the ROK MND established the Arms Control Office to build inter-Korean military confidence and  prepare for arms control. It also hosted a total of 17 Inter-Korean Arms Control Seminars from 1991 to 2007. In 2008, the seminar was expanded into the International Arms Control Seminar, in which civilian experts from home and abroad participated, and began to be pursued as part of the national policy agenda. However, because the International Arms Control Seminar was operated at the level of academic exchanges, it failed to develop into a dialogue forum where effective policy alternatives could be discussed among the nations in the region. As a result, in 2012, the seminar was reorganized into a 1.5-track SDD, in which vice defense minister-level officials and civilian security experts participate.  **| Purpose | First, the SDD aims to promote dialogue and cooperation in relation to common military** interests and issues among the Asia-Pacific nations. Although the Asia-Pacific region is emerging as the center of the world economy, there has not been any earnest dialogue on resolving the discord among the nations due to conflicting interests. Accordingly, there was a growing need for a body for dialogue among the nations in the region to conduct constructive dialogue and cooperation toward common interests. Second, the SDD aims to improve the intra-regional security environment and build multilateral defense cooperation and mutual trust, which can contribute to the creation of peace not just on the Korean Peninsula, but for the world. The Asia Pacific is a region where various security issues arise, including not just the North Korean threats of nuclear weapons and missiles, but also perceptions of past history, territorial disputes and arms races among the nations in the region. In this situation, efforts toward",page,249,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43558,"building multilateral security cooperation and trust are sure to lay the groundwork for bringing about a stable peace in the world.  **| Features | There are many dialogues held throughout the Asia-Pacific region in which minister-level** officials participate. However, the SDD is truly the first of its kind in which vice defense minister-level officials participate. Most of the dialogue venues are for minister level officials, with some dialogue forums being director general level or below. To promote dialogue and exchanges among defense officials at various levels, the SDD has developed into a venue participated in by vice minister-level defense officials. It evaluates the security environment of individual nations and introduces their defense policies so that the participants are offered opportunities to understand each other’s policies and build trust among the participating officials. The SDD, in particular, has developed into a meaningful venue where participants explore ways to eliminate regional security threats and find policy alternatives and strategies for denucle­ arization, a peace regime, arms control and unification on the Korean Peninsula.  **2. Progress to Date**  The SDD has been held three times from its inaugural session in 2012 until 2014.  Its slogan is “Cooperation for Security and Peace.” The emblem of the SDD shows the letter “S” embracing the earth.   **Table 1.

Many nations, including the  ROK, were engaged in general elections or presidential elections, which made it difficult for the respective nations to remain focused on any international conferences. There were also the fourth Halifax Interna­ tional Security Forum and the sixth East Asia Summit[1] taking place close to when the SDD took place, causing confusion in terms of which nation was participating in which venue.  Nevertheless, senior defense officials from 15  nations and two international organizations (the EU and NATO) attended the dialogue, laying the ground for the SDD to become an authoritative annual multilateral defense dialogue in the Asia-Pacific region.  In addition, the SDD contributed greatly in First SDD (November 2012)  enhancing the ROK’s soft power, which corresponds to the growth of the ROK’s national power. By laying the groundwork for stability on the Korean Peninsula and the construction of military confidence among regional nations, it successfully established itself as a senior-level multilateral defense dialogue in the Asia-Pacific region. Above all, the first dialogue provided the stage for the participating nations to form a consensus on the necessity to create a cyber working group.  **| The Second SDD | The second SDD was held from November 11 to 13, 2013. Twenty nations from the** Asia-Pacific region and Europe and three international organizations participated in the dialogue, and the number of nations sending vice minister-level officials increased sharply to 12 from three in 2012.  1 Eighteen countries were present, including 10 ASEAN nations, the ROK, China, Japan, Australia, India, New Zealand, the United States  and Russia.

Lamberto Zannier, the Secretary General of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), delivered the keynote speech. Kim Jang-soo, the Director of National Security at the Blue House, and Ahn Hong-joon, the Chair of the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee of the National Assembly, hosted a luncheon. Civilian defense experts and representatives from nations discussed future directions for the development of the SDD during breakfast meetings. The ROK government explained its defense policies, including the Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Initiative, and solidified the foundation for support towards its policies.  With the main theme of “A New Search for Greater Security Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region,” the  second SDD provided a venue for discussion on common security issues in the Asia-Pacific region, cyber security, and efficiency in defense management. Cyber security is the topic that defines the SDD, and was pursued as such with the goal of the ROK taking on the leading role in this area in the Asia-Pacific region. There were also cyber working group preparatory meetings, participated in by working-level staffs from the cyber security sectors of each nation, which effectively contributed to the creation of international norms to prevent military tension and conflicts in cyberspace.  The second SDD held significance in that it confirmed the possibility of success in cooperating for peace  in the region based on trustpolitik and that it provided the justification for the dialogue to grow into a multilateral security council suited to the characteristics of the Asia-Pacific region. Also, it provided an opportunity for the participants to realize that the trust that started from “dialogue” based on mutual understanding among nations needs to be backed up by “action.”  Welcome speech by Prime Minister Chung Hong-won (November 2013) Keynote speech by the Secretary General of the OSCE (November 2013)  It was also meaningful in that a consensus was formed on North Korea’s denuclearization and the  abolishment of North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction at a venue where representatives from major nations in the Asia-Pacific region participated.

The dialogue invited 24 nations** from the Asia-Pacific region, three from Europe, and three international organizations. The invitees included Turkey, Colombia, Peru and Chile, which were invited additionally, leading to total participants from 24 nations and three international organizations.  |Table 4.

The main theme of the third SDD was “From Conflict to Cooperation: Measures for Trust-building among  Asia-Pacific Countries,” reflecting the conflicts inherent in the Asia-Pacific region, Northeast Asia in particular. Specific agenda items included the unification of the Korean Peninsula, prevention of conflicts, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and maritime and cyber security, which constituted the major security issues in the Asia-Pacific region.  The third SDD was most meaningful in that it  provided opportunities for vice minister-level defense officials to share their views on peace and cooperation and work together to understand each other. For the vice minister-level defense officials of major nations the gathering itself marked meaningful progress in the course of building trust.  In particular, it was a great achievement to  enhance the level of understanding among participants about the security vision and Opening speech by the Minister of National Defense at the third defense policy of the ROK, the host of the event. SDD (October 2014) ROK government officials and experts utilized every opportunity to introduce the trust-building process on the Korean Peninsula, the Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Initiative, and the vision of unification of the Korean Peninsula. They also listened to critiques and advice from experts from various nations based on their respective experiences. Jörg Schönbohm, the former First Commander of the Bundeswehr Eastern Command and Vice Defense Minister of Germany in the course of the German reunification, stressed the importance of strengthening cooperation with neighboring countries and won much appreciation from the audience.",page,253,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43562,"Session 4 at the 2014 SDD Visit to the JSA (October 2014)  Another achievement the SDD made was that it opened a discussion on cyber security. The ROK  government has brought the issue of cyber security, which began to emerge at a global level, to people’s attention since the first meeting in 2012 and received favorable responses. It is now bringing the discussion at the SDD up to a different class of defense dialogue by coordinating meta-discourses among the cyber security experts in the world with specific working-level policies.  The bilateral and multilateral dialogues among participants have laid the groundwork to strengthen  political and military confidence among them in the future. Also, the friendship built among the participant nations will play a key role in opening the door toward peace and cooperation in the cases where conflicts or crises occur among them.  The third SDD was participated in by a nine-member delegation from China led by a major general-level  official, marking the first participation in the SDD by China, and eight delegates from Japan led by the Vice Defense Minister, emphasizing the increased attention among neighboring countries. The dialogue contributed to securing support from the international community and forming a consensus in connection with the ROK government’s unification policy, including the trust-building process on the Korean Peninsula and the Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Initiative. It also enabled defense industrial diplomacy in bilateral discussions and created a favorable environment for defense industrial exports by allowing the participants to get the opportunity to take a look around defense companies. The SDD also served as an opportunity to confirm the potential of the cyber working group as a new form of dialogue in the cyber area in national defense. Representatives of the participant nations visited the Joint Security Area (JSA) to see the security environment of the Korean Peninsula. The dialogue also served as an opportunity to introduce Korean culture to the participants by offering them programs to have cultural experiences in such places as Gyeongbokgung Palace and Insa-dong.  **| Way Ahead | It is planned to extend the participant nations to include those in Central Asia, along with** Mexico, Sri Lanka and so forth. The SDD bases itself on Asia-Pacific countries. The first SDD sent out invitations mostly to those with close defense strategic dialogues or military exchanges and cooperation with the ROK, in an effort to solidify the base of the dialogue. The scope of invitations has been gradually expanded to strengthen military exchanges and cooperation.  The SDD will expand its coverage to include various global issues going beyond Northeast Asia, while  specializing in cyber security to differentiate itself from other security forums. A wide range of agenda items will be addressed, from issues related to the Korean Peninsula and security in Northeast Asia to various global issues. Cyber security is being classified as the topic that defines the SDD. The ROK MND plans to develop an agenda that can obtain a consensus from many participant nations and effectively",page,254,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

Periodic gatherings will also be arranged for meetings of representatives and Northeast Asia sub-multi­  lateral meetings, with more active bilateral discussions, to pursue diversified defense diplomacy and cooperation. It has become necessary to have meetings among the officials of respective authorities to produce substantial results. As such, it is necessary for the heads of delegations to meet separately to maximize outcomes, and convene Northeast Asia sub-multilateral meetings so that the dialogue can develop into a venue where Northeast Asian security issues can be addressed in depth. The SDD will take the opportunity of having senior defense officials in one place to vitalize discussions that are crucial in bilateral military areas and pursue military exchanges and cooperation in the future.  The ROK government plans to incorporate information and communications technology (ICT) into the  meetings in order to consolidate the status of the ROK, which is already well advanced in ICT. ICT will be used for such procedures as questions and answers, proceedings by the host and access security to project an advanced image of the ROK with strong ICT and contribute to the development of the technology.",page,255,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43564,"**Special Appendix 3**  **Repatriation of Chinese Soldiers’ Remains**  **1. Historical Background**  On July 27, 1953, the United Nations Command (UNC) and the communist armed forces signed an  Armistice Agreement in which they agreed to “recover and evacuate the bodies of deceased military personnel of the other side found in the territory under the control of the other side.”[1] To fulfill the agreement, both sides signed the “Understanding on Administrative Details for the Delivery and Reception of Bodies of Military Personnel of Both Sides” at the plenary session of the 47[th] Military Armistice Commission in August 1954. From September to the end of October 1954, the UNC returned more than 13,500 bodies of the communist armed forces and received over 4,000 bodies of ROK and UN military personnel in return.  An additional 43 sets of Chinese soldiers’ remains that were excavated thereafter during the period from  1981 to January 1997 were returned to China through Panmunjom in five separate rounds in accordance with the Armistice Agreement. In September 2000, however, the repatriation of the remains of Chinese soldiers came to a halt when North Korea refused to accept the demand from the UNC to take over a Chinese soldier’s remains, stating that the case was not the concern of North Korea.[2]  **2. Background of Repatriation**  During a state visit to China in June 2013, President Park Geun-hye proposed to Liu Yandong, the Vice  Premier of China that the ROK would repatriate the remains of Chinese soldiers who died during the Korean War in an effort to solve the issue of Chinese soldiers’ remains that were not repatriated since 1997 in a humanitarian spirit. The proposal received a positive response from China. The Chinese government notified the ROK government of its intention to discuss the issue of repatriation in November 2013, which resulted in full-scale bilateral working-level meetings.  **3. Progress**  The working-level cooperation team for the repatriation of remains from China, led by Li Guiguang, the  Deputy Director of the Special Care and Settlement Bureau of the Ministry of Civil Affairs of China, came to the ROK on December 4, 2013 for the first working-level meeting for the repatriation of remains. Brigadier General Moon Sang-gyun, the Deputy Director General for Arms Control of the ROK Ministry of National Defense, met with Li Guiguang to discuss the issue in a friendly environment. The meeting led to an agreement which stated that Chinese soldiers’ remains would be returned before the Chinese Qingming  1 Article 13(f) of the Korean Armistice Agreement.  2 On September 9, 2000, in response to a request from the UNC for North Korea to take over the remains of one Chinese soldier during  the third secretary-level meeting, North Korea responded by saying that “The remains of Chinese soldiers are not the concern of North Korea, accordingly it is desirable that the case should be addressed at the Chinese Embassy or the UNC.”",page,256,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

Preparation for Repatriation**  Actual preparations for the repatriation of remains began with a digging ceremony for the excavation of  Chinese soldiers’ remains at the KPA-CPV cemetery located in Paju on December 19, 2013, with the attendance of Chinese officials. From December 19 through 24, a total of 14,000 man-days of work were carried out with excavation experts from the MND Agency for KIA Recovery and Identification (MAKRI) and support troops from the 25[th] Division. They made dedicated efforts for the excavation in bitter cold weather and moved the remains of Chinese soldiers to a temporary identification laboratory nearby.  The exhumed remains were washed, dried, identified with precision, and matched to artifacts and  records by identification experts from the MND MAKRI to prepare for repatriation.  The casketing ceremony was held at the 25[th] Division temporary identification laboratory located in Paju,  Gyeonggi-do on March 17, with attendance by representatives from China. The 437 sets of Chinese soldiers’ remains were placed in traditional caskets provided by China in accordance with Chinese traditions. The casketed remains were temporarily enshrined before their transportation to Incheon International Airport by 437 service members of the 25[th] Division one day prior to the transfer ceremony, and were laid in a Chinese commercial aircraft.",page,257,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

Transfer Ceremony**  On March 28, 2014, a joint transfer ceremony for the  remains was hosted by Baek Seung-joo, the Vice Minister of the ROK MND, and Zhou Ming, a Bureau Director of the Ministry of Civil Affairs of China, at Incheon International Airport in the presence of key figures from both nations and officials from the UNC. The participants intuitively sensed that the very moment of the transfer of the remains from the Korean soldiers to their Chinese counterparts would mark a new milestone in ROK-China relations. Vice Minister of National Defense Baek Seung-joo stated in his speech for the repatriation, “As the spring rain in the season of resuscitation of all living beings changes everything into green, we have no doubt that this repatriation of Chinese soldiers’ remains will become a spring rain and grow into a long river that will contribute to ROK-China relations and peace in Northeast Asia.” The representative of the Chinese government responded, “The repatriation of remains is sure to make bilateral relations advance further.”  After the ceremony in Incheon International Airport, the  437 sets of Chinese soldiers’ remains were moved to Shenyang Airport in China and laid to rest in the Shenyang Martyrs Cemetery in a separately prepared area.

43567,"**6. Achievement and Significance**  The repatriation of the 437 sets of Chinese soldiers’ remains, unprecedented in history, brought a  continuous flow of emotional and appreciative messages to the ROK government. Senior Chinese officials, including President Xi Jinping, made an official announcement of appreciation for the ROK government’s efforts toward the successful repatriation of Chinese soldiers’ remains. The 1.3 billion Chinese nationals were also unsparing in their appreciation for the repatriation of the remains after 60 years, saying “We are touched by the careful management of the tombs and orderly ceremony of hand-over, although China fought against the ROK in the past.” The massive repatriation of 437 Chinese soldiers’ remains, proposed by President Park Geun-hye and agreed to by President Xi Jinping, prompted a profound change from deep in the hearts of the Chinese people.  The repatriation of Chinese soldiers’ remains was pursued based on close cooperation between the ROK  and China and is expected to provide an opportunity to make bilateral relations advance further. Furthermore, both the ROK and China agreed that Chinese soldiers’ remains retrieved during the process of excavation would be repatriated to China annually, which is expected to strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries. This could also mark the beginning of inter-Korean humanitarian cooperation, including a joint excavation of remains with North Korea, and will contribute to the promotion of peace and cooperation in Northeast Asia.  **7. Way Ahead**  The MND MAKRI conducted an excavation project from April to the end of November 2014 in 27 areas,  including Inje, Yanggu and Cheolwon in Gangwon-do and Paju and Pocheon in Gyeonggi-do. The project resulted in the recovery of 1,173 sets of remains, of which 68 were identified as Chinese soldiers. The remains of Chinese soldiers were temporarily enshrined in a shrine located at the eighth district in Hoengseong, Gangwon-do, after the procedure of identification.  The MND plans to repatriate the remains of Chinese soldiers excavated in the ROK to China before the  Chinese Qingming Festival on April 5, 2015, in accordance with the agreement made at the ROK-China working-level meeting in January 2014. To do so, another bilateral working-level meeting is to be held between January and February 2015 to discuss the specific repatriation date and procedures.",page,259,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

43594,"**Appendix 10**  **Joint Declaration in Commemoration of the 60[th]**  **Anniversary of the Alliance between the Republic**  **of Korea and the United States of America**  For six decades, the U.S.-ROK Alliance has served as an anchor for stability, security, and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula, in the Asia-Pacific region, and increasingly around the world. President Barack Obama of the United States of America and President Park Geun-hye of the Republic of Korea, meeting in Washington, D.C. on May 7, 2013, present this Joint Declaration in celebration of sixty years of bilateral partnership and shared prosperity. The two leaders affirm that the Alliance is well-placed to address the opportunities and challenges of the future.  The U.S.-ROK Alliance, forged in the Korean War and founded on the 1953 United States-Republic of Korea Mutual Defense Treaty, has evolved into a comprehensive strategic alliance with deep cooperation extending beyond security to also encompass the political, economic, cultural, and people-to-people realms. The freedom, friendship, and shared prosperity we enjoy today rest upon our shared values of liberty, democracy, and a market economy.  Building on the past sixty years of stability on the Korean Peninsula, we continue to strengthen and adapt our Alliance to serve as a linchpin of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific and to meet the security challenges of the 21[st] century. The United States remains firmly committed to the defense of the Republic of Korea, including through extended deterrence and the full range of U.S. military capabilities, both conventional and nuclear.  This year also marks another milestone for our two nations - the first anniversary of the entry into force of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA). This agreement embodies the positive evolution of our partnership and demonstrates how deeply the United States and the Republic of Korea are committed to a shared future of growth and prosperity. We are pleased to note the positive results of the KORUS FTA, including increased trade and investment between our two countries, and recognize its potential for expanding bilateral cooperation and business opportunities, including in the energy sector. Our two countries will fully implement the KORUS FTA to ensure that the agreement serves as an economic growth engine in both our countries.  We are pleased with the significant progress made in realizing the 2009 Joint Vision for the Alliance of the United States of America and the Republic of Korea, which lays out a blueprint for the future development of our strategic Alliance. We pledge to continue to build a better and more secure future for all Korean people, working on the basis of the Joint Vision to foster enduring peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and its peaceful reunification based on the principles of denuclearization, democracy and a free market economy. In this context, the United States and the Republic of Korea will continue to work through the Alliance to bring North Korea in to compliance with its international obligations and promote peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula, including through the trust-building process initiated by President Park.  We share the deep concern that North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missiles programs and its repeated provocations pose grave threats to the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia. Both the United States and the Republic of Korea are determined to achieve the peaceful denuclearization of North Korea and are working with other Six-Party Talks partners and the international community to insist that North Korea adheres to its international obligations and commitments. While we invite North Korea to take the path that leads out of isolation and to join the community of nations as a responsible member, we are",page,286,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
43595,"resolved to continue to defend our citizens against North Korea’s provocations by strengthening our comprehensive, interoperable, and combined defense capabilities, to include shared efforts to counter the missile threat posed by North Korea and integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems. Because both the United States and the Republic of Korea share a deep concern for the well-being of the North Korean people, we encourage North Korea to invest in, and improve, the conditions for its citizens and to respect their basic human rights.  The peace and prosperity of both our nations are inextricably linked to regional and global security and economic growth. Based on the solid U.S.-ROK Alliance, we are prepared to address our common challenges and seek ways to build an era of peace and cooperation in Northeast Asia. The U.S.-ROK Alliance is an increasingly global partnership, and the United States welcomes the Republic of Korea’s leadership and active engagement on the world stage, including in international fora.

43596,"**Appendix 11**  **Joint Communiqué of the 45[th] ROK-U.S. Security**  **Consultative Meeting**  October 2, 2013, Seoul  In commemoration of the 60[th] anniversary of the Republic of Korea-United States (ROK-U.S.) Alliance, the ROK Minister of National Defense Kim, Kwan Jin and the U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel expressed that the ROK-U.S. Alliance is stronger than ever before, and they committed to further advancing the Alliance into the future based on the experiences and lessons of the past 60 years.  Forged during the Korean War and founded on the 1953 ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty, the ROK-U.S. Alliance has successfully deterred North Korean aggression and provocation, and played a critical role in the development of free democracy and economic prosperity in the Republic of Korea. Today, based on robust security cooperation, the Alliance continues to serve as a linchpin of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and is evolving into a global partnership that contributes to the peace on the Korean Peninsula and across the globe.  1. ‌The 45[th] ROK-U.S. Security Consultative Meeting (SCM) was held in Seoul on October 2, 2013. Minister Kim  and Secretary Hagel led their respective delegations, which included senior defense and foreign affairs officials. Before the SCM, the ROK Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Jung, Seung Jo and the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin E. Dempsey presided over the 38[th] ROK-U.S. Military Committee Meeting (MCM) on September 30, 2013.  2. ‌The Minister and the Secretary reaffirmed the commitment of the ROK and U.S. Presidents to continue to  build a comprehensive strategic Alliance of bilateral, regional, and global scope based on common values and mutual trust, as set forth in the June 2009 “Joint Vision for the Alliance of the Republic of Korea and the United States of America” and reiterated in the May 2013 “Joint Declaration in Commemoration of the 60[th] Anniversary of the Alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States of America.” They also reaffirmed that the scope and level of Alliance cooperation should continue to broaden and deepen by strengthening the combined defense posture on the Korean Peninsula and enhancing cooperation for regional and global security in the 21[st] century, as reflected in the “ROK-U.S. Defense Cooperation Guidelines” signed at the 42[nd] SCM in 2010. Against this backdrop, the Minister and the Secretary noted that the efforts of the “Korea-U.S. Integrated Defense Dialogue (KIDD)” significantly advance Alliance objectives by providing high-level political oversight and coordinating and integrating various defense consultation mechanisms between the ROK and the United States, including the Security Policy Initiative, Extended Deterrence Policy Committee, Strategic Alliance Working Group, and Counter-Missile Capabilities Committee. Consequently, they decided to pursue more active bilateral security consultation centered around the KIDD in the future. Furthermore, reflecting on the 60[th] anniversary of the ROK-U.S. Alliance, the Minister and the Secretary requested that a study on the defense vision for the future of the ROK-U.S. Alliance be completed by 2014.  3. ‌The Minister and the Secretary reiterated the firm view of the Republic of Korea and the United States that  North Korea’s policies and provocations, including its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and proliferation activities, pose a serious threat to regional stability and global security, as well as to the integrity of the global nonproliferation regime. The Minister and the Secretary strongly condemned North Korea’s December 12, 2012 long-range missile launch and its February 2013 nuclear test, which constituted serious violations of numerous United Nations (UN) Security Council resolutions. The Minister and the Secretary also reaffirmed that North Korea should fulfill its commitments under the September 19,",page,288,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

The Minister and the Secretary also reaffirmed that the Republic of Korea and the United States would continue to cooperate closely to implement fully all UN Security Council resolutions concerning North Korea.  4. ‌The Minister and the Secretary reaffirmed the two nations’ mutual commitment to the fundamental mission  of the Alliance to defend the Republic of Korea through a robust combined defense posture, as well as to the enhancement of mutual security based on the ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty. The Minister and the Secretary reaffirmed the need to continue to conduct combined exercises on the Peninsula to demonstrate Alliance readiness, particularly given the security environment since the sinking of the ROK warship CHEONAN and the artillery shelling of Yeon-pyeong Island in 2010, the North Korean long-range missile launches in April and December 2012, and the third nuclear test in February 2013. The Minister expressed his appreciation for the participation of U.S. strategic assets in the KEY RESOLVE and FOAL EAGLE exercises in March 2013. The Minister and the Secretary reaffirmed that any North Korean aggression or military provocation is not to be tolerated and that the Republic of Korea and the United States would work shoulder-to-shoulder to demonstrate our combined resolve. They also reaffirmed that the ROK-U.S. Alliance remains vital to the future interests of both nations in securing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia, and stressed their determination to ensure sufficient capabilities of the combined forces for the security of the Republic of Korea. The Secretary reiterated the firm and unwavering U.S. commitment to the defense of the ROK using capabilities postured on the Korean Peninsula and globally available U.S. forces and capabilities. The Secretary also reiterated the commitment to maintain the current level of U.S. military personnel in the Republic of Korea and to enhance combat readiness.  5. ‌The Minister and the Secretary noted that the two militaries have made substantial progress in the  development of military preparation plans related to a range of situations on the Korean Peninsula and that these military plans are to ensure an effective Alliance response to potential crises. In particular, the Minister and the Secretary praised the two militaries for completing the “ROK-U.S. Counter-Provocation Plan” in March 2013, which enables the two countries to respond jointly and effectively to North Korean provocations, and reaffirmed that the plan would be crucial in enabling the Alliance to respond firmly to any North Korean provocation. The Minister and the Secretary reaffirmed the need to continue promoting combined exercises and training events and to enhance combined capabilities in order to be prepared for any North Korean provocation in the vicinity of the Northwest Islands and the Northern Limit Line (NLL). Moreover, noting that the NLL has been an effective means of separating the ROK and North Korean military forces and preventing military tension for nearly 60 years, the Minister and the Secretary urged North Korea to accept the practical value of and abide by the NLL. Additionally, the Minister and the Secretary reaffirmed that the Armistice Agreement and the United Nations Command remain crucial instruments in maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.  6. ‌The Secretary reaffirmed the continued U.S. commitment to provide and strengthen extended deterrence  for the ROK using the full range of military capabilities, including the U.S. nuclear umbrella, conventional strike, and missile defense capabilities. To enhance effective deterrence options against North Korean nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats, the Minister and the Secretary formally endorsed a bilateral “Tailored Deterrence Strategy Against North Korean Nuclear and other WMD Threats.” This strategy establishes a strategic Alliance framework for tailoring deterrence against key North Korean nuclear threat scenarios across armistice and wartime, and strengthens the integration of Alliance capabilities to maximize their deterrent effects. The ROK and the United States are committed to maintaining close consultation on deterrence matters to ensure that extended deterrence for the ROK remains credible, capable, and enduring.",page,289,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK

To this end, the Minister and the Secretary also decided to enhance further the interoperability of the Alliance’s command and control system. The ROK and the United States are committed to maintaining close consultation to develop comprehensive Alliance capabilities to counter North Korean nuclear, other WMD, and ballistic missile threats.  8. ‌The Minister and the Secretary pledged that the ROK and the United States would continue to enhance  close Alliance cooperation to address wide-ranging global security challenges of mutual interest, including through peacekeeping activities, stabilization and reconstruction efforts, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief through tri-lateral or multi-lateral cooperation. As expressed in the “Joint Statement on Syria, adopted on September 6, 2013, on the margins of the G20 Leader’s Meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia,” the Minister and the Secretary shared concerns about the Syrian government’s chemical weapons attack on August 21. The Minister and the Secretary also expressed concerns about North Korean chemical weapons. The Secretary expressed appreciation for the ROK’s contributions to the reconstruction and stabilization of Afghanistan, including the deployment of a Provincial Reconstruction Team and the Ashena Unit, as well as ROK financial support. The Secretary also praised the ROK’s contributions to counter-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden, the UN peace-keeping mission in Lebanon, and reconstruction efforts in the Republic of South Sudan. He also expressed appreciation for the ROK Government’s continued active participation in the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).  9. ‌The Minister and the Secretary reaffirmed the need to strengthen cooperation with respect to the  protection of, and access to, the space and cyberspace domains, and to promote the resilience of critical infrastructure, including the security of information and space systems. Since the signing of the Terms of Reference (TOR) for bilateral military space cooperation at the previous SCM, the ROK and the United States have consulted on issues of mutual interest, including enhanced combined exercises and more active information sharing, and are working to continue cooperation on issues such as improving space situational awareness. Taking note of the second ROK-U.S. Cyber Policy Consultations held in Washington D.C. in July 2013, the Minister and the Secretary welcomed the signing of the TOR for the Cyber Cooperation Working Group on September 5, 2013 in Washington D.C. The Cyber Cooperation Working Group endeavors to strengthen cooperation in information sharing, cyber policy, strategy, doctrine, personnel, and exercise to improve our collective readiness against cyber threats.  10. ‌The Minister and the Secretary received a report on the results of the ROK-U.S. Military Committee  Meeting from the Commander of the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command (CFC), General James D. Thurman, which highlighted that the combined defense posture is capable and ready to “Fight Tonight,” and that it is prepared to respond effectively to any provocation, instability, or aggression.  11. ‌The Minister and the Secretary acknowledged their comprehensive strategy to strengthen the Alliance in  years to come, including achieving the transition of wartime operational control (OPCON) for the combined warfight to the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff based on Strategic Alliance 2015 (SA 2015). The transition of OPCON should sustain and enhance the Alliance’s combined defense posture and capabilities, and support both the Alliance’s bilateral defense priorities and its future development. The Minister and the Secretary, paying particular attention to the dynamic security environment on the Korean Peninsula including the intensifying North Korean nuclear and missile threats, decided to regularly assess and review the security situation on the Korean Peninsula in the context of an evaluation of the implementation of SA 2015 at the annual SCM/MCM, and to continue consultations on this issue. In this regard, they further noted the importance of a conditions-based OPCON transition and the OPCON Certification Plan in ensuring that the combined defense posture remains strong and seamless. The Secretary reaffirmed the continuing U.S. commitment to provide specific bridging capabilities until the ROK obtains full self-defense capabilities, and further noted the U.S. commitment to contribute enduring",page,290,southkorea_2014_DefenseWhitePaper,2014,South Korea,732,ROK
