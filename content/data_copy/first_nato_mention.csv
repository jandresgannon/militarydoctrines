"2","us",1982,"The Role Of Allies And Others  Given the loss of U.S. strategic superiority and the overwhelming growth of Soviet conventional forces capabilities, together with the increased political and economic strength of the industrial democracies and the heightened importance of Third World resources, the United States must increasingly draw upon the resources and cooperation of allies and others to protect our interests and those of our friends. There is no other alternative.  To meet successfully the challenges to our interests, the U.S. will require stronger and more effective collective defense arrangements.  U.S.  defense programs will consider the status of these arrangements in the planning process.  A strong unified NATO remains indispensable to protecting Western interests.  While encouraging all our NATO Allies to maintain and increase their contributions in Europe, we should specifically encourage those Allies who can contribute outside Europe to allocate their marginal defense resources preferentially to capabilities which could support both out of area and European missions.  Outside Europe, the United States will place primary reliance on regional states to deal militarily with non-Soviet threats, providing security assistance as appropriate.  If no other reasonable alternative exists, the U.S. should be prepared to intervene militarily in regional or local conflicts. In Southwest Asia, we will support the development of balanced and self-contained TOP SECRET    ER TS0269 82    TOP SECRET friendly regional forces and will emphasize assistance to certain key states for regional contingency roles.  However, the U.S. will remain the primary military power for directly resisting the Soviet Union.

We should also assist the Republic of Korea in becoming increasingly self-sufficient in its own defense capabilities.  #","section",11,"us_1982_NationalSecurityStrategy"

Założenia podstawowe  Współczesna treść pojęcia bezpieczeństwa państwa obejmuje zarówno kwestie  polityczne i militarne, jak i aspekty gospodarcze, ekologiczne, społeczne i etniczne. W każdej z tych dziedzin polska polityka bezpieczeństwa jest zgodna z prawem międzynarodowym, w szczególności z prawem Organizacji Narodów Zjednoczonych, z postanowieniami i decyzjami Konferencji Bezpieczeństwa i Współpracy w Europie oraz dwustronnymi i wielostronnymi umowami, których Polska jest stroną.  Rzeczpospolita Polska traktuje jako nienaruszalne swe granice i nie ma żadnych  roszczeń terytorialnych wobec swych sąsiadów. Szanuje suwerenność innych państw i wyrzeka się użycia siły, łącznie z grożeniem siłą, w bilateralnych stosunkach z innymi państwami. Polska pragnie szczególnie ściśle współpracować z państwami sąsiedzkimi.  ### 2. Integracja z Europą Zachodnią  Przyszłe członkostwo Polski we Wspólnotach Europejskich ma podstawowe  znaczenie dla naszego kraju. Integracji gospodarczej z Zachodem przyświecają także motywy i cele polityczne. Stowarzyszenie traktujemy jako etap w dążeniu do osiągnięcia w możliwie krótkim czasie pełnego członkostwa we Wspólnotach Europejskich, względnie - w przyszłej Unii Europejskiej, która powstanie zamiast Wspólnot. Jest to trudne zadanie wymagające wprowadzenia wielu zmian dostosowawczych oraz konsekwentnego współdziałania całego społeczeństwa.  Możemy przezwyciężyć nasze zapóźnienie cywilizacyjne i stać się równorzędnym  partnerem państw rozwiniętych tylko przez szybkie i skuteczne włączenie Polski do procesu gospodarczej i politycznej integracji zachodnioeuropejskiej. Dobrowolna izolacja  i niewykorzystanie szansy szybkiego rozwoju doprowadziłyby z czasem nieuchronnie do marginalizacji polskiej gospodarki i ubożenia społeczeństwa, a to groziłoby utratą wolności i suwerenności. Związki ze Wspólnotami Europejskimi ułatwią, a członkostwo w nich przesądzi o naszym udziale w Sojuszu Północnoatlantyckim (NATO), gdyby nie doszło do niego wcześniej.

The United States is Canada's most important ally and the two countries maintain a relationship that is as close, complex, and extensive as any in the world.  31. As strategic arms reduction treaties between the United States and Russia are implemented over the next decade, stability will be enhanced. Nevertheless, potential challenges to continental defence remain: Russia retains strategic nuclear forces able to reach North America and a number of states have acquired, or are seeking to acquire, weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.  32. Canada-US defence cooperation continues to provide highly valued stability in a volatile and turbulent world. Though CanadaUS defence cooperation continues to serve this country's fundamental interests extremely well, certain arrangements require updating:  � Canada will contribute to aerospace surveillance, missile warning, and air defence capabilities at a significantly reduced level. � In the negotiations on the renewal of the NORAD agreement, Canada will seek to preserve its benefits and examine closely those areas which may need to change in accord with evolving challenges to continental security. � Canada supports ongoing discussions on the possible expansion beyond North America of NORAD's missile warning function, and is interested in gaining a better understanding of missile defence through research and in consultation with like-minded nations. � The possibility of developing a space-based surveillance system for North America in the next century will be explored, subject to a variety of military, financial and technological considerations.  33. Canada will continue to rely on the stability and flexibility of its relationship with the United States to help meet defence requirements in North America and beyond. To that end, the Department and the Forces will:  � maintain the ability to operate effectively at sea, on land, and in the air with the military forces of the United States in defending the northern half of the Western hemisphere. This includes plans for the provision of forces already tasked for other missions to the defence of the continent, consisting of: � a joint task force headquarters; � a maritime task group on each coast; � a brigade group with associated support elements; � two squadrons of fighter aircraft; and � a squadron of transport aircraft. � begin formal negotiations with the United States on the renewal of the NORAD agreement that expires in 1996, ensuring that its provisions reflect North American aerospace defence priorities; � as part of a renewed NORAD agreement, cooperate in: � the surveillance and control of North American airspace; � the collection, processing and dissemination of missile warning information within North America; and � the examination of ballistic missile defence options focused on research and building on Canada's existing capabilities in communications and surveillance; and � maintain Canada's participation in the Canada-US Test and Evaluation Program, the Defence Production and Development Sharing Arrangements, and other existing bilateral arrangements.  **Chapter 6 - Contributing to International Security**  34. The complex problems that confront the international community today defy easy solutions. Nevertheless, Canada will remain a strong advocate of multilateral security institutions.

April 1994   Das Weißbuch der Bundesregierung zur Sicherheits- und Verteidigungs-    politik und zur Entwicklung der Bundeswehr ist Bilanz und Programm.  Auf der Grundlage einer Lageanalyse wird die sicherheitspolitische Konzeption der Bundesregierung vorgestellt und der Weg der Streitkräfte in die Zukunft beschrieben. Das ist ein längerer Prozeß, der aus zwei Phasen besteht.  In der ersten Phase nach der Vereinigung Deutschlands kam es für die Bundeswehr darauf an, die Nationale Volksarmee aufzulösen, die Bundeswehr im Osten Deutschlands aufzubauen, die gesamtdeutschen Streitkräfte um etwa ein Drittel zu reduzieren, sie teilweise neu zu stationieren und gleichzeitig auf neue Aufgaben auszurichten. Mit der Rückführung der Streitkräfte auf die vertraglich vereinbarte Obergrenze von 370.000 Soldaten in diesem Jahr wird diese Phase weitgehend abgeschlossen.  In der zweiten Phase kommt es darauf an, unter Berücksichtigung der sicherheitspolitischen Lage, unserer gewachsenen internationalen Verantwortung und des sich daraus ergebenden Auftrags die Bundeswehr auf die Herausforderungen der Zukunft auszurichten. Wir müssen die Streitkräfte, die Deutschland schließlich haben und behalten will, in ihren Fähigkeiten und Zielstrukturen im einzelnen definieren. Die Bundeswehr muß trotz begrenzter Ressourcen ihren künftigen Aufgaben gerecht werden. Dann bleibt sie ein berechenbarer Faktor europäischer Stabilität und internationaler Kooperation.  Die deutschen Streitkräfte bleiben eingebettet in die militärische Integration der Nordatlantischen Allianz, die umfassend reformiert wird und damit Grundlage für Sicherheit und Stabilität in Europa bleibt. Das klare Signal, für neue Mitglieder offen zu sein, ist ein wichtiger Beitrag der NATO zur Stabilisierung des östlichen Europa. Integration und Kooperation sind die tragenden Elemente eines vernünftigen Gesamtkonzeptes für die europäische Stabilität.  Gemeinsam mit französischen und anderen europäischen Streitkräften ist die Bundeswehr treibende Kraft beim Aufbau einer europäischen Verteidigung. Ich danke meinem Kollegen François Léotard für die enge Abstimmung bei der Formulierung des französischen und deutschen Weißbuches. Wir unterstreichen damit unser Streben, die europäische Sicherheits- und Verteidigungspolitik gemeinsam voranzubringen.  Die Bundeswehr hat in der Zeit des Umbruchs Großartiges geleistet. Sie bewährt sich mit Erfolg in internationalen Friedenseinsätzen. In Kambodscha, im Irak, im ehemaligen Jugoslawien und in Somalia hat sie sich großes Ansehen erworben. Sie kann aber auch stolz auf ihre Leistungen im Einigungsprozeß sein. Als Armee der Einheit ist sie zum Vorbild beim Zusammenwachsen unseres Vaterlandes geworden. Ich freue mich darüber, wie sehr unsere Soldaten wegen ihrer Leistungen draußen und im Lande gewürdigt werden.  Ich danke allen Soldaten und zivilen Mitarbeitern für ihren hohen persönlichen Einsatz zum Wohle unserer Bundeswehr. Ohne ihr Engagement wäre dieser Erfolg nicht möglich gewesen.

Interests And Policy Of The Czech Republic In The Area Of Defence  The Czech Republic is interested in a peaceful and free-of-conflict development in Europe and in the world. Such development will strengthen the stability in Europe and will contribute to the development of democratic institutions and economical prosperity of the whole region.  The Czech Republic strives for the maintenance and strengthening of international peace and stability.  In its effort it follows the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and fulfils the obligations following from the international agreements to which it has committed itself. But in case of need it is ready to defend its interests and security in compliance with Article 51 of the UN Charter which words the right of collective and individual self-defence.  An important means for increasing the Czech Republic defenceability is the achievement of full membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) including its integrated structures. Therefore, the Czech Republic will continue its effort to come closer to the NATO member countries in both political and military areas. It understands the membership in NATO as an expression of joint responsibility for the protection and development of democratic values as well as political and economical stability. The Czech Republic will continue at the co-operation with NATO within Partnership for Peace and at the preparation of joint activities directed to both the prevention of conflicts and maintenance of peace in Europe and in the world.

[(see map 1)](http://www.resdal.org.ar/Archivo/gre-cap1-2_1.htm)  [(see map 2)](http://www.resdal.org.ar/Archivo/gre-cap1-2_2.htm)  The time has come for a world of stability and cooperation, for a common security system embracing all Europe, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Urals. Approaching the threshold of the 21st century, we need to redefine the relations and cooperation structures of the European countries in regard to security matters, in order to successfully address issues concerning:  o the internal adaptation of NATO (new command structure)  o the external adaptation of the Alliance  o the evolving relationship with Russia, Ukraine and the other countries of the Partnership for Peace (PfP) Programme  o the Western European Unions (WEU) role  o the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) new role.  Today, the most important developments in security matters in Europe are based on the fact that NATO changes, adapts to the new situation, adopts a new strategy, reorganises its command system and changes the structure of forces within the Alliance, creating multinational rapid reaction forces in order to improve its collective defence capability and its participation in crises management.  NATO, confronting the challenges of the new post-cold war international system, is moving forward with radical restructuring of its strategic goals, structures and operation. It aims to transform from a collective defence (military) organisation to a political, diplomatic and, at the same time, military organisation, mainly concerned with peace keeping in a wide geographic area, beyond the traditional region of responsibility of the Alliance. NATO generally promotes stability in Europe through the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) and the Partnership for Peace Programme (PfP).  Greece believes that the new Atlantic Treaty with its multiple capabilities and roles, aiming at gradually including all countries of Central and Eastern Europe, will constitute the guarantor for peace in the Balkans as well as in Europe, being the only reliable politico-military organization, able to fill the ""security vacuum"" created in the area by the collapse of the bipolar system. Based on this perspective, our country participates actively in all the procedures regarding NATO's transformation, the keystones being the development of a European Security and Defence Identity (ESDI), the establishment of an organisational structure for the implementation of the ""Combined Joint Task Force"" (CJTF) concept, the establishment of new headquarters and regional commands, as well as the promotion of PfP Programmes and the regional cooperation in the context of the EAPC, in a way that the existing regional balances are not upset by the structural reorganisation of the Alliance. Our country, persuaded that NATO's evolution serves security and peace in its wider area, aspires to become a ""bridge"" for the Southeast European countries, aiming at their smooth integration into the defensive system of the Alliance.

PRINCIPLES AND MAIN MISSIONS IN THE AREA OF DEFENCE**  **1. Strategic Principles of Defence** When asserting its security interests the Czech Republic prefers political means of solution and prevention of threatening conflicts to their solutions by using force. Therefore, a primary objective of the defence strategy is to ensure reliable readiness of the state and its armed forces for defence together with simultaneous diplomatic effort to solve possible conflict by the use of international law and agreements of alliance. Defence of the state has its political, historical, economical, legal, military, internal security and generally human character with closely connected and mutually intertwined relations. In case of an armed conflict the defence of the state must be comprehensive and integrated and making use of corresponding population, material and financial resources. The comprehensive strategy of defence requires formation of a unified state security system which would directively determine and legislatively exactly assign the responsibility, duties and tasks of the state administration authorities, territorial self-government authorities, legal entities and natural persons in the state of emergency, threat to the state or in the state of war. An intention of defence is to discourage possible aggressor by the fact that his losses would be substantially higher than possible gained advantages. An objective of defence is to avert an armed conflict; in case of an attack, to repel aggression either by our own forces or using assistance of our allies. If the aggressor penetrates into our state territory, the task of the Army of the Czech Republic (ACR) will be to destroy its forces, to restore the state border and its inviolability and thus even territorial integrity of the Czech Republic. External security is ensured by the armed forces the readiness of which must, first of all, reliably prove political resolve of the state to self-defence and decision of citizens to defend unconditionally the state interests. Main tool for ensuring the defenceability of the state against outer threat is the ACR. Internal security and order are ensured by the Ministry of Interior. From the viewpoint of defence strategy, the main mission of the Ministry of Interior (Ml) is protection of the state border and elimination of the phenomena which could be a reason for breaking the internal security of the state, its destabilisation or even an armed conflict on its territory.  **2.

The present resolution will enter into force on the day of the entry into force of § 2 of the Act on the accession of the Republic of Hungary to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and on the promulgation of the latter. At the same time, Resolution No. 11/1993/III.12/ on the basic principles of the security policy of the Republic of Hungary and Resolution No. 27/1993/IV.23/ on the principles of the national defense of the Republic of Hungary of the National Assembly will be annulled.  **THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE SECURITY AND DEFENSE POLICY OF THE** **REPUBLIC OF HUNGARY.**  In the course of the past few years, changes of fundamental importance have taken place in the external security situation of the Republic of Hungary, to a decisive extent as a result of the achievements made in the field of Euro-Atlantic integration. With the achievement of membership in NATO and the practical advancement of the process of accession to the European Union, the country has also institutionally become a member of the community of democratic, developed and stable nations of the Euro-Atlantic region. All this requires the basic principles of the security and defense policy of the Republic of Hungary to be redefined.  1. The Republic of Hungary defines security in a comprehensive sense, which includes, beside the traditional political and military factors, also other dimensions of security as defined in a broader sense – that is, its economic and financial, human and minority rights, information- and technology-related, environmental as well as international legal dimensions. In the world of global challenges, international political and economic mutual interdependence and technological development, the security of the Euro-Atlantic region has become indivisible.  2. As compared to the age of the bipolar international system, the threat of a worldwide armed conflict has decreased to a minimum while at the same time, the circle of risks and sources of threat has significantly increased and become more complex. Hungary’s security is influenced mainly by the development of security in the Euro-Atlantic region and the political, social and economic processes taking place in its region. However, the country must not consider itself immune to the global sources of threat, either. Its membership in an alliance system will bring about additional responsibilities and at the same time, increased opportunities in the context of handling the latter.

That is why, as part of the Review, we asked a team from industry, the Services and the consultants McKinsey to study the best ways to learn from companies in areas as diverse as oil exploration and car production, in our search for better ways to provide equipment. Their conclusions will lead to a fundamental overhaul of our procurement processes in my Smart Procurement Initiative.  18. Underpinning the changes to our forces is our reinforced international commitment. NATO will continue as the cornerstone of our defence planning, and we intend to build on our role as a leading European member of the Alliance. Our commitment to the United Nations, through our permanent membership of the Security Council, is also strengthened. We support efforts to help make the UN a more effective tool in resolving international problems. We are also prominent members of the OSCE and the WEU.  19. The British are, by instinct, an internationalist people. We believe that as well as defending our rights, we should discharge our responsiblities in the world. We do not want to stand idly by and watch humanitarian disasters or the aggression of dictators go unchecked. We want to give a lead, we want to be a force for good.  20. That is why the Government is committed to strong defence, and sound defence is sound foreign policy. As Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary General, said ""You can do a lot with diplomacy but, of course, you can do a lot more with diplomacy backed up with firmness and force"". It is my strong belief that the Strategic Defence Review will deliver Modern Forces for the Modern World which will enable Britain to achieve a ""lot more"" in the 21st century.

The Strategy represents the basic document that defines these interests, as well as the objectives for their achievement, and materializes the political expression and highest level settlement of the Romanian State, and at the same time, the instrument for substantiating and directing the actions within the whole system of national security.  The Strategy has horizon of evaluation over medium term comprising the predictable elements – at the moment – which influence the achievement of the goals of Romania’s national security.  **1. Romania’s National Security Interests**  Romania’s national interests represent those states and processes, based on the values assumed and pursued by the Romanian society, by which it ensures the prosperity, protection and safety of its members and the stability and continuity of the state.  Building a democratic Romania, politically stable and economically and socially prosperous, capable of efficiently taking part in the dynamics of international life makes it necessary that in full agreement with the development of the process of European and Euro-Atlantic integration, the following national interests should be asserted, achieved and safeguarded:  -  The maintenance of the integrity, unity, sovereignty and independence of the Romanian state;  -  Guaranteeing the fundamental and democratic freedoms, and ensuring the welfare, security and safety of Romania’s citizens;  -  The economic and social development of the country, in keeping up with the contemporary development in the world. Intense reduction of the wide gaps separating Romania from the developed European countries;  -  Meeting the conditions for Romania’s integration as a NATO and EU member. Romania must become a component with full obligations and rights of the two organizations, the only ones capable of guaranteeing its independence and sovereignty and enable an economic, political and social development similar to that of the democratic countries;  -  Asserting the national identity and pursuing it as a democratic value, making best use of and developing the national cultural heritage and the creative abilities of the Romanian people;  -  Protection of the environment, natural resources, the quality of the environmental factors at international standards.  In the pursuit of its national interests, Romania will follow the principles of international law, will develop the dialogue and cooperation with all international organizations and states interested in achieving stability and security.  **2. National Security Policy Goals**  Romania’s national security goals articulate the effective orientation and represent the basic landmarks of the practical, sectorial action of the various state institutions so that their coherent, correlated and interdependent realization shoul contribute to the accomplishment and assertion of the fundamental interests of the country.

"14","Belgium",2000,"**THE MODERNISATION PLAN 2000 – 2015 OF THE BELGIAN ARMED**  **FORCES.**  # The Belgian context  -  Belgium, yesterday a unitary country today a federal one, is composed of different linguistic communities and is characterised by institutions of great complexity in order to increase the autonomy of the different consisting regions. Confronted with never ending arbitration, it has cultivated the art of compromising up to excess.  -  For a long time Belgium has cherished a neutral policy, but in spite of its doing so it has been involved in the two major conflicts of this century and has made, by necessity, the realistic and pragmatic choice of enlisting in the defensive alliances (NATO, WEU). From this moment on Belgium has always been a precursor in the Europeanization of defence and security matters.  -  A part of our armed forces lived in Germany for almost fifty years and few are the cities in Belgium that have lived in the wake of military activity.  -  and finally, Belgium is a small country  -  better than big countries do, it spontaneously acknowledges its own limitations and feels the need of co-operation and anchorage in a more vast entity;  -  it realises that even if big countries have more impact on international organisations it is better to be part of these and be entitled to give its opinion;  -  it is easier for Belgium to take radical decisions. It sometimes behaves as a forerunner in certain matters, adopting a more flexible and trend setting approach. To give you some examples: the decision taken in 1992 to suspend the conscription and turning the armed forces into an allvolunteer force, or the voting of the law prohibiting antipersonnel mines in 1996.  # The preceding reform phases: why did we restructure in the past?  We did so for different reasons.  -  First of all there are the geopolitical and geo-strategic reasons : the  dramatic changes in the geopolitical environment since the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 and the collapse of the USSR in 1991 : the end of the cold war, the changes in types of threats and the redefinition by international organisations of new concepts as to security and defence, the multiplication of operations abroad in the framework of regional conflicts are certainly some major reasons why Belgium has restructured its armed forces thoroughly, reducing it and transforming it.

The level of ambition for the Dutch armed forces laid down in the Government Policy Accord comprises contributions to NATO in the framework of collective defence and participation in a maximum of four peacekeeping operations simultaneously with battalion-sized units or their equivalent, if necessary for a period of three years. This is in keeping with the ambitions and capabilities of a country such as the Netherlands and expresses our commitment to international involvement. The level of ambition is determined to a great extent by the sum total of military capabilities which our country can make available to international alliances for collective defence and for crisis management, peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. The defence plans outlined in this White Paper describe the military capabilities necessary to fulfil the demands laid down in the Government Policy Accord. The large variety of missions requires a large variety of modules. However, theory and practice part company when it comes to the number of deployed units actually required and the actual duration of the deployment. This is illustrated by what has occasionally been a sizeable deployment in Bosnia and Kosovo over the much longer period of three years. The armed forces have a wide range of choices with regard to the assets which may be deployed for peacekeeping operations. A priority in this respect is that the armed forces must be organised and equipped for the general defence tasks. There must be some margin to enable the armed forces to function well and to allow a certain amount of political freedom of choice.  To carry out the tasks defined above, the armed forces must be capable of the following:  -  general defence in a NATO context, which may involve mobilisation of reserve units;  -  participation for a limited duration in a peace-enforcement operation with a brigade or its equivalent (e.g. a maritime task group, three squadrons of fighter aircraft, or a combination of these units);  -  sustained participation in a maximum of four peace operations involving contributions at battalion level or its equivalent (e.g. a squadron of fighter aircraft or two frigates);  -  national military tasks, such as the protection of the integrity of national territory, coastal waters and air space;  -  civilian government tasks, such as police tasks carried out by the Royal Marechaussee (border control, mobile monitoring of aliens and security on aviation premises) and providing military assistance in helping to carry out civil   ","page",4,"netherlands_2000_SummaryOfDefenceWhitePaper"
"17","South Korea",2000,"Security Situation Overview  Since the end of the Cold War, the global security situation has shown two opposing trends. One is toward peace, sustained by an increase in cooperation and reconciliation, and the other toward insecurity caused by ongoing regional conflicts and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  On December 3, 1989, the United States and the former Soviet Union made a joint declaration, calling for ""an official end to the Cold War between the eastern and the western blocs and for a start of a new age of cooperation for lasting peace."" Positive results ensued. The eastern Europeans and the Third World adopted democracy and opted for a free market system. Further, an increasing number of countries began to resort to non-violent means to resolve inter-state disputes.  However, the problems that lay dormant during the Cold War have resurfaced and, along with many new ones, are emerging as the latest threats to global security. Foremost are the frequent communal disputes, be they racial, religious, ethnic, or territorial. The countries labeled ""States of Concern"" are a constant threat, as they refuse to cease production of WMDs such as nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. In addition, problems on a transnational level, including environmental pollution, drug trafficking, terrorism, and refugee issues are also on the rise.  As the world's sole superpower, the United States is dealing with the security issues by way of bilateral alliances and collective security establishments like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The US is expected to remain the primary stabilizing force around the globe in the new millennium, despite challenges from Russia and China, who frequently express opposing views on some of the most controversial issues facing the international community.  The new millennium will also witness the United Nations enlarge its sphere of activity, as it pushes for a speedy conclusion to several important negotiations to reduce strategic and conventional weapons. A strict enforcement of the terms of these negotiations is another key concern of the organization. At the grassroots level, the UN works for stability via peacekeeping operations, sending trained men and women to areas of conflict.  #","section",25,"southkorea_2000_DefenseWhitePaper"

"19","Turkey",2000,"  **PART ONE**  **SECTION ONE**  **GENERAL**  The most important problem today is to make peace and stability permanent. Today, in the shrinking world environment, the importance of organizations, such as the United Nations (UN) in the lead, followed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), European-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC), Mediterranean Dialogue and the Western European Union (WEU), have increased and the need for coordinated activities between them has become prominent. Particularly, security organizations such as NATO and WEU, have acquired an even greater importance in the realization of this goal. In the region, the activities for NATO's preservation of the Euro-Atlantic ties and for attaining a flexible character in its military structure, the attempts of the European allies for assuming a more visible role in the defense field and the subjects of the development in the European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI), have become prominent as the significant dimensions of the transformation process being experienced. After the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary joined NATO, at the 1999 NATO Washington Summit, a Membership Action Plan was proposed to nine countries composed of Bulgaria, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Macedonia and Albania, and the standards for membership have been determined. Furthermore, in the Amsterdam Treaty, which went into effect in May 1999, it was targeted to develop closer organizational relations between the European Union (EU) and the WEU within the framework of the European Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). A need for a European Security Architecture emerged that would be composed of organizations which would mutually support and complement each other after the evaluation that the European security could not be provided solely by NATO and/or the WEU. The relations between NATO, WEU, OSCE, EAPC, NATO-Russia and NATO-Ukraine and the EU are the cornerstones of this architecture. The Partnership for Peace (PfP) Program, started in 1994, has acquired a new dimension with the steps taken at the Washington Summit towards making the relations of NATO-PfP countries more effective under the name of ""Enhanced and More Operational Partnership"". The PfP program is of importance from the aspect of NATO's establishment of a cooperation with the new democracies focused on security. Turkey places great importance on the PfP activities, that will provide contributions to regional and world peace within the principles of the EAPC. Within this framework, the Educational Center for the Partnership for Peace (ECPfP) has been established in Turkey. As for NATO's Mediterranean Dialogue, which was initiated in 1994 with the participation of Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Mauritania, and finally Algeria, is another activity that Turkey considers to be important and NATO is continuing its functions successfully for the prevention of misinterpretations, which could be formed in the Dialogue   ","page",4,"turkey_2000_DefenseWhitePaper"

"21","Finland",2001,"  **SUMMARY**  Introduction  The Government report ""The European Security Development and Finnish Defence"", submitted to Parliament in 1997, outlined developments in the European security environment and their impact on Finland. It went on to define the principles for developing Finland's defence up to 2008 on the basis of an assessment of the international situation and as part of Finland's overall security policy. The report proposed that the structural changes in Finland's defence system should be reviewed at intervals, the first review planned for 2001, and that a comprehensive report on the long-term plans for Finland's defence system should be made no later than 2005.  The Parliamentary Defence and Finance Committees submitted their comments on the report to the Foreign Affairs Committee. Parliament subsequently approved the Foreign Affairs Committee's report, augmented with supplementary statements on Defence Forces' personnel and garrisons having lost conscript training.  An important change in the preparation of security and defence policy occurred when the Defence Council was abolished on March 1, 2000. The Council's duties were reallocated to the Government Committee on Foreign and Security Policy and the Ministry of Defence. The former was made responsible for important matters concerning total national defence and coordination of these matters, while the Ministry of Defence was given the new responsibility of coordinating the actions of different branches of government in matters of total national defence. A new Security and Defence Committee was set up at the same time, with the task of assisting the Ministry of Defence and the Government Committee on Foreign and Security Policy in these matters. The new committee was also given the task of coordinating the preparation of the 2001 report.  The long-term development of Finland's security policy and defence recommended in the 1997 report require that preparation of the following comprehensive report be brought forward to 2004. The report will also assess the defence system as a whole in the light of developments in the security environment and society in general.  The security environment and Finland's policy  In the international environment, the democratic reforms and stabilization in Europe following the end of the Cold War are continuing, with the European Union playing a key role. By acquiring new means for crisis management, the EU will increase its influence not only as a political and economic force but also as an actor in the field of security policy. At the same time, the EU will be developing its capacity to prevent security problems from arising and to strengthen security in a broad sense. Enlargement of the Union will significantly improve the prospects for wellbeing and security beyond the present EU boundaries and will be a key means of achieving stability and unification in Europe.  The importance of cooperation between the EU and Russia for the future of Europe is continually growing. As a result of the EU's common security and defence policy, its relations with the United States will acquire more substance in the field of security policy. Security in the Baltic Sea region will improve as a result of regional cooperation and the overall changes occurring within Europe. This will be shaped by the enlargement of the EU and of NATO and developments in relations between Russia and the Baltic States.   ","page",4,"finland_2001_SecurityAndDefencePolicy"
"22","Slovakia",2001,"  -  the principle of the sovereign right to guarantee one's own security, which emanates from the natural right of the Slovak Republic to individual and collective defense according to the Charter of the Organization of the United Nations; it expresses the right to freely decide on one's own security on the basis of sovereign equality, the right of free choice of the forms of one's own security with the sovereign right to belong or not to belong to international and supranational organizations,  -  the principle of complexity, which accepts the importance and mutual influence of several factors, especially political, defense, internal-security, economic, social and environmental factors in the security policy of the Slovak Republic,  -  the principle of engagement, which expresses the active attitude of the Slovak Republic and the decision not to remain only a passive consumer of the advantages of international security co-operation,  -  the principle of indivisibility of security, on the basis of which the Slovak Republic will not realize such measures for the strengthening of its own security which would endanger the security of other states,  -  the principle of prevention, which expresses the resolve of the Slovak Republic to adopt effective measures aimed at preventing risks and threats to its security, their timely identification and elimination,  -  the principle of compatibility of the security policy of the Slovak Republic with its constitutional-legal order and international legal standards and agreements to which the Slovak Republic has accepted,  -  the principle of a co-ordinated approach, which requires a purposeful management of all capabilities and resources necessary for guaranteeing security at the national and supranational level,  -  the principle of continuity and credibility, which expresses the continuity, irrefutability, stability and credibility of the security policy of the Slovak Republic,  -  the principle of responsibility and obligation of state organs and organs of local governmental bodies, legal and physical entities and all citizens to participate in the realization of the security policy of the state,  -  the principle of environmental security.  AREAS AND INSTRUMENTS FOR THE REALIZATION OF THE SECURITY POLICY OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC  33. In accordance with the abovementioned goals and principles, the security policy of the Slovak Republic is being realized in two basic areas:  -  in the area of shaping the security environment,  -  in the area of deepening the ability and readiness to respond to the challenges, risks and threats to its interests and to addressing crisis situations.  SHAPING THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT  34. The Slovak Republic attaches great importance to shaping and influencing a stable security environment, in which favorable conditions are created for the realization of its vital and important interests. To this end it will utilize all available and effective options and means, especially measures aimed at prevention and those that strengthen global, European, regional and internal security and deepen international co-operation and enforcement of principles of international law and a state's respect for the rule of law.  -  Prevention and strengthening of global, European and regional security  35. The Slovak Republic will develop its participation on those global political, economic, environmental, social and cultural integration trends of the present world, which have a determining significance on the shaping of its security environment. It will continue to pay special attention to the development of relations with the Organization of the United Nations, which it considers the most important forum for multilateral co-operation. The Slovak Republic will therefore support the enhancement of mechanisms of the activities of the United Nations that contribute to the increase of its powers and making its work more effective. It will direct its activity in the United Nations towards solutions of issues such as improvement in the quality of the environment, lowering the tension between the developed and the developing world, disarmament, and co-ordination of the fight against organized crime and international terrorism. It will continue to take part in peace and humanitarian operations.  36. The Slovak Republic considers NATO and EU to be decisive factors of guaranteeing security, stability and prosperity in Europe and in the entire Euro-Atlantic area, for the present as well as with an outlook into the future, and it is preparing for membership in these organizations. In the interest of the development of co-operation in European security, the Slovak Republic is active in the realization of the conclusions of the European Security Charter. It will continue to actively participate in the activities of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in preventing an emergence of tensions, in crisis management and in post-conflict stabilization.

"23","Croatia",2002,"  3. Today’s world features quick and dynamic changes in international relations. Although the world’s collective security structure has been preserved after the failure of a bipolar world order through the system of the Organisations of the United Nations, relations between leading players in international relations have thoroughly been changed. Most events in the fields of economy, defence, security, society and others are defined by two contradictory processes. On one hand we have globalization as a process of unifying various administrating systems and cultures, resulting in the unity of value systems, political order and technology, on the other hand there is a process underway which is strengthening all forms of individual identity – national, regional, cultural, religious and others. The Republic of Croatia is part of this new reality and wishes to actively participate in its shaping – in accordance to its capabilities and interests. Under these conditions the principle of non-shareable security is becoming more and more significant – there is no strengthening of one’s own security at the expense of another’s security. At the same time risks and threats cannot be efficiently handled without joint cooperation and assistance. New challenges seek new solutions.  4. The Republic of Croatia’s security environment is defined by specific factors which have a determining effect on its current position. First of all, Croatia was in a transition towards a democratic society and market economy during its first stage which was marked with armed aggression with the goal of preventing Croatian independence. Most economical difficulties which we face today, as well as most security risks, are results, mostly directly, from the mentioned environment. Nonetheless, today’s security environment is more favourable than it has been in the last ten years.  5. The instability of a part of its environment, which is only at the beginning of its socialeconomic transition, poses a security challenge for the Republic of Croatia. However, this instability no longer poses a direct threat to security.  6. Six years after the signing of the Dayton Accord, Bosnia and Herzegovina is still under the intense administrative supervision of the international community. The central state administration does not function at a level required for successfully governing a state. The position of Croatians in Bosnia and Herzegovina is sensitive, among other things, because of their small number. The return of refugees and displaced persons (one of the main preconditions for normalizing life and society as a whole) is not being conducted proportionately. An obvious disproportion exists between national entities.  7. After parliamentary and presidential elections, held in October, 2000, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was the main cause of regional instability during the previous ten years, no longer poses an immediate threat to security but is now a potential partner. Bilateral relations have been normalized and their development is expected, with good reason, through various forms of bilateral and regional cooperation. A more active role is required from the Republic of Croatia in order for the entire region of Southeastern Europe to grow into a zone of partnership, stability and economic progress.  8. Croatia’s environment also includes stable and consolidated democracies. Some have reached a degree of advanced transition and are at the verge of becoming European Union member states. Hungry has been a member of NATO since 1999 and this represents a significant contribution to regional stability. Others are involved in European integrations, i.e., Euro-Atlantic associations. All of these countries represent important markets for Croatian goods and services and are key partners in all aspects. During the last decade,   ","page",2,"croatia_2002_StrategyForNationalSecurity"

It encompasses political, diplomatic, defence, economic and other spheres of the state’s policy.  1.2. The Republic of Lithuania implements its National Security Strategy through a system of long-term political provisions and means, enabling to preserve the sovereignty of the state, its territorial integrity, democratic constitutional order, human and civil rights and freedoms, and a safe environment of individual, by confronting security challenges, dangerous conditions, threats, crisis situations or military conflicts.  1.3. The Republic of Lithuania perceives its security as preserving its sovereignty and territorial integrity, internal security and order, democratic foundations, economic security of all legal entities and population and protection of its natural environment.  1.4. The National Security Strategy defines basic goals of specialised strategies and doctrines in separate areas of the state policy. These strategies must be directly based on the provisions of the National Security Strategy of the Republic of Lithuania and they must be revised every time the National Security Strategy of Lithuania itself is updated.  1.5. The agenda for the security policy of the Republic of Lithuania until the next review of the National Security Strategy will be determined by the following distinguishing features of the current security environment:  1.5.1. final preparations for entry into NATO and the EU; 1.5.2. addressing the challenge of international terrorism.  **2. BASIC ASSUMPTIONS OF SECURITY POLICY**  2.1. After five decades of occupation, the Republic of Lithuania restored its independence on March 11, 1990 and has since been developing as a modern, politically, economically, socially and culturally mature democracy, actively pursuing integration into the organisations of democratic states adhering to the same values. Dismantling of the Soviet bloc and the restoration of freedom and independence have created appropriate conditions for the Republic of Lithuania to define its security interests and policy.  2.2. The current situation of the Republic of Lithuania within the international security system is as favourable as at the latter decade. The independence of the Republic of Lithuania is universally recognised and respected, growth in the economy is improving steadily, friendly relations and practical co-operation with the neighbours are being maintained, national minorities have been successfully integrated into Lithuanian society, ten years of experience of functioning democratic institutions has been accumulated, democratic civil control of the military has been efficiently established, and integration into the global and Western institutions is advancing successfully.

"27","Portugal",2003,"  280 _DIÁRIO DA REPÚBLICA — I SÉRIE-B_ _N.[o]_ _16 — 20 de Janeiro de 2003_   decorrentes do uso intencional, indevido ou não especializado dos referidos meios e materiais. Consequentemente, perseguindo a finalidade de garantir a segurança e o bem-estar dos cidadãos, o Estado é obrigado a repensar e a adequar os conceitos e os instrumentos de segurança e defesa ao novo ambiente político-estratégico, numa perspectiva de minimização de riscos e de garantia da possibilidade de resposta, não só a estes novos tipos de desafios à paz e à estabilidade internacional como a quaisquer outros que venham a revelar-se. 1.2 — A fronteira estabelecida entre segurança e defesa, as acções concretas com cabimento em cada uma destas áreas e as entidades primariamente responsáveis pelo seu tratamento resultam do estipulado na Lei de Defesa Nacional e das Forças Armadas, Lei n.[o] 29/82. Na sua génese, esteve a necessidade de normalizar relações entre diversas entidades públicas e reposicionar poderes, inteiramente compreensíveis na conjuntura da época. Hoje, está ultrapassada essa questão e a evolução dessa fronteira deve ser igualmente percebida para não inibir a articulação dos esforços que as diferentes organizações devem desenvolver, procurando sinergias, rentabilizando meios e melhorando a eficiência na prevenção e combate aos actuais riscos e ameaças, sempre à luz dos princípios e das normas de ordem constitucional e legal portuguesa. Assim, e por se entender que «a definição dos aspectos fundamentais da estratégia global do Estado adoptada para a consecução dos objectivos da política de segurança e defesa nacional» necessita de ser adequada à nova realidade político-estratégica, afigura-se oportuno a elaboração de um novo conceito estratégico de defesa nacional, que é o resultado de um debate crítico, participado e multidisciplinar sobre as questões de segurança e defesa.  **2 — Enquadramento internacional**  2.1 — Num espaço de influência euro-atlântico, é possível definir linhas de instabilidade, envolvendo a África do Norte, a África Subsariana, o Médio Oriente, os Balcãs, o Cáucaso, a Ásia Central e a Ásia do Sul, nas quais se concentram riscos de separatismos e conflitos étnicos, religiosos e fronteiriços, fundamentalismos ou migrações em massa. As vulnerabilidades do Estado nestas regiões tornam crescentes as ameaças ligadas ao terrorismo, ao narcotráfico, ao tráfico de pessoas e ao crime organizado. Acresce que os fenómenos de desestruturação dos Estados e da globalização vieram contribuir para aumentar os riscos de proliferação de armas de destruição de massa e de uso indevido de novas tecnologias, bem como a diminuição de garantias de manutenção e controlo de equipamentos e material nuclear, radiológico, químico e biológico. Considera-se, também, a possibilidade de poderem constituir-se em foco de conflitualidade internacional os aspectos que resultem da desregulação ambiental e ecológica e da gestão dos recursos naturais, nomeadamente os hídricos e os energéticos. A acrescer a este conjunto de riscos mais imediatos, é hoje possível identificar um outro conjunto de factores que não deixarão de influenciar e condicionar o ambiente internacional e que se prendem com:  A permanência das desigualdades no desenvolimento;   O reforço do internacionalismo financeiro; A permanência de radicalismos políticos, ideológicos e religiosos; O aumento da interdependência, por força da revolução da informação e da interactividade; O crescimento dos fluxos migratórios, o carácter multicultural das sociedades e zonas de não integração das novas comunidades; Os factores ligados à evolução tecnológica, aos novos «vírus» e à utilização criminosa do ciberespaço; A atitude interventora da comunidade internacional e o exercício do direito de ingerência; A existência de uma única superpotência e a tensão entre «unilateralismo» e «multilateralismo»; A utilização do Espaço para fins científicos, económicos ou militares e as perspectivas de utilização geoestratégica que se prefiguram.  2.2 — Desta situação resulta que, cada vez mais, se propende hoje para definir um conceito alargado de segurança que, continuando a integrar os objectivos mais tradicionais dos Estados — defesa do território e da soberania —, confere atenção acrescida a uma filosofia preventiva e a uma visão global da evolução dos focos de insegurança internacional e das crises que deles decorrem, com o intuito de as prevenir e limitar, evitando o seu desenvolvimento para formas agravadas de conflitualidade. Neste quadro, como forma de optimizar a resposta dos actores internacionais, tem vindo a impor-se uma ideia de segurança cooperativa, com reflexos no desenvolvimento das organizações internacionais. A Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU) vem assumindo um papel mais interventivo na área da segurança internacional, enquadrando um conjunto crescente de acções no domínio das operações humanitárias e de paz nos mais diversos pontos do globo. Esta vontade pode ser testemunhada, mais recentemente, pelos esforços de readequação interna da estrutura de apoio às operações de paz conduzidas sob a sua égide e pelo seu empenho em suscitar um maior comprometimento dos países que disponibilizam forças. A Organização para a Segurança e Cooperação na Europa (OSCE) continua a orientar a sua atenção para os aspectos relacionados com a defesa dos direitos humanos, a resolução pacífica e a prevenção de conflitos, a gestão política de crises e a participação em actividades de manutenção de paz, tendo reforçado a sua capacidade política, em particular no domínio da diplomacia preventiva. Neste último aspecto, são de realçar as medidas de combate ao terrorismo resultantes da Conferência Internacional de Bishkek e a eleição da mesma temática para prioridade de acção no decurso da presidência portuguesa da Organização. 2.3 — A Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) tem vindo a cumprir um processo de adaptação ao novo ambiente internacional. A Cimeira de Washington, em Abril de 1999, adoptou um novo conceito estratégico, em que a aliança assume as tarefas tradicionais de defesa colectiva dos seus membros e as inerentes operações do artigo 5.[o] do Tratado do Atlântico Norte, mas também se posiciona para o cumprimento de funções de prevenção e gestão de crises «fora de área». Em paralelo, foi desenvolvido o Programa da Parceria para a Paz como forma de reforçar quer a estabilidade   ","page",2,"portugal_2003_StrategicConcept"

The establishment and development of sincere and reciprocal relationships with neighboring countries and also, the rights and freedom of Albanian citizens everywhere, are a priority for the security of the Republic of Albania.  The consolidation and improvement of the instruments of security serve to the protection of national interests without violating the interests or security of the other countries. They are an expression of the protecting policy of sovereignty and independence, freedom and prosperity, peace and integrity of a democratic country, protecting oneself and as a pledge to give our contribution to the international context.  **PART ONE**  **THE SECURITY STRATEGY**  **I .THE CONCEPT OF THE STRATEGY OF SECURITY**  **1. The** National Security Strategy **of the Republic of Albania represents the integral** official means and instruments guaranteeing the protection of citizens, society and the Albanian state from external and domestic threats and risks. Its main object is to face the possible challenges of security for the present and the future, taking into consideration the geo strategic environment of security, the guarantee level that collective systems of security give, and also the Country’s disposal resources and real capacities.  **2. The principal feature of the Strategy of security is to respect the rule of law. The** Strategy of security has as its own resource and basis the Constitution of the Republic of Albania and the Albanian legislation. It respects all international agreements, treaties, and conventions in which the Republic of Albania takes part. The Strategy becomes successful by bringing closer the viewpoints of all actors and components of the security, despite all the different affiliations.  **3. Strategy vision focusing on integration.** Collective security defense is the future perspective of all the countries that aim the fulfillment of the contemporary and democratic standards of security. The National Security Strategy of the Republic of Albania is based on the concept of an accelerated approach of our country, through multidimensional and graduated reforms, in the European and Euro-Atlantic collective security structures, putting special emphasis on EU and NATO, based on the United Nations provisions for the security and collective protection. It is to be taken in consideration that the efforts to the integration in the collective structures will be accompanied by the consolidation of reforms in the system of security and protection of the country, to adapt and come closer to the organization and functioning of collective structures.

"29","Denmark",2004,"  ### The Liberals, the Conservatives, the Social Democrats, the Danish People Party, the Social Liberals and the Christian Democrats have entered into the following agreement for the Danish Defence.  Introduction  1. The Danish Defence is an important factor in working towards the realisation of the foremost goals of the Danish foreignand security policy, namely democracy, freedom and human rights.  The goals of the Danish Defence are the following: 1) to counter direct and indirect threats to the security of Denmark and allied countries, 2) to maintain Danish sovereignty and the protection of Danish citizens, 3) to work towards international peace and security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter, specifically through conflict prevention, peacekeeping, peacemaking, and humanitarian operations.  Changes in the international security environment require the Danish Defence to strengthen its capacities in two central areas: 1) Internationally deployable military capacities and 2) the ability to counter terror acts and their consequences.  The United Nations is the framework of the efforts to create international order. In recent years the UN has developed a more effective capacity to engage in peace supporting operations and this development should be supported. At the same time the ability of the UN, as well as the ability of regional organisations, to prevent and resolve conflicts, among other places in Africa, should be strengthened.  The political parties behind the Defence Agreement agree that NATO is the central forum for joint security – and defence cooperation. The collective defence remains strongly anchored within NATO. NATO is the framework of the transatlantic partnership and a guarantor of European security. Denmark will continue to contribute to NATO, including the NATO Response Force.  The Danish Defence will contribute with ready, well-equipped and effective forces for international operations, as well as a strengthened coordination between the military and the civilian humanitarian effort in the area of operations.  Furthermore, in the case of the Danish opt-out with regard to the EU defence policy possibly being removed in the future, Denmark will be able to participate in the EU efforts within peacemaking, peacekeeping, conflict prevention, humanitarian operations and the strengthening of international security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter.  The political parties agree that the structure and capacity of the Danish Defence during 2005-2009 should be organised in a way that will ensure that Denmark, in the event of a possible removal of the opt-out, will be immediately able to contribute to future European defence initiatives, including combating terrorism, preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and peace supporting operations with force contributions from both the EU and NATO.  The current security environment, including the enlargement of NATO and the EU, is of such a nature that the conventional military threat to the Danish territory has ceased for the foreseeable future. There is no longer a need for the conventional territorial defence of the Cold War.  The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and subsequent terrorist attacks have demonstrated that the security challenges and risks confronting Denmark and other nations have significantly changed. New asymmetric and unpredictable threats such as international terrorism and the spreading of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery have entered the scene.  The threats do not necessarily have to originate from Denmark’s geographical proximity, but may nevertheless constitute a risk to Denmark, our allies and our common values, even if they manifest themselves abroad. Accordingly, the priority of Danish security policy should be aimed at possessing the capability to counter the threats where they emerge, regardless of whether this is within or beyond Denmark’s borders. Therefore, Danish Defence – together with other national components – should focus on strengthening the total defence of Denmark and its population and on ensuring Denmark’s capability to participate in international operations.

"31","Slovenia",2004,"  **MINISTER’S** **ADDRESS**  Dynamic changes in the security environment, membership of the EU and NATO and the professionalisation of the Slovenian Armed Forces have all lead to the need for a rational modification of Slovenia’s national security and national defence system.  Radical changes in security are the result of internal and external security issues, while the consequential reform of the defence sector is aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the defence system.  Defence reforms must follow from a comprehensive analysis of all the elements related to defence and the current status of the defence system. A decision was therefore taken to conduct a Strategic Defence Review which would include long-term guidelines and a vision of the defence system up to 2015.  Development of the defence system must take into account new circumstances and changes in the international security environment as well as national interests, goals and available resources.  The effectiveness of the defence reforms and the systematic transformation of the Slovenian Armed Forces into a professional force depend on sufficient financial resources being made available. Similarly important is functional professionalisation which requires a holistic and coherent structure relating to organisation, processes, values and motivation.  The importance of the Strategic Defence Review lies in the linkage between theoretical assumptions relating to national security and defence, and practical experience. The document is at the same time general and focused on the long-term, but also practical with short-term orientations.  The Strategic Defence Review has given us the relevant basis for an extensive and thorough analysis of the further development of the Slovenian Armed Forces and of the defence system. It has also defined a firm basis for further implementation of the defence reforms and strong guarantees for matching defence reforms with available resources and the new security challenges. The resulting defence system will enable the development of well trained, motivated and combat capable defence forces which will be able to carry out all types of missions and tasks.  As the Strategic Defence Review is successfully brought to a conclusion, the necessary defence reforms must now take a place.  **Dr. Anton GRIZOLD**   **Minister of Defence**   ","page",6,"slovenia_2004_StrategicDefenceReview"

"33","Montenegro",2006,"  **_I N T R O D U C T I O N_**  The Strategy of National Security of Montenegro (Hereinafter referred to as: the Strategy) is the document that defines the development and functioning of the system of national security of Montenegro and it is an expression of its commitment to be a part of the regional and global security systems.  The Strategy addresses the national interests, security objectives, security risks and challenges, possible reactions of the state of Montenegro to these risks and challenges as well as the structure of the national security system; it also focuses on the capacities of the state of Montenegro and its continuous efforts to adjust to global changes and to contribute to security and stability in South East Europe.  The Strategy confirms Montenegro’s commitment to undertake all necessary actions so as to meet the conditions for its integration into the Euro-Atlantic and other international security structures. In that context, the strategic goal of Montenegro is to become a full NATO and EU member as soon as it is possible. Having that goal in mind, Montenegro seeks to join the NATO’s Partnership for Peace Program.  The Strategy addresses the security system that Montenegro aims to establish by using the elements of the current security system and by developing some new ones. Having this approach in mind, the Strategy creates political-legal basis for thorough reform of the national security sector, as well as for legislative adaptation and further development of the national security system.  The Strategy represents the basic document that defines the concept of security of the state of Montenegro. All other documents that address security issues (such as the Security Policy, the Defense Strategy, Military doctrine, the Strategy for Homeland Security) and other security-related documents derive from it and have to comply with this Strategy.  The Strategy is a document that will serve as the basis for reforming the sectors of security and defense in Montenegro and that can be changed and adjusted to the extent of innovation and improvement of the security system. This Strategy gives grounds for a close cooperation in security-defense matters with all countries that so wish, provided there is a common interest in that.  The Strategy is a public document.

Numerous consultations were held with representatives of the French and foreign government departments concerned, civil and military experts, members of the representative committees of defence and security personnel, business leaders, trade union representatives, representatives of associations, academics and journalists. These took place within a more restricted framework, given the necessary confidentiality of certain discussions. _The dialogue with French parliamentarians comprised regular dis-_ cussions with the parliamentary committees, followed by a series of hearings behind closed doors with Government ministers on the draft _White Paper even before the President of the French Republic gave his_ seal of approval to the text. This was a radically new approach from previous White Papers’ proceedings. _A website set up for the occasion attracted more than 250,000 hits_ since its opening, indicating keen public interest in the shaping of French security and defence policy. To encourage dialogue, the Commission also opened a series of forums on its website to discuss most of the issues raised in the White Paper, including the place of France in the world, nuclear deterrence, the European defence capability, the concept of national security, the links between the armed forces and the nation, relations with NATO, the status of reservists, interventions abroad, etc. The Commission members naturally also went out to meet professionals working in the service of the defence and security of the nation. Around forty visits were made to the forces or to theatres of operation, to gauge hopes, aspirations and difficulties, notably with regard to the quality and availability of equipment. These visits systematically included roundtable discussions between members of the Commission and all categories of personnel. At the European level, discussions were held with our main partners and with eminent European Union and Atlantic Alliance personalities providing an opportunity to present the Commission’s work and learn the views of our partners.  **Reinventing our strategy**  The resulting White Paper introduces a major innovation in the def_inition of French strategy, in that it spells out a strategy not only for_ _defence, but also for national security._ _Its aim is to ward off the risks and threats detrimental to the life of_ _the nation.

La réaction des pays membres de l’ONU à la candidature luxembourgeoise durant l’année écoulée peut être qualifiée de très positive et le Luxembourg a pu obtenir un nombre significatif de soutiens de la part des pays partenaires. Ces derniers apprécient en effet l’engagement concret de notre pays en faveur l’ONU et en particulier la participation active du Luxembourg à la coopération multilatérale, tant au niveau régional qu’international, qu’il s’agisse du financement volontaire aux Fonds et Programmes des Nations Unies, de la participation aux opérations de maintien de la paix ou de la poursuite de notre politique active de coopération au développement.

En 2011, l’APD a toujours dépassé la barre de 1% du RNB et le gouvernement souhaitait de maintenir cet effort, en particulier en cette période difficile de crise. L’échéance des élections au Conseil de sécurité d’octobre 2012 se rapprochant, le Luxembourg est prêt à assumer la charge conférée au Conseil de sécurité par la Charte et de veiller au maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales, ceci en pleine transparence et dans le respect de l’égalité souveraine des Etats.  _Désarmement et non-prolifération_  En 2011, le Luxembourg a continué à appuyer les initiatives qui ont pour objectif le désarmement et la limitation des armements conventionnels et nucléaires.  Lors de la 66ème session de l’Assemblée générale des Nations unies à New York, le Ministre Asselborn a ainsi plaidé pour l’entrée en vigueur du Traité d’interdiction complète des essais nucléaires, un des éléments clés du régime de désarmement et de non-prolifération nucléaires.  Le Luxembourg a également participé à New York en juillet 2011au débat de l’Assemblée générale des Nations Unies sur le suivi de la Réunion de haut-niveau destinée à revitaliser les travaux de la Conférence du désarmement, où il a appelé au le lancement immédiat des négociations sur un traité international multilatéral, non discriminatoire et vérifiable sur l’interdiction de la production de matières fissiles.  Le Luxembourg a poursuivi son engagement de longue date au niveau du désarmement conventionnel, en participant à la Conférence des Etats-parties à la Convention sur les armes à sous-munitions en septembre à Beyrouth au Liban et à celle de la convention contre les mines anti-personnel en décembre à Phnom Penh au Cambodge. La lutte contre ces armes à effet _indiscriminatoire a été étayée par le financement conséquent de projets de déminage et de_ dépollution dans les régions les plus touchées du monde.  En 2011 et jusqu’en mai 2012, le Luxembourg est membre du Conseil exécutif de l’Organisation pour l’interdiction des armes chimiques (OIAC), basée à La Haye.

"38","Iceland",2014,"  Telecommunications systems and the primary data transmission networks must be reliable. IT and IT security in public administration must be enhanced, for example regarding coordination, education and awareness-raising.  The main basis of Iceland’s security and defence lies in the country’s collaboration with NATO, active collaboration with other Nordic countries and the Defence Agreement with the United States. It also includes the IT infrastructures mentioned above. The protection of the infrastructures on which these activities rely in Iceland is therefore one of the most important aspects of Iceland’s national defence. In view of this, the agreement signed recently with NATO’s Cyber Defence Management _Board will lead to increased collaboration in this field. As an indication of the importance attached by_ NATO to cyber security, it was decided that cyber-attacks could be classified under Article 5 of the NATO Treaty.  Increased collaboration with other international organisations such as the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe can also promote cyber security in Iceland.  A great deal can be gained from taking the initiative and forging ahead in this area. Building up cyber security is a challenge that no single entity in our society can undertake. To ensure optimum results it is necessary to approach the task in a comprehensive manner, involving as many IT users as possible. Both government institutions and private companies in addition to individuals should be included in this process.. It is important to begin this work immediately and create a common forum for development and collaboration, e.g. regarding security standards, coordination, identification of cyber security threats and the organisation of responses. Last but not least it is important to be aware of the fact that this will be an on-going process subject to continual review as it progresses, with new challenges calling for new solutions.  The strategy envisages the development of cyber security along the same lines as other aspects of civil protection and security.In the event of a catastrophe or cyber-threat, the emphasis will be on the rapid exchange of information between the parties concerned in order to minimise and mitigate damage, after which work will proceed on the next steps to be taken; assessment and recovery measures will follow the same pattern as is described in the civil defence programme. Furthermore, the event will be analysed in order to learn as much as possible from it. If the event is caused by human agents, then it must also be guaranteed that an efficient police investigation can go ahead.  **Review of the strategy and action plan**  This strategy shall be examined and reviewed as necessary, at minimum every four years. Measures based on the strategy shall be designed to cover shorter periods and shall be reviewed at least once a year. Procedure in implementing the strategy shall be in the spirit of public administration.   ","page",6,"iceland_2014_IcelandicNationalCyberSecurityStrategy"
