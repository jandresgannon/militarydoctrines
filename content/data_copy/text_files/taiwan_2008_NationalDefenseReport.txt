    The ultimate objectives of Taiwan's defense forces are based 
on strategic considerations for "national security, stability over 
the Taiwan Stairt, and regional peace" according to the Republic 
of China (Taiwan) Constitution, the ultimate objectives of Taiwan’s 
defense forces are based on strategic considerations for “national 
security, stability over the Taiwan Strait, and regional peace” , 
safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, ensuring 
the safety of the lives and assets of 23 million people living in 
Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matzu, and upholding the universal 
values of democracy, freedom, human rights, and peace. At the 
same time, Taiwan’s defense policies are also concerned over 
fulfilling its international responsibilities and playing the positive 
role of being a “security partner” on the regional and global levels, 
such that Taiwan acts as a defender, and not a dependent, of peace 
and security.
    However, dramatic changes to international situations relations 
and the emergence of new types of threats have resulted in major 
states around the world to adjust their strategic deployments 
and accelerate developments to their defense infrastructure. The 
People’s Republic of China (PRC), especially, exploits its rapid 
economic growth to incessantly expand its armaments, which not 
only puts considerable pressure on Taiwan, which is a mere strait 
away, but also affects the world’s sensitivities towards prospects of 
peace. Therefore, for Taiwan to outmaneuver a greater power, and 
overcome the enemy, it not only needs to establish a defense force 
that is “streamlined, high-quality and powerful”, but also needs to 
converge the willpower of its entire population to increase overall 
defense mobilization capacities. Therefore, the Taiwan Armed 
Forces need to accelerate their defense modernization, maximize 
efforts in forging ahead with Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA),

focus on integration of combat capabilities among the forces, raise 
personnel quality through establishment of modernized C4ISR 
systems, adjustments to the joint operation command mechanism, 
and updates to tactics, combat methods, and doctrines, and 
transform into an elite force capable of facing modern warfare.            
    To demonstrate Taiwan’s determination for self defense and 
eliminate doubts among allied countries, the Armed Forces not only 
work diligently on combat readiness and enhancing warfighting 
capabilities, they have also combined private sector capacities and 
developed defense technologies, producing distinguished results 
in research and development of cutting edge and key technologies. 
Also, the three major armament procurements of Patriot PAC-3 
missiles, new diesel-electric submarines, and P-3C fixed- wing ASW 
aircrafts have finally earned support from the Legislative Yuan to 
begin procurement; the 2008 defense budget has also reached the 
policy target of 3% of GDP , which is believed to be able to not only 
accelerate the modernization of weapons and equipments for the 
armed forces and fulfil the requirements of defensive operations, 
but also maximize the benefits of limited defense resources.
    To address to possible enemy “surprise attacks” and certain 
unpredictable offensive actions, the government has promulgated 
legislations relevant to “disaster prevention and protection”, 
“counter-terrorism and contingency response”, and “mobilization 
preparation”, and regularly conducts prevention and protection 
exercises to achieve uniformity between peacetime and 
wartime, such that emergency response mechanisms are more 
comprehensive.
    In particular, the “Yu-Shan Exercise”, which set the strict 
scenario to “anticipate enemy's strength by generous assessment", 
have served as a reference for policy-making by the President 
and various Ministers. These collective exercises, which practice 
crisis handling operations, have enhanced the government’s ability 
to respond to contingencies. Since implementation in 2005, the 
Excercise has progressively coordinated and integrated capabilities 
of various departments and overall national resources, such that the 
national security protection network becomes nigh impenetrable, 
achieving the objective of ensuring homeland security.
    Our efforts on defense are not part of an arms race, but meant to 
satisfy the basic requirements of maintaining national security and 
the lives and assets of the people. Ultimately, we cannot naively 
entrust our own security to the intentions of outsiders. To avert 
12the scourge of war, we have never abandoned the establishment 
of peaceful cross-strait relations, even as we enhance self 
defense capabilities. It is hoped that through exchange, rational 
communication, a safe environment can be produced over the 
Taiwan Strait and the region in general, and that cross-strait military 
mutual trust mechanisms can be built on the foundation of “equality 
and mutual trust”, including actions such as not developing or using 
Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), pushing  for humanitarian 
relief cooperation for peripheral seas, signing agreements to 
prevent dangerous military activities over the sea or air, defining 
military buffer zones, removing targeted weapon deployments, to 
gradually formulate a cross-strait doctrine, in hopes of “converting 
hostility to prosperity”, which is a demonstration of goodwill that is 
more compatible with the expectations of the people on both sides 
of the Taiwan Strait.
    In a democratic nation, the people have the authority to 
question what the government is doing for them. The Ministry of 
National Defense’s (MND) publication of this National Defense 
Report is precisely to explain to our people, with a professional 
and responsible attitude, recent efforts and contributions made by 
the government to enhance defense capabilities, ensure national 
security, and facilitate world peace to address cross-strait military 
balance and changes in the state of global security.
    Especially, Taiwan’s defense forces have gradually marched into 
the modernized era through “defense transformations”, developing 
defense concept, military strategies, force buildup planning, and 
vision all around “war prevention” and the “ability to fight and 
win”, and using “effective deterrence and resolute defense” as 
the strategic concept. From refinement results in aspects such as 
organization, force, armaments, doctrine, personnel, education, 
logistics, budgets, exercises, the Armed Forces have been forged 
into a strong and modern defense force, and the commendable 
results delivered in terms of observing constitutional constraints, 
adhering to the legislative spirit of the Two Defense Acts, enforcing 
military neutrality, demonstrating civilian control of the military, 
improving civil-military relations, creating positive public image, 
realizing the Three-Assurance policy, expanding military exchanges, 
and developing regional security cooperation are truly helpful 
towards building military advantages and increasing the people’s 
faith in the defense establishment.
    Amongst those, “civilian control of the military” is an important 
13National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
pillar in sustaining a democratic institution and laying down the 
foundation for democratic polity. Since enactment of the Two 
Defense Acts, the MND has established this principle and operation 
so that Taiwan is headed towards an era of revolution in military 
affairs and equipped with a modernized defense system. Even if 
different parties come into power, the Taiwan Armed Forces would 
remain steadfast in their posts, vigilantly carry out their duties and 
fulfill “civilian control of the military” with concrete actions, thereby 
displaying mature and solid progress of Taiwan’s democratization.
    In addition, results in “nationalization of the military” are 
extraordinary and gratifying. For the many central and local 
elections in the past, and in particular, the peaceful election of 
Taiwan’s 12th President and Vice President held on March 22, 
2008, the Armed Forces have strictly observed military neutrality, 
respectfully adhered to the nationalization of the military, and 
sufficiently built up the people’s sense of confidence and trust in 
the military. Today, the Armed Forces not only fully pledge loyalty to 
the nation, care for the people, transcend political boundaries, but 
at the same time also act as an important cornerstone for Taiwan’s 
democratic strength and social stability.
    Despite the PRC’s never renounces the use of force against 
Taiwan, its continuous use of the two-sided “peace-and-war” 
strategy against us, and its full-fledged efforts to suppress our 
existing space on the international arena to achieve its intentions 
of conquest, as long as our people truly recognize that, to 
maintain Taiwan’s current state of freedom, democracy, prosperity, 
and peace, we need to consolidate consensus from all citizens 
regarding national security, understand the PRC’s “harsh rhetoric 
and military preparation” and “three-warfare” tactics of “propaganda 
contests, psychological assaults, and legal contention”, establish 
an awareness for potential crisis and danger during peacetime, 
unite the people, concretely solidify psychological defense, 
wholeheartedly support the national defense infrastructures, and 
actively pursue international recognition, then all of which will be 
important references for averting and ending wars, eliminating the 
scourge of war, and preventing unexpected crises.
    National security is an expectation from all citizens. Today, the 
fate of this nation’s entire population is akin to being placed in the 
same boat, with fortune and woes all depending on one another 
and no one can be free of these influences, and only through 
a concerted effort can the boat sail forth steadfastly. In other 14
words, national security and defense affairs preparations require 
understanding, support, and participation from all of our people, 
and only strong all-out defense capacities and resolute willpower to 
resist the enemy can serve as a solid assurance to creating national 
competitiveness and survival and development, and protecting 
peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the region.
    Lastly, I not only want to thank the full devotion of the members 
of the Legislative Yuan and their colleagues, allowing the nation’
s people to have a deeper understanding of defense policy 
implementation and results, but also want to express my heartfelt 
respect and gratitude for the diligence and contributions of every 
servicemen in the Taiwan Armed Forces, and the support and 
selflessness of every military dependent over these years. I further 
hope that all fellow countrymen and women will demonstrate love 
for their home, land, and nation, and continue caring for and 
supporting national defense and act as a strong backing for the 
Armed Forces, so that defense capabilities can become stronger 
with every passing day, setting a more solid foundation for 
sustainable national development.

The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
     Striving for defense modernization, building reliable combat power 
, ensuring sustainable national development and the security and 
well-being of the people, and fulfilling responsibilities for the 
security of the Asia-Pacific region have always been objectives that 
the Ministry of National Defense (MND) has worked tirelessly to 
achieve.
    Demonstration of transparency in defense affairs are meant 
to allow the people to understand national defense, evaluate 
concrete results of defense policy implementation, and further 
vie for the people’s support and participation in national defense 
developments. Welcoming the age of All-Out Defense is not 
only important policy implementation work for maintaining 
national security, it simultaneously has a landmark meaning for 
demonstrating national democracy, and the National Defense Report 
is precisely a transparent window for the people to understand 
defense policy implementation.
    In order to fulfill the people’s rights to know, and to increase 
confidence for defense security, the MND publishes a National 
Defense Report every two years to make detailed and accurate 
assessments and judgments regarding changes in the national 
defense security situation and results from the combat readiness 
preparation efforts of the Armed Forces for their respective 
time periods, and systematically explain important aspects of 
contemporary defense policy implementation and a summary of the 
MND’s overall vision. Consequently, our citizens can understand 
that national security is not limited to military capabilities, and that 
their’s support all across the nation is needed as well. Further, 
it helps the international society understand Taiwan’s national 
defense policies and military strategies, and therefore encourages 
military exchanges and  develops blueprints for regional security 
Michael M.S.Tsai
Minister16cooperation, thus making the world aware of Taiwan’s overarching  
strategic significance in the international society.
    Looking back at the last two years, with entrenched developments 
in globalization and the information age and considerations of 
strategic interests from certain countries, we have witnessed the 
emergence of unpredictable variables in the international security 
environment, and the threats that Taiwan is facing have become 
more complicated with every passing day. Facing escalating military 
threats from the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Taiwan needs 
to adjust security and defense concepts and force buildup and 
combat readiness strategies with a forward-looking perspective, to 
establish joint operation capabilities capable of repelling enemies 
from outside, to increase defense technological capacities, to 
enhance all-out defense ideologies, and to strengthen military 
cooperation and exchanges with militaries of friendly countries, and 
to actively vie for participation in “regional security mechanisms” 
and platforms of security dialogue in the Asia-Pacific region, with 
the prospect of playing a positive role of security partner for the 
region and the world.
    To ensure our nation’s overall strategic objectives of maintaining 
sovereignty, security for national survival, and prosperous 
development, thus achieving the core national security values of 
“protecting the nation and safeguarding the people”, the Republic 
of China (Taiwan) Armed Forces never deviate from building strong 
defense capabilities and exploring professional effectiveness as 
their responsibility. We follow the Constitution and take public 
opinions into consideration, and administration by laws, with strict 
adherence to the nationalization of the military, while combat 
training routines are fulfilled to account for the strong expectations 
from different parts of the society and all the citizens.
    To strive for victory, the Armed Forces are working diligently 
to increase joint operation efficiencies under the asymmetrical 
environment between the enemy and us, we have moved from a 
“closely coordinated” level towards the “integrated” level, and 
ultimately advanced towards the "interdependent stage", the highest 
level of joint operations, further bolstering the joint operation 
capabilities of the armed forces. In particular, with our devoted 
efforts in Revolutions in Military Affairs (RMA), there have been 
no gaps during the process of force streamlining. We have also 
successfully increased the manpower at the base level and met 
the basic requirements of defensive operations. Considering the 
17National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
technological and information-based nature of future warfare, the 
Armed Forces have employed a military service system with enlists 
as the mainstay and conscription as secondary, to vie for high-
quality manpower required for force buildup planning and combat 
readiness. Since its implementation, younger generations have 
been attracted to select military service as one of their best career 
options, which is something that we can be proud of for assembling 
a competent and modern military.
    The vision and efforts of the Taiwan Armed Forces to build a 
“reliable national defense” is so that our citizens can face the 
world’s situation bravely and accept challenges willingly. And that 
all may create opportunities, consolidate fighting capabilities, unite 
in consensus for all-out defense, integrate national resources, 
exploit all-out defense capabilities, and work together to defend our 
national security and  strive for sustainable national development. 
The contents of this edition of the National Defense Report contain 
the following characteristics:
    1. Sequential explanations are based on logical thinking. 
Explanations are provided sequentially from the international 
situation, Asia-Pacific security, and the PRC’s threats against 
Taiwan; and at the same time, emphasis is placed on Taiwan’s 
overall values and defense policies and military strategies in the 
current stage, with the main objective of allowing the people to see 
the national defense establishment as their own responsibility after 
realizing the importance of defense policy implementations, and to 
subsequently provide active support and participation.
　　 2. Balance for defense security and the people’s rights to know. 
This report has taken into considerations that the people’s demands 
need to be answered, and all defense topics that are of concern 
to the people have been included in the report, such as utilization 
and management of military estate, military service system, service 
period, personnel recruitment, defense materials procurement, 
resources commercialization, defense mobilization, base-level 
education, and the Three-Assurance policy. Topics such as the 
promotion of all-out defense education can serve as references for 
research and  studies.
    3. Focus on theory and practice, disseminations and 
improvements. While we are examining the current situations and 
future developments, the MND’s views and dispositions are also 
elucidated, so that the people can understand the content of the 
2008 National Defense Report.18NationalDefenseReportcontainsonlyasummaryofinformation.

May 20089National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
    Although it has only been a short time of two years, many major 
events of world concern occurred  in 006 and 007. For example, 
the Iraq despot Hussein was executed but the U.S. troops are still 
stationed in Iraq, unable to withdraw; oil prices have skyrocketed, 
causing world-wide inflation; there is tension among Venezuela, 
Iran and the U.S.; terrorism is not yet pacified with frequent news of 
suicide bombing attacks; glimpse of hope for the critical situation 
in the Korean Peninsula; Pakistan opposition leader Bhutto was 
assassinated; genocide occurred in Africa; the BRICs (Brazil, 
Russia, India and China) have emerged; in particular, the PRC has 
established strategic economic dialogue mechanism with the world’
s major economies, and possessed the military capabilities of 
destroying satellites and space warfare, making an impact to Asia-
Pacific regional security; global warming and world stock market 
crash have also significantly affected the development of various 
world powers. However, as various world powers consider the 
balance of interests and calculate their own warfare strategy, the 
end result inevitably affects international security, which, if no good 
methods can be exercised, is highly likely to get out of control and 
cause turbulences.
    Despite the difficult situation, the core value of our national 
security – “protecting homeland and safeguarding citizens” will not 
falter under the volatile conditions of the times. Our government 
is still proactive in bolstering the four important aspects of the 
national security network: “accurate understanding”, “effective 
response”, “disciplined reform”, and “all-out solidarity”. In order 
to ensure Taiwan’s dignified sovereignty, secure existence and 
prosperous development, and achieve the overall national objective 
of “democratic Taiwan and sustainable development”, the ROC 
Armed Forces takes a pragmatic approach in the grand plan of 
military buildup and combat readiness. We are realistic and we 
always endeavor to do still better, striving to build a strong national 
0
defense, so that our country can steadily sail forward in this 
turbulent era.      
    In these two years, the Armed Forces have abode by the 
Constitution and followed through public opinions when it comes to 
the ongoing revolution in military affairs, implementation of national 
defense transformation, nationalization of the troops, enforcement 
of administrative neutrality, focus and dedication in combat training 
routines, promotion of personnel caliber, and advocacy in all-out 
defense concepts, so that the combat capabilities of the Armed 
Forces have indeed improved. We believe that the people can 
clearly testify to the training results of our servicemen from the elite 
combat power demonstrated in armed forces major exercises, or 
through the Journeys of Discovery held during base open days.
    In particular, budget for the three major military procurement, 
Patriot III missiles, new type of diesel-electric submarines, and P-3C 
anti-submarine aircraft, was finally passed by the Legislative Yuan 
in the later half of 007 under the persistent and sincere persuasion 
of the MND with professional and macroscopic perspective and 
responsible stance. This will not only enhance the Armed Forces’ 
overall combat capabilities enormously, it also demonstrates our 
people’s determination in self-defense, and it all the more heightens 
the far-reaching significance of both the ruling and opposition 
parties’ support in building a solid defense.
    However, in view of the radical changes in the international 
scene and the PRC’s continuing expansion of military buildup 
and thus gaining a military advantage over the Taiwan Strait, this 
has posed a serious threat to the security and peace of the Asia-
Pacific region. In order to build trust in Taiwan's national defense 
with international allies, and inscrease the people’s confidence 
in national defense and the confidence of the ROC servicemen 
in constructing national defense. This year’s ( 008) National 
Defense Report focus on building a modernized Armed Forces 
and expounding the democratic essence and accomplishment 
of our nationalization of the troops. The report discourses along 
the axis of “reliable national defense”, discloses recent national 
defense infrastructures  and accomplishments, and outlines future 
visions to meet volatile changes of the times, so as to reveal 
Taiwan’s contribution to the international community and an 
honest attitude of accountability towards the citizens. Under the 
framework of “Meeting the Challenges”, “Creating Opportunities”, 
“Enhancing Combat Capabilities” and “All-out Defense”, the entire 
report is divided into four parts and twelve chapters. Each part is 
summarized as follows:National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
Part One “ Meeting the Challenges ” 
    This part is divided into three chapters: “Global Situation”, 
“Asia-Pacific Security”, and “PRC Military Strength”. It outlines the 
latest international security situation and crux and factors of global 
potential threats and how that have caused obvious changes to 
the strategic security environment. It further explores the military 
movements of various nations and regional security trends in 
the Asia-Pacific, and the U.S. Asia-Pacific war strategy, military 
deployment and influence over regional integration. In particular, 
the PRC, along with its strong military power and economic growth, 
is rapidly expanding its involvement in international affairs, making 
“the PRC Threat Theory” rampant. Besides posing serious threats 
to regional security, it still plays the two-handed tactic of “peace 
and war” in its strategy against Taiwan. On the one hand, it deploys 
more than a thousand missiles targeted at Taiwan; and on the other 
hand, it actively launches an offensive by means of the non-violent 
“three warfare” (public opinion warfare, psychological warfare, 
legal warfare). The PRC’s desperate intention to plot against us 
is self-evident. It is hoped that our people can all recognize these 
threatening facts, consolidate a consensus, live in safety while 
cultivating awareness for potential crisis. 
Part Two “ Creating Opportunities ”
    This part is divided into three chapters: “Taiwan's Value”, 
“National Defense Policy”, and “Military Strategy”. It elucidates 
Taiwan’s indispensable geo-strategic position and its concrete 
contributions to the international society. This is the first time the 
National Defense Report dedicates an entire section to engage in 
an in-depth interpretation. It also explains how the current national 
defense policy still upholds the safeguarding of national interests 
and security targets as the highest benchmark and will achieve 
the basic objectives of “war prevention”, “homeland defense”, 
and “counter-terrorism and contingency response” through policy 
implementation Directives. In addition, as for enemy threats, the 
strategic concept of “effective deterrence and resolute defense” will 
persist and military buildup guidelines of “technology advancement, 
information and electronic superiority, joint interception, and 
homeland defense” will be adhered to in focusing on aspects such 
as “strengthening all-out defense concepts”, “perfecting crisis 
management and contingency response mechanisms”, “establishing 
a quality and effective modern force,” and “implementing the 
nationalization and legalization of military”, dedicated to military 
buildup plans and force establishment, so as to effectively utilize 
Taiwan’s overall resources and truly fulfill the needs of national 

defense and security, thereby building a national defense power 
that is “streamlined, high-quantity, and powerful fine in quality, and 
strong in combat capability”.
Part Three “ Enhancing Combat Capability ”
    “National Defense Organization”, “National Military Strength”, 
and “National Defense Resources” are the three chapters of 
this part. It elaborates current national defense system and 
jurisdictions,the implication and implememtation of civilian control 
of the military national defense structure framework and military 
force structure and other existing situations. To address to possible 
enemy offensive actions,the " Yu Shan Wargame " has integrated 
capabilities of all various govermental departments. In addition, 
as the military joint operation development has entered into 
the level of “closely coordinated joint operation”, in the future, 
the MND will set military joint operation command center as the 
framework, information and electronic advantage as forerunner, 
logistics planning as backup, reserve troops as reinforcements, 
psychological strength as support, and C4ISR as the platform 
for intelligence sharing to link the main forces of the ROC Armed 
Forces, provide instantaneous data and intelligence, truly achieve 
integration of combat systems and harness the effectiveness of 
joint operations as well as to establish the enormous strength 
of reserve mobilization, so that the servicemen has confidence 
and capabilities to defend their homeland and accomplish the 
military mission of defeating enemies and winning wars. As for 
national defense resources in manpower, finance, material and 
military buildup and readiness, this National Defense Report has 
described enhancement of combat capabilities by making the best 
use of manpower, materials, equipment and armament. We hope 
the citizens could continue to care and support national defense 
infrastructures.
Part Four “ All-out Defense ”
    “National Defense Education”, “Serving All Citizens” and 
“Defense Mobilization” are the three chapters of this part. It 
outlines that all-out defense has become the trend for modern 
national defense, and the MND is proactive in various education 
promotions and initiatives to make all-out defense concepts grow 
in the people’s minds. In order to consolidate cohesion among 
the people on national defense, besides actively implementing the 
“Three-assurance Policy” to ensure protection of rights and enable 
the servicemen to wholly concentrate on their combat training 
routines, the MND also fulfills their mandate of loving the people 3National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
by carrying out great acts such as disaster relief for the people. 
Through opportunities in training, we even devote ourselves 
in social services to actively assist local authorities with river 
dredging, homeland restoration, islets demining to reap the effect 
of “applying military training civilian construcion”. However, as the 
concrete realization of all-out defense lies in defense mobilization, 
the key to whether all-out defense can take root to be realized in 
the future would be to effectively integrate domestic emergency 
response systems such as disaster prevention and relief and 
counter-terrorism, build a well-established and comprehensive all-
out defense system, produce enough mobilization energy, set up 
the homeland security network and achieve the goal of homeland 
defense and uniformity between peacetime and wartime.
    “Being weak undoubtedly encourages invasion.” Obviously, the 
critical element in upholding the nation’s sustainable development 
and the people’s livelihood and happiness is whether or not our 
national defense power is strong! In other words, “from strength 
comes security, from security comes prosperity” and “national 
security is the common language of all our citizens” are not empty 
sayings. There is an old teaching that “though the world is at peace, 
complacency sure brings adversity.” The Art of War also says, “Rely 
not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own 
readiness to receive him.” Besides clearly describing the global 
scene, giving an in-depth analysis and evaluation of the PRC’s 
military intensions and capabilities and threats to Taiwan, the 008 
National Defense of Report also concretely demonstrates the ROC 
Armed Forces’ new thoughts in military buildup and the Ministry of 
National Defense’s accountability to the people. It also elucidates 
the current national defense concepts and administration results 
in the hope that our people could all understand the present-
stage national defense policies, establish a ever-ready awareness 
for potential crisis, which in turn would care for national defense, 
support national defense and participate in national defense, so 
that the all-out defense framework will become all the more robust 
and all would safeguard our country’s survival and development 
and fight for Taiwan’s freedom and democracy, thereby fulfilling 
“war prevention”, protecting the security and welfare of Taiwan’s 
3 million people, as well as making a contribution to world peace. 
Such is the purpose of compiling this volume.4    Contributions of the ROC Armed Forces to the defense of Taiwan, 
Penghu, Kinmen, and Matzu begin from the “Gu Ning To” and “8 3” 
battles half a century prior to the 996 “missile crisis in the Taiwan 
Strait”; and the Armed Forces have consistently prepared for 
conflicts, engaging enemies whenever necessary, and appropriately 
demonstrated its responsibilities to defend Taiwan’s territories 
and its determination to safeguard national security. Additionally, 
since the relentless strikes from the 9  earthquakes and other 
natural disasters in recent years, servicemen have always adhered 
to the principle of carrying out disaster relief as if it were combat 
missions, arriving on the scene at the first available moment to 
rescue people and rebuild broken homes after the disaster. Their 
heartfelt presence had been irreversibly seared into the hearts of 
the people, as if their deeds could still be seen.
    In recent years, the Armed Forces have devoted themselves 
to combat readiness and building modern, high quality, and 
high efficiency troops, expanding citizens participation in 
defense affairs, strengthening civilians’ ideas for all-out defense, 
consolidating contingency response mechanisms, solidifying 
joint operation command mechanisms, improving joint operation 
training effectiveness, ensuring the functions of enlistment and 
conscription military service systems, promoting the policies of 
integrating defense and private industries, investing in defense 
technology and weapons research, developing regional military 
security cooperation, carrying out nationalization and legislation of 
the Armed Forces, providing high quality care for the dependents 
of a serviceman, all for no other purpose than building a “reliable” 
national defense that is capable of deterring enemy invasions and 
ensuring sustainable national development and safe and prosperous 
life for the people.
5National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
For example, just by looking at the results of “promoting the policies 
of integrating defense and private industries”, the servicemen 
show their high efficiency execution in river dredging projects, 
minesweeping in Kinmen, or homeland restoration; furthermore,  
defense technology is transferred to the private sector, which 
increases industrial capacities with resource commercialization 
so as to increase overall national competitiveness. This not 
only achieves the goal of “applying military training into civilian 
construction, but also demonstrates the “trustworthiness” of our 
national defense.
    In fact, Taiwan is the first democratic country in Asia that 
remains committed to the universal values of democracy, freedom, 
and human rights, and always strives towards the goals of having 
a government which is of the people, by the people, and for 
the people. Therefore, over the years, the Armed Forces have 
been adhering to their constitutional missions, and continuing 
to strengthen themselves, in hopes of achieving the ultimate 
objective of ensuring national interests and security. In the current 
stage, national interests include: “ . Ensure national survival and 
development. . Protect the safety and well-being of the people. 3. 
Protect liberty, democracy and human rights”. Currently, the overall 
national security strategic objectives are: “To ensure national 
sovereignty, safety for survival, and prosperous development, 
and be free from domestic and foreign threats, invasions, and 
sabotage.”
    Despite the political separation across the Taiwan Strait, the 
PRC has never renounced its use of military action against Taiwan. 
It is waging the 3 warfare (public opinion warfare, psychological 
warfare, legal warfare), and further used the Anti-Secession 
Law, intending to confuse international opinion, disintegrate the 
defensive willpower of Taiwan’s people, and delivers a assassin's 
mace for the legality of employing military action. The PRC also 
uses the “3 depletions” strategy to deplete Taiwan’s diplomatic ties, 
to deplete Taiwan’s international standing, and to deplete Taiwan’
s international resources. Its flagrant action of money diplomacy 
makes Taiwan’s situation on the world stage increasingly difficult. 
Therefore, the Armed Forces must recognize its sacred mission, 
inherit the honourable tradition, and demonstrate great military 
culture. The only way that we can ensure our national interests 
and maintain security without depending on others is to build a 
deterrent force with modern and high quality military.6    In response to the dynamic challenges of defense and security in 
the age of globalization, Taiwan’s military strategy is also changed 
from the “offensive” and “unified offensive-and-defensive” nature in the 
past to the more moderate and non-invasive “defensive” position, and 
made “war prevention”, “homeland defense”, and “counter terrorism 
and contingency response” as the basic objectives for defense policies. 
Not only does Taiwan’s government include “maintaining world peace” 
as part of the Constitution, it has also repeatedly reiterated the non-
nuclear policy that Taiwan “will never develop, introduce, or use nuclear 
weapons”, sufficiently demonstrating the peaceful position of Taiwan, 
and the Armed Forces will accurately ensure that they will not instigate 
wars, and that their determination to maintain peace remains unchanged.
    Defensive operations of the Armed Forces are aimed at eliminating 
invading forces and defending homeland security, and uses coordination 
between “information and electronics” and “joint combat capabilities 
to repel or hinder enemy invasions or preparations thereof during the 
beginning of enemy invasions against Taiwan, in accordance to the 
“all-out defense” policy, based on the strategic concept of “effective 
deterrence and resolute defense”, and employing the strategic directive 
of “strategic endurance but tactical expeditiousness”, and accounting 
for enemy intentions and scale of threat. Force buildup planning is 
based on the directives of “technology advancement, information and 
electronic superiority, joint interception, and homeland defense” and  
complemented by doctrines, logistics, exercises, and budgets, etc. 
In addition, it emphasizes the “morale to win”; and, with a foresight 
in “revolution in military affairs” and under the framework of “joint 
operations”, we hope to achieve “fusion of personnel and equipment”, 
and to build solid warfighting capabilities for joint operations in the 
armed forces.
    A review of democratic constitutional states reveals that a “nationalized 
military” is a basic requirement for building a military. The armed forces 
is a military that belongs to the nation, as well as the people, and we 
already obey the Constitution, and pledge loyalty and passion for the 
people, thus actualizing nationalization of the military, strictly observing 
political neutrality, and administration by law. All military affairs are 
based on the nation and people and focus on responsibility and honor, 
and we are fully devoted in combat training duties, and vow to serve 
as a mainstream pillar of national security, and become a shield for a 
stable society and national democratic developments, in order to win 
recognition and trust from the people.
    Because modern defense affairs are no longer limited to the military

field, Article 3 of Taiwan’s National Defense Act thus states: “The 
national defense of the Republic of China is an all-out national 
defense”, which is because of the need to integrate and to invest all 
of the nation’s manpower, materials, and financial resources in the 
execution of war in order to utilize overall power, so that enemies 
will not easily instigate war. In order that the citizens of our country 
have consensus for maintaining national security and basic defense 
skills and that they can join combat smoothly during wartime to 
make  their contributions, in accordance with the All-Out Defense 
Education Act, the armed forces employ various educational 
campaigns and channels for arranging a wide variety of activities, 
and have gradually expanded and consolidated the concept of all-
out defense in the minds of the people, in hopes of harnessing and 
demonstrating the determination and power of the people to “defend 
their nation, homeland, home, and asset”, deepening military-
civilian cooperation, so that military resources are not depleted, 
and that we can face future challenges together and create new 
opportunities.
    Without security, there will be nothing! The armed forces, 
having shouldered heartfelt expectations from the people, will 
still henceforth solidify the intent for “country, responsibility, 
and honor”, demonstrating the spirit for “demand, hardship, 
improvement, and results”, improving defense preparations, 
becoming an ironclad and principled group respected by the people 
and feared by the enemies, and ensuring that the people live 
fruitful lives, that society is stable, and that the nation continues 
to develop and progress steadily, to serve as a solid foundational 
support for creating another miracle. Ultimately, we hope to support 
the government to actively participate in international organizations 
and do our part for the welfare of mankind, so that we can rightfully 
claim ourselves as a member of the global village.8

National Defense Report
    Under the trend of globalization, the global village has come 
to symbolize an operating reality in the evolution of international 
society, which has built an interactive framework between 
multilateral mechanisms, such that singular, coincidental, and 
regional incidents may cause a global chain reaction. Outside of 
conventional security topics such as territoriality, ethnicity, religion, 
culture, nuclear developments, weapons of mass destruction 
(WMD), etc, energy demand, global warming, natural disasters, 
transnational crimes, major disease outbreaks, terrorism, and other 
unconventional topics have come to the fore in the world, becoming 
uncertain factors that influence and challenge global trends. Under 
these composite influences, global trends have come to exhibit 
coexistence of frequent interactive, competitive, and cooperative 
relationships, but national interests is still a major factor in 
deciding whether states will cooperate or enter conflict with each 
other, resulting in complex and unstable international relationships.
Section 1
International Security Status
    Currently, the United States still maintains its leadership position 
upon the Iternational Security with its overwhelming overall 
national strength, but the European Union, the PRC, and Russia are 
gradually growing stronger, and their influence to relevant regional 
security affairs through multipolar interactions are undeniable, 
which will further impact the US-centric unipolar international 
interaction framework. As each nation seeds international and 
regional participation, the international society has also adopted 
joint responses, resulting in a multilateral cooperative situation with 
the US, PRC, EU, Russia, and Japan as leaders.THE REPUBLIC OF CHINATAIWAN
Chapter  Global Situations
33National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
I. Global Strategic Environment
   In recent years, many changes have occurred to the global and 
regional security status, with the US still being the global military 
superpower, but the influence of traditional and rising military 
powers such as Russia, the EU, PRC, and Japan also cannot 
be ignored. In the face of international and interregional topics 
such as fighting global terrorist organizations, preventing WMD 
proliferation, and conducting humanitarian support, international 
interactions have become more frequent, and the US needs to rely 
on and expect assistance, support, and coordination from other 
nations, thus accelerating developing trends towards coexisting 
competitive and cooperative relationships in global situations.
(I) Middle East
    In the Middle East, petroleum resources, ethnic conflict, etc, 
continue to be the focus of from national conflicts and the world; 
now, the post-war situation in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the vision 
for a Palestinian state are still uncertain, while Iran’s nuclear 
developments and conflicts in Lebanon and Syria indicate that there 
are still many unstable factors in the Middle East.
(II) Europe
    In Europe, the European Union has confirmed their political 
and economic integration schedule with the passage of the Lisbon 
Treaty, and absorbed new member states to continue its eastward 
expansions, which once again elevates its international position 
and influence, and because of recent controversies in arctic 
sovereignty, tensions are rising between the US, EU, Canada, and 
Russia; Russia’s internal political and economic situation continues 
to improve, and, relying on its rich technological experience 
and resource superiority, it is accelerating military reforms, and 
vehemently opposing US plans to install missile defense systems in 
the Czech Republic and Poland, demonstrating its strong positions 
in such aspects as international and regional security topics. 
Overall, interactions and relationships between states such as the 
US, EU, and Russia will affect future developments of Europe’s 
overall situation.
(III) Africa
    In Africa, control of situations such as ethnic conflicts, resource 
competitions, major outbreaks, and armament proliferation, and 
topics such as international peacekeeping and humanitarian 
support are still high priorities for international society. Over the 
years, states such as the EU, US, and PRC have actively intervened 
34with such tactics as monetary assistance, energy developments, 
and peacekeeping missions, with the US further establishing the 
Africa Command, accentuating Africa as an important region for 
global strategy and competition.
(IV) Latin America
   Since 006, presidential elections have been held in Latin 
American nations like Venezuela, Brazil, Ecuador, Nicaragua, 
Guatemala, and Argentina, with results showing the rise of left-wing 
powers; also, problems such as rich-poor gaps, illegal international 
economic activities, gang violence, and drug trafficking continue 
to affect regional security status. Also, as the US is occupied in 
dealing with nuclear weapons in Iran and North Korea, the Iraq 
situation, and international terrorism, with no attention to spare, the 
PRC is increasing its interaction with regional nations to attempt 
to consolidate its influences, which also has considerable impacts 
towards regional security.
II. Asia-Pacific Strategic Environment
    Overall, the current Asia-Pacific region is exhibiting an integrated 
trend on political, economic, and military affairs; group-based 
actions like the six-way talks focused on simultaneously solving 
the North Korean nuclear crisis and the Korean peninsula conflict; 
the ASEAN summit has enhanced regional political and economic 
development mechanisms and completed the ASEAN charter to 
confirm democratic and human rights development goals and 
accelerate the establishment of the “East Asian Collective”; the 
PRC’s continuous investments of large military funds to procure or 
research and manufacture new high-tech armaments and expand 
their aerial and naval strength, Russia’s armament enhancements, 
the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s military exercises, 
and the India-Pakistan nuclear competition, etc, have all stirred 
up competitions in the international strategic domain; the US 
is not only restructuring its Asia-Pacific forces and conducting 
Atlantic military exercises to demonstrate its determination to 
maintain regional security, it is also enhancing US-Japan security 
mechanisms in response to interactions with South Korea, Australia, 
and India; future developments for the PRC, Russia, and India, and 
impacts on EU member states still require observation; it is worth 
noting that, within the region, issues such as the Taiwan Strait 
standoff and sovereignty controversies over the East and South China 
Seas and south Asia are still important topics for regional security.

The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
(I) Northeastern Asia (see figure 1-1)
    Japan has undergone several cabinet shuffles, and although 
there are still controversies surrounding participation in 
international peacekeeping, supporting international counter-
terrorism, and other foreign affairs, it still abides by the basic 
US-Japan security cooperation framework, and is still enhancing 
its missile defense capabilities, and improving its relations with 
neighbors such as the PRC and South Korea to actively participate 
in regional political and military affairs; on the North Korea problem, 
it is participating in six-way talks, supporting normalization of 
relations with North Korea, and pushing for a non-nuclear North 
Korea, seeking feasible options to solve controversies over the four 
northern islands; on the issue of relations with China, it is pushing 
for strategically mutual relations to dilute hostilities, maintain long-
term two-way friendship, and actively pursuing favorable conditions 
for becoming a permanent member of the United Nations Security 
Council.
    In recent years, South Korea’s political and economic strength 
Figure -    Situation in the Northeastern Asian Region
36has been increasing, with domestic 
military reforms and external reliance 
on American political and military 
powers and six-way talks mechanisms 
to enhance its self defense and deter 
North Korea from developing WMDs; 
the new government is focusing 
on strengthening US-South Korea 
relations and improving human  
rights in North Korea, but recently, 
nationalism and defense autonomy 
ideologies have been on the rise, 
therefore, in the future, issues such 
as wartime command authority, the 
placement of American soldiers in 
South Korea, and northeast Asian 
security mechanisms will become focal 
points for the US, South Korea, and 
the international community.
(II) Southeast Asia (see figure 1-2)
    In recent years, unconventional 
security problems like terrorists, 
pirate activities, drug trafficking, 
and avian flue outbreaks are still 
the main threats; the Indonesian 
government and the Aceh separatist 
movement organization have  
gradually reconciled their conflicts; 
after recent parliamentary elections, 
Thailand’s military government has, 
for the first time, promised to return 
the government to the people; the 
Philippines is focusing on economic 
development, and fully fighting terrorist 
activities with American and Australian 
assistance; Vietnam has emerged from 
the shadows of the Vietnam War, jump-
started its economy, and strengthening 
its armaments to enhance its control 
over the islands in the South China 
Sea; after the monk demonstrations in

Nepal, subsequent developments on domestic democracy and 
human rights problems are still under much international scrutiny; 
overall political and economic situations in Malaysia and Singapore 
are relatively stable, and Singapore and Malaysia also jointly 
conducted naval and aerial patrols over the Malacca Strait with 
Indonesia to ensure regional security, accentuating their focus 
on regional stability. With Singapore recently signing the defense 
cooperation agreement with China, it not only demonstrates a 
flexible action to expand their interests through superior strategic 
positions, it also indicates the PRC’s aggressive intervention in 
regional security affairs as part of its strategic intention of actively 
pursuing security assurance for its energy channels.
    In terms of the Spratly Islands sovereignty controversy, after 
the restraints of the Declaration on the Code of Conduct on the 
South China Sea signed by various regional states, the situation 
is relatively stable, except during incentives such as exclusive 
economic waters and relevant rights, there is also a rising trend of 
various states increasing scientific explorations and cooperative 
Figure -    Situation in the Southeast Asian Region.38energy explorations; recently, the PRC has established the Sansha 
City in the Hainan Province, and partially claimed to control the 
Paracel, Macclesfield, and Spratly Islands, which not only provoked 
Vietnamese and Philippine protests, but also affects the current 
state of the South China Sea, and further radicalizes sovereignty 
conflicts between various states over these islands, which makes 
this a noteworthy issue.
(III) Oceanian Region
    Other than Australia and New Zealand, Oceania is home to 
sparsely populated island nations like the Marshall Islands and 
Nauru that are not economically developed. Australia stands out 
as the major regional power, and actively maintains regional peace 
and stability by participating in various regional security affairs with 
the US, Japan, and Indonesia; recently, the strategic importance 
of the south Pacific has attained international importance, with the 
US, India, the PRC, and Japan all exhibiting intentions to deepen 
their management of the region, and with the PRC, in particular, 
participating in regional multilateral organizations, actively 
strengthening political and economic ties with Australia, New 
Zealand, and various southern Pacific island nations to strengthen 
its influence on southern Pacific island states and simultaneously 
accomplish its goal of restraining US-Japan power, developing 
energy resources, and consolidating its strategic arrangements.
(IV) South Asia
    Because of the Indian and Pakistani nuclear developments and 
the Kashmir territorial disputes, the long arms race between the 
two nations have resulted in a negative cycle; India and the PRC 
has held their first anti-terrorism military exercise, tempering their 
existing border disputes. Recently, India is actively developing 
military cooperation relationships with the PRC, US, Japan, and 
Australia to elevate its international position; also, the series of 
terrorist attacks in Pakistan and the assassination of its former 
prime minister not only affects the state of internal security, it also 
impacts American global anti-terrorism arrangements.
(V) Central Asia
    Central Asia includes Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and 
Turkmenistan, which lie on the northwestern borders of the PRC, 
and connects with west Asian nations like Afghanistan and Iran, 
which puts them in strategically important positions, and they are 
also important towards suppressing independence movements 
in Xinjiang and Tibet. In recent years, the PRC has gradually 
39National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
expanded the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which is founded 
by itself, into a military security cooperation platform through 
political and economic dialogue mechanisms, and incorporated 
joint anti-terrorism and military exercises to consolidate control 
over leadership authority over the security situation in central Asia, 
which not only prevents American intervention, but also solidifies 
its border security, and also makes it an important regional 
organization for the PRC to gradually expand its influence to other 
regions.
III. Future Security Challenges
    Because of dynamic and complex security threat environments in 
the future, member states in the international community urgently 
need new capabilities and systems to ensure security, which results 
in dynamic and rapidly changing aspects to the international 
situation; here, we will outline possible security challenges in 
the future based on such aspects as the political, economic, and 
military.
(I) Political
    After the end of the Cold War, Russia has been in increasingly 
open disputes with the US in such issues as NATO’s eastward 
expansion, missile defense plans, and nuclear weapons in North 
Korea and Iran in recent years; the PRC’s overall national strength 
continues to increase, and it continues to vie for international 
recognition and support under the illusion of respecting human 
rights and fulfilling its international duties and responsibilities, 
without actually departing from its anti-human rights and 
undemocratic nature, and the international society urgently needs 
to consider incorporating third parties into the international system 
and adhere to the principle of “authority comes from fulfillment of 
responsibilities”, to encourage such states as the PRC and Russia 
to respect democracy, freedoms, human rights, rule of law, etc, 
to ensure stability in regional and global security status; in the 
Middle East, the reconstruction of post-war Iraq and Afghanistan, 
Iran’s nuclear developments, Israel-Palestine peace talk progress, 
etc, are still key to the progress of democratization in Middle 
Eastern nations and regional peace; the rise of left-wing power in 
Latin American regions, which employs anti-American and anti-
dictatorship rhetoric as their slogan, not only impacts existing 
power structures in the region, it will also influence future American 
policy directions.
40(II) Economic
    Oil prices have soared globally in recent years, driving up 
prices of raw and processed materials, and causing instability 
to the international financial system, which not only affects 
global economic growth and standard of living, it also causes 
various states to stringently control their contingent oil reserves, 
radicalizing international conflicts over oil and other strategic 
resources. Also, because of increasing international economic 
interdependence due to globalization, if global topics such as 
natural disasters, aging populations, and major contagious diseases 
cannot be solved in a timely manner, they may result in regional or 
even global economic upheaval and social disasters.
(III) Military
    WMD proliferation, terrorist attacks, arms races, etc, have all 
become major threats and challenges against existing international 
consensus, collective security, warning systems, and control 
mechanisms. Additionally, unconventional threats such as Internet 
attacks and proliferation of technologies with military and civilian 
applications are also gradually becoming worrisome factors against 
the state of global security; also, certain states have combined 
offensive and defensive measures over network, space, arctic, and 
other uncertain dimensions and fields of various states, including 
the PRC, Russia, and India investing in or restarting their aircraft 
carrier projects, and developing strategic force and firepower 
projection capabilities, which will further increase the likelihood 
of military conflict. Seeing as the PRC has, in recent years,

security on many occasions (taken from U.S. Navy)◎ The international society should enhance anti-terrorism

4National Defense Report

National Defense Report
invested large military funds to develop strategic nuclear weapons, 
traditional forces, and tests on anti-satellite missiles, but continues 
to refuse to explain their intentions and raise transparency, this 
indicates high degrees of uncertainty in its strategic intentions, 
considering the PRC government’s highly authoritarian nature.
Section 2 
Potential Global Threats
    The international society is becoming increasingly interdependent 
and closely tied, thanks to the rise of the information technology 
industry, and rapid and convenient transportation, but conflicts 
or military standoff may arise from terrorist activities, territorial 
disputes, resource competition, religious beliefs, historical and 
cultural differences, etc, and affect global peace and stability or the 
state of regional security. Also, global warming effects have become 
a global topic and an important issue that all states need to focus 
on and cooperate to resolve. These factors are explained below:
I. Terrorist Activities
    After the September  terrorist attacks, the world came to 
understand the cruel nature of terrorism and its immense threat to 
world peace. International terrorism stems from complex factors like 
difference in ethnic and religious beliefs, colonial hatred, ethnic 
pride, etc, and, in the short term, there does not seem to be an 
appropriate solution. Currently, organized terrorist activities across 
global regions are not only exhibiting a trend of outward expansion 
and integration with international terrorism, its movement methods 
and areas of attack are also becoming more complex, with attack 
methods not only including individual suicide bombers, but also 
unconventional security factors like international money laundering, 
trafficking and infiltration, illegal immigration, network assaults, 
4significantly raising its threat against global and various regional 
security and stability, and the international society should enhance 
anti-terrorism intelligence exchange and joint legal enforcement to 
enhance coordination and focus on basic aspects like absolving 
ethnic hatred, accepting multiple religions and religious freedoms, 
to promote peaceful coexistence and world peace.
II. Territorial Disputes
    Territoriality is an integral component of nationhood, and 
political, economic, military, security, and other strategic interests 
associated with it are often major factors behind international 
conflicts. Currently, islands that receive more attention from the 
international community for being the subject of sovereignty 
disputes include the four northern islands (referred to as the Kuril 
Islands by Russia) between Japan and Russia, the Takeshima Island 
(referred to as Dokdo by South Korea) between Japan and South 
Korea, the Falklands Islands between Britain and Argentina, as well 
as the Diaoyu Islands, which Taiwan has claimed sovereignty over, 
but both the PRC and Japan claim sovereignty over the islands as 
well, which all indicate that island sovereignty affect major national 
interests, and nations involved will not yield their positions easily, 
which will give rise to complex international relationships.
    Also, in terms of sovereignty over the Spratly Islands, aside from 
Taiwan has claimed sovereignty over the Itu Aba Island, Vietnam, 
the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, and Malaysia have all claimed 
sovereignty over relevant islands, and because this issue affects the 
interests of many nations in the region, the situation becomes even 
more complex, and, in the future, international and relevant national 
cooperation will hopefully help in negotiating suitable solutions in 
order to ensure regional peace and stability. In the future, when the 
international society faces territorial disputes, other than seeking 
international legal judgments, peaceful resolution should still be an 
important method.
III. Energy Competition
    With rapid economic development, the importance and 
dependence on energy for everyday life and national security has 
increased dramatically, and various nations further see energy as 
the basic driving force for promoting national development and 
economic growth; energy demand increases daily, causing excess 
43National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
demand on petroleum, coal, natural gas, and other non-renewable 
resources, greatly reducing existing reserves and accelerating the 
coming of the age of high energy prices, and further provoking 
various states into competition, with large energy consumer nations 
like the US, EU, PRC, Japan, and India being particularly visible. 
Today, energy competition is distributed mainly in regions like the 
Middle East, central Asia, and Siberia, with secondary regions 
such as Africa, Latin America, and northeastern and southeastern 
Asia, and each competing player vie for priorities like energy 
acquisitions, harvesting, explorations, and ensuring smooth access 
to oil and gas transportation pipelines and sea transportation 
routes.
    Recently, because of global climate change and warming effects, 
various nations are not only competing for energy resources 
in the aforementioned regions, nations bordering on the Arctic 
and Antarctic circles are further investing in energy resource 
explorations, or using methods like scientific investigations or 
redefining continental shelf expansions to declare sovereignty and 
acquire legal development rights, based on expectations of rich 
resources in regions bordering arctic and Antarctic regions, which 
will have ramifications against institutions such as the Antarctic 
Treaty and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 
and avoiding a new wave of regional security tensions in future 
energy competitions will depend on international and national 
cooperation.
IV . Religious Beliefs, History and Cultural Differences
    Political conflicts arising from religious beliefs, history, or 
cultural factors are common in the international scene, and the 
complexity and sensitivity of these problems can be seen from 
Montenegro’s May 006 entry into the UN, Kosovo announcing 
secession and becoming independent from Serbian rule, Chechnya 
seeking independence from Russia, to Israel’s frequent troubles 
since its founding, and Palestine’s unfinished quest to form its 
own nation, and post-Gulf War Iraq, and improper management 
of these issues will result in continuous conflicts or long-term 
problems, thus affecting regional and global peace and stability, 
and if composite effects like ethnic sentiments, responsibilities and 
missions, sovereignty, and economic interests come into influence, 
then unexpected military confrontations and conflicts may very 
likely occur under the context of protecting interests and security. 
44
In that case, the situation may be even more complex and difficult.
V . Global Warming
    In recent years, abnormal climates around the world have 
become more frequent, and the thinning ozone layer and faster-
than-expected rates of arctic ice cap melting, and the results of 
high levels of industrialization of various states have produced 
increasingly worsening damage to the global environment and 
ecology, and disasters from abnormal tidal waves and earthquakes 
have been happening nonstop, which indicates that global 
warming effects should not be ignored, and effective management 
and control measures are needed. The international society 
and regional national organizations have established important 
measures in recent years to mitigate the emission of greenhouse 
gases (GHG) that cause global warming, including the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change passed by the 
UN in 99, and the Kyoto Protocol passed in December 997 and 
effective February 005, which regulates future GHG reduction 
responsibilities for industrialized nations; the Singapore Declaration 
on Climate Change, Energy, and Environment, presented by 
the East Asia Summit in November 007; the expanded climate 
change conference held by the UN in Bali in December 007; these 
types of developments all indicate that the international society’
s determination and action consensus on reducing global warming 
have become more mature, and relevant future cooperation 
mechanisms should become an important part of relevant regional 
national interactions.45National Defense Report

Chapter  Asia-Pacific Security
    The PRC continues to invest large military funds in defense 
infrastructure, but its military developments lack transparency and 
continue to expand outward; therefore, the cross-strait military 
balance gradually tilt towards the PRC. Also, the PRC is actively 
participating in international security affairs, and increasing its 
clout, which causes Asia-Pacific states to express doubts about 
the “PRC threat theory”. Besides, the issues of the North Korean 
nuclear weapons, the armament development schedules of various 
nations, sovereignty problems over certain islets and defining 
the exclusive economic waters of bordering regions, and regional 
free trade integration, etc, affect the security, interests, and long-
term development of states in the region, thus becoming important 
topics for various states. Due to the region’s geographical strategic 
values and interests, the US has been highly mindful of the 
region’s security situation developments, and, aside from using 
foreign policy, economic, and other actions to maintain close

ties with peripheral nations, the US has also adjusted its Asia-
Pacific military deployments, enhanced the contents of the US-
Japan security mechanisms, remained the Taiwan Relations Act, 
proposed democratic partnership frameworks between the US, 
Japan, Indonesia, and Australia, and enhanced military relations 
with Australia and Indonesia to enable early warning and response 
for major incidents. Summarily, American military deployments in 
the Asia-Pacific are an important pillar of support in response to 
PRC military expansions, and in maintaining regional security and 
stability. (See Figure -)。
Section 1  
Shifts in Strategic Security Environments
    The Asia-Pacific is one of the most rapidly developing regions 
in the world, and the frequent foreign, political, and economic 
interactions among states in the region further make it an important 
region for international powers to extend their influence to. In recent 
years, the region is exhibiting a sense of active integration, with 
the US continuing adjustments in its Japanese and South Korean 
deployments to actualize partnership mechanisms in coordination 
with military restructuring in Guam and Hawaii. ASEAN has 
established consensus on political and economic integration, The 
US and South Korea have completed free trade agreements, and the 
six-way talks have successfully established multilateral models to 
jointly solve nuclear weapons issues. Also, with the rise of the PRC, 
Russia, and India’s economic power, there is now a magnetic effect, 
causing considerable attention from the international society; these 
factors all result in trends of closer interactions in the regional 
strategic security environment. In the future, various nations 
will continue to affect the interaction model and changes in the 
strategic security environments on major regional security issues, 
controversial positions and response measures.
50I. Important Situational Changes
(I)Security issue – Six-way talks
    In 993, North Korea declared their withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, which resulted in the first North Korean 
nuclear crisis. The US-led Korea Peninsula Energy Development 
Organization successfully signed the Geneva Nuclear Framework 
Agreement with North Korea, bringing a pause of the crisis. At the 
end of 00, North Korea restarted its nuclear weapons program, 
and by March of the following year, the US and North Korea held its 
first dialogue under PRC mediation, and subsequently introduced 
states like South Korea, Japan, and Russia to establish the current 
six-way talks framework. Since 007, there have been six meetings, 
which resulted in North Korea promising to abandon its nuclear 
weapons and research programs and sign joint declarations to the 
effect of abandoning nuclear actions. Although the effectiveness of 
North Korea’s promise need to be observed, the summit between 
the leaders of the two Koreas, the presidential meetings, etc, that 
came after the abandonment can help ease tensions on the Korean 
Peninsula. Summarily, the six-way talks have been operating for 
four years, which has gradually established models for dealing 
with relevant issues, and has become the negotiation platform for 
dealing with regional security topics. In the future, it will continue 
to uphold the responsibility of monitoring the North Korean promise 
to abandon nuclear weapons or other relevant regional security 
issues.
(II) Economic issue – ASEAN integration and US-South Korea free 
trade negotiations
    ASEAN has started discussions on issues related to the ASEAN 
Charter in 005. On November 007, the ASEAN Charter was 
signed after the ASEAN summit, clarifying the goals towards 
democracy and human rights, and actively seeking transformations 
that would result in legal entities like the EU. In the same year, 
the “ Joint Statement of East Asia Cooperation” was announced at 
the “ASEAN 0+3” summit, which emphasizes on completing the 
ASEAN economic community by 05 instead of 00, and also 
incorporating nations like Australia, New Zealand, and Indonesia 
into the push for the east Asian community. In northeastern Asia, 
South Korea is actively negotiating free trade deals with the US 
to increase its economic and trade competitiveness, and the two 
states formally signed the US-South Korea free trade agreement, the 
first American free trade agreement in Asia. The US is also actively 
5National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
negotiating with the PRC in hopes of expanding economic and trade 
competition capacity and markets. Based on the aforementioned 
indications, economic and trade bloc integrations will continue to 
be the goals pursued by various nations in the region to develop 
their interests, and will have deep impacts on the interaction and 
competitiveness of various nations.
II. Regional Security
    The political, economic, trade, and military interactions between 
nations within the region have resulted in positive and stable 
development relations, but changes are taking place because of 
the October 006 underground nuclear testing from North Korea; 
under diligent negotiations of the international community, the 
region’s security status have temporarily returned to normal. Also, 
because of the rapidly increasing overall strength of the PRC and 
subsequent ambitious military expansions, this has caused threats 
and impacts to the cross-strait military balance and regional 
security that are greater than that of North Korea. As emotions 
are rising among various nations, highly suspicious attitudes are 
adopted towards the PRC; however, complications have arisen to 
regional security issues that has a high potential of erupting in 
conflict, including the aforementioned controversies over territory, 
border, islands, and the cross-strait situation, due to the PRC’s 
authoritarian nature and Russia’s reemerging intents for military 
expansion, which has become major threats against overall regional 
peace. Important developments relevant to the state of security are 
explained below:
(I) Problems over the Taiwan Strait
    The Taiwan Strait is an important waterway in the Asia-Pacific, 
directly affecting the operation of Korean and Japanese waterways, 
as well as internal political stability and the mutual interests of the 
US and Southeast Asian states. And various nations expect and 
work hard to maintain peace and stability in this region. The US 
has traditionally tried to maintain the delicate balance that exists 
across the straits, and expressed support for peaceful solutions to 
the cross-strait issue in its Taiwan Relations Act, Treaty of Mutual 
Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, 
and the two-plus-two talks, in order to reduce accidental eruptions 
of conflict. In recent years, the PRC is actively expanding its 
military power, and further establishing new waterways west of the 
5Taiwan Strait, which further reduces Taiwan’s available space, and 
this action from the PRC has caused grave alarm from neighboring 
states, and its intentions of military intimidations against Taiwan 
has demonstrated the PRC’s savagery and sever threat towards 
regional peace and stability.
(II) Sovereignty over the Spratly Islands
    The Spratly Islands sovereignty controversy stems from major 
interests such as history, energy, resources, and strategic supply 
route, making it a major divisive issue among the PRC and ASEAN 
states, of which the Itu Aba Island belongs to Taiwan. In 00, the 
PRC and ASEAN signed the Declaration on the Code of Conduct 
on the South China Sea, followed by relatively stable interactions 
developing among various states, but by 007, as Vietnam and 
British Petroleum sought cooperative explorations, the PRC 
declared the establishment of the administrative agency called 
Sansha City, all provoking strong reactions from relevant states, 
causing rising tensions and further proving the political savagery 
and inconsistency of the PRC.
(III) Economic rights in the East China Sea
    The oil wells in the East China Sea are rich with natural 
resources but remains in undefined waters between the PRC and 
Japan, resulting in controversy between two issues like sovereignty, 
definition of territorial boundaries, and harvesting methods, making 
it a major dispute after visits to the Yasukuni war shrine, revision of 
textbooks, anti-Japanese sentiments, and other historical disputes. 
In the latter half of May 004, the PRC built the Chunxiao oil and 
gas well approximately 5 km west from the middle line of the 
economic waters claimed by Japan, and added naval and aircraft 
patrols to prevent Japanese entry. Japan protested and appealed 
to the international community to protect its rights, and the two 
sides decided to negotiate a solution for the issue; up to November 
007, there have been  formal negotiations. Although there were 
no breakthroughs, PRC president Hu Jintao, who had been actively 
trying to negotiate the issue, had visited Japan in 008 to discuss 
appropriate solutions, accentuating the importance of the issue to 
both sides of the debate. And, subsequent developments will be 
noteworthy.
(IV)Fishing rights conflict in the Yellow Sea
    The Yellow Sea between the mainland China and the Korean 
Peninsula, an important fishing zone for the PRC and North and 
South Korea, affects the fishing rights of the three states and has

Pacific to maintain regional security and stability (taken 
from U.S. Air Force)
caused many naval standoffs in recent years. North and South 
Korea  have sent naval ships for fishing protection, demonstrating 
strong intent to protect their fishing rights. It turned out that they 
fired at each other, accentuating the high sensitivity surrounding 
the Yellow Sea and the urgency of drawing clear boundaries The 
UN has offered its own boundary proposals for the northern Yellow 
Sea to avert the conflict, but it was not recognized by North Korea; 
each side has distinctly different views and methods on defining 
maritime borders in this region, and South Korea has lobbied for 
PRC assistance in resolving the problem. But the PRC is lukewarm 
about the issue, and has not acted actively on it.
    The aforementioned developments demonstrate that the PRC is 
rapidly developing its military and overall national strength. Not 
only has it exceeded its defense needs or warfighting needs against 
Taiwan, but its aggressive behavior, such as the perception of 
itself as a major power, negligence of international consensus, and 
unilateral actions have visibly affected neighboring states. The PRC’
s aggressive expansions of its naval and aerial military strength 
have affected the cross-strait military balance and interaction 
model, which has unspeakable implications for current and future 
developments towards regional peace and stability. Neighboring 
nations must, in response, rely on methods such as enhancing 
exchanges and cooperation or allying themselves with the US, 
Japan, Australia, out of considerations for their own strategic 
planning and long-term development, and developments on this 
situation will be especially noteworthy.

Section 2 
American Impacts on the Asia-Pacific
    The US, although located in the North American continent, has 
superpower influence that can dictate the course of the world. After 
the Cold War, the US, based on its own national interests such as 
foreign policy, economic, and security, and its insistence on basic 
values such as democracy, freedoms, and human rights, has shifted 
its Europe-centric strategic thought, towards various Asian regions; 
currently, the US and various Asia-Pacific nations like Japan and 
South Korea still maintain close cooperative relations, and deploy 
large forces. Aspects such as the American strategy, force, and 
their effects on the Asia-Pacific will be summarized below:
I.  American Asia-Pacific Strategy
() In terms of national strategy, the US aims to ensure the security 
of its alliances, deter arms races, address security threats, defeat 
potential enemies, etc. After the 9  incident, the US recognizes 
terrorism as its most dangerous threat, and current terrorist 
hotbeds include Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Southeast Asian 
regions with their own unresolved issues, like territory, fractured 
sovereignty, historical enmity, etc. Also, the PRC’s military 
expansions have drawn high alert from various states, making it a 
high American priority.
() After the US-Iraq war, the American military strategy gradually 
shifted to the three axes of anti-terrorism, prevention of WMD 
proliferation, and defending homeland security, and, adhering to its 
preventative defense and pre-emptive strike strategic framework, 
intends to use its superior military advantage to protect its national 
security and interests. Because certain modern and military 
advanced states are becoming challenges against its absolute 
supremacy, in order to maintain its military advantage, defend 
against potential threats, and maintain the military balance, peace, 
and stability in the Asia-Pacific, the current American Asia-Pacific

strategic defense lines, vie for 
security cooperation partnerships, 
effectively deter potential threats, etc, 
and orienting its preparations against 
threats towards such objectives as 
flexible deployments and building 
rapid response and long range 
expedition capabilities.
II. Current State of American 
Forces in East Asia
(I)State of current forces and 
transformation strategy 
   The US has stationed over 00,000 
troops in East Asia, primarily in 
Hawaii, Japan, and South Korea. In 
recent years, the American military 
has targeted its future combat mission 
requirements and incorporated  
operational frameworks such as trends 
in Revolution of Military Affairs (RMA), 
armament technology transformation, 
and global pre-emptive attacks to 
carry out force structure adjustments; 
it has introduced advanced land, 
sea, and air combat systems,  
and improved mobile and rapid 
deployment capabilities to effectively 
deter potential threats. Also, based on 
operational and deployment concepts 
like pre-emptive strikes and mobile 
flexibility, American Asia-Pacific 
force structures will be transformed 
according to its overall force  
planning; planning for the US Army, 
Navy, and Air Force are as follows:561. Army
    To develop light, mobile, and rapidly deployable Stryker 
brigades, instead of traditional heavy mechanized force structures.
2. Navy
    To transform “battle group” mission arrangements into “strike 
groups” according to three major objectives of naval defense, naval 
strikes, and naval bases.
3. Air Force
    To construct “expedition forces” that focus on strategic bombers, 
aerial refueling aircrafts, and advanced fighter planes, and enhance 
strategic airlifting capabilities, to strengthen long-range expedition 
capabilities, and in hopes of executing global strategic strikes and 
force projection operations.
(II) State of future force adjustments planning
    Continue expanding military alliances, enhance regional 
multilateral cooperation mechanisms, and demonstrate its 
determination to maintain its military presence, protect its interests, 
and accomplish its political objectives through actions such 
as military exercises, peacekeeping, and humanitarian rescue. 
American force adjustments planning can be summarized as 
follows:
1. Japan
    T o integrate methods such as warning mechanisms, aerial 
combat command, and ground troops arrangements on both 
sides through actions such as sharing bases and joint training 
to enhance actions such as two-side intelligence delivery and 
processing, joint operation command, and uniform force utilization, 
to address sudden regional crises, and support international 
humanitarian rescues, peacekeeping, and other missions; as well 
as use cooperative development models to enhance constructions 
of missile defense systems, and increase warning against WMDs to 
deter potential missile threats.
2. South Korea
    American forces stationed in South Korea are gradually 
decreasing and moving southward from non-military zones, and 
the US is assisting South Korea in increasing its capabilities such 
as intelligence gathering, military operational command, and 
joint operation coordination through methods such as monetary 
assistance, base merging, and wartime command transfer, in 
order to enhance rapid support capabilities during wartime to 
address developments regarding the state of security in the Korean 
57National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
Peninsula and surrounding areas.
3. Guam
    Guam is American territory that is geographically advantageous 
in the western Pacific Ocean in terms of entering and leaving East 
Asia, and the US is using tactics such as clearing access for the 
Apra Harbor, expanding the airstrips and aviation control facilities 
for the Anderson Air Base, regularly stationing strategic bombers 
like the B-5 , B- , and B- , and advanced fighter planes like the 
F-, stocking cruise missiles and multi-use air-launched guided 
bombs, deploying attack submarines, and stationing rapid response 
ground combat troops, in hopes that Guam can be an important 
projection platform for American Asia-Pacific forces to rapidly 
respond to emergency needs; the US is also expanding the Peal 
Harbor base in Hawaii in preparations for planning of stationing 
aircraft carriers.
4. East Asia and Oceanian Region
     To expand the Changi naval logistics base in Singapore; to build 
floating bases and logistics facilities in areas such as Thailand’s 
Gulf of Thailand and Indonesia’s Natuna Islands; to build Australian 
new training grounds, and actively seek to rent important military 
facilities from states such as Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam, and 
seek to establish long-term military strongholds.
III. American Impacts on Regional Security
(I) Enhance military-political interactions to demonstrate the intent 
to maintain peace
    Under the precondition of prioritizing the maintenance of regional 
peace, and in response to the needs of situational developments, 
the US is gradually adjusting its forces stationed in South Korea 
and Japan, strengthening its political-military dialogue and 
interaction, etc, to actualize military partnerships on both sides, 
so that while other parties are constructing autonomous defense 
capabilities, they can also maintain regional stability, utilize 
further functions, and uphold more important responsibilities. 
Also, in southeast, south, and central Asia, the US will actively use 
bilateral or multilateral mechanisms such as military training and 
exchanges, high-level political dialogues, and regional security 
affairs coordination to increase mutual understanding and trust 
to reduce potential factors of conflict, promote peaceful regional 
development, and demonstrate capability and willingness to 
58
solve regional affairs, in order to ensure Asia-Pacific security and 
stability; in recent years, the US has been engaging in military 
exchanges with the PRC under these preconditions to understand 
the PRC’s intentions behind its strategic development, and promote 
gradual increase in its military transparency, which has positive 
impacts on maintaining regional peace and security.
(II)Enhancing military strength as a necessity to ensure democracy 
and  freedom
    Through actions such as enhancing interactions with friendly 
nations to control situational developments on regional security, 
maintaining security cooperation relationships with southeast 
Asian states like Singapore, the Philippines, and Thailand through 
construction of northeastern bases based mainly on Japan and 
South Korea, consolidating developments in Guam and the force 
projection base for the west Pacific, and extending influence 
towards Australia, India, and central Asia, the US has demonstrated 
its determination to militarily defend peace and effectively deter 
threats or respond to contingencies. Also, through actions such 
as annual bilateral or multilateral joint exercises, enhancements 
to international counter- terrorism and nuclear non-proliferation 
cooperation, active assistance in disaster relief and peacekeeping, 
participation in regional security discussion forums, etc, the US is 
actively demonstrating its ability to control the situation, prevent 
wars, manage crises, and expand its efforts to invite various states 
to support the US in showing its strong military capabilities to 
defend peace and demonstrate idealistic values such as love for 
freedoms, pursuit for democracy, and respect for human rights, 
and pressure undemocratic states in the region to execute political 
reforms to accelerate their democratic developments.59National Defense Report

Chapter 3 PRC Military Intention
    The PRC’s strategies against Taiwan, from the “Verbal Intimidation  
saber rattling”, and “harsh rhetoric and preparation to fight”, to the 
current “culture united front and military pressure”, all emphasize 
the strong-armed position of "being willing to risk war" to solve 
the Taiwan problem. The PRC’s military build-up philosophy went 
from the “people’s war” during its founding through influences 
from reforms, the Soviet collapse, and the two Gulf Wars, and is 
now focused on actively deploying new high-tech equipments and 
gradually developing towards technological military build-ups, 
enhancing joint operation training, signal warfare, and “winning 
local wars under advanced information technology conditions”. 
In recent years, the PRC not only passed the Anti- Secession Law 
to suppress Taiwan’s legal secession, it is more actively waging 
the three non-military wars against Taiwan, employing attacks on 
different levels such as public opinion, psychological, and legal.
Section 1 
 Military Intention
    The PRC’s 006 defense white paper stated a three-stage 
development strategy of its defense and force build-up: at the first 
stage, it will set a solid foundation before 00; at the second 
stage, there will be greater developments before 00; at the third 
stage, they will basically “build information-based forces and win 
information wars by the middle of the st century. Evidently, the 
PRC’s military build-up strategy incorporates other intentions of 
becoming a regional power, and is thus starting to develop in the 
outward direction, to build military capabilities that are appropriate 
for its national strength and international position to further ensure 
national interests and support developments of international 
relations.
63National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
I. PRC’s Military Strategy
    The PRC’s military strategy is founded upon “active defense”, 
emphasizing on winning a campaign in remote areas quickly, 
winning the first campaign decisively, setting increases in joint 
operation capabilities as its objective, developing towards combat 
capabilities in the Asia-Pacific and the world, and also does not 
rule out pre-emptive strikes to preserve its sovereignty; its tactics 
also incorporate internal and external changes from different eras, 
giving even broader definitions to “active defense”. Additionally, in 
order for the PRC to be on equal footing with militarily advanced 
states and penetrate traditional limits to its military activity space, 
it adheres to the asymmetrical warfare philosophy and actively 
constructs combat capabilities in areas such as information, 
electronics, networks, and space, accentuating that its combat 
philosophy has changed from a defensive “active defense” to 
an offensive “active defense” that operates outside theatre, and 
emphasizes pre-emption.
    In recent years, the PRC, responding to international and 
regional situation changes, is placing its strategic focus in 
directions such as the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea to 
support its sequential national policy and satisfy regional security 
affairs requirements. Although the PRC declares that it will not 
instigate wars or invasions, it will immediately employ offensive 
measures whenever its national sovereignty or territorial integrity 
are compromised, or when it faces unambiguous hostility; therefore, 
although the PRC bases its strategy on “active defense”, militarily, 
it emphasizes an active role to use its military power as a deterring 
role to construct a strategic security environment.
II. Political and Military Strategies Against Taiwan
    With an increase in overall national strength, the PRC is 
employing more dynamic and flexible strategies against Taiwan, 
incorporating the “three wars”, and interchangeably using methods 
such as political pressures, economic allures, military intimidations, 
diplomatic suppression, and social warfare, while relying on its 
military power as a strong support for taking Taiwan, actively 
enhancing military build-ups, and having its relevant military 
strategies against Taiwan as followed.
(I) The three non-military wars against Taiwan
    The PRC has long excelled at using public opinion and 
64psychological tactics against its opponents, and, in recent years, 
it has accounted for the fact that, in order to employ military action 
against outside actors, they not only need to abide by international 
laws, they should have legal propriety, and hence, it resorts to the 
so-called three non-military wars (public opinion, psychological, 
and law warfare). Therefore, in 003, the PRC has incorporated the 
“three Warfare” into its “Political Work Act for the PRC Military”, 
in its attempts to systemize its non-military tactics against Taiwan 
to “consolidate the self, fight for the middle, and divided the 
enemies”, and simultaneously establish a situation of “strengthening 
the self while weakening the enemy”. Currently, the PRC’s “three 
warfare" against Taiwan primarily include the following actions: in 
public opinion war, it uses the media to employ methods such as 
inciting propaganda and misleading information in order to create 
advantageous conditions for its military strikes. In psychological 
war, it builds psychological leadership agencies, professional 
psychological operations units, etc, to achieve the psychological 
goal of striking at the heart. In law warfare, it uses the Anti-
Secession Act as legal reference for future invasions against 
Taiwan. The PRC military’s “Three Warfare” uses non-military 
tactics, and its strategies have become dynamic and flexible, which 
may obfuscate the sense of self or enemy, and further weaken 
our will to resist enemies, to achieve the goal of winning without 
fighting or winning majorly with little fighting.
(II)Fabricating legalization of military action against Taiwan
    Article 8 of the Anti-Secession Act, legislated by the PRC on 
March 005, states that the PRC’s military can employ non-peaceful 
and other necessary measures against Taiwan when “Taiwan, under 
any justification or method, factually secedes; when major changes 
occurs that will result in Taiwan’s secession, or cause permanent 
loss of any possibility of peaceful unification”, intent on legalizing 
a potential war over the Taiwan Strait to eliminate international law 
and reduce international intervention. It accentuates the PRC’s 
further implementation of its “Three warfare” against Taiwan, using 
public opinion and psychological warfare to eliminate Taiwan's 
morale, resilience, and unity, and also control our own ethnic and 
national philosophies to consolidate recognition and consensus 
for non-peaceful policies against Taiwan; also, through legal 
competition, the PRC may weaken Taiwan's sovereignty, fabricate 
propriety for future invasion against Taiwan, and prepare for 
possible international assistance for Taiwan and legal problems that 
65National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
it may have to confront.
(III)Implementing preparations for military conquest of Taiwan
    Even though the PRC declares that it will solve the cross-
strait problem “peacefully”, it requires its military to increase 
preparations for military conflict with Taiwan, having full assurance 
of “forced unification” when the cross-strait polity collapses, 
therefore, in recent years, it is dramatically increasing its defense 
budgets to fully push along various military modernization targets, 
and actively conducting Taiwan-specific military exercises and 
training. It is intent on building military backing that can effectively 
and quickly conquer Taiwan; additionally, in order to prevent Taiwan 
from negating the PRC’s military growth, it is actively using a two-
sided strategy which contains the methods such as withdrawing 
missiles, increasing military transparency, and enhancing military 
exchange with the US military to request that the US stop selling 
weapons to Taiwan, and also controlling international political 
suppression, negotiating to block international military support 
channels that Taiwan may have access to, in the hope of that, 
under the strengthening of the self and the weakening of the other, 
the goal can be achieved by controlling absolute military advantage 
against Taiwan in order to support its overall national strategy and 
complete the preparations for invading Taiwan.
(IV)Build capabilities to block foreign militaries
    The PRC believes that, if it employs military actions against 
Taiwan, outside intervention will be its greatest concern, with the 
US being the most significant outside power in terms of possibility 
in interfering in conquering of Taiwan. In order to  prevent American 
military intervention and emerge as the regional superpower, 
while enhancing preparations for conquering Taiwan, the PRC is 
also actively developing blocking strategies, including precision 
strike capabilities such as its second artillery’s ballistic and cruise 
missiles, new long range naval missiles and submarine-launched 
anti-ship missiles, ship-launched and air-launched cruise missiles, 
and aircraft carrier groups, intending on building capabilities to 
strike at American bases and carrier battle groups stationed in the 
Asia-Pacific, and blocking out American intervention into battles 
over  the Taiwan Strait, in order to isolate Taiwan and assist in the 
successful military execution of future invasions against Taiwan.
(V)Intentions of internalizing  the Taiwan Strait
    The PRC military is actively planning, researching, and 
constructing its aircraft carriers, and is intent on establishing 
66combat capabilities beyond the outer islets, which will force our 
defensive operation positions into a disadvantageous “in-line” 
operation model, and if it completes its deployments, it will form 
a battle format of “internalized seas” against Taiwan, and create 
combat advantages of direct encompassment for the PRC.
III. Military Operation Concepts
    The PRC military’s overall military operation concepts are 
based on winning partial wars under the information condition, 
and combining strong high-tech forces and military and civilian 
resources, and its defense modernization is heading towards joint 
operations, comprehensive logistics, long range and mobility, 
out-of-theater operations, military reforms, and researching 
and procuring new high-tech weapons, in hopes of possessing 
capabilities to prevent foreign military intervention. Currently, the 
PRC is trying extremely hard to conceal its strategic intentions 
of controlling the western Pacific waters, and researching and 
manufacturing or purchasing, from foreign sources, mid-range 
ballistic missiles, aerial warning aircrafts, aerial refueling aircrafts, 
aircraft carriers, large destroyers, new fast missile patrol boats, 
nuclear attack submarines, enhanced joint command and control 
capabilities, etc, intent on crossing the first islet chain.
    In recent years, the PRC military is actively developing its 
force and firepower projection platforms in its army, navy, and air 
force, intent on blocking foreign military entry or exit of the Asia-
Pacific region; it is extending towards operation areas in space 
and networks, which is in response to the situation over the Taiwan 
Strait, and also to consolidate overall warfighting capabilities 
that is on the level of western states, and the PRC’s intentions of 
actively emerging as the regional military superpower is quite clear. 
The PRC military’s overall operation concepts against Taiwan in 
the future will use methods such as military intimidation, partial 
lockdown, and saturation attacks on key targets as its key axis, 
to consolidate the effectiveness of its operations against Taiwan, 
and gradually build a formidable warfighting capability to conquer 
Taiwan.

Section 2
Military Capabilities
    In order for the PRC to adjust to military reforms around the 
world and the requirements of developing its national strategy, 
it is promoting total defense modernization on the foundation of 
economic development, and setting new-era military strategic 
orientations to realize “military reforms with a Chinese touch”. The 
PRC military stresses military development contents that focus on 
strong high-tech forces, and technological training of forces; it 
uses joint operation as its basic operation format, develops long 
range precision strike capabilities, constructs digitized and mobile 
troops, realizes the winning of partial wars under the information 
condition, and continues Taiwan-specific contingency operation 
preparations in order to raise its overall warfighting capabilities.
I. Defense Budget
    The PRC capitalizes on its overall growth in national strength to 
invest large funds in defense infrastructure, and, since 99, the 
PRC’s defense budget had been growing by the double digits for 
7 consecutive years, currently only behind the US and Russia as 
the world’s third-largest defense-spending state, and emerging as 
the largest in Asia; in order to modernize its defense, currently, it 
is focusing on enhancing weapon characteristics, actively moving 
towards attacking, paralyzing, blockading Taiwan, and capturing 
Taiwan’s outer islands. The cross-strait military advantage is slowly 
tilting towards the PRC (the PRC’s defense budget statistics from 
997 to 007 are as shown in Table 3- ).
68(I) Allocation summary
    In 007, the PRC’s defense budget is $350.9  billion RMB 
(approximately $44.94 billion USD), a 7.8% increase from 006 
(the 006 defense budget is $ 97.93  billion RMB, or approximately 
$38. 5 billion USD 007), and the PRC claims that the new budget 
increases are mostly used to cover military salaries and wages, 
benefits, public affairs, food costs, and funding for equipments 
and facilities, and increase the PRC military’s defensive operation 
capabilities under the information condition.
(II) Structural analysis
    According to the defense budget released by the PRC 
government, it is separated into personnel living expenses, activity 
maintenance expenses, and equipment expenses, variously 
used on military salaries and wages, equipment maintenance, 
and procurement, research, and manufacturing, each occupying 
approximately one third. However, to adjust the rates for the PRC 
military’s .3 million standing soldiers in 007 (including civil 
soldiers and reserves), 980,000 military police, and 4 million 
persons living on retirement checks, as well as incorporating

The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
the requirements of its increased infrastructure funds and 
enhancements to its defensive operations, it will need larger 
defense budgets, therefore its actual expenditures need to be 
hidden among non-military departments.
(III) Hidden budget
    The PRC claims that its defense budget expenditures are still low 
in comparison with major states in the world. However, according to 
the aforementioned allocation summaries and structural analyses, 
it is estimated that the PRC’s human resource expenses are up to 
$0 billion USD, its activity maintenance expenses are up to $30 
billion USD, and its equipment expenses are up to $ 0 billion USD, 
which far exceeds the PRC’s official budget, and the PRC military’s 
defense technology research projects, weapon sales profits, partial 
foreign procurement expenses, defense industrial revenues, and 
operational funds for 660,000 military police members have all been 
left out of the defense budget. Therefore, western defense strategy 
analysts believe that official data is not actual funds, and that the 
PRC military’s actual military expenditures are rather far apart from 
official defense budget data, which occupies only approximately 
one third of actual total funds, and, estimates of its actual defense 
budget spending should be doubled or tripled, which is between $90 
to $0 billion USD (the PRC’s official and actual defense budget 
expenditures are as shown in Figure 3- )

Official Defense Budget70(IV) Equipment procurement
    Because the PRC is under defense pressure, especially in terms 
of winning partial high-tech warfare, it is actively procuring new 
weapon equipments from foreign sources, and, other than its 
official budget, its military funds also include military projects.  
Other important projects (such as “tracking advanced foreign 
strategic high technology” and “manned aerospace projects”) or 
expenses of military-industrial groups are all listed separately.  
Also, the PRC is purchasing weapon equipments and technological 
transfers from Russia, such as the Ilyushin-76 transport plane, 
Sukhoi- 7 aircraft (it is manufacturing its own Jian-  aircrafts 
after acquiring technological transfer), Sukhoi-30 aircraft, modern 
class missile destroyers, and K-class traditional submarines. In 
addition, the PRC is also buying the S-300 series of air defense 
missiles, and, in the future, it hopes to acquire the most advanced 
Russian air defense missile systems. The aforementioned items are 
only parts that are well known to the outside world, and items and 
technological transfers not released will be more difficult to estimate.

(V) Future developments
   The PRC sets 00 as its strategic opportunities period, and 
overall research and analyses indicate that, the PRC is facing 
factors such as winning partial high-tech wars under the information 
condition, military strategy adjustments, and expanding defense 
7National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
infrastructure requirements from its new military reforms, and, in 
the future, its military funds will need higher levels of increase to 
adapt to establishing a middle class society, military reforms, and 
new-era military conflict preparation requirements in a balanced 
fashion. Future development analyses are as follows:
.In order to coordinate its national interests and military 
modernization targets, it is estimated that, before 00, its military 
funding will reach 3.0% of its GDP or more, approximately $700 
billion RMB (approximately $95 billion USD), to solidify the PRC’s 
military infrastructure that is mobile, digitized, and unified.
.In order for the PRC military to complete its military build-up 
objective of winning partial wars under the information condition, 
it intends to build a high- quality and effective modern force, and 
the scale of its military funding may be relaxed, and it is estimated 
that, under increasing military funding, its military deterrence 
ability towards the region will gradually increase. However, the 
Chinese threat theory will likewise attract international attention, 
surrounding regions will gradually see the PRC as a potential 
threat, and these developments may instigate a new round of arms 
race in the region.
II. Current Military Capabilities
    The PRC’s aggressive military preparations against Taiwan 
indicates that, right now, it is setting its own schedule and gradually 
building formidable warfighting capabilities against Taiwan, and 
its contingency operation preparations against Taiwan had been 
increasingly and especially comprehensive, stressing exceeding 
traditional warfighting models, facing enemies with advantages, 
penetrating theatre and out-of-theater constraints, employing 
military or non-military methods to achieve victory, which is certain 
to have some effects on its operation concepts. In the future, it is 
more likely to use the precision strikes of certain “assassin's mace” 
weapons, and combine “acupuncture warfare” with a wide variety of 
asymmetrical warfare tactics to physically damage infrastructures 
that are important to Taiwan’s political, economic, and military 
needs, in hopes of yielding the most benefits with the least costs.
(I) Joint surveillance capacity
    The PRC military currently possesses overall surveillance 
capacities such as surveillance satellites, observation and 
communication radars, aerial warning aircrafts, and intelligence- 
7gathering boats, which can engage in long-term monitoring of 
the land, atmosphere, ocean, and electronic signals or regions 
surrounding Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matzu, and already 
possess capabilities to monitor sea and air targets in the Asia-
Pacific region and combat command and control.
(II) Long range precision strikes
    The PRC military’s second artillery is actively deploying the DF 
series of short-range tactical ballistic missiles, which 
takes only 7 minutes to strike at Taiwan’s mainland, and, at the 
same time, it is deploying land attack cruise missiles, which can 
carry out long range precision strikes against targets that are 
important to Taiwan; also, new vessels and aircrafts in the navy 
and air force are equipped with long range precision weapons, 
which can carry out long range precision strikes against important 
political, economic, and military targets on Taiwan’s mainland and 
outer islets.
(III) Blocking foreign militaries
     In recent years, the PRC military is enhancing its joint exercises 
among army, navy, and air force, actively enhancing its overall 
warfighting capabilities, and arranging new generations of aircrafts 
and vessels to conduct training to resist foreign militaries. So far, 
it already possesses combat capabilities to block foreign militaries 
from entering the first islet chain.
(IV) Network, information, and electronic warfighting capabilities
    The PRC understands the importance of network, information, 
and electronic warfare, and is actively researching and training 
various information and electronic assault and defense tactics to 
build capabilities to damage or control enemy command and control 
agencies and basic civilian facilities systems; currently, the PRC’
s information and electronic warfare tactics include computer virus 
attacks, hacker infiltrations, etc, and its methods include Trojan 
programs, worms, internet phishing, fake viruses, spyware, etc, and 
it also conducts research on soft and hard kill tactics (or methods) 
such as sabotaging enemy command centers, operation platforms, 
radar, etc, and currently, it already possessed capabilities to hinder 
enemy command, control, and surveillance systems.
III. Military Build-up Targets
    The PRC has never abandoned military options against Taiwan, 
and has planned certain force construction targets under limited 
73National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
timetables, continuing preparations of military conflict against 
Taiwan. In accordance with the concept of winning partial wars 
under the information condition, it is actively enhancing unified 
operation, joint logistics, and long range mobile strike capabilities. 
And it continues to push its military developments in accordance 
with changes in the situation over the Taiwan Strait, in hopes of 
achieving the objective of being a strong high-tech force with 
strong technological training, in order to build a modernized 
military defense. Situations of relevant military developments are 
explained as follows:
(I) Military education transformation
    With favorable international situational changes and increases 
in its overall national strength, the PRC is pushing for new military 
reforms. Other than focusing on high-tech developments, it is 
also actively pushing ahead for military education and training 
transformations, with emphasis on doctrine and theory research and 
formulation, joint operation command mechanisms, joint training 
systems, joint logistics insurance systems, and adjustments and 
reforms in outfitting. Therefore, PRC military staff members will be 
able to adapt to the future unified joint operations requirements 
in order to simultaneously accelerate the rate of transformation 
towards mobility and digitization. And the existing problems within 
the PRC military’s systems, equipments , and education and 
training can be solved in order to possess capabilities to engage in 
modern warfare, making it a top priority for its military build-up.
(II)Force construction targets
1.Second artillery
    The PRC aims to build strategic deployments with double 
intimidation and double strike abilities, and is accelerating the 
operational functions of its weapon systems under complex electro-
magnetic environments, enhancing nuclear intimidation and anti- 
nuclear intimidation, nuclear strike, and regular missile strike 
capabilities. Other than continuing to enhance the contingency 
functions of various ballistic and cruise missiles, the PRC is actively 
organizing new missile groups, and accelerating research and 
construction of nuclear, regular, and anti-carrier ballistic missiles. In 
recent years, it is also enhancing many joint operation capabilities 
between its armed forces in order to establish advantages against 
Taiwan or foreign naval support, and execute long range precision 
strikes with point paralysis and surface destruction.
2.Army
74    Keeping with the direction of militarily developing towards 
mobility and digitization, the PRC is enhancing its training 
under complex electro-magnetic environments. It is accelerating 
upgrades to its existing primary combat equipments, consolidating 
regimenting structures, emphasizing on airborne troops, light 
mobile troops, and information warfare troops; it is also continuing 
adjustments in outfitting its brigades and battalions, moving from 
foot soldiers to mobile troops to increase its command and force 
projection speed, and increasing its ratio of mobile and digitized 
equipments; it is also gradually increasing special operation and 
rapid response capabilities such as fusion of high altitudes and 
ground level, far end mobility, rapid strike, amphibious landing, 
etc. 
3.Navy
    In order to fulfill its strategic target of transforming from “brown 
waters” to “green waters”, and build a modern naval warfighting 
capacity that consists of many branches, and has nuclear and 
regular warfare tactics, the PRC is emphasizing on developing 
information systems and new weapon equipments to enhance 
naval operation preparation targets; at the current stage, it has 
completed foreign purchases of modern class missile destroyers, 
K-class traditional submarines, self-made large combat ships, large 
multi-role landing vehicles, new fast missile patrol boats, while 
accelerating deployments of nuclear attack submarines, initiating 
military build-up targets such as research and manufacture projects 
of aircraft carriers, and enhancing long-range precision strike and 
force projection capabilities, expanding naval defense depths. 
4.Air force
    The PRC intends to build an information-based aerial warfighting 
capacity with offensive and defensive functions with great emphasis 
on developing new weapon systems and enhancing air defense 
operations, information warfare, strategic mobility, and multi-
role protection capabilities; it is also continuing research and 
manufacture of Jian- 0 aircrafts, Jian-7 bombers, Hong-6 guided 
missile aircrafts with long range precision strike capabilities, and 
enhancing air defense capabilities across Beijing, Shanghai, and 
its south- eastern seas, to boost its overall anti-air and air defense 
capabilities, in hopes of controlling partial air superiority in partial 
battles during critical moments. 
5.Information and electronics
    The PRC emphasizes on developing new command and control,

The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
warning and espionage, navigation and targeting, information 
transfer, and information warfare systems, continuing to enhance 
overall standards, and adapting to the equipment development 
requirements of main battles. Additionally, it will enhance research 
and development on electro-magnetic pulse weapons with the 
intention of paralyzing Taiwan’s C4ISRsystems and controlling 
electro-magnetic superiority over the Taiwan Strait.
(III) Equipment development trends
    The PRC military’s overall equipment construction developments 
is meant to invest in long-term targets, including its overall 
warfighting capabilities and future warfighting capabilities; it 
is accelerating defense technology industrial modernization, 
constructing warfighting equipments for information warfare, 
and introducing foreign corporations and financial management 
mechanisms in order to enhance production efficiency, improve 
the quality of self-made weapons, and support the policy of 
modernizing military equipments; the PRC is also reinforcing 
intimidation and actual fighting capabilities under the information 
condition, developing towards mobility and digitization,and 
intensifying ambush, mobility, defense, information, and protection 
capabilities; it is also actualizing requirements such as unifying 
its armed service, constructing a joint operation system, and 
integrating its accomplishments, and actualizing developments of 
autonomous and far-reaching equipments.
    In aerospace technology, the PRC is not only improving its 
communication, observation, navigation and targeting, the 
operational effectiveness of its military monitoring satellites in orbit, 
the construction of constellation network surveillance capacity, 
and increase in space signal support capabilities. Additionally, in 
order to satisfy future warfare requirements, it has initiated anti-
satellite research and development projects since 000, originally 
scheduled for field tests in 008, however, on January 007, the 
PRC’s mid-range missiles have successfully destroyed weather 
satellites, indicating that the PRC’s research and development of 
anti-satellite weapons is ahead of the original schedule, and it now 
possesses basic ability to strike low-orbit military satellites, and, 
according to its plans, in the future, it will continue to develop anti-
satellite weapon platforms capable of soft kills; its primary combat 
weapons are planned towards highly efficient damage and precision 
control and guidance, and it is continuing developments on long-
range rockets and anti-armor bombs, increasing the precision 
76
National Defense Report
capabilities of its mid and long range combat weapon platforms; its 
anti-missile systems are developing in the direction of high-altitude 
anti-ballistic systems in order to protect Beijing and important 
cities and key military posts along the south-eastern seas; in 
terms of information and electronic warfare, the PRC aims to seize 
information advantage, and, aside from electronically monitoring, 
interfering, and soft-killing Taiwan’s information systems, it can 
also effect more intervention and damage against American military 
information systems, and it is also developing towards paralyzing 
the enemy’s combat command systems and effectively defending 
against information attacks as its primary axis.
against information attacks as its primary axis.
Section 3 
Military Threats
    As its economy is rapidly growing, the PRC is effectively 
investing in military expansion projects, with the majority of military 
funding used to research and develop or purchase new weapon 
systems, and its combat capabilities in second artillery, navy, 
and air force are gradually securing military advantages over the 
Taiwan Strait; and it is also expanding its traditional sphere of 
ground combat to underwater, sea, air, space, electro-magnetism, 
and network areas, vying for combat advantages in the six areas, 
and, currently it is employing the strategy of using the military to 
block independence and encourage unification, setting down the 
operational principle of “pursue negotiations, prepare for war, and 
be patient” against Taiwan, and its tactics are increasingly flexible 
and variable. These developments indicate that the American and 
Japanese report on the PRC’s military and defense white paper 
is correct in saying that the cross-strait military advantage is 
gradually tilting towards the PRC.
I. PRC Military Deployments Against Taiwan
(I) Aerospace
    The PRC military has over 30 targeting, navigation, 
communication, monitoring, research, and weather satellites 
operating in Earth’s orbit. In order to enhance communication 
77National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
secrecy in military command, precision navigation of naval and 
aerial transport platforms, and all-weather surveillance abilities, 
the PRC continues to push in aerospace research. In particular, 
its surveillance satellites, along with its3-D precision navigation 
and all-weather surveillance capabilities will dramatically increase 
the strike precision of its cruise missiles. And, after deploying 
surveillance satellites, the PRC now has night surveillance 
capabilities, with surveillance radius covering important global 
targets. The PRC is also actively researching and manufacturing 
various satellites with military applications in order to increase 
its capabilities in early warning, command and control, battlefield 
reconnaissance, aircraft and ship navigation, and missile guidance 
and control, in order to increase enemy monitoring and precision 
strike capabilities; also, as the PRC was successful in 007 in 
successfully using mid-range ballistic missiles to destroy weather 
satellites, although currently it only possesses actual combat 
capabilities against low-orbit satellites, in the future, it will continue 
developing anti-satellite weapon platforms and technologies such 
as military surveillance, military communication, navigation and 
targeting, and marine observation, in order to achieve its intention 
of becoming the space superpower (depictions of various orbital 
satellites from the PRC military are shown in Figure 3- ).
Figure 3-  Depictions of Various Orbital Satellites 
in the PRC Military78(II) Second artillery
    The PRC military currently has approximately over ,300 
regionally deployed short-range ballistic missiles and cruise 
missiles, continuous manufacture of various improved missiles, 
and is gradually outfitting troops. Its research and modification of 
short-range ballistic missiles emphasize on characteristics such 
as hit rate, mobile course-changing, and sub-munitions. In recent 
years, the PRC has effectively achieved strategic deterrence, and 
is actively enhancing various missile deployments, and its new 
ballistic missiles are aimed towards solidification, miniaturization, 
and mobility, using integration of advanced satellite guidance 
systems to dramatically increase overall strike precision. In terms 
of regular ballistic missiles, currently, its tactical ballistic missiles 
are deployed in military zones in Nanjing and Guangzhou, and, in 
wartime, they can rapidly carry out missile strikes against Taiwan. 
Tactical ballistic missiles already deployed by the PRC can provide 
applications of combined firepower against Taiwan (the PRC second 
artillery’s short range tactical ballistic missile and cruise missile 
threats diagram is shown in Figure 3-3).
Figure 3-3   The PRC second artillery’s short range tactical ballistic 
                  missile and cruise missile threats diagram 79National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
(III) Air force  
    The PRC military’s air force against Taiwan consists of air 
defense missiles systems and various fighter and bomber aircrafts, 
and currently approximately over 700 fighter aircrafts of various 
models can engage in combat against Taiwan without landing for 
maintenance and supply. Additionally, the PRC air force’s elite 
fighter aircrafts and the Sukhoi series of fighter aircrafts bought 
from Russia are mostly deployed in bases in the eastern half of 
China, and, in wartime, they can quickly carry out airstrikes against 
Taiwan.
    Under the strategic guidance of incorporating offensive and 
defensive capabilities, the PRC military is actively increasing 
training in areas such as naval warfare, night navigation, and long 
range rush, and also enhancing automatic command and control 
capacities and combat capabilities in low-altitude aerial ambush 
at night; also, the PRC military is expanding logistical facilities for 
the Sukhoi fighter aircrafts in airports along the coasts of Fujian 
and Guangdong, in order to facilitate mobile entry for the aircrafts 
at all times, and, through intense training methods and mobile 
deployment adjustments, the PRC has visibly compressed Taiwan’
s anti-air warning time, and is increasingly threatening Taiwan’s air 
defense (the PLAAF’s primary advanced fighter aircraft diagrams 
are shown in Figure 3-4).
(IV) Navy
    International air routes around the Taiwan Strait cover an area of 
40 square kilometers, and 600 to 900 small and large ships pass 
through the area. In order to obtain marine hydrological data, the 
PRC has been, in recent years, continuing deployments of their 
marine investigations and intelligence gathering ships around 
Taiwan’s peripheral waters, and extending as far as intelligence Figure 3-4   The PLAAF’s primary advanced fighter aircraft diagrams
80gathering operations in the west Pacific, the Philippines, and 
Japan; also, according to situational analyses of PRC submarine 
activities in Taiwan’s peripheral waters, it is clear that the PRC had 
provided relevant gathered data for naval use.
    The PRC’s naval forces against Taiwan have gradually replaced 
older ships with fewer and newer ships, and the PRC is also 
actively modernizing its fleets. These include large fleets such 
as surface combat ships, attack submarines, mid-size and large 
amphibious transport ships, and coastal missile patrol ships, which 
can all engage in combat against Taiwan immediately. And they can 
also support combat missions by redirecting its northern fleets and 
relevant resources. In recent years, the PRC has purchased high-
performance weapon systems from Russia, including the modern 
class missile destroyer and the K-class traditional submarine, which 
poses direct and severe threats against Taiwan’s marine safety (the 
PRC military’s primary surface and underwater naval forces diagram 
is shown in Figure 3-5).
(V) Army
    In recent years, the PRC continues to increase various 
armaments, transport helicopters, and some military zones have 
completed refitting of new amphibious tanks, main battle tanks. 
Adhering to its military build-up orientation towards mobility and 
digitization, the PRC military combines construction schedules 
for naval and aerial transport forces, and enhances the strength 
and scale of training in coordination among branch services, joint 
firepower performance, joint landing between the armed services, 
depth assaults after landing, ground aviation and airdropping, 
and mountain assaults, in order to enhance ground troops in 
contingency operations against Taiwan and joint operations 
capabilities among the armed services.
Figure 3-5    The PRC military’s primary surface and underwater naval 
forces diagram
8National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
    Also, the PRC’s ground troops against Taiwan have relative 
advantage in numbers, and its existing contingency mobile 
operation troops, fully equipped, fully staffed, and fully trained, 
can engage in combat without undergoing combat training; also, 
the primary troops that the PRC will be deploying when engaging 
against Taiwan can come from the Nanjing military zone facing 
Taiwan, and, in wartime, the PRC can also sent reinforcements from 
military zones in Guangzhou and Jinan to enhance its warfighting 
capabilities. However, despite having advantage in ground troop 
numbers, the PRC still cannot fully support their operations in 
terms of aerial and naval transport and logistics, making it difficult 
to fully employ ocean-crossing assaults or airborne operations. 
Because of this, the PRC is actively developing various aerial and 
naval transport methods to effectively support operations against 
Taiwan (the PRC army’s primary armored, open-field air defense, 
and ground aviation forces diagram is shown in Figure 3-6).
(VI) Information and electronics
    The PRC’s network attacks employ a unified military-civilian 
operation format, and, other than designating its northern, central, 
and southern network warfare centers as the mainstay, the PRC is 
Figure 3-6   The PRC Army’s Primary Armored, Field Air 
Defense, and Ground Aviation Forces Diagram8further combining network resources and absorbing information 
technology talents, applying the strong anonymity, wide attack 
range, no distance limitations , and difficulty in detection to 
complete preliminary large-scale network warfare capacities.    
    In recent years, the PRC established many network warfare 
centers, and tested network hacking, espionage, and virus 
attacks against Taiwan from the Chinese mainland and out-of-
theater locations. Ground-based electronic warfare troops are 
equipped with new signal jamming equipments, creating various 
jamming fields; the air force has deployed long-range jamming 
aircrafts, various anti-radiation UAVs, and anti-radiation missiles. 
In terms of intensive operation training under complex electro-
magnetic environments, the PRC military has gradually enhanced 
its tactics such as network hacking, virus attack, electronic 
interference, and anti-radiation missiles, which can destroy Taiwan’
s basic capabilities in command and control and information 
and communication equipments, which has a high specificity of 
engaging Taiwan.
II. Key Points In Military Preparations Against Taiwan
    The PRC military is actively modernizing its military to serve 
as a foundation for becoming a global power, and it uses 
its rapid economic growth to actively develop modernized 
military capabilities and to account for future regional warfare 
requirements. It is actively accelerating research and manufacture 
of joint operation command systems, enhancing joint firepower for 
large-scale battles, building formidable anti-sea and air defense 
capabilities over the Taiwan Strait, and purchasing platforms 
to build rapid projection capabilities in order to enhance its 
contingency capabilities and destructiveness. It also continues to 
accumulate attack capacities that can execute precision strikes 
against Taiwan’s political, military, and economic targets to 
sabotage Taiwan’s command mechanism and economic order; 
additionally, its aircrafts and ships continue to expand their the 
radius of their activities, which is not only to gather intelligence 
about Taiwan’s hydrology and airspace, but also to test Taiwan’
s naval and aerial response time, which serves as a reference for 
military actions against Taiwan.
(I) Accelerating joint operation command systems
    In order to integrate joint operation capabilities and effectively 
engage in combat, the PRC military is currently actively devoted 
83National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
to testing of joint operation command platforms, integrating 
datalink equipments of combat troop, prioritizing the completion 
of command and control for joint firepower strikes in the south-
eastern seas region and combat systems as its objective. In the 
future, the PRC will gradually build command and control systems 
that will cover the Asia-Pacific region. Also, through actions such 
as participation in UN peacekeeping troops and the Shanghai 
Cooperation Organization (including anti-terrorism exercises), and 
allowing allied nations to observe exercises, the PRC is actively 
increasing its mobile out-of-theater combat capabilities, and 
synchronously enhancing experience and tactical methods such as 
anti-terrorism and joint operations.
(II) Enhancing joint strike capabilities
    The PRC’s research and manufacture of short-range ballistic 
missiles and cruise missiles in second artillery has greatly 
increased in number, precision, and contingency capabilities 
compared to the past. This result serves as an indicator in the 
enhanced joint firepower strike capabilities of the PRC military. It 
is estimated that the PRC military has completed various missile 
preparations, which enables striking capabilities against Taiwan’
s important political, economic, and military targets. At the start of 
a battle against Taiwan, the PRC can use large amounts of tactical 
missiles, cruise missiles, anti-radiation missiles, unmanned aerial 
attack platforms, and air forces to quickly penetrate the defensive 
depths over the Taiwan Strait, and attack important political and 
military targets such as Taiwan’s political and economic heartlands, 
military bases, logistical supply facilities, and command, control, 
communication, and intelligence centers, which can weaken Taiwan’
s defensive capabilities and force Taiwan’s combat capabilities into 
paralysis or collapse.
(III) Building formidable naval and aerial capabilities
   The PRC military has assembled approximately 00 new large 
surface combat ships, various submarines with submarine-launched 
anti-ship missiles, and new missile patrol boats while completing 
placements of mobilization bases for coastal anti-ship missiles, and 
constructions of logistical facilities in ports around the Fujian area. 
Currently, with the combination of over 500 new generation fighter 
aircrafts, the S-300 series of air defense missiles introduced from 
Russia and fighter-bomber aircrafts, the PRC military has formed 
tightly knit aircraft, missile, and artillery networks, and the PRC 
is simultaneously enhancing multi-role protection infrastructure 
84in airports around the south-eastern seas, and integrating joint 
air defense capabilities, and the PRC now possesses preliminary 
partial air defense superiority in terms of conquering coastal areas. 
In recent years, other than increasing the frequency of naval strait 
patrols and air defense exercises, naval ships are also gradually 
increasing cross-region and around-the-island navigation training, 
increasing the frequency and scale of exercises in Taiwan’s eastern 
waters, and gradually forming a naval and aerial blockade situation 
against Taiwan.
(IV) Increase rapid projection capabilities
    In recent years, the PRC air force continues to purchase the 
Ilyushin-76 large transport aircraft from Russia, and its army 
continues to mass-produce various models of transport helicopters, 
as well as researching its own mid-sized transport helicopter, 
intent on establishing rapid airdrop projection capabilities; also, 
aside from building large multi-role landing ships, the PRC navy, in 
order to fulfill variable landing methods against Taiwan and large-
scale naval transportation of troops, is also actively purchasing 
large bull class inflatable rafts from Ukraine, in hopes of building 
comprehensive amphibious warfare capabilities against Taiwan.
(V) Expanded radius of aircraft and vessel activities
    As the PRC’s navy and air force become stronger, the radius 
of the PRC’s aircraft and naval activities continue to extend 
outward. After 996, there have been fundamental changes to these 
situations. For example, in 998, the PRC has approximately over 
400 fighter aircrafts operate near the west of the middle line of 
the Taiwan Strait. Since 005, there have been ,300 to over ,700 
aircrafts every year (statistical table of PRC fighter aircraft activities 
west of the middle line of the Taiwan Striat is shown in Table 3- ). 
Also, activities of PRC intelligence ships around Taiwan’s peripheral 
waters are also increasing continuously. In the last 3 years, the 
PRC’s intelligence and scientific research ships have been moving 
around the Taiwan Strait an average of over 0 times, many times 
of which they even infringed on Taiwan’s sovereign waters. It is 
believed that the PRC’s frequent use of aircrafts and vessels in 
the Taiwan Strait are not only to gather intelligence about Taiwan’
s hydrology and airspace but also to test Taiwan’s naval and aerial 
response time in order to serve as a reference for military actions 
against Taiwan.
   In the past  to 3 years, the PRC has frequently sent out marine 
investigation ships into Japan’s exclusive economic waters for 
85National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
hydrological research. It is believed that the reason that PRC 
aircrafts and ships are actively gathering intelligence in the East 
China Sea is out of consideration that when situation escalates 
over the Taiwan Strait, it can effectively gain the aerial and naval 
superiority in these waters. Therefore, it can interfere with the 
actions of the American military and Japan’s self defense force, so 
that they cannot quickly intervene in battles over the Taiwan’s Strait.
III. Taiwan-Specific Exercises
    In order to achieve its strategy of using its military to hinder 
independence and encourage unification, the PRC military is 
actively enhancing Taiwan-specific tactical combat exercises, 
dramatically increasing joint operation capabilities, and is, in 
recent years, conducting combat exercises for joint armed services, 
armed and branch services, tactical methods, and missile tests, 
and actively deepening armament strength against Taiwan and 
joint operation training results. Classes emphasize live troop 
combat exercises under complex electro-magnetic environments, 
emphasizing on landing, lockdown, and firepower strikes, to 
enhance various Taiwan-specific scenario training, such as 
forcefully sealing off and conquering nearby coastal islets, joint 
firepower strikes, resisting electro-magnetic interference, aerial 
and naval lockdown, conquering Taiwan’s outer islets, and resisting 
foreign militaries, in order to test the abilities of each armed and 
Table 3-     Statistical Table of PRC Fighter Activities West
                 of the Middle Line of the Taiwan Strait86
branch service in contingency operations, and enhance coordinated 
combat capabilities between the armed and branch services, which 
pose a major threat against Taiwan.
IV . Characteristics of PRC Attacks Against Taiwan
    In terms of the various military capabilities of the PRC against 
Taiwan, the main threat of the PRC’s current-stage invasive 
capabilities against Taiwan still lies in military intimidation 
and blockade against Taiwan. However, in overall analyses of 
various factors such as the modernization progress of the PRC’s 
military, developments of strategic concepts, force structure and 
deployments, and weapon research and manufacturing capabilities, 
its future combat capabilities against Taiwan will become more 
comprehensive.
(I) Emphasizing preparations for contingency operations
    In recent years, the PRC military continues to research and train 
for joint operation projects, emphasizing on testing various combat 
capabilities, including joint landing, depth assault operations, 
partial naval and aerial blockade, and joint firepower strikes; 
also, the PRC is engaging in exercises such as cross-region force 
projection and border counter-strike operations. An overall view of 
the PRC military’s various exercise activities within the year still 
reveals that the primary axis still continues to be Taiwan-specific 
combat capability preparations, and the quality of the PRC military’
s warfighting capabilities continues to increase, which will benefit 
subsequent actions such as increasing the strength of military 
activities and mobile force adjustments which indicates that the 
PRC military is gradually achieving stage-based combat readiness 
targets in contingency operations against Taiwan.
(II) Building capabilities to block foreign militaries
    An overview of the research, development, and manufacture 
situations of the PRC second artillery’s intercontinental, mid-range, 
and anti-satellite ballistic missiles, and recent test fires of the ship-
launched and air-launched Yingji series and submarine-launched 
anti-ship missiles indicates that the PRC military is actively 
integrating aerospace, ballistic missiles, and combat platforms 
such as land, sea, and air, to build capabilities to block foreign 
militaries. In assessing situations such as its enhanced assembly of 
ships crossing Japan’s Miyako Strait, deployments of submarines to 
tactical waters covered by American naval carrier strike groups, air 
force bomber aircrafts extending into the East China Sea region for 87National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
flight training, it is believed that it possesses strategic intimidation 
capabilities of hindering foreign military entry into the first islet 
chain and attacking parts of American military bases stationed 
in north-eastern and south-eastern Asia, which greatly increases 
security concerns of foreign military intervention over the Taiwan 
Strait.
(III) Expanding surveillance coverage area
    The PRC military combining with military, civilian, and 
international cooperation capacities gradually established 
remote space sensors, surveillance satellites, and radars, and 
acquired surveillance platforms such as warning, monitoring, and 
intelligence, research, and marine monitoring, actively increasing 
joint surveillance capacities. It indicates that the PRC’s surveillance 
tactics are getting increasingly dynamic, gradually covering all 
of eastern Asia, and multiplying the difficulties in concealing the 
military facilities, troop movements, and mission execution of 
Taiwan’s armed forces.
(IV) Variable choice in striking firepower
    The PRC military currently has land attack weapons, including 
ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, air-to-ground missiles, smart 
bombs, etc, with ballistic missiles already possessing multiple 
target striking capabilities; its air-launched missiles include anti-
radiation missiles, the Yingji series, etc, which enables joint 
firepower strike capabilities with variable choice and deterrence.
1. Enhancing joint strike effectiveness
    In an overview of the PRC military’s live troop combat exercises 
of its second artillery troops in 006 and 007, they were all 
conceptualized as battles against Taiwan by using the "simulation  
wargames and realistic validation" and using various tactical 
and cruise missiles to execute high-and-low joint firepower 
strike efficiency tests, which not only tests the tactical actions of 
firepower ambush but also evaluates the combat capabilities of 
saturation strikes and precision strikes against Taiwan. New joint 
operation training methods is also used to exceed traditional armed 
service limits and fulfill future operation requirements.
2.Build superior firepower for quick victories
    The PRC military currently has land attack and air-launched 
weapons. When combined with the precision strike principle of 
destroying actual entities, damage systems, and paralyzing key 
points, it is gradually building superior firepower for shocking the 
entire battlefield, and achieving quick victories.88
V . Possible Methods of PRC Attacks Against Taiwan
    The Anti-Secession Act legislated by the PRC allows the PRC 
military to employ non-peaceful methods and other necessary 
measures against Taiwan, which visibly indicates that the PRC still 
refuses to abandon military action against Taiwan. In the future, 
if the PRC employs military action against Taiwan, it will account 
for the tactical concepts of lowering cost, raising efficiency, fight 
fast, and win quickly,. In analyzing the PRC military’s current 
warfighting capabilities, possible actions in attacking Taiwan can 
be approximately separated into four major categories:
(I) Military intimidation
    In peacetime, the PRC already uses psychological warfare 
formats, and employs actions such as increasing the strength of 
its military activities, adjusting force placements, including forward 
deployments, live exercises, and firepower demonstration, and 
also uses media reports of warfare woes over the Taiwan Strait with 
the intent of causing internal psychological panic in Taiwan, and 
striking at Taiwan’s public morale.
(II) Partial blockade
    The PRC may use its navy and air force to execute partial 
blockade operations against important ports, external routes, etc, 
in Taiwan’s main and outer islands, and execute lockdown and 
control or conquering of Taiwan’s outer islets, in order to weaken 
Taiwan’s public morale, destroy Taiwan’s economic establishment, 
and worsen Taiwan’s survival environment to achieve the objective 
of forcing Taiwan to negotiate for peace.
(III) Saturation attacks against key targets
    In using its second artillery, air-launched land attack missiles, 
etc, the PRC may strike at parts of Taiwan’s command system, 
political, military, and economic heartlands, symbolic targets, 
etc, and gradually upgrade and increase intensities in hopes of 
disintegrating Taiwan’s willpower to fight and forcing Taiwan’s 
surrender or support subsequent executions of strategic battles.
(IV) Landing (Taiwan) battles
    The PRC may integrate its armed services and second artillery 
troops and engage in amphibious attacks against Taiwan’s main 
island, with the intention of winning as quickly as possible to 
conquer Taiwan before foreign intervention to establish the fact.89National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
VI. Overall Analysis of Possible Enemy Activities
    In analyzing the aforementioned possible PRC military actions 
against Taiwan, because the PRC does not yet possess capabilities 
to completely invade Taiwan’s main island and effectively blocking 
foreign militaries, it is believed that, at the current stage, there 
is greater likelihood of the PRC employing military intimidations, 
partial lockdowns (including conquering outer islets), and saturated 
attacks on key targets, to achieve its stage-based objective of 
using the military to hinder independence; and, in the future, as the 
PRC military acquires capabilities to conquer Taiwan’s main island, 
or when the situation becomes urgent, it may directly attack Taiwan’
s main island.90

Chapter 4 Taiwan Value
    Taiwan is located where the Eurasian mainland meets the Pacific 
Ocean, and is also on the meeting point between Northeast and 
Southeast Asia and the pivot of the first island chain in the West 
Pacific, making it a very important military geostrategic position, 
and a prime target for the PRC’s strategy of building a blue-water 
navy. If Taiwan is controlled by an undemocratic state with unclear 
military strategic intentions and non-transparent military affairs 
operation, then peace and order in Northeast Asia and the North 
Pacific will face immense threats. Therefore, Taiwan’s existing 
advantages such as solid democracy, liberal values, and stable 
economy, as well as contributions to the international society such 
as counter-terrorism and contingency response, helping the weak 
and curbing the strong, and peacekeeping, not only make it able to 
serve as an example of democratic and economic development for 
Asian states, but it can also act as a security anchor for maintaining 
peace and order in the Asia-Pacific region.
Section 1 
Taiwan’s Geographical Strategy
    Geographical strategy can be shortened to “geostrategy”, which 
is the study of the relationship between geography and strategy 
with geography as the foundation, and the value of geography in 
strategy.
   The 6th century was the era when the first wave of Europeans 
began great adventures and discoveries in Asia. First, there were 
the Portuguese, followed by the Spanish and the Dutch, all vying 
for commercial profits, coming far from the Atlantic Ocean, Cape 
of Good Hope in southern Africa, the Indian Ocean, or by directly 
crossing the Pacific Ocean to Southeast Asia. In order to develop 
95National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
commercial markets in China, Japan, and regions in the southern 
seas, they had all gradually initiated placements or constructions of 
trade bases in the vital spot of Taiwan.
   Since the end of World War , the US-led group of main western 
democracies has all used the first islet chain in the West Pacific as 
the frontline post for blocking authoritarian states in the Eurasian 
mainland. Taiwan is located in the middle of the first islet chain, 
which enables it to not only connect the overall theatre. Above all, 
it can choke the throat of marine traffic ways along the southern 
and eastern seas of the Chinese mainland in peacetime. In wartime, 
it can serve as a strategic forward base for offensive planning 
against the Chinese mainland.
    Therefore, because of economic activities of western states in 
eastern regions, or military and economic activities of contemporary 
western states in the Asia-Pacific region, one can notice that 
Taiwan’s geographical position has important strategic values to its 
interests and states that intend to affect certain measures in this 
region.
I. Geography
    Taiwan consists of the main island, subordinate islands, and 
archipelagos in Jinmen, Matsu, Penghu, and the South China Sea, 
for a total of 86 islands. The main island measures 394km north-to-
south, 44km east-to-west, occupying approximately 35,759 square 
km in area, and located in the vital position of the intersection of 
the Eurasian mainland and the Pacific Ocean, the intersection of 
Northeast and Southeast Asia, and the middle point of the first islet 
chain in the West Pacific.
    The South China Sea, the South Sea, occupies 3.5 million 
square km in area with abundant fishing and potential petroleum 
resources. There are four archipelagos in this sea: the Pratas 
Islands (consists of the Pratas Island, Pratas Atolls, South Vereker 
Bank, and North Vereker Bank), Paracel Islands (consists of the 
Xuande Islands, Yongle Islands, and underwater sandbars and 
sandbanks), Macclesfield Islands (consists of 9 shoals including 
the Siamese Shoal, Magpie Shoal, Carpenter Shoal, etc), and the 
Spratly Islands (consists of 0 islands, shoals, and banks).
II. Military
    Taiwan is located in the connecting point between Northeast and 
96Southeast Asia, being the vital point on the first islet chain in the 
Pacific Ocean, and controlling marine routs along southern and 
eastern seas around the Chinese mainland, which has the effect 
of limiting or ensuring the PRC’s naval forces’ passage through 
the first islet chain in terms of the PRC’s development of naval 
strategies. In terms of American and Japanese interests, it can 
provide Japan with protection and security investments over the 
marine defensive strategic frontline on Japan’s southern seas.
   This strategic location provides convenience for projection 
military force towards peripheral seas, and can balance interactions 
among American, Japanese, and PRC strategic interests in the 
West Pacific, making it a key leverage point in the stability and 
development of the Asia-Pacific region. In a joint statement between 
the US and Japan after the  +  security conference in 005, the 
region of Taiwan and its surrounding waters were listed as a mutual 
strategic target for the  states, which has significant meaning for 
demonstrating Taiwan’s importance towards the peace and stability 
of the East Asian region.
III. Economy
    Currently, the Asia-Pacific region is the center of gravity for global 
economic development, and Taiwan is located between Southeast 
and Northeast Asia, and its surrounding seas and airspace are 
important international marine and aerial traffic intersections, 
connecting marine and air traffic routes from Japan, South Korea, 
the Chinese mainland, and various states in the Southeast Asian 
region. Therefore, Taiwan’s economic geostrategic position is 
even more important. Cross-strait situational developments not 
only dictate regional security and stability, it further influences the 
economic interests of various instates in the Asia-Pacific region.
    The Northeast Asian states of Japan and South Korea are affected 
by domestic lack of resources, and both need to rely on external 
trade with export-oriented states to import petroleum, industrial raw 
materials, and civilian goods from abroad by ship. Furthermore, 
they also need to use ship transport to sell various manufactured 
industrial products across the world. If they cannot reliably use 
the Taiwan Strait route and need to take the Pacific waters east of 
Taiwan, risk and cost will dramatically increase.
    To the PRC, 3 out of 4 major export routes for major northern and 
southern commercial ports go through the Taiwan Strait, and its 
long-term influence for the PRC’s economic developments speaks 
97National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
for itself.
     In the last few decades, Taiwan has used advantageous strategic 
positions and well-trained defense forces to effectively block the 
eastward expansions of PRC influence, maintaining security and 
stability over the Taiwan Strait, and providing important assistance 
for ensuring the safety of international routes. In the future, 
Taiwan will continue play an appropriate security role under this 
geostrategic framework, and provide positive contributions for the 
security and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.
Section 2
Contributions to the International Society
◎ For the last few decades, Taiwan has maintained security and stability over the Taiwan Strait and 
provided important assistance for ensuring the safety of international routes
98    Taiwan has limited land area and is densely populated. But 
because Taiwan’s people collectively devoted everything they 
had, they created the economic miracle admired across the 
world. As Taiwan’s people enjoy the fruits of their labor from 
dramatically increased living standards, they have never forgotten 
to fulfill their responsibilities as a member of the international 
society. Despite the PRC’s constant obstructions and oppression, 
leaders throughout Taiwan’s history have still openly declared 
to the international media, many times in important political and 
economic events inside and outside the country, how Taiwan will do 
everything to contribute to the international society.
    Based on various implementation considerations, the 
government offers assistance to undeveloped or underdeveloped 
states, including NGOs (non-governmental organizations) in: 
democracy, human rights, medicine, humanitarian assistance, 
emergency rescue, environmental protection, conflict prevention, 
information technology, education and cultural exchanges, human 
resources developments, and global topics that are of concern to 
organizations and foundations of democratic states.
    Through parliamentary, private sector, economic and trade, 
and foreign policy channels, Taiwan provides relevant assistance, 
which will be explained below on the four aspects of encouraging 
democracy, counter-terrorism, poverty relief, and peacekeeping:
I. Encouraging Democracy
    With its authoritarian system, Taiwan has undergone democratic 
reforms such as demilitarization, removing limits on political 
parties and media, full reforms to parliamentary elections, 
popular presidential elections, and even successfully democratic 
transformations of political power transitions through democratic 
elections. And now Taiwan’s society of politically democracy, liberal 
lifestyles, and social tolerance is precisely an appropriate example 
of success for states pursuing democracy and liberties.
    Having accumulated many years of respect for the universal 
mainstream values of democracy, freedom, and human rights, 
Taiwan can exert soft influence against the PRC, which currently 
operates under one-party rule, actively expands its military despite 
suspicions, and fears from the international society, which can have 
a demonstrative effect on its democratic political transformation, 
99National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
in order to increase the transparency and predictability of its 
decision-making behaviors, reduce potential factors of conflict, and 
provide positive contributions for regional security.
    In the future, Taiwan will continue to use existing democratic 
accomplishments to protect human rights and defend the 
universal values cherished by the international society, and 
persist in making positive contributions for global and regional 
developments.
II. Anti-Terrorism
    After the conflict model between democracies and dictatorships 
ended, unconventional terrorist activities are of the highest concern 
and worry for the international society among modern security 
threats.
   After the 9  terrorist attacks witnessed around the world, 
attacking threatening terrorist activities have become the core 
topic for American national strategies. Justice measures against 
terrorist attacks have changed from national anti-terror activities 
to joint global ones, where states around the world devote the 
best of their efforts. According to the findings of the Country 
Reports on Terrorism released by the US State Department, 
there are approximately 80 terrorist organizations with frequent 
activities around the world, spreading out across regions such 
as Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.
    Overall, despite the US-led global anti-terror alliance of western 
states devoting its efforts to combat international terrorist activities, 
international terrorist activities are still increasing in frequency and 
intensity in recent years.
    As a member of the international society, Taiwan has employed 
various response and management measures out of respect for the 
UN’s relevant anti-terror resolutions and treaties, and also out of 
the responsibility to encourage world peace and security.
   On September 0, 00, President Chen officially announced 
Taiwan’s the strict position of its anti-terror policy, pointing out that 
“terrorism can proliferate anywhere, with almost the whole world 
under covered by its threats; including China developing terrorism-
like assault tactics in its exhaustive warfare, which severely 
threatens our national security and people’s well being, therefore, 
the nation’s people should repudiate such tactics and increase 
their awareness.”
00    The Taiwanese government’s concrete measures for counter 
terrorism will be explained below through the four aspects of 
legislation, mechanisms, international cooperation, and anti-terror 
forces:
    The Minister of Justice has drafted the Anti-Terrorist Activities 
Act, which creates relevant regulations for topics such as 
responsible units, intelligence integration, communication and 
investigations, asset seizures, funds freezing, investigation 
methods, technology export management, border security 
management, and counter terrorism support missions from military 
troops.
   In 004, the Executive Yuan established the Anti-Terrorism Policy 
Conference, as well as Executive Yuan Counter Terrorist Activities 
Management and Control Office staffed by personnel assigned 
from relevant departments, which were renamed to the Joint Policy 
Conference and the Executive Yuan Homeland Security Office on August 
007, unifying the integration and application of anti-terrorism 
topics and resources between various Executive Yuan departments.
In 003 and 006, Taiwan signed the Cargo Safety Agreement and 
the Palembang Declaration – Nuclear and Radioactive Substance 
Inspection Agreement, in order to improve the safety of transporting 
ship cargoes.
   In 004, Taiwan started strictly implementing complete export 
management measures of strategic high-tech products, to prevent 
relevant technologies from falling into the hands of ambitious 
elements.
   In 007, Taiwan amended the Money Laundering Control Act 
serving as a reference for preventing and eliminating financial 
assistance for terrorists.
Starting from 007, Taiwan initiated the Anhai Project – Border 
Security Management to prevent firearms and drug trafficking and 
illegal immigration.
    Major intelligence and law enforcement agencies, such as 
the National Security Bureau, National Police Agency, and the 
Investigation Bureau, have all established specific anti-terror 
mechanisms, serving as a connecting window for international 
anti-terror activities, and actively contributing to Taiwan’s 
responsibilities as a member of the international society.
    Outfitting of anti-terror forces in the police include Wei-An 
Special Services Commando, and Thunder Squads in various 
county and city police departments; for the military, they include 
0National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
Army Airborne Regiments, Military Police, Army Special Service 
Teams, specialized anti-biological, anti-radiological, and anti-toxic 
troops, and relevant mission support troops, devoting to increasing 
the nation’s overall anti-terrorism capabilities.
III. Poverty Relief
    In terms of assisting economic and social developments, Taiwan 
has employed the parallel method of staffing technological groups 
abroad and overseas service groups to assist with economic and 
social developments in developing states; currently, Taiwan has 
assigned 34 technological groups in 9 states, for a total of 46 
technical personnel.
    In terms of economic assistance, Taiwan allocated funds to 
establish the Central America Economic Development Funds to 
assist with planning such as creation and management of small 
and medium businesses to encourage development of regional 
economic activities and increase the people’s living standards; 
also, Taiwan provided more than 300,000 job opportunities for 
citizens from allied states in the Southeast Asia region, improving 
living standards for their homeland and families while they assist in 
◎ Despite facing hostile PRC threats, Taiwan’s government continues to demonstrate its usual sensibleness 
and restraint to eliminate threats of war and maintain peace across the Taiwan Strait
0building Taiwan.
    In terms of volunteer manpower support, Taiwan has signed 
volunteer assignment agreements with  allied and non-allied 
states, including Honduras, for a total of 75 volunteers assigned to 
Africa, Central America, Asia-Pacific, and the Caribbean. Provisions 
include assistance and service in special skills such as small and 
medium businesses, agriculture, urban development, environmental 
protection, hygiene and medicine, information technology, 
education and cultural exchanges, human resource development, 
etc.
    In terms of Taiwan’s medical hygiene and emergency rescues, 
it includes humanitarian rescues for the South Asian tsunami, 
and refugees from Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan, and, in the last 0 
years, Taiwan expended at least $450 million in funds. In recent 
years, Taiwan has further established international Taiwan medical 
activity groups to effectively integrate governmental and private 
sector medical hygiene resources, and they have gone to  states, 
including Panama, Swaziland, Guatemala, Nauru, Palau, Fiji, and 
Tuvalu, benefiting as many as 4,000 persons.
    Additionally, in terms of environmental protection, since 987, 
◎ Outfitting of anti-terror forces and relevant mission support troops dedicated to 
improve the nation’s overall anti-terrorism capabilities03National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
the government had taken note of the importance of environmental 
protection for sustainable human development, and specially 
established the Environmental Protection Department under the 
Executive Yuan, and allocated project funds to deal with the 
pollution prevention and waste disposal relevant to environmental 
protection, and ecological protection work, in hopes of using 
exchanges of experience with western states, studies, and 
legislations to make active responses and contributions towards 
importance topics such as improvements and of the global warming 
environment.
IV . Peacekeeping
    On the topic of international security, Taiwan had immediately 
expressed its three basic positions, on February 4 and July 5 of 
007, of supporting de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and 
peaceful dialogue to resolve conflicts, supporting the international 
community to engage in dialogue with North Korea immediately 
through diplomatic channels. Taiwan is willing to participate in a 
dialogue environment created by the international society to create 
peace, demonstrating its determination to encourage peace and 
stability in the international society.
    On the topic of regional security, Taiwan gradually transformed 
its offensive-oriented and unified offensive-defensive military 
strategy to the more gentle and non-invasive defensive operations 
and active defense, and announced war prevention, homeland 
defense, and anti-terrorism as the three basic objectives of Taiwan’
s defense policy, and further added “maintaining world peace” into 
the national constitution, demonstrating Taiwan’s peaceful position.
    Taiwan’s government and leaders had, in the past, declared 
many times Taiwan’s non-nuclear policy, and President Chen 
further stressed that Taiwan is determined to not only oppose 
nuclearization, but further support de-nuclearization, during a tea 
meeting with foreign reporters on October 9, 007, and reiterated 
the “three no’s to nuclear weapons” policy promise that Taiwan will 
not develop, introduce, or use nuclear weapons.
    In recent years, despite facing hostile PRC threats such as 
ceaseless additions of missile deployments against Taiwan, 
large military exercises targeted at Taiwan, public declarations 
refusing to abandon military resolutions to the Taiwan problem, 
promulgation of the “Anti-Secession Law”, Taiwan’s government 04
continues to demonstrate its usual sensibleness and restraint, and 
tirelessly and publicly imploring, through multilateral channels, 
to the international community, that peaceful and stable cross-
strait interactive frameworks should be established; on October 
004, President Chen further suggested positions such as formally 
ending cross-strait hostilities, establishing cross-strait military 
trust mechanisms, reviewing cross-strait armament policies, and 
formulating behavioral doctrine in the Strait, and open military 
exercises and activities to actively express goodwill, in hopes of 
eliminating threats of war, maintain peace over the Taiwan Strait, 
and fulfill Taiwan’s basic responsibilities as a member of the 
international society.
    Additionally, on the complex and sensitive territorial sovereignty 
controversies surrounding the South China Sea, President Chen 
landed on Itu Aba personally on February , 008, to deliver the 
Nansha Initiative, which explicitly accepts the spirit and principles 
of the Declaration on the Code of Conduct on the South China 
Sea, insisting on peaceful methods to solve the territorial and 
sovereignty controversies, and that developments in the South 
China Sea should place emphasis on environmental protection 
rather than exploitation of marine resources, and that international 
environmental experts and organizations should be regularly invited 
to research the area, to avoid sovereignty controversies, interfering 
with cooperation between various states in the South China Sea 
area. Communication through bilateral channels is encouraged to 
actively reduce the unstable situation in the South China Sea.05National Defense Report

Chapter 5 Defense Policy
    Concrete actions of defense policies are meant to effectively 
utilize overall national strength to secure national interests based 
on the “Constitution”, the “National Defense Act”, and “national 
security strategies”, and considerations of how to establish armed 
defense capabilities.
    In the current stage, the greatest threat to Taiwan’s defense 
security still comes from the PRC. Various concrete implementations 
and planning of defense affairs primarily focus on defending against 
the PRC’s military threats. Also, the Armed Forces are concerned 
about typhoons, floods, earthquakes, epidemics, etc, that pose a 
threat to the life and assets of the people, and prioritized them as 
such for carrying out support capability preparations.
Section 1
The Mission of the Armed Forces
    The “Constitution of the Republic of China” explicitly states in 
Article 37: “The national defense of the Republic of China shall 
have, as its objective, the safeguarding of national security and the 
preservation of world peace.” Article  of Chapter  of the “National 
Defense Act” also states: “The national defense of the Republic 
of China aims at utilization of comprehensive national power to 
establish national defense force, safeguard national security, and 
maintain world peace.”
    The armed forces aim to protect national interests such as 
“national survival and development”, “the safety and well-being of 
the people”, and “democracy and human rights”, and follow the 
national security strategy to achieve the current overall strategic 
goals for national security: ensure national sovereignty and dignity, 
survival and security, and prosperity and developments, and be 
free of internal or external threats, invasions, or sabotages”. The

Section 2 
Policy Directives
    In the face of dramatic military expansions from the PRC, 
international terrorist activities, and domestic threats of major 
natural disasters and epidemics, the Armed Forces focus its current 
defense policy orientation on achieving the basic objectives of 
“war prevention”, “homeland defense”, “counter-terrorism and 
contingency response”, in order to ensure overall national security 
and protect the safety of the people’s lives and assets. Concrete 
policy orientations are as follows: 
I. Expand All-out Participation in National Defense Affairs
(I) Continue to maintain transparency of defense information 
through proactive measures such as releasing the national 
defense reports, opening MND information websites, delegating 
academic communities to study military topics, holding academic 
symposiums, and hiring academic and professional experts as 
defense affairs consultants.
(II) Use reviews and amendments of legislations, inter-agency 
affairs coordination committees, and joint exercises to tightly 
0integrate overall reserve mobilization resources and mechanisms 
such as disaster prevention and relief, communicable disease 
control, nuclear accident prevention, and counter terrorism 
measures, to harness overall all-out strength.
(III) Conduct series of mobilization drills such as “Wan-An” and 
“Tung Hsin” in accordance with all-out defense concepts, in hopes 
of collecting emergency reserve resources and rapidly engaging in 
defense support and disaster response operations through prompt 
and accurate mobilization system exercises, thereby building a 
comprehensive homeland security network.
II. Enhance All-out Defense Concepts
(I) Building integrative defense powers that fuse military-civilian 
oneness, tangible combat capabilities, and intangible psychological 
defense is a primary defense conceptual development axis for 
many countries in the st century. Having observed this trend, 
the MND is actively building an all-out defense system that is all-
dimensional, participated by all, comprehensive and “trusted” by 
the people.
(II)Through formulation of all-out defense teaching staff and 
educational materials, and multiple channels, such as school 
education, on-the-job lecture tours for civil servants, academic 
research forums, dissertation selections, awards for outstanding 
contributions, prizes for participating in online questionnaires, 
military-civilian interactive events, mascots, comics, and Journeys 
of Discovery – Base Open Day tours, and summer boot camps, the 
MND seeks to accurately grasp societal trends, fully engage in 
dissemination and promotion, focus on the groundwork for all-out 
defense, inspire public focus and discussion concerning “everyone’
s responsibility on national defense and security, and everyone’s 
relevance in defense infrastructure”, and further encourage popular 
participation in defense affairs, so as to actualize various physical 
work called for in the “All-out Defense Education Act” and the “Act 
of All-out Defense Mobilization Preparation”, thereby establishing a 
consensus as a “life community” when it comes to national defense 
security.

military confrontations and ensuring national security, coordinate 
with the government’s policy guidance to push for cross-strait 
peace and stability interactive frameworks, continue preparing and 
negotiate with the PRC for behavioral doctrines, diligently push for 
cross-strait military trust mechanisms, and encourage peace and 
stability over Taiwan Strait.
(II) The cross-strait mutual military trust mechanism should be 
built on the foundation of both sides being “equal and trustworthy” 
in order to ensure stable developments on the security situation. 
Considering that the PRC has never expressed concrete goodwill or 
promised to abandon military liberation of Taiwan, the armed forces 
is steadily pushing forward its plans based on the near, mid, and 
long-term stages.

Section 5 of this chapter.
XII. High Quality Care for the Lives of Military 
Dependents
(I) Troop “ safety ”
.Personnel safety: continue measures such as consolidating 
internal troop management efficiency, utilizing supervision and 
assistance functions of all levels of staff, actualizing various 
safety inspection regulations, enhancing humanistic management, 
psychological assistance, and military discipline education, and 
establish safety early warning and response mechanisms to reduce 
occurrence of accidents and dangerous incidents.
.Psychological safety measures: use measures such as patriotism 
education, public awareness projects, education projects, various 
artistic activities, artistic and performance tours to deepen 
servicemen’s recognition of “why they fight and for whom they 
fight”, inspire patriotism from the servicemen and solidify their 
willpower to resist enemies.

between troops and dependents of mandatory service soldiers and 
voluntary soldiers, to resolve suspicions and build benevolent and 
positive interactive relationships.
Section 3 
Crisis Management
    The ROC Armed Forces are an inseparable component of the 
homeland security network. In compliance with government policy 
and the principle of “all-dimensional security”, they focus on 
managing “military crisis”. The information reporting system of 
the “ Joint Operation Command Mechanism” is designated with the 
responsibility to closely monitor dynamic and stationary factors 
which will influence security. In order to protect the people’s lives 
and assets, it will spare no effort to “prevent any crisis in advance, 
monitor situations while they occur, respond to emergent scenarios, 
swiftly manage crisis situations, and confine any escalation”. (see 0
Figure 5-    Homeland security network establishment, missions 
and responsibilitiesNational Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
I. Objective
    In the face of national security threats, the Armed Forces, bound 
by their duty to “protect homeland security”, are to strengthen 
crisis prevention and management and focus on “countering 
unrestricted warfare” and “countering terrorist activities” so as to 
establish capabilities for “contingent response, rapid reaction, and 
immediate operation”.
II. Missions
    Under the direction of “Governmental Response and Management 
Mechanism on Domestic Major Urgent (Contingent) Events” issued 
by the National Security Council, the missions of the ROC Armed 
Forces, within the national crisis management mechanism, include:
(I) Preparing for war and executing defense operations under a 
military conflict.
(II) Facilitating the Ministry of the Interior to manage mass 
upheavals and violent activities, handle serious hijacking and 
sabotaging events in the Capital area, and neutralize civilian 
airport, aircraft, harbor, and ship hijackings and sabotages.
(III) Under "Disaster Prevention and Protection Act," supporting 
◎ Establish the concept of military and civilian oneness for all-out commitment 
in defense reinforcements and disaster relief contingency operations local governments and governmental disaster relief authorities 
when they are unable to manage disasters.
III. Authority
    The authority for crisis prevention and management is derived 
from "The Enforcement Regulation of the Management of Accidents 
during General Combat Ready Status for the ROC Armed Forces 
(Governing also unrestricted warfare and counter-terrorism 
activities)" and the "Disaster Prevention and Protection Act," which 
list various major accidents or disasters required for support. For 
those accidents without legal mandate, the MND can provide timely 
support under the direct order of national command authority. 
When a crisis has escalated to jurisdiction and evolved into military 
conflict or war, it will respond with proper warfighting preparations 
or execution of defense operations under related standard operating 
procedures and operation plans.
IV . Jurisdiction
(I)Military accidents (incidents): These include accidents listed 
in “The Enforcement Regulation of the Management of Accidents 
during General Combat Ready Status for the ROC Armed Forces,” 
in which crafts such as PLA aircraft and naval ships, Chinese large 
iron fishing boats, and mobile fishing boats violating the code of 
conduct or causing accidents.
(II)Unrestricted warfare (terrorist activities): The sabotage and 
assault activities of this type of warfare have endangered the 
people's lives and assets, or seriously jeopardized national 
interests or national security.
(III)Major disasters: These are the major disasters listed in the 
“Disaster Prevention and Protection Act.”
V . Execution
(I) Crisis prevention
    Threats to homeland security mainly come from external military 
threats and internal non-military threats (e.g. threats resulting from 
natural disasters or man-made calamities). The crisis prevention 
effort is extremely complex. In terms of preventing military 
threats, it is necessary for the ROC Armed Forces to take the 
initiative and assess any possible situation in advance. Focuses 
should also be set on “grasping threat intelligence”, “predicting 
3National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
crisis”, “formulating reaction initiatives”, “rehearsing drills”, and 
“accumulating experience”. For the characteristics and patterns of 
crises, the ROC Armed Forces have closely worked with authorities 
to seamlessly collect intelligence, comprehensively design accident 
scenarios and responses, and direct forces to investigate resources 
in their area of responsibility and prepare for resource mobilization. 
Coordinating with military, government, and civilian combined 
exercises, ROC Armed Forces executed a variety of integrated joint 
homeland defense drills to improve their abilities in joint early 
warning, joint response, and crisis prevention and management. 
In the future, the ROC Armed Forces will follow national security 
policy and defense policy objectives and guidelines to continue 
monitoring the situations in the Taiwan Strait. Focusing on reducing 
military tension and risks of miscalculation, the ROC Armed Forces 
will endeavor to prevent military accidents and neutralize crises 
before they emerge. For non-military threats and prevention, please 
see Section 3 of Chapter  Building Homeland Security for a 
detailed discussion on the relevant actions.
(II) Crisis handling
    This aims to monitor the development of crises that occur and 
◎ Enhance the “contingent response and rapid reaction” capabilities of various command units, readiness 
force and district hospitals to effectively address threats and challenges
4defuse them as soon as possible. Its focuses are “stabilizing the 
situation”, “monitoring the gravity of crises” and “integrating 
responses”. When the country faces a natural or artificial disaster, 
the ROC Armed Forces abide by the “Disaster Prevention and 
Protection Act” and the “Regulation of Applying Military Assistance 
to Relieve Disasters” to facilitate county or city governments to 
relieve disasters. In a sudden assault by terrorist attack, the ROC 
Armed Forces will immediately analyze the characteristics of the 
assault to decide its sources. Then, the designated contingent 
forces will follow the order to provide "counter-terrorism operation" 
support for authorities and local government and neutralize 
the threat as soon as possible. When the crisis escalates, the 
Joint Operation Command Center will activate a comprehensive 
contingent mechanism and execute contingency tasks or defense 
operation missions in compliance with the order from the national 
crisis management mechanism. For works performed by the 
Executive Yuan in integrating overall national strength (including 
manpower, materials, finance and other relevant resources) to 
support the Armed Forces’ operations, counter-terrorist activities 
and disaster rescue and relief, Chapter  Defense Mobilization has 
a detailed discussion. The MND’s management of military crisis, 
counter-terrorist activities and disaster rescue and relief are as 
follows:
1. Military crisis
(i) The pattern of modern warfare and the development of high-
tech weapons have increased the suddenness and unpredictability 
of military crises. Crisis monitoring and management will face 
more challenging situations if an adversary launches terrorist 
attacks by quasi-military actions or unrestricted warfare measures. 
Therefore, when an adversary shows obvious offensive intentions 
or clear indications of invasion, the MND will immediately and 
comprehensively analyze threat intelligence and issue preparatory 
orders for an “upgrade of defense readiness condition (DEFCON” 
and for “preliminary operation guidance” on a timely basis to 
prepare for enemy threat. In the following step, the MND will 
recommend the government to convene the "National Security 
Council." Based on the decision and direction of national command 
authority, it will adopt proper warfighting preparations or execute 
defense operations.
(ii) Considering that the enemy may launch regular and irregular, 
linear and non-linear, symmetrical and asymmetrical warfare with 
5National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
a sudden assault against Taiwan, the ROC Armed Forces have 
completed preparations for various combat-ready statuses. Based 
on the capability differences of forces between peace and war time, 
the standard operating procedures and operation plans have been 
formulated accordingly. We are cautious with launching a war. We 
will not start a war before all other choices have been exhausted. 
Based on these two principles, the warfighting preparation guidance 
is designed to actively and comprehensively prepare for war and 
succeed defense operations.
(iii) For other discussions on military crisis, Chapter 8 Armed 
Forces Combat Capabilities have a series of sections on the MND’s 
concrete actions.
2. Counter-terrorism operations
(i) In order to protect the people’s lives and assets, the government 
has issued a comprehensive guideline on “the action organization 
structure and functional mechanisms of counter-terrorism”. Under 
this guideline, the counter-terrorism crisis management is separated 
into three stages: “prevention, management and recovery”. The risk 
prevention statuses include three color codes “green, yellow, and 
red”. Once intelligence regarding a terrorist attack is confirmed 
or an unpredicted terrorist attack has occurred, the counter-
terrorism mechanism will be immediately activated to respond to 
the emergency.
(ii) In addition, the Military Police will assist police agencies in law 
enforcement according to the regulations of the mutual supporting 
agreement between the police and the military police. It will also 
collaborate with the police administration to build a comprehensive 
intelligence network of crisis early warning and solidify prevention 
and reinforcements for counter-terrorism operations.
3. Disaster relief and rescue
(i) The ROC Armed Forces always support disaster relief authorities 
and local governments when major disasters overwhelm their 
abilities. In compliance with the “Disaster Prevention and Protection 
Act” and the “Regulation of Applying Military Assistance to Relieve 
Disasters”, the ROC Armed Forces will dispatch forces to facilitate 
disaster relief efforts immediately after they happen based on the 
principle that missions “shall not influence operation readiness, 
disturb command authorities, or exceed capacity”. The MND 
included disaster relief as one of the regular military missions so 
that a legal basis is laid for procuring disaster relief equipment and 
machinery to help minimize loss to the people’s lives and assets. 
6
(ii) In response to the contingency requirement of various types 
of crisis and natural disasters, the MND units have designated 
personnel on duty 4/7 at the “ Joint Operation Command Center” 
as prescribed by the standard operation procedures for various 
contingencies to manage any crisis events during peacetime. In 
addition, before the typhoon season is due, all theaters of operation 
will be asked to complete organization of disaster prevention and 
rescue contingency groups at the Command Center and enhance 
preparation so that they can engage in disaster prevention and 
rescue in a timely fashion and assist in safeguarding the people’s 
lives, assets and security.
(iii) Establish new infection syndrome monitoring and reporting 
systems for regional military hospitals such as those in Songshan, 
Taoyuan, Zuoying, Kaohsiung, and Hualien, disease prevention 
capabilities such as “investigation, testing, handling, and research” 
for laboratories equipped with  class 3 and 4 pathogens testing 
abilities in Institute of Preventive Medicine, regional quarantine 
bases that control and investigate epidemic conditions, and 
professional troops for detoxification support work.
(iv) Coordinate with various departments in participating in 
amendments to legislations such as the Disaster Prevention 
and Protection Act, Prevention and Protection Operation Plan 
for Windstorm, Flood, Drought, Fire, and Earthquake Disasters, 
Forest Fires, and Debris Flow, Regulations Governing Application 
for Military Support and Disaster Handling, Regulations for 
Dispatching Judicial Police, and Preservation of Natural Ecology 
and Environment.
(v)For more information on the MND’s disaster relief works and 
results, please see Section  of Chapter  Social Services.
(III)Aftermath recovery
    Rehabilitating confidence is critical in the aftermath recovery 
stage. The ROC Armed Forces will focus on “hardware recovery” 
and “confidence restoration”. For “hardware recovery”, the ROC 
Armed Forces will follow the order to provide support, and mobilize 
comprehensive national powers to decontaminate or reconstruct 
affected areas, so as to avoid a second crisis. For “confidence 
restoration”, the focuses will be boosting forces' morale and 
anchoring the fighting will of the military and people to effectively 
dissuade the enemy from launching follow-up attacks. For more 
detailed discussion on the MND’s works on “hardware recovery” 
and “confidence restoration”, please refer to Section  of Chapter 7National Defense Report

Combat Capability.
Section 4 
Military Exchanges
    To coordinate with overall foreign policy, the MND continues to 
push for military affairs interaction and cooperation with friendly 
states, and use the concept of mutual assistance and mutual 
benefits to maintain positive relationships with various states 
through methods such as high-level visits, think tank cooperation, 
military purchases, educational training, military assistance, and 
humanitarian assistance, to pursue bilateral or multilateral military 
cooperation and exchange opportunities, in hopes of achieving the 
ultimate objectives of “expanding friendships and consolidating 
alliances”, “increasing international visibility”, and “maintaining 
peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the Asia-Pacific 
region”.
   In 007, visits from foreign civilian guests and military 
commanders to Taiwan totaled 9  groups and 700 persons; armed 
forces visits to allied states also totaled ,80 persons; persons 
selected domestically to receive foreign training, and student 
exchanges with allied states totaled 46 persons.
    In terms of discussions of security topics, we have held strategic 
security discussions, Taiwan-US armament and defense affairs 
conferences and discussions, which attracted elite members 
of political and academic communities across various states. 
Regardless of areas such as military build-up planning, enemy 
intelligence control, expanding military exchanges, or increasing 
troop combat capabilities, group collaboration and advice are 
significantly beneficial for the armed forces.
    In the future, military exchanges and cooperation activities for 
the armed forces will continue coordinating with the principles of 
overall national policy and striving for maximum national benefits, 
and we will sustain steady promotion, in hopes of using opinion 8
exchange channels on topics of shared interest to gradually 
increase the level of officials and personnel exchange, expand 
areas of cooperation, endeavor after advantage for the armed 
forces and the nation, and fulfill the responsibility of maintaining 
regional security and prosperity.

    Article 38 of the Constitution of the Republic of China states 
that “The Army, Navy, and Air Force of the nation shall rise above 
personal, regional, and party affiliations and shall be loyal to the 
State and love and protect the people”, while Article 39 states that 
“No political party and no individual shall make use of armed forces 
as an instrument in the struggle for political power”, and Article 6 of 
the National Defense Act also states that “The ROC Armed Forces 
shall remain neutral from individual, regional and party affiliations 
in accordance with the Act”. The armed forces belong to the nation 
and the people, and logically pledge allegiance to the nation, 
observe the Constitution, and defend political neutrality to realize 
the strict positions of “administration under the rule of law” and 
“nationalization of the military”.

The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
II. Concrete Actions
    In order for the armed forces to actualize the “nationalization 
of the military”, as mandated by the Constitution, they strictly 
defend political neutrality and focus on combat readiness to ensure 
national security and fulfill the people’s expectations, and the 
relevant concrete actions are as follows:
(I) Formulate concrete regulations
.Soldiers cannot serve in any positions provided by political 
organizations or election candidates.
.Currently active soldiers cannot be forced to join political parties 
or political organizations or participate in political activities that 
aid political parties, political organizations, or election candidates 
running for public office.
3.Soldiers cannot engage in organizing, promoting political party 
affairs, disseminating political views, or other political activities 
within military agencies.
(II) Promulgate relevant commands
    Commanding officers (or section chiefs) in all units at all 
levels are requested to use various occasions and opportunities 
to promote regulations relevant to the “nationalization of the 
military and political neutrality” as set out by the Ministry of 
National Defense, and strictly prohibit all officers, soldiers, and 
civilian employees from participating in political party or political 
organization activities on or off work, or from campaigning for any 
election candidate.
(III) Use media channels
    Through media channels such as newspapers, broadcasts, 
celebrations, Ju Kuang TV Campus, and by utilizing opportunities 
such as various meetings, academic lectures, Ju Kuang 
education, lectures from commamding officers, the current 
mission and constitutional responsibilities are explained to  the 
servicemen.
(IV) Establish mutual trust and recognition
    Whenever there are domestic elections, all units are reminded 
to strictly adhere to relevant regulations according to “observation 
of constitutional regulations”, “defending political neutrality”, and 
items of relevant importance, to prevent election activities from 
entering units, barracks, or bases, so that there are no violations 
during elections.30
III. Demonstration of Results
    After many central and local elections, all servicemen have 
adhered to the strict positions of nationalization of the military and 
defending political neutrality, earning high degrees of trust from 
the people. In particular, because of the excellent performance  of 
the armed forces in recent years, the people have become more 
and more comfortable in entrusting the important responsibilities 
of national security and homeland defense to the armed forces, 
giving them the recognition and respect rightfully earned by the 
servicemen in their tireless diligence in the last decade.
   Specially, the th presidential and vice presidential election 
was completed smoothly on March  of 008. This election was 
closely watched by the international community, and our people 
demonstrated high degrees of democratic courtesy, writing down 
another page of democratric development for Taiwan. The armed 
forces also realized the mandate of “nationalization of the military” 
through their excellent enforcement of “political neutrality”. The 
results and performance of the armed forces in safeguarding  
constitution democracy and national security have earned admiration 
and recognition from the people and the international society.
IV . Future Vision
    To orderto carry out the mandate of “nationalization of the 
military”, the armed forces should observe the constitution and 
defend political neutrality. According to the laws, soldiers should 
ensure that troops are not affected by political interference 
or transitions of political parties, faithfully executing their 
constitutional responsibilities of defending the country and the 
people. Taiwan is now a modern nation characterized by both 
democracy and the rule of law. In order to protect the nation’s 
democratic achievements, the armed forces need to firmly execute 
their mandate of defending the Constitution, focus on combat 
training, ensure the well-being of the people, build effective 
deterrent capabilities, and fully achieve the constitutional mission 
of the armed forces. Because of the combined efforts of the armed 
forces and the people, Taiwan’s democratic progress and positive 
image have earned admiration from the international society. In 
order to cherish this hard-earned achievement, all servicemen will 
keep up the good work in the future to maintain the strict positions 
of “nationalization of the military” and “political neutrality”, and 3National Defense Report

Chapter 6 Military Strategy
    The American-Iraqi “Gulf War,” a critical milestone in the 
history of modern warfare, has initiated waves of “Revolution of 
Military Affairs” (RMA) in force planning measures among nations 
around the world with the intent to develop more efficient defense 
establishments and operations. The ROC armed forces have 
been recogniziog this trend and continuing related analyses and 
evaluations on issues such as global security status, security 
environment in the Asia-Pacific region, potential enemy threats, etc, 
based on the guidelines of “ Joint Operations” and incorporating the 
special requirements for defensive operations; we have decisively 
initiated a national defense transformation after considering the 
strategic environment, enemy threats, and defense resources, 
drawing up a comprehensive and extensive force planning and 
defense force programming plan to maximize the effectiveness 
of limited defense resources and build a defense force that is 
"streamlined, high-quality and powerful".
"streamlined, high-quality and powerful".
Section 1. 
Strategic Concepts
    Strategic Concepts is the result of strategic judgment of 
situations including political intention, military goals, and broad 
depiction of execution methodologies, which will serve as the basis 
for various defense planning measures.
    “Resolute Defense, Effective Deterrence” is the strategic 
guidance for the defensive operation of the ROC Armed Forces with 
the basic intent of proclaiming our nation as a peaceful nation. 
However, in the event of threats to the survival and development of 
our nation, we will have the capability and resolution to expend all 
available methods to impose maximum casualties to the invading 
forces to protect the lives and properties of our citizens and to 
ensure the sustainable development of our nation.  
35National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
THE REPUBLIC OF CHINATAIWAN
Chapter 6 Military Strategy “Effective Deterrence” relies on constructing a defensive force 
with deterrence capabilities, convincing the enemies to voluntarily 
abandon any attempts of military invasion because of considerations 
such as the uncertainties in victory or risk of suffering more losses 
than gains.
    “Resolute Defense” refers to the actions which the ROC Armed 
Forces take  when “Effective Deterrence” fails to stop the invading 
force from taking offensive operations, operated through rapid 
reserve mobilization mechanisms, converging overall national 
defense capabilities, and, under the physical and mental support 
from all of our people to repel the enemies, execute lethal 
counterstrikes against the enemies by air, sea, and land, with joint 
operation methods, to demonstrate the resoluteness of the ROC 
Armed forces in defending our homeland.
Section 2.
Force Planning
    Relevant force planning efforts primarily refers to building the 
required defense forces by anticipating possible war scenarios 
and other factors related to national security according to future 
strategic environments. Therefore, force planning efforts must 
simultaneously consider factors such as potential enemy threats, 
strategic guidance, technology developments, obtainable budgets 
and the defensive operation requirements, achieving integrated 
utilization of overall defense resources with planning and sequence, 
according to the guidance of joint operation philosophies and 
through disciplined analytical procedures and planning efforts, 
and obtaining new weapon systems that meet timeline and quality 
expectations, in order to build modern and high quality troops.
    Force planning at the current stage still requires simultaneous 
troop and force improvement work on software and hardware 
through facets such as high quality human resource, materiel 
readiness, joint operations, information and electronics warfare, 
reserve mobilization, psychological warfare, defense technologies, 
36force structures, and defense financing; and increase operational 
efficiency through all-encompassing, proactive, and continuous 
RMA efforts in fields such as personnel, intelligence, operations, 
training, logistics, communication, information and electronics, and 
equipments, to maintain the strength of defense organizations and 
defense forces.
I. Quality Manpower Planning
    The ROC has adopted a draft-and-enlist policy with emphasis on 
enlistees, in consideration of operational requirements of modern 
weapon systems, gradually decreasing numbers of draftees and 
continuous reductions in service periods, and in coordination 
with organization simplification and defense finance situations, to 
actively enhance the recruitment efforts while continuing to improve 
the quality of our defense personnel. Related planning frameworks 
are stated as follows,
() Endorsing the draft-and-enlist policy, with emphasis on enlistees 
and draftees as supplements. 
() Expanding recruitment channels and efforts, and continuing 
transformations in  manpower structure and quality. 
II. Armament Readiness Planning
    Focusing on the items and characteristics  of equipments 
needed for future defensive operations, we conducts analyses on 
factors such as existing technologies and research capabilities, 
potential acquisition methods, acquisition risk and total life 
cycle costs to draft optimized weapon system acquisition plans 
to effectively utilize related budgets, and meet the needs and 
missions of the ROC Armed Forces in time and with good quality, 
in accordance with military development frameworks and  force 
planning objectives. The armament readiness planning strategy 
involves three directions: “Weapon Acquisition Strategy”, “Logistics 
Readiness Strategy”, and “Technology Development Strategy” as its 
primary axis, while simultaneously conducting planning related to 
armament readiness. 
    Under the precondition of satisfying the combat operational 
requirements of the ROC Armed Forces’ weapons acquisition 
work through utilizing advanced management technologies and 
comprehensive acquisition management standards, weapon system 
acquisition strategy aims to obtain maximum benefits with reasonable

The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
cost under the shortest schedule.
    Logistics readiness strategy can be separated into “Strategic 
Logistics” and “Operational Logistics.” “Strategic logistics” 
accelerates the deployment schedule of new weapon systems and 
establish Integrated Logistics Support capacity for the total life 
cycle of the weapon systems through efforts such as integrating 
governmental and relevant private sector capacities, enhancing 
professional division of labor and management mechanisms, etc.; 
on the other hand, “Operational Logistics” satisfy the various 
logistics support requirements of combat troops through regional 
supply center, rapid mobile support and utilization of logistics 
resources in an integrated, swift and precise manner. 
    Technology development strategy focus on anticipating future 
combat operational requirement, integrating overall materiel 
resources, evaluating existing technological capabilities to 
draw a defense technology development blueprint to support 
combat readiness mission. Armament readiness-related planning 
frameworks are stated as follows:
() Conducting research and development based on the guidance 
of “Have it first, make it good, make it better”; making upgrades 
and production based on the guidance of “Establishing core 
capabilities, integrating existing capacities, strategic alliance, 
Division of labor”; conducting off-the-shelf purchase based 
on the guidance of “Domestic first and supplement by foreign 
procurement” and “ Joint development, cooperative production as 
priority and supplement by off-the-shelf acquisition”.
() Integrating armament resources, seeking partners, and drawing

Chapter 7 National Defense Organization
    Since March st, 00, our defense organization has went 
through reasonable adjustment based on the design of the “Two 
Defense Acts” and developed into a system with “civilian control 
of the military” and “defense uniformity” characteristics. The norm 
of “civilian control  of the military” puts the military under the 
supervision of public opinion, and ensures that the military belongs 
to the nation and the people; the norm of “defense uniformity” 
enables more smooth and efficient execution and operation of 
various defense affairs.
    Abiding by the Phase II plan of "the Jingjin Program", the MND 
continues to implement organization and staffing adjustments 
based on the principle of “Downsizing higher echelons, fortifying 
combat units” with the a 75,000-personnel force as total force 
strength. Current force structure consists of the Army, Navy, Air 
Force, Combined Logistics, Reserves, Military Police, Information 
and Electronic Warfare, and Missiles as the main defense combat 
forces.

Defense controls the nation’s defense affairs, and that the President 
is empowered to command the forces, and assigns duties to the 
Minister of National Defense, who orders the Chief of the General 
Staff to command the execution. According to Article  of the 
53National Defense Report

Section 2 
Civilian Control of the Military
I. Primary Content
55National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
    The highest level of leadership in democratic nations represents 
the will of the popular majority, with the assembled civilian 
government formulating all policies (including defense policy), 
and shouldering political responsibilities, and decisions need to 
align with public opinion, and be evaluated by public opinion, 
and, in a democratic nation, it is the electorate or the legislature 
representing popular will that has the authority to determine the 
retention of national leaders and policy directions, not the military. 
The military needs to observe the constitution, and execute policies 
from the civilian government, and the role it plays is a professional 
organization which provides defense policy recommendations 
in a timely manner, and dutifully executes formulated policies or 
executed decisions from the civilian government. In other words, 
the nature of “civilian control of the military” is that civilian leaders 
are responsible for formulating defense and military policies, and 
military staff members adopt military professionalism, obey civilian 
control, and refrain from political interference.
◎ The nature of “civilian control of the military” is that civilian leaders are responsible for 
formulating defense and military policies, and soldiers adopt military professionalism, obey 
civilian control, and refrain from political interference.56II. Legal Governance
    “Defense” is part of national administrative powers, and, to 
enforce the fundamental spirit of “civilian control of the military”, 
Article 36 of the Constitution of the Republic of China explicitly 
states that “The President shall have supreme command of the 
army, navy, and air force of the country”. Article 8 of the National 
Defense Act also designates the President as the commander-
in-chief of Armed Forces. They both confirms the President’
s command rights of the armed forces. While the President’s 
commander-in-chief authority allows for command of the armed 
forces, under Article 8 of the National Defense Act, the Minister of 
National Defense is directly responsible for executing the President’
s orders, while the Chief of the General Staff will be commanded by 
the Minister.
   Secondly, Article 0 of the National Defense Act stipulates that 
“The Executive Yuan is responsible for formulation of defense 
policies, consolidation of overall national power and supervision of 
its subordinate agencies to conduct relevant defense affairs.” Article 
 stipulates that “The MND is in charge of overall national defense 
affairs, shall well perform its policy, command, and armament 
functions. Besides, it shall submit suggestions in defense policies 
and formulates military strategies accordingly”. Article  stipulates 
that “The position of the Minister of National Defense is of civilian 
official nature, and he or she shall assume the authority over the 
overall national defense affairs”. Meanwhile, Article 3 stipulates 
that “The MND has under it the General Staff Headquarters (GSH), 
serving as the staff organization of command system, and command 
mechanism of joint operations to the Minister. The GSH is headed 
by the CGS, who is in charge of military affairs of command system, 
and assumes the authority to command the ROC Armed Forces 
under the order of the Minister”. Through the requirements outlined 
clearly by these articles, the Republic of China’s decision-making 
authority in defense affairs are designated to civilian leaders, 
with the professional military as the dutiful executors of defense 
policies.
III. Concrete Demonstration
    Democracy is the core value and interest of the Republic of 
China, and civilian control of the military is an important pillar 
in maintaining the democratic institution, and is the foundation 
57National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
in achieving democratic polity. Since the promulgation of the 
National Defense Act and the Organization Act of the Ministry of 
National Defense, this principle and operation mechanism had 
been implemented, moving the Republic of China towards a new 
era of military reforms and establishment of modernized defense 
institutions. Especially, between transitions of political parties, 
the armed forces have always kept to their responsibilities, strictly 
defending against any internal schisms, making “civilian control 
of the military” a tangible principle, which makes democratization 
more mature and solidified.

Section 4 
Force Structure
    Facing the continuous military expansions of the PRC, the 
ROC armed forces will continue its force structure adjustment 
based on the Phase II planning of the “ Jingjin Program” under the 
precondition of zero increase in defense spending, in order to 
defend national security, peace in society, and the well-being of 
the people; and, adhering to the principle of “Downsizing higher 
echelons, fortifying combat units”, we will continue our organization 
streamlining with an end strength target of 75,000 personnel. 
Current force structure calls for Army, Navy, Air Force, Combined 
Logistics, Reserves, Military Police, Information and Electronic 
Warfare, and missiles as the main combat forces for the defensive 
operation of ROC; our current mission, organization structure, and 
future prospects will be further discussed below:
I. Army
(I) Mission
    During peacetime, the Army safeguards key locations in Taiwan 
and various areas in its outer islets, and focuses on forming 
basic combat and contingency operation capabilities, executing 
contingency preparation missions, protecting critical bases, 
facilities and depots, and supporting anti-terrorism operations and 
major disaster relief efforts in their area of responsibility (AOR); in 
wartime, the Army will form a decision counseling group and serve 
as a component of the joint operations command center, providing

The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
recommendation on army warfare; simultaneously, the Army will 
establish the “Combined Coordination Center” to integrate land 
warfighting capabilities from all forces to support individual defense 
commands; each defense command and its subordinate units are 
under direct control of the “ Joint Operations Center” to conduct 
joint operations with naval and air combat units in defeating 
invading forces for the protection of our homeland.
(II) Organization (see figure 7-4)
    Army Command consists of individual departments, offices, 
and divisions within the command and subordinate units including 
Army Command, Defense Commands, Aviation and Special 
Forces Command, Education, Training and Doctrine Development 
Command, Maintenance Command, R.O.C. Military Academy, 
Special Service School, Army Academy, General Service Command, 
Assistant Education Center, Northern Regional Recruitment Center, 
etc.
(III) Vision
    “Defend the nation and protect our citizens” has always 
been the sacred mission of the Army. The Army is aggressively 
Figure 7-4    Organization of the Army64seeking long range, precision strike, highly effective weapon 
systems and continuing its push to become a “Digitized, Three-
Dimensional and Mechanized” modern Army with “Elite Manpower”, 
and enhancing its joint and special operations capabilities, 
so that the Army can become a modern fighting force capable 
of dealing with future warfare under any crisis or challenges 
and successfully execute the homeland defense mission.
1. Elevate proficiency, cultivate capabilities
    We aim to complete a comprehensive planning to satisfy 
our manpower needs in building a modern combat force, and 
in accordance with the principle of “Attract Talents, Cultivate 
Capabilities, Elevate Proficiency and Enhance Combat Readiness”, 
and establishing the idea that “people” is the most valuable military 
asset, which will effectively elevate our personnel proficiency and 
secure overall battlefield superiority in the future.
2. Modern force construction goals
(i) Digitized
     In order to build a network-centric and multi-path battlespace 
command and control systems, we plan to use the “Po Sheng 
Program” as the core to link the existing “IMSE” (Improved Mobile 
Subscriber Equipment) System, and implement preparation 
◎ “Defend the nation and protect our citizens” has always been the sacred mission of the Army
65National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
measures such as constructing a “Ground Force C4ISR System” 
and “Integrated Tactical Command and Control System” to enable 
“common picture” and “synchronous command and control” 
capabilities to different echelons on the battlefield. The goal is 
to achieve “early warning”, “agile situational awareness” and 
“dominance of the battlespace”.
(ii) Three-dimensional
    The Army plans to seize the vertical three-dimensional 
battlespace and combine the overall requirements of rapid force 
and firepower projection, surveillance and strike capabilities for 
future defensive operations by aggressively seeking the acquisition 
of new attack helicopters, utility helicopters and UAVs (Unmanned 
Aerial Vehicle) to greatly enhance the overall Air Land Battle 
operational capabilities and build the Army into an elite lethal force 
that is mobile, swift, and agile.
(iii) Mechanized 
     We will continue our efforts in obtaining armored infantry 
fighting vehicles and light or medium tactical wheeled vehicles to 
satisfy the needs for contingency and mobile strike operations, 
armored and mobile infantry brigades, and relevant support troops; 
planning also calls for the replacement of “New Main Battle Tank” 
and “ 55mm Self Propelled Howitzer” to establish “fast response, 
mobile strike and effective elimination” warfighting capabilities 
needed to accomplish ground defense missions.
3. Enhance joint operations training 
    Future battlefield environments call for “joint operations at all 
combat scenarios”, requiring Army combat readiness and training 
efforts such as organization, TO&E, force structure, military 
education, doctrine development, tactics and drills development, in 
hope that, during homeland defense operations, we can effectively 
integrate warfighting capabilities among all branches to enable 
“synchronous” operations.
4. Enhance special operation capability
    “Minute efforts with immense return on high value targets” is 
the nature of special operation, the key force in creating optimum 
scenarios for the final campaign and an effective deterrent 
against the enemy’s “Decapitation, Disintegration, and Paralysis” 
operations. The Army is developing its professional special 
operation force by vigorously studying special operation tactics 
and drills, purchasing special operation instruments and enhancing 
IKP selection and training channels to professionalize the Special 
66Forces troops; generic troops, meanwhile, will be empowered with 
counter special operations capabilities to act as force multipliers in 
future defensive operations.
5. Long range engagement, precision lethal strike
    To extend our depth of operations on the battlefield, we will 
continue to acquire weapon systems such as “short range air 
defense weapon system” and “multiple launch rockets”, and 
effective long range precision weapon systems required to connect 
with joint interceptions to strengthen land to air (mid-to-low 
altitudes), land to sea (near shore) striking capabilities, in hopes of 
attacking enemies in transit at sea and exterminate them during landing.
6. Comprehensive logistics, precision battlefront support
    We plan to integrate regional support capabilities, and provide 
comprehensive maintenance support on the battlefield and 
precision materiel supply chain management to set in place a 
competent logistics management, sufficiently utilize datalinks, 
conduct swift and effective battlefront support, and satisfy the 
needs of our troops.
7. All-out defense, total resolution
    The Army not only belongs to the people, it is also closely tied 
with the safety and security of our citizens and assets. Under the 
policy of “Streamlining Actives, Amass Reserves”, the Army will 
continue its organization adjustment and RMA (Revolution in Military 
Affairs) efforts, and, through measures such as concentrating the 
trust from the people, realization of the All-Out Defense vision, 
construct a total defensive force with full engagement and support 
from our fellow citizens on the All-Out Defense foundation of “all-
encompassment, popular participation, total defense, popular 
trust”.
II. Navy 
(I) Mission 
    During peacetime, the Navy will patrol the Taiwan Strait, maintain 
maritime security, strengthen force construction, refine readiness 
training, and provide appropriate support for major disaster relief 
efforts; in wartime, the Navy will act as a deterrent or counter 
enemy attempts of naval blockades or military invasions against 
Taiwan with allied forces to ensure national security by maintaining 
open waterway access to and from Taiwan’s sovereign waters.

missions.
2. Integrated logistics capacities
   We plan to integrate the readiness, support, control, and 
information management capacities of the logistics system, enforce 
internal operation, cross-branch communication and collaborations, 
and enhance the overall operational effectiveness of combined 
logistics.
3. Conserve logistics resources
    We plan to enhance the operation and capabilities of professional 
organizations, uniformly apply logistics resources to conserve 
logistics resources, and satisfy warfighting requirements.
4.Integrated logistics support (ILS)
    Based on the considerations of the overall logistics support, we 
will strive for adequate cooperation between the purchase, supply, 
maintenance, and final depot development of all equipments in 
order to enable equipments to be fielded on the same date as the 
Figure 7-7    Organization of the Combined Logistics Force74establishment of full logistics capacity and to fulfill the need for 
focused logistics in modern warfare.
5. Direct in place supply 
    Based on the directive of “regional support” and “joint supply”, 
we plan to use information technology and modern supply chain 
management principles to establish regional mixed storage 
facilities. Through information systems with proactive, rapid, and 
direct supply enable interchangeable use between materials and 
facilities among all forces.
6. Comply with future trends
    By incorporating possible future warfare scenarios, we will 
continue enhancing our logistics support mechanisms with an 
emphasis on streamlined acquisition procedures to maximize 
resource effectiveness, and also implement standardization, 
formalization and systemization of logistical operations to comply 
with global trends and future development trends.

Chapter 8 National Military Strength
    Under an asymmetric environment between ourselves and 
the enemy, integrating limited resources to implement the “all 
operations performed as joint operations” mode of combat to resist 
strong enemies has become a currently unavoidable trend, and 
currently the joint operation of the armed forces has entered the 
third stage – “closely coordinated joint operations”, and, in the 
future, the armed forces will use the joint operations command 
center as the framework, information and electronic advantages 
as the guidance, logistical operations as the foundation, reserve 
troops as support, and morale as sustenance, and C4ISR will be 
the battlefield intelligence sharing platform, linking main combat 
forces from the armed services, providing instantaneous digital 
intelligence and data, and, through integration of forces and 
firepower from the armed services and verification processes, 
experience can be gained, the determination and capabilities of 
the servicemen in defending their homeland can be demonstrated, 
and the mission of the armed forces to defeat enemies and secure 
victory can be completed.
Section 1
Yu Shan Wargame
I. Origin
    The "Yu Shan Exercise" is the national-level military contingency 
response exercise attended by the President himself, to verify 
the appropriateness of various plans from the Fu An Program 
from the National Security Council. The aforementioned programs 
and exercises are all held by the National Security Council, 
with assistance from the Ministry of National Defense, and 
joint participation from the Office of the President and relevant 
85National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
THE REPUBLIC OF CHINATAIWAN
Chapter 8 National Military Strength departments and divisions in the Executive Yuan. In recent years, 
the precision strike capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army has 
increased dramatically, sufficient to carry out intense ambush and 
decapitation attacks against Taiwan, therefore, in order to annihilate 
the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) strategic intention of 
“showdown on first engagement”, the ROC government not only 
needs to enhance its own armaments and warfighting capabilities, 
it also needs to establish sufficient military contingency response 
mechanisms, in hopes of preserving continued operation of 
governmental core capabilities even in the face of hostile military 
intimidations or attacks, and encourage public morale, integrate 
national resources, and steadfastly deal with PRC provocations. 
This is the project framework of the Fu An Program. The goal of 
the Fu An Program is to ensure the safety of military leaders during 
military emergencies, continuity of governmental core capabilities 
and operations, and protect key basic infrastructures.
II. Summary of the Wargame
    The Yu Shan Exercise is part of the Fu An Program, which is 
not only used to verify the appropriateness of the Fu An Program’
s planning, it also emphasizes on discovering problems from the 
exercise to serve as references for future Fu An Program planning. 
Since the first experimental Yu Shan ’05 Exercise held in 005, the 
Premier, officials from various departments and divisions, the Chief 
of the General Staff, and senior staff from various departments 
have all participated in the exercise; and between the Yu Hsan ’06 
Exercise, the Yu Shan ’07 Exercise, to this year’s ( 008) Yu Hsan ;08 
Exercise, not only did the President and the Vice President attend 
the event, participating personnel such as the Premier, officials 
from various departments and divisions, the Chief of the General 
Staff, and senior staff from various departments have all increased 
yearly, and exercise topics became gradually more complex, while 
the exercise framework became more difficult, which is an extreme 
challenge for the contingency response capabilities of political 
and military officials participating in the exercise. In particular, this 
year’s ( 008) Yu Shan ’08 Exercise kept to the exercise’s spirit of 
“striving for truth, striving for practicality, overcoming hardships, 
overcoming high standards”, and was separated into 3 stages of 
drill execution.
(I) The first stage consists of the exercise of the opening and 
deployment of the command center (including contingency 
86deployment). Main exercise items include: strategic early warning 
and warning level operations; stages of openings for national 
political and military centers and operational procedures conducted 
by various departments, protection for the safety of political and 
military leaders and procedures for emergency entry into command 
centers; instant response procedures for emergencies (standard 
procedures for the initiation of the National Security Council, 
simulated televised broadcasts from the President, simulations 
of the Premier holding emergency press conferences), mobile 
relocation procedures for command centers, etc.
(II) The second stage consists of defense drills for national key 
infrastructures. Main exercise topics include: integrated protection 
plans for various key national basic infrastructures; military, police, 
and naval patrol and warning operation for various key national 
basic infrastructures; network security protection for various key 
national basic infrastructures; firefighting, emergency repairs, and 
restoration operations for various key national basic infrastructures, 
etc.
(III) The third stage consists of political-military simulations. Main 
exercise topics include: emergency assessment, decision-making 
and planning, coordination between response measures, horizontal 
connections between various departments and divisions, etc.
III. Results
    The Fu An Program and Yu Hsan Wargame are important 
milestones for Taiwan’s defense infrastructures and military 
contingency response mechanisms, and also an example of all-
out defense, which is, furthermore, a demonstration of the ROC 
government’s determination for self defense. In particular, through 
years of diligence, the Fu An Program has achieved the following 
important results:
(I) Established military emergency monitoring and early warning 
procedures for the national level, in coordination with the opening 
of national political and military command centers, in hopes of 
achieving the targets of “regular monitoring, integrated intelligence 
and information, early warning, timely response”.
(II) Established integrated protection mechanisms for political 
and military leaders, providing personal safety assurance for the 
President, Vice President, Premier, and leaders of other important 
departments and divisions.
(III) Established operational doctrines for the command suite for 
87National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
National Defense Report
the national political and military command center, certain reserve 
command suites for the national political and military command 
center, and relevant command suites, which can provide various 
governmental departments and divisions with secure locations and 
joint command and control procedures for emergency response.
(IV) For preliminary integrated defensive capacity defense for 
national key basic infrastructures, we have completed inspections, 
assessments, and classification work for key basic national 
infrastructures across the country, focusing on completing 
integrated defense plans for high-priority targets.
    After 4 years of diligence and experience, the government has 
not only established formidable military emergency response 
experience and integration, it also acquired long-term progress, 
forming the deterring effects of “cannot be overcome, cannot be 
paralyzed”, which has very positive significance for maintaining 
peace and stability over the Taiwan Strait.
Section 2 
Joint Operation Effectiveness
I.Joint Operations Concept
    The vision of the ROC Armed Forces joint operations is to 
construct “long range and in-depth warfare” and “synchronized 
joint engagement” warfighting capabilities, aiming at satisfying 
the operational requirements of “origin deterrence, naval and air 
interceptions elimination by counter amphibious landing”. When 
the enemy exhibits apparent intentions or actions of hostility, our 
defensive actions will include effective integration of all military 
manpower and fire from services and positioned in multiple layers 
according to weapon systems ranges and capabilities, selecting 
targets of greatest strategic significance or greatest threats, 
gradually eliminate the enemy and eventually achieve our defense 
objectives. 
    Currently, the ROC Armed Forces have reached level three of 
88the five-level joint operations development plan, “tightly coordinated 
joint operations”. Future integration of the command and control 
(C) datalink system and the Jingjin Program will enable coordinated 
movements between services on the same spectrum. Reaching the 
level four “integrated joint operations” and subsequently advancement 
to level five “mutually dependent joint operations” will further 
consolidate the ROC Armed Forces' joint operations capability.
II.Joint Operations Command Mechanism
    To establish mechanisms that are consistent through peacetime 
and wartime, with appropriate jurisdiction and able to sufficiently 
utilize the effectiveness of joint operations, the ROC Armed Forces 
Joint Operations Command Center will execute direct control of 
all strategic executive levels and establish tight joint operational 
command networks (the diagram of the armed forces joint operation 
command hierarchy is shown in Figure 8- ). The result is a joint 
Figure  8-      Armed Forces Joint Operation 
Command Hierarchy89National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
operations mechanism with simplified 
force employment, flattened chain of 
command and precision command 
speed.  The success of the joint 
operations command mechanism 
operation depends on the links  
between command and control systems 
and the battlefield management  
systems. The Po-Sheng Program 
already advanced into the system 
implementation stage in 005. Upon 
the completion of the program, we 
will establish effective integration and 
communication between critical C4ISR 
system and weapon platforms providing 
real time battlefield intelligence and 
battlefield transparency for ease of 
battlefield management, enabling 
further perfections in joint operation 
command and control, thus benefiting 
the execution of joint operations.
III.Joint Operations Force  
Restructure
    In response to the PRC's continuous 
military expansions which threatens 
Taiwan's security, the ROC Armed 
Forces are actively restructuring the 
military organizational framework, 
promoting All-out defense and  
consolidating joint operations  
efficiency. Furthermore, the ROC Armed 
Forces will conduct force restructuring 
planning in accordance with the 
principles of “advanced technology 
taking the lead, information and 
electronic superiority, joint interdiction 
and homeland defense” and actively 
develop warfighting capabilities 
sufficient for deterring hostile forces.

network” to ensure air defense and security of the network” to ensure air defense and security of the 
Taiwan Strait90(I) Consolidate joint operations and 
develop joint efficiency  
    Force construction planning of 
the ROC Armed Forces focuses on 
integrating and utilizing joint operations 
warfighting capabilities of the individual 
services. We will capitalize on measures 
such as sustained operation of joint 
operations mechanism, establishment 
of joint forces, enhancements in joint 
operations training, amendments 
in joint operations doctrine and 
validation through exercises. Further 
efforts will be made to integrate joint 
operations command-and-control, 
C4ISR software and hardware to 
enhance battlefield management 
and harness the full potential of 
joint operations efficiency, in order 
to respond to the PRC's strategy of 
“ winning a campaign in a remote 
area quickly, and winning the first 
campaign decisively” against Taiwan.
(II) Joint surveillance and enhanced 
battlefield command and control  
    After completion of the Po-Sheng 
Program, we will integrate battlefield 
intelligence from early warning aircraft, 
missiles, radars and warships forming 
tight joint surveillance and battlefield 
management platforms through  
the multi-layered communication 
network of the armed forces with 
common battlefield picture. This will 
enhance transparency in Taiwan’
s naval and air combat zones and 
its surrounding waters, ensuring 
security of our waterways and air

the high efficiency and survivability in the command  
and control function of the “joint operations command 
mechanism” and thus benefit the execution of joint operations.
(III) Fortify joint protection to ensure infrastructure 
    The purpose in preserving our joint warfighting and counter 
special operations capabilities is to continue strengthening the 
security and protection of our critical political, economical and 
military infrastructures. Numerous “Han Kuang Exercises” have 
validated that individual area command has completed contingency 
response measures for the protection of critical infrastructures 
and effectively engage in counter special operations against the 
enemy. Moreover, detailed protection measures have been devised 
to protect critical nodes of the protective targets within individual 
area of responsibilities. To ensure comprehensive operational 
capabilities, individual area commands have designated effective 
contingency forces according to types of enemy threats, nature 
of protection targets and mobility requirements. For example, 
airports and navy piers will be support patrols by mechanized 
armored troops, while the Army aviation and special forces will 
be stationed in the high mountains to counter enemy special 
operations. The armed forces will also monitor the precise timing 
and frequency of the PRC's satellite activities above Taiwan and 
the outer islets in peacetime and possible actions that may be 
taken by the PRC in wartime. By efforts such as “camouflage”, 
“relocation”, “cover, concealment”, “mobilization”, “operational 
redeployment” and utilization of civilian hardened facilities, 
we are capable of fortifying the security of our infrastructures.
◎ Current joint training and exercise topics all deals with 
existing enemy tactics and drills to enhance overall 
joint operation capabilities◎ Refine mobile air operation training to rapidly project 
long-range force for effective surprise attacks to 
counter enemies and win wars
9(IV) Long-range precision strikes and destruction of the enemies' 
core capabilities 
    The construction of the deterrence capability of the ROC Armed 
Forces is aimed at weakening the enemies' combat capacity and 
stagnating or repelling enemy offensives. In the future, under 
the command of the Joint Operation Command Center, long-
rang suppression capability integrated with air, information and 
electronic warfare functions will allow precision strikes, destruction, 
sabotage, paralysis and exhaustion on the first-wave of enemy 
offensive against Taiwan. Simultaneously, it will also ensure the 
mobility of the ROC Armed Forces, enabling the selection of 
enemy targets with the greatest threat and gradually eliminating 
the invading force through synergy of joint operation capability 
and effective integration of weapons systems, thus achieving the 
strategic goal of “deterring from the origin”.
(V) Joint multi-layered interceptions for air defense 
    The PLA's guided missiles are the greatest threats to Taiwan's 
air defense, so the ROC Armed Forces is actively participating 
in developing low-altitude missile defense system. After the 
completion of the networked command, control, surveillance 
and reconnaissance system for joint anti-missile engagement 
capabilities, it will possess active “critical area defense” functions. 
Under the operational control of the Joint Operation Command 
Center, the current PAC-  air defense missiles will be utilized 
in coordination with the planned purchase of PAC-3 air defense 
missiles to form a tight low-altitude  missile defense system. Also 
employed is the air force's beyond line-of-sight strike fire and 
the anti-aircraft capability of the naval fleets to establish a multi-
layered air defense interception network. Through this multilayered 
interception capabilities, we will be able to protect our overall 
capability and ensuring security in Taiwan's naval and air space.
(VI) Joint counter-blockades to maintain maritime freedom
    Navy's warfighting capability developments focus on “missile-
oriented ship weaponry, automated command and control and 
three dimensional anti-submarine operations”. After the final 
incorporation of the Keelung class vessels into the navy, the 
command and control efficiency of the Maritime Joint Operations 
Command Center will be improved tremendously by simultaneously 
extending the operational radius of the southern, northern and 
eastern naval and air spaces. If diesel-electric submarines and P-3C 
long-range fixed wing anti-submarine warfare aircraft are acquired 
93National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
as planned and 
included in the order of battle, they can greatly enhance our anti-
submarine capability and also enabling air operations control, 
naval surface strikes and rapid mine deployment functions. We will 
also integrate naval surface combat fleets, submarines, auxiliary 
warships and air and coastal firepower to secure and maintain safe 
maritime routes and carry out joint naval/air escort operations to 
effectively counter enemy blockade maneuvers and ensure our free 
access to international waters.
(VII) Elimination of enemy amphibious landing forces through joint 
fire  
    Littoral area is the decisive battlefield for the Army. We will 
acquire multiple mobile launch rockets to be employed in coastal 
areas, complemented with army aviation to extend the land-
based counter-naval operation capabilities. With enhancements to 
the Army's joint operations command and control platform within 
individual area commands, the joint warfighting capability will 
improve considerably in terms of debarkation strikes and shoreline 
elimination assaults. Each area command can effectively combine 
naval and air operations, control army aviation attack helicopters 
and land-based precision firepower to rapidly assemble joint fires 
to employ in littoral and coastal areas. This will inflict devastated 
effects on the enemies trying to come ashore and ensure victory of 
the final decisive battle.
IV . Joint Training and Exercise
    Based on the strategic concept of “Effective Deterrence, Resolute 
◎ Integrate logistics forces of all military branches and enhance 
equipments, weapon systems and ammunitions readiness to 
satisfy the needs of troops in peacetime and wartime
◎ Strengthen effectiveness of military fuel pipeline 
transportation and supply to lower the management 
burden of fuel pipelines94Defense” and adapting to the changes in the Asia Pacific region, 
military threats and invasion models from the PRC, the overall 
defensive operations training and exercises of the ROC Armed 
Forces has evolved from segmented, individual force exercise to the 
joint operations model in the past few years. Reviewing executions 
of the annual Han Kuang Exercise and various joint operations 
exercises validated that we have entered the joint operations level. 
We continuously examine the effectiveness of the exercises and 
trainings based on the individual goals and push for continuous 
improvements with the expectation to counter any invading forces 
and winning the first war.
(I) Training and exercise goals
    The current warfighting and training trends of the ROC 
Armed Forces toward “joint operations at all combat and 
training scenarios” demands an encompassing refinement to the 
effectiveness of our joint operations. Joint operations of combat 
forces are the focus for every major training exercise. Through 
modeling of all possible invading models, the design of different 
combat scenarios provides training on the following topics: Validate 
current joint operation integration capabilities; inspect feasibility 
and suitability of current joint defense planning. Cultivate and 
elevate joint operations capabilities of staffs at the all level; testing 
joint operations command and control operational efficiencies; 
nurture transition between peacetime and war time and the abilities 
in dealing with contingency situations. Solidify joint logistics supply 
and reorganization efficiencies and focus on various key training 
topics in defensive operations. These topics will facilitate the ROC 
Armed Forces in continue enhancing joint operations training and 
◎ Implement ammunition depot management, refurbish storage 
facilities, and reduce management burden for the forces to 
ensure the safety of ammunition depot and its operations
◎ Actualize the objective of integrating defense industry with 
the private sector to continue execution of commercial 
maintenance for military equipments95National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
joint engagement efficiencies.
(II) Joint training and exercise results
    Current joint training and exercise topics all deals with existing 
enemy tactics and drills. During the past year, under the planning 
of the annual training orders, we have conducted various joint 
operations training exercises in surrounding waterways, air 
space and land-based training grounds. Through evaluation and 
validation of multiple joint and combined arms exercises of troops 
at various echelons, we have gradually acquired various previous 
parameters from experience. By continuing the RMA (Revolution in 
Military Affairs) efforts, the ROC Armed forces expect to continue 
repeatedly validating and revising joint operations doctrines 
through future training exercise opportunities with an aim to elevate 
the joint operation levels of our staffs and enhance our overall joint 
operation capabilities.
(III) Future direction
    The RMA (Revolution in Military Affairs) efforts have gradually 
transformed the ROC Armed Forces into a joint operation force that 
is elite, compact and robust. Facing the imminent threats from the 
PLA and the need to implement the “effective deterrence, resolute 
defense” strategic concept, the ROC Armed Forces will creatively 
design and plan joint training exercise models suitable for different 
operational echelons based on the strategic geographic features 
of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu while dealing with the post-
“ Jingjin Program” force structure. Through steps of realizing 
basic training, enhancing combine operations and validating joint 
operations and the steadfast attitudes of “precision, deliberate, 
robust and challenging”, we plan to enhance the overall joint 
operations training and exercise on a gradual and step-by-step 
pace. We expect to elevate the overall combat capabilities of 
our armed forces by achieving the operational goal of replacing 
quantity with quality to ensure the prosperity of our society and the 
security of our nation.
V . Logistics Operations
    Logistics is the source of all warfighting capabilities.  In order 
to construct a precise, swift and effective logistic management 
mechanism based on the foundation of “joint logistics” system with 
clearly defined logistics responsibilities, the Combined Logistics 
Command has been assigned the responsibilities of generic 
service support while individual military forces are delegated for 
96maintenance support of proprietary equipments.  The ROC Armed 
Forces will continue perfecting regional supply and maintenance 
operations; integrate repair capacities and elevate “Armed Forces 
Engagement Logistics Management System” to effectively exercise 
logistics support and strengthening its command, management and 
decision support functions to achieve the goal of joint operations 
support.
(I) Logistics policy

goal is to provide swift support to combat, training and exercise 
missions and improving transportation for military personnel during 
official missions or vacations.  This will satisfy the needs of our 
troops, enhance service quality and enable the swift flow of military 
transportation.
9. Strengthen facility renovation operations, execute policy for 
reduction in water and power consumption
    We will control the execution status on construction and 
engineering projects of regional scales, requesting detail work 
plans prior to the beginning of the fiscal year while maintaining 
control of the contract awards.  The goal is to complete the work 
allocation before the end of April after the beginning of the fiscal 
year.  To comply with the government energy saving policy, we 
demand our subordinate units to implement related energy saving 
control measures for timely cost savings.
10. Enhance logistics information efficiencies, provide precise 
decision making support
     Continue enhancing “Military Engagement Logistics Management 
System” capabilities to achieve the Integrated Logistics Support 
goal of “real time awareness of operational requirement, real time 
viewing of logistics resources and real time control of logistics

and authorization mechanisms. Accompany the completion of 
various databases, information systems and the revision of repair 
and supply manuals, all force commands should also construct 
spare parts management mechanism to enhance precision and 
accuracy in spare parts preparation and properly utilize the annual 
maintenance budget.
(ii) In FY 007, the MND advocates all subordinate units to initiate 
small purchase contracts with large, discount wholesale stores 
and successful expand the number of contractors from 5 to 6 .   
Pursuing to the necessities of our troops, we also expanded open 
purchase items from 4 ,035 to 69,880. We expect the utilization of 
the commercial sales channels will shorten the supply schedule, 
lowering storage burden and swiftly integrate with the need of our 
troops.
00(iii) We terminated 6 Km of low efficiency oil pipelines and 
consolidated 60 military gas stations in various regions after 
assessment. We also distributed around 9,000 gas cards to all 
military branches to enhance the fuel supply efficiencies.
(iv) Enhance ammunition depot safety management measures by 
conducting comprehensive ammunition inventory, storage rotation 
and pile reshuffling. Improve storage environmental control, 
policing, monitoring and fire prevention, protection and suppression 
measures. Conduct routine ammunition evaluation and justification 
on an annual basis to decrease deterioration in ammunition 
quality. Conduct planned disposition of defective or unserviceable 
ammunition.
3. Maintenance readiness
(i) Commercial maintenance of military aircrafts
   Since 00, Army, Navy and Air Force have been planning 5 
projects to gradually release their systems for fleet, whole plane 
and system level commercial maintenance. We completed contract 
signing for commercial maintenance of sixteen types of military 
aircrafts in twelve cases. We will evaluate the gradual release 
of three AT -3 model aircrafts for commercial maintenance after 
considering factors such as annual budgets, commercialization 
benefits, source selection and maintaining professional capacity 
within individual military branches in the future.
(ii) Commercial maintenance of military vessels
    The MND completed Cheng Kung class frigate, Ching Chiang 
class patrol boat and LCM craft maintenance projects in 005 
and Ching Chiang class patrol boat depot level maintenance in 
007. In the meantime, we will continue our efforts in military

commercial maintenance of various support and combat vessels 
based on our maintenance capacity and the intention of commercial 
shipyards, maintenance budget and execution methodologies.
(iii) Commercial maintenance of land based equipments 
   Starting from 008, we will focus on the commercial maintenance 
of “non-sensitive”, “non-readiness-urgent” land based equipments 
with special emphasis on items that are “high failure rate”, “high 
value”, “long repair cycle” with no organic repair capacities, not 
cost effective and low ROI (Return on Investment). 
4.Transportation readiness
(i) Referencing regulations from the Motor Vehicle Supervision 
Office, Ministry of Transportation and Communication, we revised 
0National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
the “Regulations Governing Military Vehicle Registration and 
License Application” in August 5, 006 and updated the vehicle 
registration cycle from five years to three. We also conducted a 
comprehensive military vehicle registration check to enhance the 
management oversight. 
(ii) To expedite foreign business travel arrangements for military 
personnel, the MND simplified related procurement procedures and 
delegated the Combined Logistics Command to conduct centralized 
procurement planning for government rate airline tickets through 
“Inter-entity Supply Contract”. The Combined Logistics Command 
completed the procurement process in April 8, 006 enabling all 
defense organizations to conduct airline ticket procurement through 
the “Inter-entity Supply Contract”.
5. Facilities readiness
(i) Military facility maintenance funding should be budgeted 
according to “Defense Budget Itemized List” and funded through 
related budget items based on the nature and function of the 
facilities. All units should adopt proper control measures and 
mechanisms to ensure the completion of the contracts before the 
end of the fiscal year and execute in a timely and quality manner. 
(ii) Abiding by the energy saving policy of the Executive Yuan, the 
MND is fully devoted to the saving of water resources. Over 80% 
of all subordinate units have replaced with water efficient utilities, 
effectively reduced related budget expenditure. 
6. Logistics information
(i) The MND will refine the “Military Engagement Logistics 
Management System” to provide real time battlefront control and 
ensure our fighting capabilities. Through online real time feedback, 
combat forces will be able to report demands for maintenance, 
spare parts, supplies, fuels and ammunitions…etc., hence 
strengthening the real time decision analysis capabilities for the 
commanders. Logistics forces can also effectively predict wartime 
and peacetime demands and thus able to provide active battlefront 
support operations.
(ii) When conducting equipment maintenance and inventory 
operations, all MND units shall assess proper equipments and 
provisions available for supporting disaster relief operations based 
on their individual missions and capabilities. Through “Military 
Relief Resource Management System”, all MND units should 
complete entering disaster relief resource data to provide real time 
status of disaster relief resources and use as a critical reference 
0when supporting disaster relief missions.
(III) Future direction
   Applying modern business administration concepts and theory, 
the ROC Armed Forces will establish a modern logistics operation 
based on refined logistics management system with clearly defined 
logistics responsibilities between “force construction” and “combat

Section 3.  
Operational System Integration
    In recent years, the PLA has been aggressively accelerating its 
force transformation efforts needed for twenty-first century joint 
operations and constructing its information, command and control, 
and electronics warfare capabilities. The PLA expects to achieve 
“information and electronics superiority” through measures such 
as “comprehensive surveillance and reconnaissance for situation 
awareness”, “network attack for psychological terror”, “precision 
strike and physical destruction” and “electromagnetic interference 
to paralyze command and control”.  The PLA also expects such 
measures will elevate the effectiveness for “acupuncture”, 
◎ Taiwan implements All-out defense mobilization to 
unleash the power of our people and fight for victory of 
defensive operations◎ On-site call-up and on-site mobilization to complete immediate 
combat training and engage in homeland security defense
04
“decapitation strike” operations to paralyze our warfighting 
capabilities.
    The overall information and electronics development and 
planning for the ROC Armed Forces are based on the strategic 
guidance of “effective deterrence, resolute defense” and 
joint operations requirements. Following the major policies of 
“technology advancement, information and electronics superiority” 
force construction concept and adopting the following major 
policies, “C4ISR System”, “Strengthening defense information 
infrastructure”, “ensure defense information security”, “construct 
information and electronics warfare capacities”, “strengthening 
communication and information network utilization effectiveness” 
and “implementing digitization of defense matters”, the goal is to 
construct communication, information and electronics warfighting 
capabilities of the ROC Armed Forces aiming for “information and 
electronics superiority”, “solid national defense” and “preemptive 
strike”.
    Facing the constant military threats from the PLA, the ROC 
Armed Forces should plan for related counter measures based on 
existing capabilities in peacetime.  In the meantime, following the 
construction of the “Po Sheng” program to enhance joint operations 
command and control efficiencies, we will integrate national and 
commercial technology resources to construct a network-centric 
warfare capability based on existing C4ISR infrastructures in the 
future.  Through realizing superiority in information and electronics, 
precision engagement and full spectrum protection network centric 
warfare capabilities, we will be able to conduct preemptive strike 
and stand on the ground for victory.  Related measures are stated 
as follow:
I. Endeavour in “Information and Electronic Superiority” for 
Taiwan and Penghu Defensive Operations
    The ROC Armed Forces communication and information and 
electronics warfare application concept should base on the strategic 
guidance of “effective deterrence, resolute defense, joint interdicion 
and homeland defense”.  We will draft related counter measures to 
ensure “information and electronics superiority” in future Taiwan, 
Penghu defensive operations after considering changes in enemy 
threats, PLA information and electronics measures toward Taiwan in 
peacetime and communication, information and electronics tactics 
that the PLA will probably employ during various stages of military 
invasion.05National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
    To effectively realize new generation of joint warfighting 
capabilities, the ROC Armed Forces is currently planning to deploy 
linkage between C4ISR Systems and individual service automatic 
data links to interconnect major command and control systems 
and weapon system platforms.  This will enable all combat units to 
conduct real time, synchronous battlefield intelligence interchange 
to increase battlefield transparencies and construct a “visible, 
audible and commendable” real time decision support system, 
enhancing battlefield monitoring, control and decision management 
effectiveness to fully exercise the benefits of joint operations.
II. Fortify Command Mechanism for Joint Operations 
Command-and-control Effectiveness
    To complement command contingency response mechanism and 
excel the joint operations command and control effectiveness of 
individual strategic command organizations, the ROC Armed Forces 
procured the “Po Sheng Program” based on joint operations mission 
requirements.  Since the project initiation in 004, we gradually 
construct and strengthen tri-services joint operations command-
and-control functions. At the current system implementation stage, 
we adopted current fielded and matured U.S. military “tactical 
data link” to integrate major sensors and weapon system platform 
across all forces.  At the end of the implementation, we’ll be able 
to effectively integrate all combat forces, provide real-time joint 
operations intelligence and information, strengthen battlefield 
management and unleash the effectiveness of joint operations.
III. Construct Armed Forces “Network Centric Warfare” 
Capabilities
    “Network-centric warfare” is undoubtedly the form of the st 
century. Complying with the defensive operation requirements, 
the ROC Armed Forces will consider enemy threats, development 
trends in information technology, mil-spec software development 
cost and future commercial off-the-shelf information technology to 
gradually replace mil-spec information technologies.  We will also 
integrate national and civilian technology resources to plan and 
build up Network-centric Warfare (NCW) based on existing C4ISR 
capabilities.  Key developments include “integrate joint operations 
command and control platforms”, “ensure joint operations 
command-and-control communications”, “strengthen information 
and electronics security protection”, “information and electronics 06
National Defense Report
offensive and defensive capabilities buildup” and “increase 
complexity in electromagnetic environment training”. The goal is to 
construct information and electronics warfighting capabilities with 
“leading basic infrastructure”, “advanced information command 
and control systems”, “flexible information and electronic warfare 
capa¬bilities”, “assuring information and electronics security” and 
“integrated information and electronics environment” to effectively 
support the execution of defensive operation missions.
    To effectively deal with threats from the PLA and to strengthen 
joint operations efficiencies, the ROC Armed Forces will develop 
toward the goal of “integrated warfighting capabilities, collaborative 
sharing of intelligence and information” with supporting “joint 
operation command mechanism” as the core. We will also endeavor 
in strengthening information and electronics warfare capacities, 
integrating armed forces communication, information and 
electronics network, continue enhancing C4ISR system integration 
by applying advanced technical data link systems to interconnect 
major sensors, new generation weapon system platforms and 
critical command and control mechanisms.  The goal is to construct 
and strengthening “network-centric warfare” capability, information 
and electronics defensive operation capability to effectively 
control “information and electronics superiority” across the Taiwan 
Strait, unify overall war fighting capabilities and serve as “force 
multiplier”.
Section 4. 
Reserves Mobilization Capacity
    Based on the concept of All-Out Defense while considering the 
need for defense and economic development, the fundamental 
mobilization preparation policy for the ROC is to “include 
mobilization in governing while nurturing combat readiness in 
economics development” aiming to conserve warfighting potentials. 
In war time, we will implement all-out defense mobilization to 
unleash the power of our people and fight for the victory of the 07National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
defensive operation.
    Under the guidance of the national mobilization preparation 
fundamental policy, the reserves mobilization preparation policy 
of the ROC Armed Forces must fully consider factors such as the 
possible invasion model of the PLA, defense force planning policy, 
defensive operation strategic concept, geographical characteristics 
of the Taiwan island, national resources, financial capabilities and 
our force structure…etc. Major contents are as follow:
(I) Preparation concept
    “Nurture combat capabilities among citizens in peace time, 
employ for military operations in war” and liberate the fighting will 
of protecting the “homeland, family and properties”. 
(II)Preparation goal:
    On site mobilization, on site combat engagement; timely 
mobilization, timely operations. 
(III) Preparation forecast
    Under the overall architecture of “all-out defense mobilization 
preparation”, put emphasis on military mobilization supported by 
all out defense to construct an open, ready defensive mobilization 
mechanism. Systematically organize and utilize our national 
resources to swiftly fulfill reserves warfighting capabilities, enabling 
supporting defensive operations requirements in war time and 
disaster relief operations in peace time. 
(IV) Preparation guidance
    Composed mainly of the ground force reserves and utilize area 
command as core, we hope to unify the military and civilian power 
through the “All-out Defense Combined Negotiation Task Force” 
and apply the unified force into combat. With the support from the 
administrative mobilization, we can fully utilize the total civilian 
manpower and resources to ensure continuity in military operations 
and exercise the concept of an all-out defense.
I. Manpower Mobilization Capacity
    Based on Article 7 of the “Act of Military Service System”, 
the MND supervised over .9 millions of reserves personnel. 
Additionally, based on Article 4 to 33 of the “The Enforcement Rule 
Of Military Service System Act”, the MND drafted the mobilization 
selection criteria policy for Armed Forces personnel and selected 
physically capable personnel within the over 900,000 physically fit 
people retired from the armed forces within the last eight years as 
the reserves. The rest will be call for temporary enlist duty based on 08article 6 of the “The Enforcement Rule of Military Service System 
Act”.
   Based on the force construction guidance “fight, equip, organize 
and train”, the ROC Armed Forces renewed and revised the TO&E 
(Table of Organization and Equipments) and adjust the reserves 
organization structure to enable the overall warfighting capabilities 
of the reserves force more compliant with the warfighting 
requirements and forming a more tightly integrated security defense 
system with the standing forces. The structure adjustment of the 
reserve forces are stated as follow,
(I) Ground force reserves 
1. Ground combat troops 
Mission: conduct homeland defense for coastal areas, urban, 
depth and critical targets protection. 
Organization: organize into multiple reserves brigades, battalions 
and companies. 
2. Combat support troops

(IV) Military assisting duty corps 
Mission: conduct military assisting duty support operations in 
wartime or contingencies. 
Organization: divided into organic and regional military assisting 
duty corps based on the nature of the service, organized as team 
or independent regional group. 
1. Organic military assisting duty corps
    Maneuver with the service unit to provide military services 
such as airport, sea port, depot repair, post construction, materiel 
transportation and cemetery services. 
2. Regional military assisting duty corps
    Assign regional specific mission, conduct generic bridge 
repair, road maintenance and materiel packaging, unload and 
transportation services based on the needs of the transitory or 
strike forces. 
◎ Material mobilization is one of the critical parts to achieve 
full combat readiness, fully utilizes potential civilian 
mobilization capacities to support combat operations◎ Coordinate requisition and execution agencies to complete 
various military transportation mobilization preparation 
tasks according to defense operation needs
0II. Material Mobilization Capacity
    Current stage of all-out defense operations relies on the 
fulfillment of reserves mobilization by achieving the goal of full 
combat readiness to ensure the protection of our homeland. In 
particular, material mobilization is one of the critical parts to 
achieve full combat readiness and relies heavily on the entirety 
of the administrative mobilization system. Based on the “All-out 
Defense Mobilization Preparation Act”, its related regulations and 
the “All-out Defense Mobilization Preparation Directives”, the MND 
has drafted mobilization preparation plan and related sub-plans in 
different categories.
(I) Military supplies materiel mobilization 
    To fully utilize mobilization capacities concealed in the society, 
the MND has completed surveys and statistics of multiple critical 
materials and fixed facilities based on the “Enforcement rules for 
materials investigation” and related regulations with the support 
from the administrative mobilization. We have selected and stored 
suitable quantities of ten types, 66 categories and 33  items 
of various critical materials such as “rational”, “minerals and 
basic metals”, “machineries”, “fuel”, “chemicals”, “construction 
materials”, “transportation vehicles, communication equipments”, 
“medical supplies”, “fibers, leathers, rubbers, cottons, wools” and 
“others”. We also orchestrated various schools, public facilities, 
medical facilities, warehouses, container terminals and other fixed 
locations to assist troops support operations.
(II) Military transportation mobilization
    Based on defensive operation requirements, standing troops 
emphasized in tactical mobility while reserves emphasized in fulfill 
equipment needs. Planned mobilization of needed vehicles should 
individually mobilize for the driver and the vehicle; emergency 
mobilization of the needed vehicles should simultaneously mobilize 
both the driver and the vehicle. Heavy machineries, vessels and 
aircrafts should simultaneously mobilize the vehicle and personnel 
as well; the aforementioned requirements will go through detailed 
survey, organization and management conducted with advance 
notification of both supply and demand. Routine requisition drills 
should be conducted using wartime budgeting procedure and 
collaborate with requisition organization to complete various 
military transportation mobilization preparation tasks.
(III) Military supplies industry mobilization 
   Based on Article 7 of the “All-out Defense Mobilization 
National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
National Defense Report
Preparation Act” and the “Implementing Regulation on Production 
Switching Practice for Defense Industry”, the MND conducted 
surveys on the variation in fundamental information for machineries, 
storage capacities, technicians, raw materials and production 
capacities in mobilization factories. This will facilitate the 
mobilization production transformation efforts to manufacture items 
for military needs and establish operation regulations to assist 
various mobilization production preparations. 
. Place emphasis on items with domestic production and repair 
capacities when constructing the mobilization manufacturing system 
and focus on the production and maintenance items for weapon 
system and equipment assemblies or subassemblies. Select 
factories with close proximity to cities or military plants and with 
previous military production experience as the prefer mobilization 
factories. 
. By referencing detailed surveys, selection and organization, 
the MND will apply for technicians; prepare production blueprints, 
raw materials, machineries and tool sets. With schedule 
mobilization production drills using wartime budgeting procedures 
and collaborate with local government to supervise assigned 
mobilization plants, we will be prepared for military supplies 
industry mobilization readiness and satisfy the continuous 
operational requirements of individual forces .
Section 5
Boost Intangible Combat Power
    Intangible Combat Power” is a critical factor for victory in war 
and a glorious legacy of the ROC armed forces to triumph over 
strong enemies. Based on Article 5 of the “Military doctrine and 
combat provisions”, “Intangible combat power” includes the three 
elements of “ideology”, “military ethics” and “military skills”. 
Simply stated, “Moral Combat Power” is a combination of faith, 
comradeship, combat will, drills, physical training and courage 
elevated into an internal strength, and a critical element of combat 
power and a joint demonstration of our intangible warfighting 
capabilities.
I. Education Goal
    The fundamental objective of current ROC defense policy is “war 
prevention, homeland defense, counter-terrorism and contingency 
response”. To effectively achieve the above objectives and execute 
the strategic concept of “effective deterrence, resolute defense”, 
the construction of “Intangible Combat Power” must emphasize 
on education and training in “consolidate and morale education”, 
“integration of force training and exercise”, “counter Three warfare 
from the PLA” and “practice morale mobilization”. Pursuing to the 
push for “RMA (Revolution in Military Affairs)” and the guidance of 
“All-Out Defense Policy”, we will continue strengthening the quality 
of our troops, nurturing loyalty, striving for citizen consensus, 
enhancing overall Warfighting capabilities to deter any intent of 
invasion from the PLA to achieve the goal of “war prevention”.
II. Objective Measures and Results
    The morale combat power of the ROC armed forces must abide 
by the constraints within Constitution and the “National Defense 
Act” and the consideration of enemy threats and force construction 
needs; we must promote the overall planning and elevate the morale 
combat power through multiple channels of education, training and 
communication. Objective measures include the following:
(I) Enhance morale education
1. Implement Ju-Kuang campus education
    The Ju-Kuang Campus patriotic education program has a long 
history in the ROC Armed Forces providing resounding effects 
on cultivating the loyalty among military personnel. Contents of 
the current Ju-Kuang Campus education program focused on 
“nurturing loyalty, patriotism and establish cohesiveness among 
troops”, “abiding the Constitution and solidify military ethics” 
and “highlighting major political and economical achievements, 
consolidate common belief and consensus among military 
personnel”. We contracted Chinese Television System (CTS) to 
produce 70 minutes of program in two stages with the first half 
been a policy educational program, while the second half is more 
of a sentimental nature to provide education through entertainment. 
The program is broadcast to all military personnel every Friday

afternoon. Based on the mission, 
characteristics of the troops and the 
actual requirements, generic troops 
will have 00 minutes of education 
per week, troops in training center 
or special mission will have 0 
minutes per week and higher echelon 
organizations will have 00 minutes 
per week.
2. Festivity planning
    On major national holidays, in 
addition to inviting scholars and 
experts for lectures on specific 
topics, the MND will integrate with 
all out defense education topics 
and collaborate with other related 
ministries and local governments to 
conduct activities such as “military 
exercise and exhibition”, “force 
demonstration” or “military/civilian 
joint evening show” to motivate 
morale among our citizens and to 
increase the harmony relationship 
between the military and the civilians. 
With the arrival of the Armed Forces 
Day on September 3rd, the MND will 
select and celebrate elite Armed 
Forces personnel and organizations 
to exhibit role models to encourage 
overall advancements.
3. Drafting educational topics
    Based on guidance of the  
“Constitution” and “National Defense 
Act”, the morale education of the 
ROC Armed Forces stands firm on the 
principles of “a nationalized military” 
and “neutral administration”. Focusing 
on defense policy requirements, 
we assessed troop missions  
and activities; collaborate with    
government to provide information

Supplement by spontaneous education opportunities, we also invite 
experts and scholars to conduct seminars and papers on a monthly 
basis. Utilizing individual political warfare units within the armed 
forces, or distributed through web, these facilitations provide 
guidance to commanders at all levels the ability to communicate 
with troops in a timely manner and forming the concepts of 
“homeland defense” and “law abiding”.
(II) Integrate with force training & exercise
1. Training and exercise specific education
    To strengthen moral mobilization capacities among our fellow 
military personnel, preventing lack of coherence due to reduction 
in service time and downsizing in organization, the MND enhanced 
communiqués directives in both peacetime and war by drafting 
news letter and utilize additional campaigning efforts. Additionally, 
since 005, we conducted “Intangible Combat Power week” special 
education program prior to the annual “Han Kuang Exercise” on 
specific topics such as “loyalty education”, “strengthening combat 
will”, “comprehension on enemy development”, “information 
◎ Build up collaboration relationship with academics and research organizations to construct counter Three 
Warfare theory basis and provide timely recommendation to strengthen decision making capabilities

security and espionage awareness” and “mutual support training”. 
Results from the post-course surveys indicated a viable increase in 
the understanding of the overall “Intangible Combat Power” issue. 
Satisfactions on the contents of the educational program clearly 
indicate the effectiveness in enhancing Intangible Combat Power 
education prior to exercise and training events.
2. Psychological counter pressure training
    Current “Battlefield Counter-Pressure Psychological Training” 
planning of the ROC Armed Forces focus mainly on dealing with 
“Taiwan and Penghu Defensive Operations” scenarios. Integrated 
with domestic and foreign research results, we designed training 
curriculums and facilities suitable for necessary psychological 
training. Through execution and assessment on the various stages 
and adjustment reviews in a timely manner, we were able to achieve 
strengthening psychological fitness of our military personnel, 
stabilizing their will to fight and enhance team morale and spirit to 
unleash their overall warfighting capabilities.
   Since 004, following the trends in battlefield technology 
development and the need to strengthen military personnel 
battlefield tolerance, the ROC Armed Forces started related 
planning tasks on topics such as “academic research”, “program 
evaluation” and “foreign visits”. After obtaining approval, we 
designated academic organizations such as the National Defense 
University, referencing “military psychology training” developments 
from modern nations and using “psychological adjustment” training 
as basis, to develop two major training contents categories – 
“training center advanced training – elevating counter pressure 
capability” and “garrison basic training – enhancing psychological 
fitness”. ‘Curriculum”, “facilities”, “instructors” and “assessment 
methodologies” were separately established accordingly with 
development in training curriculum, professional trainers and 
quantitative assessment tools to gradually establishing military 
psychology training related operating guidelines. Since 007, we 
established “battlefield counter pressure center (room)” and utilized 
various facilities and instruments to increase self-confidence, 
courage, potential, will to fight and the counter pressure 
capabilities. We train multiple groups of lower echelon solders in 
different stages to elevate their psychological fitness and solidify 
their psychological training in countering pressures.
(III) Countering PLA’s Three Warfare
     Dealing with the “Three Warfare” measures and to prepare for 
6military conflicts against Taiwan from the PRC, we embraced 
intelligence analysis, media, psychological warfare and news 
organizations to plan, develop and draft related counter Three 
Warfare strategies and measures. Information are further provided 
to government agencies for reference and provide clear guidance 
to all levels within the ROC Armed Forces to adopt effective actions 
to expand the overall awareness of psychological warfare and 
protections. 
    To counter the “Three Warfare” attacks from the PRC, the MND 
has conducted four “Counter Three Warfare Round Table” seminars 
since the end of 006. Through invited scholars, experts and 
related government ministries and agencies we have jointly drafted 
related counter measures and strategies. On December, 5th, 007, 
we successfully accomplished another research and analysis 
seminar inviting scholars and experts proficient in mainland issue, 
cross Straits relationship and the PRC’s “Three Warfare” for a panel 
discussion. A special report on “Analyzing PRC’s policy toward 
Taiwan and our counter measures after 7th National Congress 
of the Chinese Communist Party” was presented. Attendees also 
offered counter measure recommendations as references to related 
organizations. In order to construct “Counter Three Warfare” 
theory architecture, we also invited scholars and experts to publish 
papers, publications and completed “Understand PRC’s Three 
Warfare Intent Illustration”, “A Transparent Look on PRC’s Three 
Warfare Towards Taiwan”, “Political Warfare of the New Century” 
and “Research on PRC’s Psychological Warfare Toward Taiwan”, 
effectively raising the understanding of counter Three Warfare 
◎ Promote relevant education in accordance with the 
“All-Out Defense Education Act ” to incorporate the 
essence, knowledge and concept thereof into the lives 
of our citizens◎ Integrate with the annual military training exercises

the dual goals of integrating peacetime and wartime 
operations and solidify moral combat power7National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
measures among our fellow soldiers.
(IV) Realize morale mobilization
1. Establish morale mobilization topics
    We collaborated with mobilization supervision organizations to 
integrate the reserves service system and the utilization of mass 
media. Through planned systematic reports with topics of “all-
out defense, homeland defense” in peacetime, we successfully 
elevated the crisis awareness of military personnel and civilians 
to setup cooperation mechanism and strive for all out supports for 
defense affairs. Wartime topic of “defense national survival is the 
responsibility of every citizen” is aiming at escalating patriotism 
among our soldiers and strengthening civilian’s understandings 
on the cruelty of war and to consolidate the will to fight among our 
fellow citizens. 
2. Collaborate with government during training and exercise
    To fulfill guidelines regulated by the “All-Out Defense 
Mobilization Preparation Act”, effectively linking with the “All-
Out Defense Mobilization System” and integrated with annual 
“Han Kwang Exercise” and individual exercises, the MND invited 
other related ministries/agencies from the central government and 
county/city governments, major national industries to conduct 
wargames or realistic drills aiming to enhance crisis awareness 
among our citizens and to ensure our mobilization preparation 
operations. Additionally, based on “Regulation on the Control of 
Public Broadcasting Business and Its Personnel during Military 
Mobilization”, a regulation derived from the “All-Out Defense 
Mobilization Preparation Act”, we setup news processing, 
reception and preparation mechanisms to collaborate with support 
mechanism from the commercial broadcasting media to achieve the 
goal of supporting disaster relief in peacetime and realizing military 
operations support in wartime.
III. Future Direction
    Applying forward-looking concept and an attitude for execution, 
the ROC Armed Forces will continue the push for the Ten-Year 
Force Planning Program and combat readiness related missions. 
We indulged ourselves in executing force training tasks expecting 
to synchronously elevate both our physical and moral combat 
capabilities. The visions for execution in ROC Armed Forces moral 
combat power are stated as follows:
(I) Enhance professional media mechanism8
    Dealing with the technology development and trends in 
diversification of media channels, the ROC Armed Forces learned 
from the development experience of modern nations such as 
the U.S., plans to integrate daily affairs and battlefield media 
production into political warfare system experimentation and 
integrate with the “RMA (Revolution in Military Affairs)” policy to 
construct a professional political warfare warfighting capability. 
Providing guidance to professional organizations such as “Voice of 
Han Broadcasting Network” and “Youth Daily News”, we continue 
our investments and put emphasis on professional trainings such 
as “media perception and utilization”, “construct information 
channels”, “media and psychological warfare products development 
and production”…etc. According to “All-Out Defense Mobilization 
Preparation Act” and related regulations, we actively negotiate with 
commercial broadcasters and print media to establish collaborative 
operations capacities aiming to accumulate wartime real time media 
production capability, strengthen joint media mechanism to deal 
with the “real time” and “integrated” development trends in future 
battlefield news media.
(II) Establish analysis evaluation indicator
    Referencing development experience from modern nations, 
we established think tanks with invited scholars and experts and 
conduct routine seminars encouraging officers with advanced 
degrees and joint staff education background to submit papers 
on related topics. Focusing on the assessment index and 
dimension on topics such as battlefield counter-pressure index, 
moral maintenance, leadership and combat readiness training, 
we constructed analysis tool and model to be included in gradual 
validation and verification during exercises and training with detail 
index analysis and research. The development goal is to elevate 
precision in assessment index, establish effective Intangible 
Combat Power research capacity and realize the fruit in military 
knowledge.
(III) Integrate and validate through training and exercise
    In addition to planning the “Moral Combat Power Week” special 
education program and continuing integration with annual training 
and exercise, we drafted moral combat power standard operating 
procedure and joint operations mission action items under 
situations such as counter terrorism and disaster relief according 
to different stages in Defense Condition (DEFCON) and Emergency 
Conditions (EMERGCON) planning. We further drafted exercise 9National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
validation topics and special education program contents based 
on these SOP and action items to be included as verification and 
validation items in exercise and training executions expecting to 
accomplish the dual goals of integrating peace time and wartime 
operations and solidify moral combat power.
(IV) Elevate counter three warfare research and education 
capacities
    To comprehend latest PRC developments and its policy 
toward Taiwan, the MND applies more aggressive and active 
attitude to obtain real-time information on PRC’s “Three Warfare” 
measures and its intelligence toward Taiwan through building 
multiple intelligence and information channels and information 
sharing through “information interchange and cooperation” 
programs. We also conducted routine “Counter Three Warfare 
Round Table” related seminars to initiate research interests and 
build up collaboration relationship with academics and research 
organizations to construct counter Three Warfare theory basis and 
provide timely recommendation to strengthen decision making 
capabilities.
(V) Push for All-Out Defense education
    The ROC Armed Forces promote related educational tasks 
based on the “All-Out Defense Education Act” through multiple 
paths of “institute policies and regulations” and “planning multi-
facets activities”, and planning is underway for regulations such as 
additional articles and enforcement rules for the “All-Out Defense 
Education Act”, “All-Out Defense Educator Appointment Act”, 
“Regulation for Rewarding Outsourced Research”, “Regulation on 
the Management of Establishing All-Out Defense Education Fund” 
and “All-Out Defense Education Decision and Evaluation System”. 
Additionally, based on the “All-Out Defense Education Act”, the 
MND collaborates with related government ministries, agencies, 
local government, schools and social organizations to establish 
a complete education system merging the nature, knowledge and 
concept of “All-Out Defense Education” into the lives of our citizens. 
Through integrating all-out defense mobilization capability with the 
education system, we will be able to swiftly inject the mobilization 
capabilities into supporting our warfighting operations and ensure 
the success of the Taiwan, Penghu defensive operations.0

    Defense Resources include the allocation and utilization of 
manpower, financial resources, and material resources, and, as 
the armed forces assesses the overall time-space environment of 
the nation, and anticipates future operational requirements, they 
carry out planning based on modernized management knowledge 
and technology, in hopes that limited budgets can yield maximum 
investment returns; however, in the process of combat readiness 
developments, we hope to satisfy public expectations on all issues 
relating to public rights and benefits and national interests, under 
the precondition of not affecting combat readiness developments, 
and, through coordination with overall national developments, 
we will enable personnel to maximize their excellence, goods to 
free their flow, lands to maximize their advantages, materials to 
maximize their utility, equipments to maximize their functions, and 
weapons to maximize their combat capabilities, in order to build 
troops that can defend national security and defend the well-being 
of the people for the new century.
Section 1 
Defense Manpower
I.Reform the Terms of Military Service
(I) History of the terms of military service
    Under government policy planning, the current terms of military 
service are moving towards a draft-and-enlist direction with 
enlistees as the mainstay, and from 005, the numbers of enlistees 
are gradually increasing to select high quality personnel with long 
service periods to invest in main combat troops that require highly 
skilled and technically adept personnel, and simultaneously, to 
coordinate with major government policy implementations, legal 
protocols relevant to military service are amended at the same 
3National Defense Report

THE REPUBLIC OF CHINATAIWAN
Chapter 9 National Defense Resources time to fulfill defense needs and public expectations, and adapt 
to changes in the nation’s political and economic environment, in 
order to realize the armed forces’ responsibility to maintain national 
security.
(II) Summary of current legal governance
1. Legal sources of the terms of military service
   Article 0 of the “Constitution of the Republic of China” stipulates 
that: “The people shall have the duty of performing military service 
in accordance with law”; Article  of the “Act of Military Service 
System” stipulates that: “In accordance  with the Law, the males 
citizens of the Republic of China are obligated to take military 
service”, while Article  of the same legislation states that “The 
Military Services in the Act refers to: Military Officer Service, Non 
Commission Officer Service, Enlisted Man, Replacement Service”. 
Male citizens of service age in the Republic of China who are 
shown by draft inspections to be qualified for active duty will be 
drafted into active duty service units, and those who intend to 
take replacement service can apply for replacement service in 
accordance with public announcements from the Ministry of the 
Interior during the replacement service application period from 
active duty service; those who have been inspected and confirmed 
to qualify for replacement service will take replacement service.
2. Execution results of military service fairness
(i) In order to develop the functions of new generations of weapon 
equipments, it has become a inevitable trend to recruit personnel 
with high quality and willingness to serve long terms to enhance 
the capabilities of the main combat troops, but with the growing 
number of volunteers in the armed forces, it provides room for the 
adjustment of the length of draft service, therefore, based on overall 
considerations, the length of draft service was changed to one year 
since January , 008, in order for long-term service members to 
focus on troop readiness training missions to consolidate troop 
capabilities, and also to adjust the length of service for drafted 
soldiers and officers so that they can enter society earlier, which 
will help them implement their plans for their lives.
(ii) In coordination with policy shift of the terms of military service 
towards relying on enlistees as the mainstay, manpower needs 
for active duty troop mobilization is greatly reduced, and the 
age of service is also too high, resulting in excessive numbers of 
personnel being administered and managed, which not only puts 
pressure on military mobilization work, and also interferes with 
4human resource utilization, the cycling rates of reserve troops are 
accelerated to consolidate reserve mobilization capabilities, and 
also attract talented youths overseas to return to service early. 
(iii) Push for liberalized human resources
    Enhancing overall national competitiveness is a policy priority for 
the current government. To cultivate Taiwan’s international talents 
and promote its position in the international society and economic 
development potentials, we are shifting the terms of military service 
towards the overall planning of “enlistees as the mainstay”, and 
also simultaneously amend Article 48 of the Implementation Act 
of the Act of Military Service System to allow military personnel 
currently in school to enroll in co-op degree programs in domestic 
and foreign universities, and participate in global competitions to 
win medals or awards, with the Ministry of Education recommending 
time limits for enrolling in foreign schools.
(iv) Improve training and inventory system in the defense industry
    The current defense industry’s training and inventory system 
will undergo improvements and incorporated into the replacement 
service system so that the defense industry’s training and inventory 
system can incorporate movements in the societal environment 
and improve the system to actualize transformation, under the 
precondition of preserving the advantages and fairness of the 
military service system under existing system and conducting policy 
legally, in order to enhance domestic technological and industrial 
research and development work and Taiwan’s international 
competitiveness.
(v) Pushing for a draft-and-enlist policy with “enlistees as the 
◎ Coordination with the enlistees-first policy in the military 
service system allows high school graduates to enter military 
service by directly applying for volunteer soldier status.◎ Cultivating staff members that command civic, military, 
technical, and ethical excellence, and building superior 
leadership and command staff for armed forces troops.
5National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
mainstay”
A. To expand the age range of volunteer service, Article 47 of the 
“Act of Military Service System” will be amended to be unrestrained 
by Article 3 of the “Act of Military Service System”, so that high 
school graduates can directly apply for military service to shorten 
length of service and help with subsequent life planning.
B. For volunteer reserve soldiers, Article 47 of the “Act of Military 
Service System” will be amended to add references to the “Act of 
Military Service System’s” volunteer reserve soldiers that are not 
restrained by limits to active-duty-turned-volunteer soldiers to fulfill 
actual requirements.
C. To expand channels of recruiting volunteer soldiers, Article 48 
of the “Act of Military Service System” will be amended to add 
regulations and legal sources to female volunteer service, which not 
only utilizes female manpower to strengthen defense capabilities, 
but also provides women with an opportunity to serve their nation 
through the military, as well as fulfilling the policy vision of gender 
equality.
D. Under the precondition of incorporating the progress and 
planning of the Jingjin Program, as of 007, the enlistee-to-draftee 
ratio is now 55% : 45%, and by 008, the targeted enlistee-to-
draftee ratio of 60% : 40% is expected to be reached.
II. Improve Military Education
    Military education needs to combine the needs of RMA, address 
challenges arising from shifts in the overall national environment, 
and formulate comprehensive education systems under military 
strategic guidance and the Ministry of Education’s policy 
governance. To make this system operate efficiently, we should 
formulate military education frameworks, set out clear educational 
targets and focuses, and, through educational assessments 
and reform methods, achieve the overall targets of military 
developments.
(I) Military education framework 
    Current military education is intended to carefully plan and 
cultivate high quality staff members with military and civilian 
excellence and tactical and ethical aptitude, in order to construct 
an elite and effective modern force with appropriate numbers, 
based on the four aspects of the armed forces’ mission, the future 
ten-year military planning framework, five-year force construction 
plan, and education targets, and in accordance with the principle 
6of “cultivate for real jobs, plan for the development”, and based 
on the philosophy of “combat, talent, selection, education”, and in 
accordance with RMA (Revolution in Military Affairs) requirements, 
and using “thinking, military ethics, and military aptitude” as the 
content, and “philosophy, science, and military studies” as the 
focus, and in assessing situational factors such as “technological 
weapon renewals” and “changes in the mode of warfare”, and by 
considering aspects such as “reviewing educational objectives”, 
“improving educational systems”, and “improving educational 
contents”.
(II) Military education system
    The armed forces use a macroscopic perspective to plan and 
establish their current education system, and separate it into “basic 
education”, “advanced education”, and “further education” in 
accordance with the Act of Military, in order to separate education 
for officers and noncommissioned officers.
    In the officer education system component, “basic education” 
includes: credit- based courses included in the University Act and 
electives and developmental education required for training basic 
officers; “advanced education” includes regular and specialization 
classes in branch-specific military schools; “further education” 
mainly consists of various strategy, command, and staff education 
and master and doctorate degree education in various schools 
and research centers in the National Defense University, and with 
civilian master and doctorate programs as supplements.
    In the noncommissioned officer education system, “basic 
education” mainly consists of specialization and developmental 
education, supplemented by acquisition of basic technical diplomas 
or licenses; “advanced education” mainly consists of high-
level noncommissioned officer classes in various branch-specific 
schools, and supplemented by specialization classes and mid-
level technical civilian diplomas or licenses; “further education” 
mainly consists of regular first sergeant classes, supplemented by 
acquisitions of high-level technical civilian diplomas or licenses and 
advanced degrees; also, volunteer soldiers will focus on enlistment 
training and specialization training, and develop into volunteer 
noncommissioned officers according to planning.
(III) Military education objectives
    Basic officer training is intended to cultivate modern officers 
with excellent military and civilian experiences, great tactical and 
ethical aptitude, having university degrees and complete education

and responding to future modes of 
warfare.
(IV) Emphasis of improvements to 
education targets
    In terms of psychological  
education, we will enhance national 
consciousness, study warfare  
philosophy, consolidate the  
determination to win, and accentuate 
military ethics to develop resolute 
will, and establish the belief that 
psychology is more important than 
materials, and that morale, tactics, and 
techniques are more important than 
weapon equipments.
    In terms of life education, we plan to 
train the behavior of military personnel, 
inspire virtue in military personnel, and 
develop the personal characteristics 
of obedience, responsibility, self-
discipline, respect for the law, and 
self-motivated learning, that modern 
military personnel should possess, 
through honors systems and staff-in-
training systems.
    In terms of physical training, we plan 9National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
to train for physical strength, increase courage and confidence, and 
develop teamwork and determination to undergo hardship in order 
to enhance one’s will.
    In terms of technical education, we will complete credit-based 
courses mandated by the Ministry of Education, supplemented by 
technical military classes, in order to learn command, control, and 
staffing capabilities, develop knowledge for new technologies and 
information, enhance strategic and tactical aptitude, and build the 
professional soldier.
(V) Methods of reforms and improvements
    In observing trends in military education around the world, 
and in consideration of current enemy threats, and to fulfill future 
defense buildup policies, the armed forces will, henceforth, 
continue with the eight policy directions of education assessments, 
reviews and amendments to education regulations, recruiting high 
quality personnel, developing competent instructors, engaging in 
military educational exchanges, enhancing military sales training, 
integrate class design, and renewing educational content, so 
that education satisfies combat training, and that combat training 
guides education, in order to achieve the target of fusing training 
with usage.
    In terms of carrying out education assessments, in order to 
increase the overall competitiveness of various basic schools, 
each school will assemble their own self assessment committees 
to plan, coordinate, and process relevant work, and regularly or 
irregularly conduct self assessments, so that schools conduct self 
assessments through aspects such as educational responsibilities 
and personal characteristics of officers in order to establish self 
improvement mechanisms and seek improvement strategies, so 
that university education fulfills the assessment standards of the 
Ministry of Education, and that officer developmental education 
also satisfies various requirements such as personal characteristics 
in military school, basic military knowledge and skills, and physical 
training. Simultaneously, we will actively participate in the 00 
military and police faculty assessments to be carried out by the 
Ministry of Education after accepting the overall university matters 
assessment carried out by the Ministry of Education, in hopes of 
fulfilling university education targets, and also expand student 
recruitment efficiency of military schools.
    In terms of reviews and amendments to education regulations, 
we will look at the execution results of organizational adjustments 
30to military school, shifting the terms of military service towards a 
draft-and-enlist system with enlistees as the mainstay, and military 
education, draft amendments to the Act of Military Education, and 
seek legal procedural negotiations to comprehensively review and 
amend regulations relevant to military education and improve the 
armed forces’ military education system.
   In terms of recruiting high quality personnel, since 006, 
regular-season military schools have cancelled departmental 
exams, and adopted a selection-based admission process based 
on university departmental test results, which resulted in 00% 
student recruitment rate in 007, and the new students are all of 
high quality, which is very beneficial towards enhancing the quality 
of military staff.
    In terms of cultivating competent instructors, we will not only let 
each school devise their own instructor training and usage plans 
according to education class needs, and prioritize on assigning high 
quality staff with comprehensive management experience, potential, 
and sense of duty, the MND will also enact the “Guidelines for 
Hiring Professional Technical Personnel for Military Schools” based 
on special and indispensable professional instructors based on 
military strategy, tactics, and professional military technical fields, 
set out regulatory conditions for matters such as the qualifications, 
tenure, ratio, and procedures of hiring personnel, and have each 
school coordinate with assigned priority works, in order to acquire 
competent military professional technical instructors.
    In terms of military exchanges, in order to enhance military 
relations with allied states, encourage competent officers  and 
cadets of friendly countries to participate in Taiwan’s various 
bachelor, master, and doctorate programs and advanced education 
programs in command and control staff college and war college in 
the military schools in Taiwan, and enhance the Chinese language 
capability of the participants for various courses from allied 
nations, we have, with consent from agencies such as the Executive 
Yuan, incorporated the MND into the Taiwan Scholarship Plan, 
which will allocate scholarships through annual budgets, allowing 
allied officers and military students to receive training in Taiwanese 
military schools, which will enhance military exchanges between 
Taiwan and allied states.
    In terns of enhancing military sales, we will set out the annual 
foreign military sales procedures for the armed forces, so that the 
armed forces can send personnel overseas for training when they 
3National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
cannot receive domestic training or achieve the training standards 
required for the operation and maintenance of certain armament 
sales or new weapons, and receive the newest military strategy, 
tactics, logistics, technology, doctrine, and educational material 
from foreign sources; simultaneously, we will set out the priority 
sequences for overseas training, with the current stage focused on 
training joint operation and C4ISR professionals, in order to fulfill 
the education objectives of “training for operations” and “operation 
right after training”.
    In terms of enhancing class design, the armed force’ basic 
education classes will be separated into core classes and 
specialized classes, in order to allow base-level staff to cover 
both professional and general quality, and continue to enhance 
language, information, and management capabilities; advanced 
education will be based on the professional specialization of 
the armed services and professional training, in order to build 
the professional skills that each military personnel’s area of 
responsibility and missions call for. Further education will divide 
specializations based on shared and professional classes, with 
emphasis on various strategic studies to incorporate combat 
readiness requirements. And simultaneously, we will incorporate the 
military strategic planning of “technological leadership, information 
and electronic advantage, joint strikes, and homeland defense”, 
and amend the “Chart of the Standards of Shared General Classes”, 
so that classes will grow increasingly more complex in a gradual 
way, to achieve the education objective of “continuity from start to 
finish”.
    In terms of renewing educational materials, in order to fulfill 
the combat readiness requirements of the armed forces, various 
educational classes’ educational contents will emphasize on 
academic theories and incorporation with actual troop requirements, 
to adequately reflect developments in technology, equipments, 
and warfare; Education materials and projects will be amended or 
renewed in a timely manner to maintain the comprehensiveness 
and novelty of educational materials, and also fulfill the three- 
assessments-and-three-tests procedures and operations, to align 
closer to educational needs.
III. Employ Civilian Defense Officials
    In order to coordinate with defense system transformations and 
operational reforms, and ensure the ideal of civilian control of the 
3military, the MND will employ enough civilian officials to be no 
less than one-third of all assigned positions, in accordance with 
legislations, actively build civilian defense official systems, cultivate 
their professional quality, enhance military-civilian cooperation, and 
improve communication and coordination capabilities, so that, after 
the defense reform and transformation, civilian defense officials can 
be tasked with driving forth and creating new ideas for defense.
(I) Concept of employing civilian officials
    Employment of civilian defense officials is to support the 
mechanism of civilian control of the military and establish 
professional military division of labor. Therefore, we have actualized 
the usage, development, examination, and promotion systems 
for civilian defense officials to utilize the ideal and concept of 
independence for civilian officials, in order to benefit the drive to 
innovate and invigorate defense affairs, and thus enabling them to 
fulfill the vision of civilian control of the military, nationalization of 
the armed forces, administrative neutrality, and all-out defense, to 
the best of their abilities, thus enabling the armed forces to uphold 
ideals that are more appropriate for democratic eras.
(II) Establish systems for civilian defense officials
1.Employment of civilian defense officials
   Since the implementation of the Two Defense Acts, 8
civilian job vacancies have been gradually opened in the MND 
and its subordinate agencies.Through methods such as national 
examinations and open selections, we will continue using the 
aforementioned examination and election methods to screen 
personnel in a disciplined manner, and we will also apply for 
“Examination for Colonels or Higher Ranked Officers Transferring 
to Civil Service Positions” and “Special Examination for Civil 
Servants Transferring to Civilian Positions in the Ministry of National 
Defense”, in order to attract long-term and talented professional 
defense personnel.
2.Planning for additional defense positions
    The MND has requested the Ministry of Civil Service to add 
defense- administrative and defense technology teams and 
departments so that, in subsequent usage of personnel, the 
MNS can choose profession “defense” personnel and satisfy the 
operational requirements of national defense.
(III) Planning for operational systems for civilian defense officials
    To facilitate the operation of civilian defense officials, utilize the 
expected benefits and achieve the vision of civilian control of the 
33National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
military and military- civilian cooperation, the MND is gradually 
planning out operational standards for civilian officials:
1.Planning personnel positions
    Based on organizational adjustments to the armed forces’ Jingjin 
Program, we will plan out civilian personnel positions for each 
administrative agency besides those stipulated by the Organization 
Act of the Ministry of National Defense, and the Armaments Bureau 
and Medical Affairs Bureau also need to employ one third of civilian 
positions assigned, so that there will be 8 positions for civilian 
MND officials.
2.Employment and promotion method
    Based on the “Civil Servant Employment Act” and “Civil Servant 
Promotion Act”, we will formulate the “Regulation for Internal 
Promotion of Civil Servants in the Ministry of National Defense” to 
process promotional adjustments to civilian officials in the MND to 
invigorate human resources management for civilian MND officials 
and raise morale for personnel.
3.Evaluation method
    Based on regulations in the “Civil Servant Evaluation Act”, we 
will formulate the “Guidelines for Evaluations of Civil Servants 
in the Ministry of National Defense” and “Chart for Rewarding 
and Punishing Civil Servants in the Ministry of National Defense” 
to process evaluation, reward, and punishment work for civilian 
officials, in order to achieve the goals of honesty, consistency in 
rewards and punishment, and objectivity.
4.Benefits and rights protection
    We will enact the “Regulations for Assigning Managerial Duties 
to Non- Managerial Personnel” and “Regulations for Overtime 
Management for Civilian Officials in the Ministry of National 
Defense” to provide additional salaries for assigning additional 
duties to non-managerial personnel, as well as overtime; also, we 
will provide overtime for forgoing vacations and assistance wages 
for vacations according to the “Improvement Measures for Vacations 
for Civil Servants in the Executive Yuan and Subordinate Agencies”, 
and award regular wages and transportation wages. We will also 
actively review and strive to improve other benefits and rights for 
civilian officials to boost morale and retain high quality personnel.
(IV) Develop professional quality for national defense
    To develop and retain civilian defense officials for the long 
term, the MND will enact regulations such as the “Guidelines 
for the Training, Advanced Education, and Lifelong Learning of 
34Civilian Personnel in the Ministry of National Defense” and the 
“Implementation Plan for the Staff Training of Civilian Personnel in 
the Ministry of National Defense” based on relevant regulations like 
the implementation details of the “Act of Training and Advanced 
Education for Civil Servants” and the “Implementation Methodology 
for the Training and Advanced Education of Schools in the 
Executive Yuan and Subordinate Agencies” to incorporate relevant 
military training courses, and, through various educational training, 
employ civilian officials in the MND to rapidly familiarize themselves 
with national defense affairs, and consolidate the professional 
quality of national defense, thus utilizing their talents.
(V) Anticipating military-civilian cooperation relationships
1.Enhance communication and coordination capacity for military-
civilian cooperation
    In order to accommodate the cultural differences in military and 
civilian thinking, enhance communication and coordination between 
them, and enhance the efficiency of military-civilian cooperation, 
the MND will establish the effective operational model outlined 
below:
(i) In terms of job vacancies, we will use the model of listing military 
and civilian positions in parallel, and regularly switching between 
military civilian positions for managerial and assistant managerial 
positions to jointly drive forth national defense affairs.
(ii) In terms of organizational work, we will use joint operation to 
enhance military-civilian harmonization and cooperation, utilize the 
complementation and mutual benefits between military and civilian 
thinking.
(iii) In terms of educational training, we will implement mixed 
training, in hopes of developing communication, coordination, and 
cooperation capabilities during the learning process, and establish 
the vision of a shared organizational culture.
2.Thinking for civilian defense officials in the new era
    The implementation of the Two Defense Act has confirmed the 
democratic national defense systems of civilian control of the 
military and uniformity of national defense, with civilian ministers 
overseeing the entire operation and shouldering all responsibilities. 
In order for the minister to possess decision- making capabilities 
with foresight and extensiveness for defense policy and resources, 
we will effectively integrate the military policy, command, and 
armament branches and direct defense policy implementation, 
introduce civilian officials to participate in defense affairs and 
35National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
National Defense Report
the design of the operation of defense policies, all of which are 
intended to incorporate innovative benefits from dynamic ideas.
    The dynamic ideas generated through joint military-civilian use 
and military- civilian interactions not only enhance and deepen 
the strength and power of defense capabilities but also gradually 
demonstrate concrete results. especially, When the armed forces 
implement the Jingjin Program and enter a new age of national 
defense reforms and transformation, aside from military personnel 
adhering to their professional military frameworks in combat 
readiness work, they also use interdisciplinary perspectives, rely 
on joint participation of civilian defense officials with professional 
training in different fields and independent ideas, and makethe 
planning and execution of defense operations more extensive.
Section 2 
Defense Financial Resources
    Defense budgets focus internally on budgetary allocations, 
management, and control, and externally on public expectations, 
based on the principle of “effective use, utilization of benefits”, 
in coordination with factors such as overall national economic 
developments, financial revenues and expenditures, and national 
security, in hopes that the people can trust the national defense 
and support defense budgets.
I. Acquisition of Financial Resources
(I) Annual comparison of defense budgets from 1999 to 2008        
   Taiwan’s defense budgets as a percentage of Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) from 999 to 008 are shown in Figure 9- . Defense 
budgets as a percentage of overall central government budgets are 
shown in Figure 9- .
    Under government policy guidance, the scale of defense budgets 
increased from .69% of GDP in 007 to 3% of GDP in 008, 
indicating the people’s support for the armed forces’ determination 
to defend the security over the Taiwan Strait; hence, the armed

forces will adhere to the principle of “effective use, utilization 
of benefits”, ensure that military planning requirements must be 
tightly tied to military planning frameworks, and force construction 
plans are carefully sequenced according to order of importance to 
reasonably and effectively allocate resources.
(II) Comparison of defense budgets between Taiwan and major 
states in the world
    The defense budgets of major states around the world differ 
because of factors such as society and economic systems, military 
systems, budgetary systems, and, based on data from The Military 
Balance of London’s International Institute of Strategic Studies, we 
hereby analyze the 006 defense budgets of states like the United 
Kingdom (UK), US, Japan, PRC, South Korea, Israel, Singapore, 
and North Korea, as shown in Table 9- .

by the budget.38II. Use of Financial Resources
(I) Defense budget allocation trends from 1999 to 2008
    In terms of financial resource allocation and usage, the 
armed forces’ combat readiness work relies on military planning 
frameworks and force construction plans, considers priorities 
on financial strains on national defense and urgency of policy 
implementation, and gradually review and make allocations to 
achieve military planning targets. Allocation trends for defense 
budgets between 999 and 008 (personnel maintenance, 
operational maintenance, military investments, and others) are 
shown in Figure 9-3.

III.Defense Financial Management
    Achieving combat readiness depends on competent financial 
management, and, in response to environmental changes and 
increasingly tight monitoring from the legislature, the MND is 
actively enhancing financial management work, as abstracted 
below:
(I) Enhance policy development planning
    Incorporating combat readiness work, relying on sourcing, 
streamlining, estimates, and returns. And through professionalizing 
legal authorities and adopting efficiency-oriented models for 
management functions, we will push forth various management 
projects, and thus support defense policy implementation objectives 
and provide the armed forces with various resource allocation 
management references.
(II) Improve budgetary allocation management
     We will use systematic modeling to estimate financial resources, 
and regulate resource allocation principles based on defense policy 
implementation emphases and combat readiness priorities; we will 
use savings estimation capabilities to coordinate with budgets in 
subsequent years; we will establish return mechanisms, reduce 
inefficient budgets, support new investment and combat capability 
maintenance, etc.
(III) Enhance accounting information efficiency

National Defense Report
Section 3
Defense Material
I. Base Realignment Planning
    In the view of the overall yields of national land development 
and the call for force structure adjustment, the Ministry of National 
Defense (MND) must acquire adequate military estate for operation, 
training and logistics to satisfy the needs of force planning 
and combat readiness. Meanwhile, issues preventing regional 
development such as certain military bases operation, training 
grounds construction and restriction of civilian infrastructure within 
the proximity of a military zone should be resolved by seeking 
balance among national security, regional development and needs 
of our fellow citizens.  Based on the concept of “nurturing combat 
readiness in economic development,” the MND has reevaluated 
the utilization of military estate, adequately adjusted military 
deployment and facilities, and reduced restriction areas on the 
principle of “managing and releasing according to actual needs.” 
Such efforts should meet the minimum requirement of defense 
security without jeopardizing our combat readiness.
    We base our planning through the three dimensions of 
“reassessing and consolidating camps,” “overall planning of 
training grounds” and “reassessment of the construction-restricted 
areas near military facilities.” Comprehensive assessments 
are conducted on the efficiencies of the overall military estate 
utilization to promote regional economic prosperity, encourage 
urban development, protect citizens’ legal rights, and fully integrate 
the military into our society. We elaborate on the execution concept, 
objectives, expected benefits, results, military estate strategy, and 
concrete accomplishments as follows:
(I) Execution concept  　　
    Based on the principles to retain consistency between peacetime 
and wartime, we will integrate critical military facilities and training 
grounds based on the guidance of “consolidating small bases into 
larger ones” and “one base for all three services.” We will also 
reassess and merge all current discrete, small training grounds and 
47National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
construct large scale training grounds suitable for joint exercise and 
training, and existing training grounds with no impacts on combat 
readiness will be evaluated for deregulation or relinquishment.
(II) Objectives 
   The five years plan calls for a three stage execution from 005 till 
the end of 009. More than ,06 hectares of land will be released 
and more than ,937 hectares will be deregulated (the overall 
planning on the utilization, release and deregulation of military 
estate as shown in Table 9- ).
(III) Expected Benefits  　　
. Based on previously identified priority defense targets in case 
of domestic emergency responses (counterterrorism), the MND has 
requested all regional commands (defense commands, garrison 
commands) to assess, within their areas of responsibilities, 
confidential areas that may be critical to the overall national 
security and implement prioritized defense preparation missions for 
those areas. Such efforts have drastically increased our domestic 
emergency response capabilities and benefited the armed forces in 
executing counterterrorism operations.  　　
. After the original acquisition sources were examinined, 
Table 9-  Planning Chart of the Utilization, Release and 
Deregulation of Military Estate48694 relinquished bases occupying ,06 hectares of land had 
been returned to their previous owners, local governments, or 
through legal “transfer” to the National Property Bureau. Such 
efforts can relieve the MND of the management and maintenance 
responsibilities while providing lands necessary for the national and 
local political and economic developments. This created a win-win 
situation for all stakeholders.  　　
3. ,937.48 hectares of civilian lands will be deregulated after 
easing the construction restrictions nearing critical military 
facilities, which will ensure the legal rights of our citizens while 
encouraging regional developments and address the needs of major 
national developments and defense readiness.
(IV) Results
    The Military Estate Five-Years, Three-Stages Execution Plan has 
achieved 00% of its short-term goal in releasing 94 bases and 
training grounds of 48  hectares and deregulating 6 fortresses and 
restriction zones of ,003 hectares. The mid-term goal requires 
accommodating the needs of mission adjustment from the Jingjin 
Program, the inauguration of new generation of combat forces and 
the land required to construct military housing to accomplish the 
“Three Assurance Policy” promoted by President Chen. The MND 
has assessed and reserved estates needed for reuse in order to 
economize land use while continuing with management of remaining 
according to the planned schedule. The mid-term target is to 
release 354 locations totaling at 795 hectares, and deregulating 
3locations totaling at ,934 hectares. As of Dec. 007, 7
locations with areas up to 334.8  hectares have been released and 
3 locations totaling at 3,873.5 hectares have been deregulated, 
and we will continue assessments according to the planned and 
scheduled management schedule to increase the overall returns in 
the utilization of land resources.
(V) Military estate strategy
1. Effective utilization of estate resources to support force 
planning and combat readiness missions
    The MND uniformly authorizes the allocation of military estates 
to satisfy the living, training and operational needs of our military 
personnel. This was accomplished through professional estate 
management measures to acquire military lands in a timely manner.  
Based on the military estate overall plan, lands without current 
utilization plans will be immediately released; lands with utilization 
plans will be acquired through multiple annual PPBS budgeting 
49National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
process.  To satisfy local development needs while fulfilling actual 
military mission requirements, the MND will conduct military estate 
management measures according to the Military Estate Release 
Process Principle, stated as follows:
(i) The MND will assist current occupying units to draft the land 
utilization project (with an emphasis on utilizing current estate) for 
military lands in which the lands will be acquired through annual 
budgeting process within the five years and annual execution plan. 
(ii) With limited defense resources, budgets projected for 
investment in land procurement cannot fulfill the needs for the 
construction of every facility. The MND must consider the priorities 
and focus sequentially on lands critical to combat missions, 
education and training facilities, and living quarters for our military 
personnel, etc.
(iii) The principle is not to release lands currently used in support 
of daily operation unless the lands are relevant with the issue of 
major national constructions or civil importance reviewed by the 
Executive Yuan policy board  Only under circumstances, based on 
the defense ideology of harmony between military and the civilian, 
we will create a win-win situation, with the release methods of 
“seeking relocation lands, build and demolish by the military for 
civilian, and build first then relocate.” 
2. Eliminate land disputes, lessen patrol and management burden
    The MND will gradually release futile, discrete and non-military 
own lands to relief from patrol burden while preventing land 
disputes between the military and the civilian. This will assist in 
maintaining harmonious relationship between the two. We will also, 
through legal measures, acquire and manage lands that are planned 
for operation, as assigned by the armed forces.
3. Replace egocentric thinking with active involvement; drafting 
guidance with effective management
    Military estate management is tedious and cumbersome, the 
MND will comply with current laws and regulations, integrate limited 
estate management manpower, consolidate all military estate 
management organization, establish an active processing concept, 
invoking effective measures by drafting problem-oriented guidance, 
and amend antiquated regulations as the basis for future estate 
management.
(VI) Accomplishments and achievements
. Acquired national and public lands for military use amount to 40 
cases with a total area around 76.9 hectares. 
50. 35 cases of futile military estates are released as non public 
properties for an area of 38 hectares.  cases of lands are 
provided for government organization or public construction with 
an area around 8.7 hectares. The return or deregulation of 4 
cases of national or public lands with an area around 5.5 hectares 
is completed. 4  cases of lands illegally occupied by civilians with 
an area of around 44.98 hectares are transferred to the National 
Property Bureau.
3. Current cases in supporting major national construction
(i) The construction of the “National Biotechnology Development 
Park” under Academia Sinica requires using 5. hectares of land 
in Armaments 0 factory.
(ii) 50 hectares of Shuinan Airport are released to the Taichung 
City for city renewal project.
(iii) 5.5 hectares of land over 0 locations within the “Tsoying 
Base” are released to facilitate the construction of Tai- 7 Bypass 
way for the Kaohsiung municipal government.
4. Regulations amended or enacted
(i) The amendment of the Armed Forces Real Estate Management 
Directives is completed. 
(ii) The amendment on the regulations for dealing with land 
acquired or requisitioned by the military in the past without proper 
transfer of land titles is completed.
(iii) The regulations for military controlled properties offered for 
non-military organizations use are promulgated and enacted. 
(iv) The regulations for military lands involved in city development 
plans are promulgated and enacted.
II. Armament Readiness
    The mission of the Armament Branch is to achieve the goal 
of force planning concepts and defense programming plan by 
following policy guidance from the Policy Branch and fulfilling the 
operational requirements from the Command Branch. The vision is 
to integrate armaments resources, effectively elevate self defense 
capability, establish life cycle management, and fully support force 
construction and combat missions. The MND has enacted the 
“Armament Strategy Planning Guidance Directive” based on the 
force planning concept, future force construction items planned 
by the Policy Branch. Military build-up directions and actual 
requirements will then be further validated by the Command Branch 
on the basis of results from missions in combat, exercise, and 
5National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
training or models simulation. After optimal acquisition methods 
have been confirmed by the MND’s Planning, Programming 
and Budgeting System (PPBS) process, a full lifecycle project 
management model will be then executed according to the weapon 
system acquisition procedure, in order to acquire weapon systems 
or equipments needed to fulfill combat readiness requirements. 
In order to effectively utilize the technical talents and research 
and development capacities within the armaments branch, force 
construction planning needs will be integrated under policy 
guidance from the military policy branch, using investment methods 
that yield the highest returns, and thus satisfying the operational 
requirements of the Command Branch in a timely manner. Therefore, 
the armament strategy relies on the three axes of acquisition, 
technology and logistics strategy, complement, an overall planning 
will be set up synchronously in view of engineering, estate 
management, personnel and financial strategy, management 
measures, and simultaneous fusion with the civil industry in order 
to support military build-up and operation.
(I) Armament strategic planning
    Under policy guidance from the Military Policy Branch, the 
armament strategy planning must fully utilize technology talents 
within the Armaments Branch using optimal methodology for 
maximum investment returns. The strategy planning must integrate 
with the military build-up requirements and satisfy the operational 
requirements of the Military Command Branch in a timely manner.
    Operating within the realm of national security objectives and 
strategy guidance, the armament strategy development process 
(Appendix 3) executes its planning in accordance with the overall 
◎ Research and development focusing on items and 
characteristics of equipments required for the force 
build-up of the armed forces can fulfill the combat 
readiness mission requirements of the armed forces◎ Analyzing future military build-up and operational 
requirements, improving defense technology 
capacities, and realizing the defense technology policy 
of defense self-reliance.5defensive operations strategy concept. In this process, innovative 
technology development in the global market place will be evaluated 
to predict future trends in defense technology development. Results 
of the evaluation will be provided to the Policy Branch and serve 
as a reference during its force planning strategy process. In view 
of the fighting capability requirements, the armament strategy 
development process will evaluate both the feasibility of “Non-
Material Alternatives” and the suitability of “Material Alternatives.” 
Additionally, it will verify the “Technology Readiness Level” of the 
current and forward looking research and production capacity both 
in the domestic (both commercial and military) and international 
market. This will serve as recommendations on future industrial 
development and combat readiness.
    Furthermore, according to the force planning concept and 
operational requirement items in the force build-up plan, the 
armaments planning develops the long term development strategy 
of acquisition, technology and logistics based on with existing 
technology of the armed forces.  We also propose feasible action 
plans to fulfill requirements and correspond to the development 
policy. Through the governing directives from policy meetings and 
authorization mechanism of a team made out of representatives 
from individual branches, joint staff and the armaments bureau, this 
provides a reference for the establishment and modification of force 
planning. In the meantime, the armaments bureau also establishes 
0 years force construction planning research and development 
items, and evaluates existing capacity, establishes key technology 
based on initial requirements, and elevates overall research 
◎ Disciplined technology strategy planning, integration 
of military and civilian technology resources, 
improvements of defense technology capacities.◎ Promoting defense industry developments, enabling fusion 
of defense and civilian industries, and consolidating defense 
self-reliance, and this achieving combat readiness missions.53National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
and production capabilities, within the compliance of approved 
development directives, thus integrating system technology 
research and engineering development to integrate closely with 
force construction requirements and follow up with mass production 
deployment operation, which will greatly increase the investment 
returns of the defense budgets.
    During the planning phase, we employed existing technical talent 
to conduct concept design and evaluate the acquisition method, 
lifecycle cost and acquisition risks of each possible proposal based 
on equipment items, capabilities needed for the armed military 
build-up requirements.  The results are recommended as the 
acquisition strategy for each project.  We expect, under the pre-
condition of fulfilling force planning concept and defense planning, 
to effectively utilize budgets, integrate related resources and come 
up with the optimal acquisition options for the weapon system.  
Results will serve as a reference for the integrated evaluation 
office as a reference during system analysis decision, which 
facilitates the continuous operation and execution of the acquisition 
projects, and, with abundant buffer in pre-planning scheduling and 
completion of an overarching analysis, we expect the armaments 
readiness operation to fulfill military build-up and operational 
mission requirements in a timely and quality manner with least risk 
and maximum returns and integration with the long-term goal.
    During the execution phase, we will team with the project 
execution organization and related responsible joint staffs to 
execute project management and supervision according to 
Integrated Project Team (IPT) and Integrated Project and Process 
Development (IPPD) management model. With incremental 
acquisition approach and spiral development methods, the 
individual weapon system acquisition project will be progressively 
under the project strategic guidance.
(II) Acquisition strategy planning
    Under the precondition of enabling weapon acquisition operation 
to satisfy the operational requirement and policy guidance, the 
Armament Branch applies advanced management techniques and 
comprehensive acquisition management systems (Directives and 
Guidance) to acquire maximum effectiveness and efficiency in the 
shortest schedule with the most adequate cost. Planning principles 
include:
1. Research and development 
    Since the planning of the “ten-year research and development 
54items,” we followed the technology development process and the 
results of capacity evaluation according to the policy guidance of 
“Have it first, Make it better, Perfect it afterwards” to construct core 
capabilities needed to satisfy the requirements and inject innovative 
technology gradually into current deployed systems.  After the 
research and development of the weapon system fully satisfied 
the basic operation characteristics requirements, we initiate low 
rate initial production by applying spiral development method and 
gradually enhancing weapon system capabilities during the mass 
production stage.
2. Mass production of R&D results
    Based on the guiding principles of “establishing core 
capabilities, capacity integration, strategic alliance, allocation 
and cooperation,” we have included the key core capacity items 
into the five-year force planning, research and modification plan.  
We conduct System Engineering development, enhancement and 
mass production planning tasks to integrate domestic production 
capabilities and jointly elevate production technology level to 
achieve the goal of a self sufficient defense industry.
3. Commercial off the shelf procurement
    Under strategic directives such as “domestic first and 
supplement by foreign procurement”, “joint research and 
development, joint production first, and off the shelf purchase 
second”, and “pre-planning, encompassing deliberation, process 
legality and operation swiftness”, weapon system acquisition 
projects will be comprehensively planned We must seek maximum 
investment returns through methods such as industrial cooperation 
plans and technology transfer to cultivate domestic defense 
industry production capacity.
(III) Technology strategic planning
    Technology strategy planning must foresee future operational 
requirements, evaluate existing technology capabilities, establish 
core capacity, and integrate armament resources to construct a 
blueprint for defense technology development in support of military 
build-p and combat readiness.
. Evaluate technical capabilities: Assessing operational 
requirements for the future forces, we put high priority on the 
information and electronics and the tri-missiles (Hsiung-Feng, 
Tien-Kung, Tien-Chien).  We conduct evaluation on the require 
key technologies, confirm the technical maturity of its technical 
readiness level to lower research and development risk and ensure 
55National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
feasible deployment strategy, which will serve as a reference for 
future technology industrial policy development and force planning.
. Integrates armament resources: By applying the evaluation on 
technology capability technical maturity, we examined the research 
development, design, production and maintenance technical 
capability within the current armed forces.  Under the system 
architecture of “information and electronics superiority and the 
tri-missiles,” we segregated “core development” and “non-core 
outsourcing” items, joined industrial capabilities, and integrated the 
overall related armament resources.
3. Seeking joint partnership: We seek domestic and international 
partners for joint development on task where there is a deficiency in 
technical capabilities or non-core item.  The purpose is to integrate 
industrial capabilities, reduce investment cost and acquisition risk, 
elevate defense industry capabilities and construct a blueprint for 
national technology industrial development. 
    Through stringent technical strategy planning, we expect to 
achieve the defense technology strategy of integrating future 
operational requirements through technology capability evaluation 
and integrating dual use technology resources.  We will be devoted 
to the key weapon system and advanced innovative technical 
research and development to elevate defense technology capability, 
and fulfill the policy of a self sufficient national defense”
(IV) Logistics strategic planning
    Logistics strategy planning must operate under the precondition 
of fulfilling operational requirements and maintaining reliable war 
fighting capability. Abiding by policy guidance of a self reliant 
defense, we adopt “full lifecycle system management” architecture 
supplemented by the methods of “supplying chain management” 
and “industrial strategic alliance”. Our planning principles are:
1. Total life-cycle management mechanism
    By applying system engineering science during research, 
development and production stages, we build up a complete 
configuration management database to assist the development of 
a planned maintenance management mechanism. This will further 
construct logistics support capabilities to effectively control 
maintenance costs and uphold the highest availability rates during 
the full system lifecycle.
2. Supply chain management
    With the equipment configuration database, weapon system 
assembly line replacement unit, equipment dedicated spare parts 
56and accessories A/B type materials will be acquired by establishing 
long-term supply channels with the suppliers through foreign 
military sales, service support procedure, commercial procurement, 
basic purchase agreement and contract models. Meanwhile, general 
or consumptive materials will be acquired through cooperative 
supply contracts or hypermarket suppliers.  This will simultaneously 
achieve the goals of simplifying contract management personnel, 
reducing inventory and increasing maintenance and supply 
effectiveness.
3. Industrial Strategic alliance
    In accordance with the capacity establishment planning 
drafted according to the acquisition strategy, we will expand 
cooperation with civilian companies (domestic or international) in 
the future, encourage strategic alliance and technology transfer 
actions between international major weapon system integrators/ 
manufacturers and domestic government or business organizations, 
to strengthen the base of a self reliable defense industry, constitute 
an interwoven industrial cooperation, support networks to lower 
lifecycle cost, and enhance the effectiveness of the logistics 
support operation. Also, when authorizing system analysis for 
individual weapon system acquisition project, we will clearly specify 
industrial cooperation requirement with special evaluation on 
transferring logistics support capability to the domestic industries.  
In the meantime, we will research optimal enterprise operation 
examples (such as Performance-Based Logistics), regulate 
principles of operational logics and procedures based on national 
interests and establish optimal operational models to cooperate 
with the industries.
(V) Execution
. The draft and revision of the armaments directives has been 
successfully completed, and related guiding documents such 
as doctrines and regulations have also been in the process of 
continuous development/modification. As well, doctrine training 
conferences and facilitating sessions have been conducted, in 
hopes of effectively promoting the concept of armaments strategy 
and hence elevate the thinking, quality and effectiveness in 
armament operations among all military units to accelerate the 
modernization of the ROC armed forces, this accelerating the 
modernization of the armed forces, supplemented by constant 
expansion of the IKP (Instructor & Key Personnel) trainings to 
amplify promotional effects and thus achieve the military build-up 
57National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
mission and combat readiness.
. Armament exchange cooperations with advanced states will be 
conducted under the “Armament Strategy Planning” that is currently 
under way, along with incorporations of views from the “Ten Year 
Military Build-up Framework”, “Five Year Force Construction Plan”, 
and “Defense Policy Implementation Vision”. In practice it combines 
military strategy, force planning directives and key defense 
technology development strategies.  Predict future development 
and application planning with preset returns goals and establish 
concrete strategy and planning to push forward based on the 
nature of the domestic defense technology capabilities.  Under 
the principle of equality, mutual benefit and sharing of resources, 
we have established formal technological research cooperation 
mechanisms with advanced states around the world, and 
confirmed advanced technological cooperation agreements, and, 
currently, we are actively undergoing negotiations on individual 
information exchange and cooperation with corresponding foreign 
organizations, units or laboratories with the expectation to proceed 
with promotion of all-encompassing armament affairs cooperation.
3. The MND has completed the technology capability evaluation of 
its subordinate research and development units such as the Chung-
Shan Institute of Science and Technology, Materiel Production 
and Manufacturing Center, Joint Logistics Tactical Engineering 
Readiness Development Center, Shipbuilding Development Center, 
and Tai Chuan and Han Hsiang under the Ministry of Economic 
Affairs. The MND also implemented the defense technology 
capability database as a reference for future defense technology 
policy development and resource commercialization plans.
4. Relying on the logistical transformation experience initiated by 
the American military, we have completed the 5 logistical policy 
promotion orientations of “Full Lifecycle Project Management 
System”, “Industrial Strategic Alliance Measures”, “End-to-End 
Integrated Logistical Information Systems”, and “Developments of 
Future Logistical Professionals and Manpower” in accordance with 
the logistical strategy planning schedule and future logistical vision 
of the armed forces.
5. In terms of increasing weapon system availability rates and 
lowering maintenance costs, we have completed the following 
logistical strategy planning:
(i) “ Full Lifecycle Management ” : using weapon system project 
management methods to supervise, manage, and evaluate various 
58
activities, including “stages such as planning, development, 
production, deployment, maintenance, and retirement”.
(ii) “ Supply Chain Management ” : effectively execute operations 
such as resource planning, resource acquisition, production / 
maintenance, transportation allocation.
(iii) “ Industrial Strategic Alliance ” : employ the “efficient logistics” 
model to gradually delegate non-core maintenance work to private 
sector weapon system support integrators to assume various 
logistical support operations, and thus encourage private sector 
industry participation in defense affairs.
III. Fusion of Defense and Commercial Industries
    Based on the legislative spirit within the “National Defense 
Act” to build “a self sufficient national defense” and the policy 
guidance from the Executive Yuan to expand internal needs and 
energized domestic market, the Ministry of National Defense 
(MND) uses the operational requirements within the ten-year force 
planning as a basis, integrating with the schedule of the material 
readiness strategy, and pushes for the development of the defense 
◎ Combine domestic capabilities, develop defense technology industries, and acquire weapon 
equipments, emphasizing on self-made products, in order to actualize technologies.59National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
industry.  Through the operating model of Integrated Product 
Team (IPT), we confirmed the production capability of the local 
defense/civilian industry after technology capacity assessment and 
authorized the optimal equipment acquisition model for weapon 
systems (procurement or technology cooperation) and industrial 
cooperation needs.  We expect to improve the defense technology 
industry capacity through technology transfer or other ICP projects.  
In the meantime, we increase defense materiel research and 
production capacity of the industry through dual used technology 
development plan.  According to the regulation on the rights of 
the results of defense technology research and development, such 
technologies can be transferred to the commercial industry after 
authorizing intellectual property rights. We integrate the defense 
and commercial industry by such means to enrich our self sufficient 
defense capabilities while achieving the force planning mission and 
preparing for combat readiness.
(I) Defense resource commercialization
    With the endless market vitality and the spirit to both cultivate 
from and for the civilian markets, we assess the domestic 
production capacity within acquirable defense budgets and set the 
◎ Plan armed forces requirements and industry investment and investor willingness, adequately 
integrate defense and civilian industries, and actualize defense self-reliance.60
annual goal from 003 to 0. We also drafted related regulations 
and plans to integrate individual branches and units within the 
armed forces to promote defense resource commercialization, 
which will further help local market development and heighten 
domestic science and industry level.
1. Strategy 
    Planning for the privatization of defense resources is based on 
the concept that increasing the percentage of defense budgets 
in domestic industries can greatly encourage private sectors 
to participate in the defense establishment and assist national 
developments in industry and eco¬nomy. In addition to the 
purchase of general military requisites from domes¬tic markets, 
non-core maintenance capacities for existing weapons will be all 
privatized. If new weapon systems can be manufactured by the 
private sector, international sources will not be considered. The 
ROC Armed Forces itself will not establish any capacities. We will 
strive under the three principles of lower military engagements, 
lower foreign procurement expenditures and increased privatization 
budgets to adjust allocation of national defense resources, in order 
to increase domestic production.
2. Results
   Since Planning and execution started in 00, we have achieved 
our targeted privatization goal of NT$ 6 .9 billion and NT$ 67.3 
billion both in 006 and 007. We also expect to achieve the goal 
of NT$ 7 . billion in 008 while completing the long term major 
commercialization plans as followers:
(i)  Production of large guided missile boats.
(ii)  Production of Light, medium weight armored vehicles.
(iii) Production and maintenance of frequency-hopping radios.
(iv) Production and maintenance of eight-wheeled armored vehicles.
(v)  Strategic commercial maintenance.
(vi) Government Own Contractor Operated (GOCO) of military 
factories
3. Guidance for the future
(i) Continue promoting strategic commercial maintenance
    Continue promoting strategic commercial maintenance: The 
ROC Armed Forces will continue the overall planning for strategic 
commercial maintenance of military aircrafts and warships, and 
actively push ahead commercial maintenance of land-based 
military equipments. The aim is to establish long-term commercial 
maintenance partnerships with domestic firms.6National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
(ii) Continue increasing of domestic procurement over foreign 
acquisition and expanding defense materials production and 
maintenance certifications
    To achieve or exceed current commercialization goals is to rely 
on further acquiring or subcontracting weapon system maintenance 
through domestic industries. The MND has directed the Army, 
Navy, Air Force, Combined Logistics Command and the Armament 
Bureau to set, on an annual basis, the upper limits of foreign 
procurement and the lower limits of domestic military procurement 
and maintenance licensing, which can control and encourage 
subordinate units to truly exercise domestic procurements.
(II) The assessment of domestic industry production capacity 
1. Strategy 
   Article  of the “National Defense Act” calls for “…consolidates 
efforts of the private sector to develop technology in the defense 
industry. Acquisition of weapon equipment shall firstly consider 
domestically -made products. When it is necessary to pursuit 
outsourcing channels, the acquisition activities shall materialize 
the technology transfer policy so as to establish an autonomous 
national defense infrastructure.” The MND will achieve the goal of 
“enhance defense technology, enrich defense capabilities, integrate 
defense industry, and realized self reliant defense” through PPBS 
process and domestic production capability assessments. Any 
vehicle, ship, aviation, telecommunication, electronics, information 
and optronics investment with an acquisition amount exceeding 
NT$ 50 million is mandatory to make the assessment of domestic 
production capability and embed the assessment results and final 
analysis in the system analysis report. Domestic procurement 
must be exercised if such production capability exists in the local 
industry. Foreign procurement can be approved only when there is 
a lack of production capability in the domestic industry. All foreign 
procurement should exercise technology transfer to introduce 
advanced technology, elevate domestic defense industry level, 
energize local economy development, and tightly integrate the 
defense and local industry.
2. Results
    37 cases have been completed with domestic production 
capacity assessment process to serve as a reference for acquisition 
projects to fully integrate the defense and private sector for a self 
sufficient national defense.6(III) Industrial Cooperation Program (ICP )
1. Strategy 
    To carry out the private investment stimulus plan within the 
public economic stimulus program, the MND will include ICP 
principle articles during the acquisition planning stage to construct, 
elevate domestic industry and technology capabilities under the 
precondition that such inclusion will not affect the acquisition of the 
defense materiel. Any foreign military investment and acquisition 
projects exceeding a total value of US$5 millions must include an 
ICP agreement. The ICP quotas should exceed 40% of the overall 
commercial contract value or actual total contract value by the 
prime contractor in Foreign Military Sales projects. Execution 
methods include domestic investments, technology transfers, 
cooperative research, personnel training, domestic acquisitions, 
assistance in international sales and other activities pertaining 
to domestic investment environments. To ensure that ICP items 
meet our national needs, the MND formed the defense industry 
development team with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and local 
industry to plan requirements of the armed forces ahead and 
seek investment commitment and maintenance intention from the 
◎ Defense technologies can drive forward civilian industrial development and national resource 
allocation, enhance domestic industrial competitiveness, and encourage industrial upgrades.63National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
local industries. After completing the planning of the ICP item list, 
the Letter of Offer and Acceptance or contract will be completed 
with the foreign manufacturer to fully realize technology transfer, 
promote industry advancement and ensure the follow-on operation 
of the weapon system.
2. Results
    In addition to elevate industry capabilities through utilizing ICP 
agreements required by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the MND 
actively pursued defense industry development teaming mechanism 
to complete the integration of military and industry ICP items for 
the “Sacred Seagull Project.” We completed the negotiation with 
the foreign manufacturer in details to be included in the Industrial 
Cooperation Agreement (ICA) execution items. A Follow-up will 
continue the execution through negotiation and develop the 
assembly, operation and maintenance capability of the P-3C fixed-
wing antisubmarine aircraft with the domestic industry.
(IV) Military-civilian transferable technology development plan
1. Strategy 
    Based on the ideology that defense technology can stimulate 
private industry development and national resource sharing, the 
MND accepts the delegates from the Ministry of Economic Affairs 
for the execution of the Technology Development Program. The 
intent of the program is to transfer defense technology capabilities 
to the private companies to create business values through sharing 
of defense technology by cultivating the partnering manufacturers’ 
capability to manufacture defense materials and being devoted 
in defense research and development. The results will not only 
enhance the competitiveness of the local industries and encourage 
technology advancement; but also we are able to nurture defense 
technology capabilities in the private industry and integrate 
both parties in a joint effort to enhance the overall national 
competitiveness.
2. Results
    Key focuses of the Technology Development Program include 
telecommunication and optronics, mechanical engineering and 
transportation, materials and chemical engineering and biomedics. 
The MND has established various technical and operational 
management centers (Taichung, Chingshan and Longyuan 
campuses) to facilitate technology transfers and industrial 
upgrades. So far, there has been more than 300 companies 
participated and over ten billions of revenues generated.64

National Defense Education
    All-out defense education is the most economical and effective 
investment for national defense. In the age of globalization, national 
security has evolved from the traditional military security to comprehensive

Education Propaganda
I. Educational Objectives
    Based on the principle of “education for all”, All-out Defense Education 
involves integrating relevant departments, various levels of governmental 
agencies, all-out defense mobilization system, schools and societal 
associations to build a comprehensive all-out national defense education 
system. It is categorized into school education, government agency on-
the-job education, social education, and military artifact preservation and 
education to aim at four respective audiences. Its perspectives are based 
on five educational axes, namely, international trends, national defense 
policies, all-out defense, defense mobilization, and national defense 
technology. These axes examine hostile threats and pragmatically execute

National Defense Education various education undertakings. The hope is to achieve the objectives 
of increasing the all-out awareness for potential crisis, build an all-out 
defense consensus, and consolidate an all-out determination against the 
enemy.  
(I) Education recipients 
1.School education: To incorporate All-out defense into the curriculum of 
all schools and implement diverse teaching activities so that students can 
fully understand the importance of all-out defense. Primary schools and 
junior high schools will increase safety and disaster prevention education 
activities and field trips to military historic sites, military artifact memorials 
or military history parks; senior high schools and vocational school 
curriculum will add on All-out Defense Education courses, and include 
various field trip activities; and universities will offer national defense 
general knowledge as an elective.
2.On-the-job education for government agencies: To explain relevant 
courses of the five educational axes according to the nature of work of 
the civil servants so as to reinforce their sense of national security and 
consensus of all-out defense.
3.Social education: To target at the general public, which focuses on 
national defense common sense, military-civilian relations, civil defense, 
disaster prevention, defense mobilization and other aspects of education.
4.Military artifact preservation and education: To integrate 
governmental and social organizations of all levels to value the collection, 
keeping and management of military entities, historic sites, museums 
and memorials that possess national defense education significance. 
Using tours, illustrations, activities and other diverse means to make 
the concepts of all-out defense take root in the people and achieve the 
objective of education.
(II) Education goal
    The purpose of all-out national defense education is to raise an all-out 
awareness for potential crisis, build a defense consensus, consolidate 
an all-out determination against the enemy, and fulfill all-out defense. It 
emphasizes that there is no distinction between the frontline and rear 
area of modern warfare. Only when the people increase their awareness 
for potential crisis, stand fast in their psychological defenses, remain 
determined to protect their homes and defend their country, actively 
participate in and support national defense infrastructure, practice the all-
out defense system of  “military-civilian solidarity in peacetime and war 
time alike”, and establish a “homeland security network”, can they ensure 
the country’s safety. 
70II. Actions and Results
(I) Formulate regulations for education
    In order to properly promote and develop the legal basis and 
supplementary regulations of the All-out Defense Education, and to 
materialize the planning, implementation and assessment of the All-
out Defense Education, four regulations have been completed. They 
are the “Implementation plans for social education curriculum and 
teaching activities”, “Implementation regulations governing education 
for government agencies”, “Regulations for rewarding outstanding 
contribution”, and “Implementation regulations governing management 
of military artifact and military historic sites”, all of which detailed the 
respective tasks and responsibilities and the relevant agencies designated 
to complete the sub-plans and promote various education undertakings.
(II) Academic seminars
    In order to strengthen academic research on All-out Defense Education, 
effectively integrate the departments of the Executive Yuan and the 
research resources of non-governmental organizations, colleges and 
universities, the National Defense University held an “All-out Defense 
Education Academic Seminar” on August 0, 007. More than three 
hundred participants attended and engaged in fervent discussion, 
including the National Defense Committee from the Legislative Yuan, 
executives of All-out Defense Education promotion agencies from the 
Executive Yuan and local governments, and non-governmental experts 
and academicians. Their suggestions have served as references for All-out 
Defense Education policies.
(III) Implement troop education
    In response to the development of the relationship between the two 
sides of the Strait and Taiwan’s political environment, coupled with current 
needs of military buildup and combat readiness, plans have been made to 
produce programs and broadcast in the “ Ju-Kun TV Campus” using short-
films, seminars, and TV speeches featuring All-out Defense Education, 
so as to raise an awareness for potential crisis among servicemen and 
cultivate military ethics through animated means, which in turn will 
consolidate cohesion, boost troops’ morale, deepen psychological 
combat capability, keep concentration on combat training, increase 
tangible operation capability, and achieve the Armed Forces’ mission with 
full strength.
(IV) Emphasize school education
    In order for All-out Defense Education to take root, integrative teaching 
is adopted for elementary and junior high schools. Teaching CDs have 
been produced and plans are to conduct “teaching symposiums” and 
7National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
teachers’ on-the-job training at the beginning of 008 and incorporate 
the teachings into current curriculum in 009. High school and vocational 
school courses on “National Defense General Education” will be taught 
by military instructors from 006 to 008. After 009, All-out Defense 
Education curriculum will be implemented, in which there will be two 
compulsory credits during their first year. Colleges and universities are left 
to devise the name, content and implementation methods of the all-out 
defense curriculum themselves with plans to be submitted to the Ministry 
of Education for approval in accordance with the University Act.
(V) Strengthen on-the-job training
    In order to enhance the national consciousness of the civil servants 
and their understanding towards defense affairs, regular All-out 
Defense Education is carried out on a regular basis as prescribed by 
the “Implementation regulations governing education for government 
agencies” for 65 agencies including departments at the Executive 
Yuan and city and county governments. Professional instructors are 
appointed for the task of lecturing. Since its implementation in 006, 
,007 seminars have been conducted for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and other agencies in which 07,7 6 people were trained. Satisfaction 
level surveyed by questionnaires reached more than 80%, indicating an 
effective increase in the defense knowledge of those trained. In addition, 
considering that the Internet can deliver education resource sharing 
benefits, education learning networks such as the Executive Yuan’s “Civil 
Service Development Institute” and “Public Service e-Learning Web” are 
integrated to build all-out defense learning. It is roughly estimated that 
6,975 people have visited the websites and the effectiveness of on-the-job

(VI) Promoting social education
    The Department of Social Education 
of the Ministry of Education, National 
Police Agency, National Fire Agency of the 
Ministry of the Interior, and Government 
Information Office jointly organized an 
“Implementation plans for social education 
curriculum and teaching activities”. In 
order to develop social education and 
stimulate all-out defense consciousness, 
the plan prescribes that the county and 
city governments, cultural centers and 
agencies concerned are to promote all-out 
defense concepts among neighborhoods 
and communities, non-governmental 
organizations and social groups by 
integrating with community learning. In 
addition, the plan seeks to promote all-out 
defense concepts through mass media in 
collaboration with the “Wan-An Exercises”. 
An all-out defense website is also built to 
provide information on regulations, military 
summer camps or trivia quizzes, Q&A and 
other exciting activities to increase the 
public’s understanding of the significance 
of all-out defense. Since July 006, over 
,08,343 people have visited the site to 
date.
(VII) Military artifact preservation
    The goal is to properly preserve military 
historic sites, museums, and memorials, 
honor the historical events of the Armed 
Forces, and encourage an all-out  
awareness for potential crisis. Therefore, 
in accordance with the “Implementation 
regulations governing management 
of military artifact and military historic 
sites”, existing 308 collected records 
of relics, historical buildings, military 
history parks that are of national defense 73National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
significance in various counties and cities serve as scenic spots for the 
Cultural Foundation and local county and city governments to incorporate 
into the overall travel itineraries. And through the guided tours, they 
can bring about a tourism fever. Since opening in July 006, the Armed 
Forces Museum has held 4 0 special exhibitions with 73,99  participants. 
In addition, Armed Forces retired equipment was given to the local 
governments to build military historical parks that fulfill both educational 
and promotional functions.
(VIII) Enrich the teaching materials
    In order to enhance the all-out education curriculum and effectively 
implement on-the-job education for government agencies, the Command 
Headquarters of each force and the National Defense University 
appointed 00 instructors to participate in the instructor seminar 
conducted by the National Defense University and 64 qualified instructors 
were chosen to serve on-the-job itinerant education assignments for 
government agencies. In addition, to provide teaching and reference 
materials for All-out Defense Education of various academies of the Armed 
Forces and schools of all levels, a teaching material editing team is set up 
to produce various types of auxiliary material. The materials are guided by 
five major educational axes and categorized into two types as university 
and on-the-job education, and high school and social education. 
Altogether there are nine textbooks as references for high and vocational 
schools and above.
(IX) Implement all-out defense
    Summon mobilization cadres of all levels to implement education 
research and study in the form of academic speeches, professional 
subject lectures and wargame. Incorporate them into relevant all-out 
defense curriculum to fulfill all-out defense mobilization education. 
Additionally, in collaboration with “Han Kuang Exercises”, invite various 
departments, county and city government, and public enterprises to 
participate in field military drills. Use homeland security protection as 
the main axis and mobilization, civil defense, counter-terrorism, disaster 
prevention and other contingency mechanisms as the drill themes to build 
an all-out defense consensus and establish a strong  “homeland security 
network”.
(X) Visit county and city governments for evaluation
    In order to understand the actual efficacy of All-out Defense Education 
implemented by the departments of the Executive Yuan, relevant agencies 
of special municipalities and counties and cities, and schools of various 
levels, visits to 5 county and city governments were paid from September 
9 to October 5, 007. The main points were “to explain the All-out 
74Defense Education Act and policies”, “to understand the current status of 
various tasks” and “to engage in experience sharing and views exchange”. 
The conclusions serve as references for promoting and developing All-out 
Defense Education.
III. Future Direction
(I) Enact implementation rules and clarify tasks and duties
    Actively engage in the draft and enactment of the three regulations, 
namely, “Implementation regulations for promoting All-out Defense 
Education”, “Implementation regulations for all-level schools to promote 
education” and “Instructor training program”. And plan and formulate 
“Amendment or enforcement rules of the All-out Defense Education Act”, 
“A statute governing the appointment of all-out defense educators”, 
“Regulations for rewarding outsourcing research”, “Act of establishment 
and administration of the All-out Defense Education base” and establish 
the “All-out Defense Education policy and assessment”. These regulations 
specify duties of execution and put implementation and review into effect 
to promote the All-out Defense Education step-by-step.
(II) Strengthen inter-agency coordination and integrate education 
resources
    Consolidate consensus through inter-agency coordination mechanism. 
Integrate the education resources of various departments of the Executive 
Yuan, schools and all walks of society.  Within the scope of school 
education, government agencies’ on-the-job education, social education, 
military artifact preservation and education, promote various tasks of All-
out Defense Education, so as to stimulate consciousness in all people to 
protect their country and fulfill all-out defense.
(III) Cultivate instructors and substantiate education capacity
    For the mid-tem and long-term training of all-out defense instructors, 
plans are that the National Defense University will cooperate with civilian 
universities where teachers’ training centers are available to set up 
instructor training classes. In addition, there is also the plan to establish 
an All-out Defense Education strategic alliance, long-distance All-out 
Defense Education instructor training, All-out Defense Education instructor 
training for all levels of schools, and instructor training of on-the-job 
education for all agencies and departments. A complete instructor talents 
database is to be set up to meet the needs of future education promotion.

Chapter  Serving All CItizen
    Defending homeland security and protecting our people’s well-being 
is the responsibility and duty of the ROC Armed Forces. In recent years, 
the Armed Forces have made concerted efforts in promoting the “Three-
Assurance Policy”. It has allowed all soldiers to enjoy peace of mind and 
serve their posts with due diligence in protecting homeland security. 
More so, as family lives are protected, it has become, in an intangible 
way, an important strength in stabilizing the society. Furthermore, in view 
of the responsibility of protecting the people’s well-being, the Armed 
Forces have reinforced their social services through proactive policy 
enforcements such as disaster relief, health care and disease prevention 
and control, maintenance of law and order, environmental protection, 
homeland restoration, river dredging, offshore islands demining, and 
military-civilian interaction. At the same time, the Armed Forces, based 
on the principle of “administration by law”, have been active in putting 
administrative reliefs in practice. They include the servicemen and people’
s rights protection, appeals, state compensation, disengaging military 
control and no- or limited-construction area, and compensation for 
damages caused by military services. The abovementioned policies and 
actions and results of the Armed Forces’ proactive services to all citizens 
aim to establish a trustworthy image of the Armed Forces and create an 
atmosphere for all citizens to support national defense. This facilitates 
defense by all citizens and realizes all-out defense.
Section 1
Three-assurance Policy
   
    “Taking up weapons to protect the country” is the duty of the Armed 
Forces. In order to express his concern for the ROC servicemen 
and support for the national defense policy, President Chen Shui-
bien proposed the “three-assurance policy” of assuring “troop safety,

The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
THE REPUBLIC OF CHINATAIWAN
Chapter  Serving All CItizen servicemen family security, and peace of mind for military dependents” 
on May , 000, during his exhortation to the servicemen at the Kinmen 
defense zone. The aim is to reward the hard work of the military personnel 
and their families with reasonable return; and at the same time, enable 
the servicemen to be worry-free and fully committed to combat readiness 
duties. In recent years, the Armed Forces’ concerted efforts in pushing 
the “three-assurance policy” not only have allowed all soldiers to serve 
their posts with due diligence, the protection of their family lives has also 
created an three-win situation for the troops, military personnel and their 
families. In an intangible way, this has become an important strength in 
stabilizing the society, fulfilling the policy objectives of bolstering the 
Armed Forces’ operation capabilities and realizing all-out defense.
I. Policy Objectives
(I) Troop safety
    Troop safety is the cornerstone for consolidating combat capabilities 
of the forces; it is also a key concern of our people. The major tasks of 
the Armed Forces are to solidify the servicemen’s loyalty and patriotism 
toward their country, streamline combat readiness training, establish 
security early-warning and handling mechanism, prevent security-
compromising events and counter enemy conspiracy activities. They are 
carried out in conjunction with enhancement in “humanistic management”, 
“psychological counseling”, and “military discipline education”. This 
ensures the safety of the Armed Forces and builds it into a strong national 
defense force. Their families can be rest assured that their loved ones 
serving in the military are in good hands as they answer their call to 
defend the country and protect the people.
(II) Servicemen family security
    Family is a relationship that no individual can break away from. Family 
values have become universal values. The Armed Forces have formulated 
relevant statutes governing military personnel welfare in accordance with 
the ‘National Defense Act” to safeguard the servicemen’s welfare and 
bolster welfare services to their families. Existing resources of the society 
and local governments are to be actively leveraged in multifaceted and 
collaborated manners to look after the family lives of military personnel. 
All are so the servicemen can be worry-free and concentrate on their 
combat training routines.
(III) Peace of mind for military dependents
    This policy seeks to reassure the families of the Armed Forces regarding 
their loved ones serving in the military and thus obtain their cooperation 
86and support on national defense matters. The Armed Forces have been 
active in improving the living quality of the servicemen, enhancing 
services and care to the servicemen and protecting their legitimate rights 
and interests. They have also implemented services for dependents of 
mandatory soldiers, established communication channels for civil affairs, 
increased dependents gatherings, family activities and national defense 
journeys of discovery, and other activities. This reinforces the two-way 
communication and positive interactions between the forces and families 
in hopes of achieving the goal of uniting the families.
II. Actions and Results
(I) Troop safety
1.Implement patriotism education and increase conviction to fight 
against the enemy
(i) Arouse patriotic sentiments 
    Using the “ Ju-Kuang TV Campus” TV programs as the platform, 
education is administered via four channels, namely, troop education, 
school education, new recruit education and reserve education. 
Supplementing it are Armed Forces News, VHBN radio programs, 
promotional materials and education for special projects. This will 
establish the servicemen’s ability to accurately discern values and 
concepts such as loyalty and treachery, right and wrong, and good and 
evil; raise their awareness for potential crisis; and strengthen their belief 
in “why they fight and for whom they fight”. This will unite the tangible 
combat capabilities with the intangible, consolidate the servicemen’s 
consensus to work together and harness the effectiveness of education.    
(ii) Stand fast in the conviction to fight against the enemy 
◎ The “three-assurances policy” enables all soldiers to 
serve their posts and perform on their duties◎ The Armed Forces actively improve servicemen’s quality of life 
and enhance servicemen care so they are not distracted and 
can concentrate on combat training

    According to the “Guidance program for the planning and development 
of military training ground”, there were 66 cases of training ground 
renovations of various sorts in 007, costing NT$ 97.39 million. In the 
future, in response to adjustments in force personnel training, the plan is 
to extend the six training grounds, namely, Kengtzukou, Hukou, Hushan, 
Chiangchunshan, Fusing South Barrack and Tri-Force Combined Logistics 
Base, so as to eliminate potential factors of danger in training grounds. 
(ii) Establish the expertise certificate system
     Troop training will adopt a gradual manner with qualification certificates 
to successively upgrade training standards and achieve the training 
targets one by one. Also to be enforced is that, before completing 
88the “professional skills training” and “skills assessment qualification 
certificate”, servicemen cannot be appointed tasks which are not their 
trained expertise and dangerous, so as to ensure personnel safety.
5. Strictly enforce secret protection disciplines to ensure security 
of classified military information
(i) Strictly enforce troop discipline on secret protection operations 
    In accordance with the “Classified National Security Information 
Protection Act” and other related secret protection regulations, the 
Armed Forces are to implement inspection and audit to protect classified 
information on a regular and irregular basis. In the event of any deficiency, 
improvement must be promptly called for to strictly enforce secret 
protection disciplines.
(ii) Implement safety assessments on sensitive billets 
    In order to warrant personnel safety, safety assessments on planes, 
ships, armored fighting vehicles and weaponry units that require only a 
few men to operate on and key personnel in roles responsible for sensitive 
information are conducted every June and December. The assessment 
results will be categorized and handled according to the degree of safety 
it affects on the troops. This is so that personnel with safety concerns will 
be addressed with appropriate measures for the effective control of safety 
of key units.
(iii) Strengthen the operation procedure of confidentiality on 
special projects 
    For sensitive investment projects such as the Armed Forces combat 
preparation exercise and training, military cooperation exchange, major 
military procurement, weaponry R&D and testing, C4ISR integration 
and forces and firepower deployment, the entire Armed Forces are 
strictly required to complete the “Special confidentiality provisions” at 
the beginning of the projects and implements secrete protection and 
security maintenance at various stages. In addition, in response to the 
implementation of various sensitive projects, conference anti-interception 
inspections and secrete protection and security maintenance are carried 
out to effectively protect the confidentiality and safety of sensitive 
projects.
6. Management of crisis prevention to protect the Armed Forces’ 
image
(i) Strengthen joint operation command mechanism 
    Operation command agencies of all levels are guided to form a “joint 
operation command center” in accordance to the principle of “uniformity 
between peacetime and wartime”. This is so to supervise and command 
contingency response troops of all levels to adopt contingent actions

(II) Soldier family security
1.Strengthen legal services and 
implement the complaint system
(i) Legal services
    In order to answer any legal queries 
of the servicemen, their dependents 
and hired personnel, and protect their 
legal rights and interests as well as 
provide legal advisory services to various 
agencies and forces, the MND, military 
command quarters, higher-grade Military 
Court and its branch courts, and local 
military courts all have legal service 
windows that provide services such 
as legal advice, contract review and 
litigation. The MND also promulgated the 
“Enforcement Rules for Military Personnel 
Legal Service"” to protect the legal rights 
and interests of various units, servicemen 
and dependents of the Armed Forces. 
And in order to broaden those being 
served, an amendment was made on 
July 7, 007 so that more could obtain 
legal services. These include those who 
breached a regulation and are subject to 
criminal investigation, trial or litigation, 
or who are subject to administrative 
disciplines due a breach in disciplinary 
action, and who violate a regulation of 
the Armed Forces. In addition, through 90the production of “Legal Window” broadcast in the VHBN radio program, 
common legal sense and government regulations are enhanced.
(ii) Lawsuit assistance 
    The MND has promulgated the “Processing Regulations for Legal 
Assistance for Servicemen Involving in Lawsuit on Duty” and processed 
grants for Armed Forces personnel who are involved in litigation due to 
public duties. A total of 8 lawyers are appointed across the country, 
Kinmen and Penghu areas to guide the affiliated agencies to process 
administrative litigation cases. At the same time, assist the soldiers 
and families in civil and criminal cases and provide services such as 
mediation, reconciliation, writing legal complaints, and court defense. 
Additionally, the “Guideline for Military Personnel Legal Services” was 
promulgate as the basis for processing applications and transfers. In 
007, 7,6  cases of legal queries were answered and 659 cases of 
litigation were counseled, proving to be quite effective.

“985 Complaint Line”. Its services include consultations regarding the 
violation of the servicemen’s legal rights and interests, improper discipline 
administered to and grievances of the servicemen as an individual, 
violation of the servicemen’s dependents to enjoy concessions, and any 
cases that fall within the scope of Armed Forces human resource service, 
operation training, logistics supply and maintenance, medical care, law, 
procurement, dependent’s loans, psychological counseling, military 
discipline, corrections and reserve management. Since the setup of the 
“985 Complaint Line”, more than 500 cases of complaints and close to

servicemen with dependents purchase houses, putting 
the soldier family security policy in practice◎ The Armed Forces’ services to dependents of standing 
soldiers present a positive effect in aggregating the hearts of 
military dependents and boosting the morale of the forces
9National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
40,000 cases requiring advisory service were received. The cases have 
all been processed, making the system effective in assisting the Armed 
Forces dealing with problems and providing advice.
(iv) Dependents subsidy 
    Through the “Military Personnel and Dependents Assistance 
Foundation”, continue to enhance care on the life, welfare and interests of 
the servicemen and families, as well as compensation measures for those 
who suffered injuries or death and for bereaved families caused by military 
activities so the servicemen can be worry-free.
2.Adjust the roster for forces in preparation for combat to better 
care for the families
    In accordance with the “Enforcement Regulation of the Management of 
Accidents during General Combat Ready Status”, “Armed Forces Combat 
Readiness Regulations” and “Strong and Stable Operation Plans”, 
promote work schedule plans for non-combat duty personnel. At this 
stage, in response to the work policy of non-combat duty personnel, the 
Armed Forces have completed many concrete supplementary measures 
such as “Amending the roster of senior official and intelligence watch at 
base”, “Modifying the combat forces grouping and roster methods”, and 
“Reducing and combining watch duties”. Implementing roster according 
to the existing regulations does not affect combat readiness and takes 
good care of families at the same time.
3.Continue to renovate old military quarters to help servicemen 
purchase properties
    Continue to carry out site rebuilding of old military quarters to 
settle the existing dwellers. Currently 9 sites such as the Taipei City 
“Communications and Air Traffic Wing” have been completed to rehouse 
8,78 households. Those under construction are 4 sites of the Keelung 
City “Sea Village” expected to rehouse 3,860 households. Those 
awaiting construction include the three sites of the Taipei City “New 
Village” estimated to rehouse 3,367 households. Eight sites such as the 
“Ilan County Government Center” are under planning and are undergoing 
rebuilding as planned. Application to purchase houses rebuilt from old 
military quarters is open for servicemen who have families but no dwelling. 
And as prescribed by the overall housing policy of the Executive Yuan, the 
families of the servicemen are assisted in their purchase of state housing 
and private properties.
4.Encourage advanced study in spare time to enhance the 
servicemen’s expertise and capabilities
(i) As prescribed by the “Implementation Rules governing Military 
Personnel Studies in Spare Time”, integrate education resource to obtain 
9a degree or license to elevate the caliber of the Armed Forces manpower. 
5,98 people have been trained over the years.
(ii) Plan to conduct “Armed Forces personnel training class for spare time 
certificates”, “Middle rank officers and base level management” and other 
classes to enhance the servicemen’s skills and qualifications.  
5. Collaborate with employment guidance to assist the retired 
servicemen in starting a business
(i) Promulgate the “Implementation plan of Armed Forces retired 
servicemen occupational training”, and supervise the retiring servicemen 
to acquire some skills before retirement. And conduct pre-retirement 
vocational training classes for soldiers with mid and long-term service and 
recruitment and career seminars of domestic enterprises to help retiring 
servicemen plan their next stage in life.
(ii) According to the “Enforcement Rules for the Employment Services of 
Retired Servicemen in the Armed Forces” promulgated by the Executive 
Yuan, the MND has coordinated with the National Youth Commission, 
Council of Labor Affairs, and Veterans Affairs Commission to work together 
in selecting employment service organizations, setting up the Armed 
Forces Retired Servicemen Employment Service Center, and conducting 
domestic enterprise recruitments and career counseling seminars. This 
is so that the servicemen can enter the job market immediately after they 
retire. Over the past years,  employment itinerant seminars have been 
conducted with a participation of 9,749 retired servicemen.
(III) Peace of mind for the soldiers’ families
1. Improve living facilities of the servicemen so their families feel 
assured 
    Improve the servicemen’s living facilities to increase their quality of life 
as prescribed by the “Guidelines of Armed Forces Building Infrastructure”. 
In 007, 4 cases of “Improvement project on the Army’s urgent living 
facilities” were implemented to provide the servicemen comfortable living 
space.
2. Implement services for dependents of mandatory service 
soldiers to make servicemen worry-free
    In order to make servicemen worry-free and concentrate on combat 
training, the Armed Forces have assisted in serving families of standing 
soldiers through Military Friends Society and the county (city) military 
service stations. In 007, 675 people were offered condolences on 
emergency situations, 7 ,505 people were visited on contact itineraries, 
593 people were serviced via the dependents network, and 8 cases 
were subject to coordinated corrections. This has a positive effect in 
aggregating the hearts of military dependents and boosting the morale of 
93National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
the forces.
3. Reinforce familial functions to gain support for national defense
    In accordance with the “Implementation Rules of Family Activities 
for Military Dependents”, invite the servicemen’s families to participate 
in model commendation and family activities to enhance two-way 
communication and positive interaction, thereby gaining the families’ 
backing. In 007, 3, 54 functions were conducted and 370, 55 family 
members participated, which were good results.
4. Complete living care and assist with relief and finance 
management loans
(i) Childcare nursery services 
    By means of “strategic alliance”, the MND Welfare Section signed 
agreements with quality childcare institutions of each county and city 
to offer childcare concessions for military personnel. At present, 6 0 
private childcare institutions have signed and the number is planned to 
increase gradually. The objective is to have contracted institutions in every 
township, village, and city so as to fulfill care for military dependents.
(ii) Emergency relief and special financial loans 
    This is due to the difficulty in controlling the servicemen’s loans outside 
the bases; some servicemen have borrowed money from covert money 
dealers with adverse consequences. In order to prevent servicemen from 
falling into the hands of covert money dealers, the Armed Forces have 
persisted in promoting the correct concepts of financial management 
and reinforce military discipline inspections. The “Implementation Rules 
governing the Military Financial Loans Assistance” were promulgated in 
September 005 to help servicemen look for suitable borrowing channels 
◎ The Armed Forces improve medical care services so 
the servicemen can obtain sound medical care◎ Implement the welfare services policy so the servicemen 
and their dependents can obtain sound care
94for emergency relief loans and resolve the disciplinary problems within the 
Armed Forces. Up to November 9, 007, the number of applicants has 
reached more than 0,000 with approved loans of 5.8 billion NTD.
(iii) Carry out accident insurance for active servicemen
    To ensure the lives of the servicemen and their families are indeed 
protected and worry-free, 66 personnel received compensation from injury 
and accident insurance in 007.
5. Link with social support network to look after servicemen with 
mental disability
(i) Improve psychological counseling measures
    Actively integrate the Armed Forces’ psychological counseling 
resources and social support network by adding a “Counseling” entry on 
the homepage of the MND website to serve all servicemen and dependents 
and for the general public’s use.
(ii) Set up home centers
    Establish district home centers by unit of operational zone to serve 
as transit centers between the troops and hospitals for taking in 
personnel suspected to suffer from mental illness, emotional disorders, 
maladjustment and chronic illness. Currently, the Combined Logistics 
Command has completed the establishment of 7 home centers across the 
northern, central, southern, eastern and off-shore areas. The centers will 
provide proper care to the mentally impaired servicemen and enhance 
medical care services and psychological counseling.
6. Improve medical and health service and provide proper 
treatment and care
(i) Medical and health service 
    Establish online registration by leveraging Internet technology. At 
present, nine hospitals including the Taipei Veterans Hospital, and those 
in Kaohsiung, Taichung, Taoyuan, Hualien, Zuoying, Songshan, Beitou and 
Gangshan have fully implemented it. 
(ii) Treatment subsidy 
    In the event of injury resulted from public duties, the servicemen 
may seek emergency medical service at private hospitals and apply for 
subsidies. Furthermore, upon cessation of service and retirement, shall 
the wounds have not recovered, medical care and physiotherapy shall 
continue.
III. Future Direction
(I) Develop the military secret protection legal system to ensure 
forces safety
    “The Classified National Security Information Protection Act” and 
95National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
“Classified Military Information and National Defense Secrets Types and 
Scope Classification Criteria” have been respectively implemented since 
003. Based on serious secret protection legal system, the Armed Forces 
have reviewed the current “Implementation Rules Governing Armed Forces 
Secrecy” and modified the contents to a large extent. The “Guidelines 
for Armed Forces Secret Protection Tasks” are to be promulgated in 
008 in the hope to integrate with other national laws and reinforce the 
servicemen’s concepts towards secret protection legal system. They shall 
also serve as the basis for the entire Armed Forces’ “administration by 
law”.
(II) Promote soldiers welfare regulations to fulfill soldier family 
security
   Article 6 of the “National Defense Act” states: “The status of the active 
soldiers shall be respected and their benefits, insurance, compensation, 
welfare, rewards and discipline and other rights shall be prescribed 
by law.” The MND is currently deliberating to formulate the draft of the 
“Soldiers Welfare Regulations” which aim to regulate the welfare items that 
the servicemen and dependents now enjoy but have no legal basis. Under 
the planning principles of “not adding to the national defense budget” and 
“not increasing the personnel establishment”, departmental discussions, 
joint review, internal deliberation meetings, and servicemen, scholar and 
experts workshops will continue to be held, so that the soldiers’ welfare 
system can be better and comprehensive.
(III) Prioritize appointment by domicile address to enhance peace 
of mind among families
    Under the premises of meeting the requirements of the troops’ duties, 
there are plans to prioritize appointment of the standing soldiers by their 
domicile by allotment. For off-shore, eastern and remote areas, domicile 
priority and volunteer methods will be adopted. In the event of inadequate 
staffing, neighboring counties and cities will reinforce support first. The 
principle is to avoid support across areas. In addition, enlisted personnel 
are appointed to serve in the northern, central, southern, eastern and 
islets and off-shore areas. Their service units can be rearranged according 
to the family residence or by indication and their appointment will continue 
to be arranged close to their family domicile.

National Defense Report
Section 2  
Social Services
    In view of the duties to protect our people’s well-being and under the 
Executive Yuan’s policy directive of “applying military training in civilian 
construction” and the premise of “not affecting military combat readiness, 
not compromising military command systems and not exceeding military 
support capabilities”, the military has taken the initiative to incorporate 
social service tasks into its “homeland defense” mission. The tasks 
include disaster rescue, medical and health care and disease prevention 
and control, law and order maintenance, environmental protection, 
homeland restoration, river dredging, islets demining, and military-civilian 
interactions. This serves to build a trustworthy image of the Armed Forces 
and promotes the all-out defense policy.
I. Policy Objectives
(I)  Full disaster relief efforts
    Pursuant to the guidelines of “Disaster Prevention and Protection Act” 
and “Regulations Governing Application for Military Support and Disaster 
Handling” and under the guidance of the “Central Disaster Response 
Center” of the Executive Yuan, various disaster response mechanisms are 
coordinated to synchronously set up disaster relief, typhoon prevention 
command centers at all levels to effectively harness manpower, transport 
vehicles, machineries and various resources. This enables disaster relief 
work in the first hour and reduces civilian casualties and assets loss to the 
minimum.
(II)  Medical care and disease prevention
    This is categorized into “medical and health care”, “first-aid training”, 
“military medicine”, “biohazard medical disposal” and “disease 
prevention”. The Armed Forces are proactive in promoting medical and 
health care and disease prevention. Besides providing the servicemen 
and dependents with proper medical and health care to ensure prevention 
measures for the personal safety of the servicemen and maintenance of 
sanitation for military bases, the Armed Forces also assist governments at 
97National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
all levels to maintain cleanliness in areas 
undergoing disease prevention and 
control operations, so as to effectively 
contain the epidemic spread.
(III)  Assist in the maintenance of 
law and order
    In order to help safeguard social 
stability, the military police, in  
conjunction with the “Code of Criminal 
Procedure”, “Regulations on Assigning 
Judicial Police”, and “Military and Police 
Support Protocol”, focuses on matters 
of military relevance to help judicial 
agencies enforce law and order. It also 
integrates with the police administration 
to establish comprehensive crisis early 
warning capabilities in peacetime.
(IV) Carry out environmental 
protection
    In order to fulfill the environment and 
natural resources protection obligations, 
the Armed Forces facilitate in promoting 
national environmental protection 
policies including “waste reduction by 
classification, resource recycling and 
reuse, and green purchases”, “public 
hazard and pollution prevention and 
control”, “biodiversity conservation” 
and “sustainable development of the 
environment” and implement relevant 
environmental and ecological protection 
tasks.
(V) Strengthen homeland restoration
    In order to unite national defense and 
the society, the Armed Forces integrate 
training routines and plan mountain 
marching training for the special 
operation forces involving “walking, 
training, planting, and restoring at the 
same time”. This carries out homeland 
restoration tasks such as tree plantation,

effects of servicemen training as well as the achievement of prevention.
(VI) Assist river dredging
    Based on the positive mindset of “disaster prevention and homeland 
defense”, the Armed Forces have assisted local governments in river 
dredging tasks. The rivers are also used as simulation training fields to 
provide the servicemen the opportunity of on-site practice and training. 
It also allows them to gain special skills before service ends, thereby 
increasing their employment opportunities and achieving the objective of 
win-win for all.
(VII) Demining actively in islets
    Engage in large area landmine removal tasks in Kinmen and Matzu 
areas. To save the public’s money and collaborate with the government in 
establishing the off-shore islands policy, the Army Command Headquarters 
formed a demining group on April , 007, which is dedicated to execute 
independent demining and commissioned demining management tasks. It 
is estimated that the demining tasks will be completed within the statutory 
deadline in 03.
(VIII)  Implement military-civilian interaction
    Through civil affairs coordination conferences and family and good 
neighbor activities, the Armed Forces engage in good military-civilian 
communication during peacetime to nurture military-civilian relations, 
eliminate potential resistance, and implement the annual exercise and 
training tasks. In addition, we work in conjunction with the “national 
defense service team” of the local joint service centers of the Executive 
Yuan, which functions as a “single window” to provide the public with 
advisory service on national defense affairs and process trust, complaints 
and resistance cases, thereby building a trusted public image of the 
Armed Forces.
II.  Actions and Results
(I)  Disaster relief
    “The Armed Forces Joint Operation Command Center” served 
concurrently as the Armed Forces crisis management center is on duty 
4 hours. Under the guidance of the “Executive Yuan Central Disaster 
Response Center”, it collaborated with the operation of various disaster 
response mechanisms to simultaneously establish disaster relief and 
typhoon prevention command centers at all levels, effectively leveraging 
manpower, transportation vehicles and machineries and resources to 
respond to any disaster at any time, thereby safeguarding our people’s 
99National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
lives and properties. From July , 006 to December 3 , 007, the Armed 
Forces have performed five major disaster rescues, namely Bilis, 0608 
Torrential Rain, Pabuk, Wutip, Sepat and Krosa Typhoons, and 68 general 
search and rescue tasks. The Armed Forces disaster response center 
always completes the tasks entrusted by the Central Disaster Response 
Center. A total of 8,86 military personnel were assigned and aircrafts, 
ships, vehicles and machineries were sent as support for disaster relief 
such as search and rescue transport, medical and nursing care for the 
injured, wastes clearance, environmental sanitization, and crop harvest 
assistance. See Table - for details.
(II) Medical care and disease prevention
1.  Armed forces hospitals provide proper medical care to 
servicemen and families
    Servicemen who are hospitalized longer than that covered by the 
National Health Insurance (NHI) and require further medical care upon 
doctor confirmation, the “Implementation Rules Governing Concessions 
for Medical Treatment at Armed Forces Medical Care Institutions” was 
promulgated on April 7, 007, to ensure that the servicemen receive 
timely and appropriate medical care services. Families of soldiers or 
deceased servicemen holding valid identification will receive concessions 
Table -    Statistics of the Armed Forces aids to local county 
(city) governments during major disasters300of varying degrees depending on regulations when seeking medical 
treatment at military hospitals. This is so that medical care of military 
dependents could obtain concrete protection. In addition, in response to 
subsidies granted to servicemen who were injured during official duties 
and sought treatment in private hospitals, the “Subsidy Regulations for 
Medical Care Costs Paid to Servicemen for Their Injuries during Official 
Duties” were promulgated on June , 007. Servicemen can apply for 
subsidies for the co-payment or medical costs not covered by the NHI 
during hospitalization, so the purpose of looking after the servicemen can 
be fulfilled.
2.  Armed forces first-aid training
   Since 988, the MND has been actively promoting self-rescue and 
mutual aid training and first-aid qualification training for troop units 
to improve the medical care quality of the Armed Forces troops and 
strengthen the emergency rescue and casualty evacuation capacities 
during peacetime and wartime. The MND Medical Affairs Bureau appointed 
the Combined Logistics School and other relevant agencies to conduct 
the “Armed Forces Emergency First-aid Training Class” and formed an

3.  Develop military medicine
    The structure, functions, and dynamics of modern aircraft and 
submarines has evolved quickly. Phenomena such as high and low altitude 
pressures, temperature changes, acceleration, spatial disorientation, noise 
and vibration can easily exceed the limits of human physiology. Therefore, 
aviation and diving medicine, which are exclusives of military medicine 
and closely linked to the enhancement of combat strength in the frontline, 
have become two of the major focuses of military medical research 
institutions. Maintaining the physical and mental health of aviation and 
diving personnel is the mandate and undoubted mission of aviation and 
diving medicine. Thus, the selection, health care, occupational safety, 
accident investigation, and other operations of these special personnel 
will all depend on the efforts of specialized medical staff and the sound 
development of the research system. Their efforts will guarantee flight 
safety and submarine missions, improve control of quality, and maintain 
combat power.
(1)  Aviation medicine
A. Aviation physiological training readiness 
    The Armed Forces Gangshan Hospital completed building the “ejection 
seat”, “spatial disorientation aircraft” and “night vision/night vision 
Table -     Statistics on Personnel Undergoing the Armed Forces 
First-aid Training30goggles training system” and 
various aviation physiological training equipment to combine with the 
existing “human body centrifugal machine”, “high pressure chamber”, 
“low pressure chamber” and other equipments. It seeks to build a 
comprehensive Armed Forces’ aviation physiological training center to 
serve as a basis of flight training for pilots. In addition, to ensure the 
continuous and safe operation of the aviation physiological equipment, 
a maintenance cost of 80,0 0,000NTD was budgeted for a span of five 
years. 66,584,000NTD have been spent in 006 and 007 to ensure the 
effective operation of the equipment.
B. Flight crew training
   The “Training Standards of Aviation Medicine” (version ) were 
promulgated on April , 007 to implement Armed Forces aviation 
medicine practices. In 006 and 007, ,594 and ,76 flight crew 
respectively were given aviation physiology training; 59  and 469 night 
vision training; and 79 and 7 high G centrifuge training, effectively 
preventing flight accidents.
C. Aviation doctors, nurses and instructors training 
    Carry out the “Implementation plan of aviation doctor, nurse, and 
aviation physiology instructor training class” on a yearly basis. The Armed 
Forces Gangshan Hospital will be responsible for curriculum planning 
and implementation. It will also invite relevant domestic experts and 
scholars to teach and implement pre-job training for the newly appointed 
aviation doctors, nurses and reserve aviation physiology instructors to 
fulfill the requirements of professional medical, nursing and physiological 
knowledge for air operations of the army, navy and air force. It also 
safeguards flight security and enhances the air service troops’ combat 
capabilities.
◎ The Armed Forces hospitals provide medical care 
services to ensure that servicemen receive timely and 
appropriate diagnosis for health maintenance◎ Diving personnel work in high-pressure environment 
for long hours so regular eye structure and cornea 
examinations are performed to maintain their health303National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
D. Flight crew health care 
    In addition to the annual physical examination, a "Procedure of Applying 
for Examination Result and Appealing for Reexamination" for those who 
cannot pass the examination is proposed to validate the physical fitness of 
flight personnel. 
(2) Submarine medicine
A.  Submarine (diving) medicine training
    In order to enhance understanding of the Navy surgeons on the 
practice of submarines and diving medicine, the “Navy surgeon pre-
service training and emergency medicine and rescue intensive training 
program” was subscribed. The Zuoying Armed Forces General Hospital 
is to work in conjunction with the appointment schedule of Compulsory 
officers and conduct two sessions of training annually. Through this pre-
service training, it is to carry out submarine medicine and advanced 
cardiac life support (ACLS) classes and other curricula to achieve the 
objective of promoting submarine medicine. 6 people have completed 
the pre-service training in 006 and 007 while 4  people have completed 
ACLS.
B. Enhance pressure test, oxygen-resistance, and diving simulation 
training
    In conjunction with the Navy under-water personnel expertise training 
course, the Zuoying Armed Forces General Hospital conducts pressure 
and oxygen-resistance and diving simulation training, so that the 
trainees can experience under-water operations in a safe and controlled 
environment and familiarize themselves with the abnormal pressure 
settings under water, thus reducing diving accidents and ensuring 
personnel health and performance of military missions. ,43 people 
were given the pressure test in 006 and 007; 5 underwent oxygen-
resistance and 75 diving simulation training.
C. Step up physical examination of diving operation personnel
    In view of the long period professional divers are exposed to high-
pressure environment and the possibility of musculoskeletal and 
peripheral nerve damage due to improper decompression procedures, the 
“Armed Forces Diving Operation Personnel Annual Physical Examination 
Regulations” were promulgated on February 7, 006. The statute 
prescribes methods and items for the physical examination in accordance 
with submarine medicine, so as to form the basis of the physical 
examination for Armed Forces divers. 68 Diving Operation Personnel 
have completed the examination in 006 and 007 to maintain personnel 
health and ensure the Armed Forces combat capabilities. 
D. Step up physical examination of submarine personnel304    The nature of work of submarine troops is such that they carry 
out sensitive under-water missions over a long period of time. As 
such, medical care personnel are required to accomplish emergency 
treatment on their own in the event of emergency injuries and illness, 
and evacuation support is not easy. In view of these and other factors, 
the supplementary regulations of “Armed Forces Personnel Physical 
Examination” were amended and promulgated on October 5, 007. The 
stipulation prescribes that submarine operation servicemen regardless of 
age are subject to one comprehensive physical examination every year. By 
increasing the frequency of physical examinations, personnel’s conditions 
are fully grasped and potential risk factors to the servicemen can be 
discovered to ensure personnel health and performance of submarine 
missions. 380 people completed the submarine physical examination 
in 007. For results of professional training and physical examination in 
military medicine, please see Table -3 for details.

and prevention of biological toxic 
material medical disposal
(i) Localized surveillance and  
prevention of biological toxic material 
medical disposal
    By order of the Executive Yuan, 
collaborate with localized surveillance and 
prevention tasks to prevent terrorists from 
spreading biological viruses in metropolitan 
areas, schools, hospitals, water sources, 
military camps or populated areas and 
causing heavy casualties. The procedure 
is that the incident site reports as required 
by the system and the Executive Yuan will 
set up a central disaster response center, 
which delegates pathogen detection to 
local competent authorities and DOH 
Center for Disease Control. Where 
necessary, the Armed Forces are asked to 
support the experts of the said agencies to 
ascertain source of pathogen and range of 
contamination pursuant to the specimen 
collection and surveillance operation 
procedures, so as to report back to the 
command center in time.
(ii) Control of outbreak areas and 
biological protection and counter-
terrorism and contingency response 
actions
    Control of outbreak areas is carried 
out, by the local disaster relief and rescue 
commanders, taking into consideration the 
range of contamination and severity of the 
epidemic, by commanding police agencies 
of his/her jurisdiction and coordinating with 
the MND to send military police support. 
The Armed Forces primary health units, 
however, answer directly to the order from 
the top, to set up medical care facilities 306to provide health service reinforcements. Outside the outbreak areas, 
the Armed Forces hospitals of all levels will work in collaboration with 
the DOH to set up emergency medical teams and supply medicines and 
equipment, so as to reinforce the biological protection medical operations 
administered by the hospitals in the outbreak areas. The immunization 
of uncontaminated personnel in outbreak areas will be handled by local 
health agencies and supported by the medical centers of the Armed 
Forces troops and hospitals at all levels. Furthermore, medical wastes will 
be disposed of by appointed agencies according to the Infectious Medical 
Wastes Disposal Procedure and the principle of nearby incineration. 
The corpses in outbreak areas, after decontamination treatment, will be 
registered by the Social Affairs Bureaus of each county and city and burnt 
on-site. For infected livestock, the agriculture and forestry agencies of 
each area will coordinate with the local forces of the Armed Forces for 
support in culling and incineration. As for decontamination of localized 
biologically toxic materials, the Armed Forces Chemical Warfare Units will 
conduct decontamination work in outbreak areas in conjunction with the 
local command centers.
5. Strengthen disease prevention
    With regards to the epidemic conditions of communicable diseases, 
the Armed Forces put priorities on epidemic control and prevention of 
communicable diseases. Prevention measures for the personal safety 
of servicemen and maintenance of sanitation at military bases are also 
reinforced to leverage on the preventive functions. Furthermore, assistance 
is provided to the local governments to maintain local cleanliness for 
effective control of epidemic spread. The results of implementation are as 
follows: 
(i) The Armed Forces General Hospitals in Kaohsiung, Taichung, Taoyuan, 
Hualien, Zuoying, Songshan and others have incorporated the “Syndrome 
and severity monitoring reporting” system to effectively monitor the 
incidences of infection.
(ii) The “Implementation Plan of the MND Disease Control Emergency 
Response Command Center” was promulgated on February 5, 003. It 
is activated simultaneously with the prevention and control mechanism 
that is activated upon announcement of domestic and overseas epidemics 
by the Center for Disease Control, DOH of the Executive Yuan. The 
“MND Disease Control Emergency Response Command Center” is thus 
established to devote efforts into the prevention and control of domestic 
epidemics in time. This ensures the Armed Forces operation capabilities in 
the event of major epidemic outbreaks.
(iii) The “Operation Guidelines for MND Epidemic Outbreak Surveillance, 
307National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
Investigation, Handling and Reporting” was promulgated on September 
, 004 to cater for the epidemic outbreaks of communicable diseases 
within military agencies. Through the stringent monitoring mechanism and 
report operation system, we can detect early infectious outbreaks or cases 
of fever of unknown cause within various agencies of the Armed Forces, 
conduct immediate emergency epidemiological investigations and suitable 
medical treatment, and adopt accurate disease prevention measures. It is 
hoped that this will seize the right opportunity and control the epidemic to 
prevent the spread of communicable diseases.
(iv) Make use of the annual preventive health care workshops to 
strengthen dissemination of relevant regulations and disease prevention 
practices in military preventive care operations. Preventive care workshops 
for primary military medical cadres were held in the north, central, south 
and east of Taiwan in 006 and 007. 64  and 6 4 people participated 
in the training respectively to implement relevant preventive health care 
practices and ensure the health of military servicemen.
(v) Document, follow-up and assist in the medical treatment of confirmed 
cases of human immunodeficiency virus amongst enlisted servicemen; 
those withdrawn upon examination or ceasing service will be documented 
and submitted to the Center for Disease Control and a copy will be sent to 
the respective health care agencies of the infected person’s domicile for 
follow-up and supervision.
(vi) The MND Medical Affairs Bureau, in coordination with the DOH 
Center for Disease Control, regulates tuberculosis cases. The medical 
affairs agency in charge of the respective case will provide the names of 
respective personnel of close contact with the patient and thus relevant 
disease prevention measures, as well as coordinate and handle natters 
related to disease cessation for ongoing follow-up, supervision and 
treatment. 
(vii) Each Armed Forces-affiliated hospital and the Institute of Preventive 
Medicine of the National Defense Medical Center serve as support when 
an outbreak occurs in the military. Besides providing medical treatment 
for the disease, each Armed Forces hospital will immediately report any 
suspicious symptoms and test results to the public health agencies, 
and inform the Medical Affairs Bureau and notify the medical affairs unit 
affiliated with the respective forces. In addition, the Institute of Preventive 
Medicine of the National Defense Medical Center is equipped with 
pathogen test abilities of biosafety level III and level IV laboratories. They 
provide high-standard surveillance, investigation, examination, handling 
and research on epidemics, sufficient to provide units suffering the 
epidemic to engage in prompt and accurate disease control measures.
308(viii) Practices in response to the avian flu
A.  Administer influenza vaccine: In coordination with the 007 influenza 
immunization program of the DOH Center for Disease Control, the MND 
Medical Affairs Bureau allocated 9,000 doses of vaccine in October, 
007. Medical Affairs units, kitchen staff, air crew, submarine crew and 
personnel working in closed space of various Commands were vaccinated 
to reduce Severe Complicated Influenza Case or mortality and to avoid 
viral infection caused by influenza virus gene recombination. This is to 
protect the servicemen’s health, reduce security-compromising events and 
maintain troop combat capabilities. 
B. Strengthen awareness on avian flu prevention amongst subordinate 
servicemen and dependents. Increase their knowledge on avian flu by 
using the military network system or military-related publications to 
publish relevant material. 
C. Strictly regulate protection clothing and masks and other disease-
prevention materials and flu-treating medicines.
D. The Armed Forces are to coordinate with the relevant disease control 
practices of the DOH and Council of Agriculture of the Executive Yuan to 
provide pertinent central and local support. 
(III) Maintenance of law and order
    When assisting the judicial agencies in enforcing law and order, the 
Armed Forces focus mainly on military-related cases. From July , 006 
to December 3 , 007, 964 criminal cases were handled, arresting ,673 
offenders; 3 military deserters were captured; 35 gangsters were 
disciplined; 59 cases of stowaway mainlanders and 35 illegal stowaway 
immigrants were uncovered; 330 firearms of various types, 36, 8 bullets,

hunting down 74.5 kilograms of heroin, 9 .7 kilograms of amphetamine, 
77.09 grams of marijuana. 
(IV) Environmental protection
1. Push the armed forces in homeland cleaning and environmental 
protection tasks
    In accordance with the “National Clean Homeland Initiative” of the 
Executive Yuan, the MND promulgated the “Armed Forces Implementation 
Plan for the National Clean Homeland Initiative” on September 0, 006. 
An amendment was promulgated on October 9, 007 to step up efforts 
in cleaning and clearing various military camps (bases) and surrounding 
areas within 50 meters. A “Workshop of the Armed Forces Environmental 
Protection Project” was conducted on November , 007, which 
completed training of 5 seed instructors. The workshop reinforced 
the servicemen’s concepts on clean homeland and environmental 
protection and their effectiveness in implementation. After on-site visit and 
evaluation in stages by the task force under the Environmental Protection 
Administration, the Armed Forces overall received distinction for their 
work. The Dahan Base of Army Command Headquarter received high 
distinction; the MND Chungai Base and the Chungchin Base of Combined 
Logistics Command received distinction.
2. Reduce wastes by classification, resource recycle and reuse and 
green purchases
    In collaboration with the national policy of waste reduction by 
classification, resource recycling and reuse, and green purchases, the 
MND announced the “Implementation Plan of Military Waste Reduction by 
Classification, Resource Recycling and Reuse, and Green Purchases” on 
January 6, 006. This was to strengthen the Armed Forces’ full efforts 
in waste reduction measurers. They also commission, in accordance with 
the law, local governmental environment protection agencies, or eligible 
public/private waste cleanup and disposal organizations recognized by the 
Environmental Protection Administration to enforce cleanup and disposal 
and resource recycling and reuse to minimize waste contamination. 
Further, pursuant to the “Agency Green Purchase Initiative” of the 
Executive Yuan, the MND has been proactive in promoting purchases of 
environmental friendly commodities with green certification. In 006, the 
entire force spent 89.6% of the total expenditure on green products. We 
also received a distinction grade for our performance by the evaluation 
team of the Environmental Protection Administration.
3. Control and prevention of water pollution
    Pursuant to the national environmental protection laws and policies, the 
30MND has continued to push for the operation and maintenance of waste 
water and sewage treatment facilities in Armed Forces hospitals at all 
levels, military factories, ports and logistics depots. This processes waste 
waters of various industries and sewage utilities, thereby maintaining the 
natural constitution and quality of water. In addition, based on the national 
“Emergency Response Plan for Major Maritime Oil Pollution” amended and 
approved by the Executive Yuan, the MND amended and announced the 
“MND Response Plan for Major Maritime Oil Pollution Incidents” on May 
30, 006. Relevant information on the major pollution emergency response 
system is to be updated regularly according to the Armed Forces’ capacity 
to support maritime pollution contingencies, so as to maintain normal 
operation of communication and response for maritime pollution.
4. Control and prevention of soil and groundwater contamination
    Pursuant to the “Soil and Groundwater Contamination Prevention and 
Control Plan” of the Executive Yuan, the MND promulgated the “Military 
Barracks (Camps) Soil and Groundwater Contamination Prevention 
and Control Plan” on November 5, 006 to actively push surveillance, 
investigation and prevention of contamination. It conducted the “Armed 
Forces Promotion of Soil and Groundwater Contamination Prevention 
Training Workshop” on March 30, 007, and completed training of 68 
seed instructors. This was to enhance the servicemen’s knowledge and 
skills on contamination prevention and control. A joint effort made with 
the EPA in 006 and 007 in pushing the “Military oil tank facilities soil 
and groundwater contamination prevention investigation plan” and the 
“Military barracks contaminated groundwater source investigation plan” 
have completed surveillance and investigation on the contamination 
susceptibility of 0 military oil tanks and fuel stations and 0 military 
camps. Tests and analysis were also conducted on the possible range of 
successive contaminations to ensure follow-up and enforce improvements 
on contamination, thereby protecting soil and groundwater from 
contamination hazards.     
5. Management of toxic and chemical substances
    Pursuant to the “Toxic Chemical Substances Control Act” amended 
and promulgated by the Executive Yuan on January 3, 007, the MND and 
EPA revised and announced the “Toxic Chemical Substance Management 
Regulations of Military Agency and Branches” in a meeting on August 30, 
007, to promote the Armed Forces’ control of toxic chemical substances. 
A “Workshop on toxic chemical substance management system and 
regulations” was also conducted on November , 007 and 54 
executives and personnel of related operations completed training. This 
strengthens the security control of military agencies’ operation of toxic

The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
chemical substances and prevents the occurrence of disaster caused by 
toxic chemical substances.  
6. Control of airport and aviation noise
    In order to decrease noise pollution due to military aviation operations, 
besides emergency combat exercise missions, control on schedules of 
flight training and testing is tightened. Environmental friendly aviation 
routes are also adopted to avoid passing by densely populated areas as 
much as possible. The “Principles Governing MND Subsidies to County 
and City Governments for Improving Aviation Noise at Military Airports” 
was promulgated on January , 005. Funding has been budgeted to 
subsidize the Civil Aeronautics Administration or respective county/city 
governments of the particular airports in accordance with the law for their 
noise prevention and treatment efforts. On November 3, 007, the “ 007 
Armed Forces Comprehensive Report on the Implementation Results 
of Aviation Noise Control and Improvement at Various Airports” was 
published to allow various airports to implement aviation noise prevention 
and improvement to help various airports in implementing aviation noise 
control and improvement operations. In the future, amount of subsidies 
will be allocated reasonably and appropriately depending on the actual 
impact suffered by various airports. 
7. Control of biodiversity
    The MND promulgated the “Military Promotion of Biodiversity – Control 
Plan for Invading Fire Ants” on June , 004, and has already established 
the red fire ants report system and set up the Military red fire ants control 
information website. A “training workshop on the operation of the military 
red fire ant control information network system” was also conducted on 
January 9, 007 to reinforce the entire force’s push on the surveillance, 
monitoring and control of red fire ants. The Council of Agriculture and the 
“National Red Imported Fire Ant Control Center” were also asked to work 
in conjunction to control the spread and damage by red fire ants. They 
assisted in guiding the Taoyuan Red Fire Ant Control Team to continue 
supporting the military in administering red fire ant bait control doses on 
the 3 camps invaded, an estimated area of 736 hectares. Additionally, 
pursuant to the “National Joint Control Plan on Mikania micrantha and 
Chromolaena odorata” and in collaboration with the technical assistance 
from the Endemic Species Research Institute, the Armed Forces have 
comprehensively monitored and controlled invasive species of plants 
such as Mikania micrantha and Chromolaena odorata, which occupies 
approximately 6.5 hectares. All are to maintain the safety of the military 
barracks (camps) and the sustainable and balanced development of the 
environment and ecology.  
3(V) Homeland restoration
From 006 to end of 007, the Armed Forces have completed exploration 
and studies on 39 landslide and debris-flow susceptibility zones and 
reported them to the Council of Agriculture. We have also implemented 
forest plantation spanning 0.6 acres on the Dongtsaiding Mountain in 
Chiayi, planting ,550 trees and delivering good results in mountain and 
forest conservation.
(VI) River dredging
1. 2006 Armed forces river dredging results
    Dredging was completed at three locations, the Luofu Bridge of the 
Shihmen Reservoir, Chilu Large Bridge of the Jhuoshuei River, Guangfu 
Bridge of the Wuluo River. ,870 military personnel and 5,838 heavy 
machinery and vehicles of various kinds were sent; and ,04,465 cubic 
meters of sand and gravel were taken out. The cleaning results exceeded 
initial targets; see Table -4 for statistics.

The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
2. 2007 Armed forces river dredging results
    The Ministry of Economic Affairs commissioned the Armed Forces to 
carry out dredging tasks at four locations in 007: Luofu Bridge of the 
Shihmen Reservoir, Chilu Large Bridge of the Jhuoshuei River, Gaoping 
River Brook, Gaoping River Dam. Under the Armed Forces full efforts, 
stage  and  of the 007 schedule have been completed. 4,73 military 
personnel and 5, 67 heavy machinery and vehicles of various kinds were 
sent. The total volume of debris dredged was as much as ,456,98  cubic 
meters, accomplishing 30% which were very effective. See Table -5 for 
statistics.
Table -5 007 Statistics on Armed Forces River Dredging Results343. 2008 River dredging schedule plan
    The Ministry of Economic Affairs commissioned the Armed Forces to 
carry out dredging tasks at 4 locations, upstream section of Shihmen 
Reservoir, stage 3 Chilu Large Bridge of Jhoushuei River and Yungshin 
Bridge and upstream section of Gaoping River Dam. Volume of silt 
removed is estimated to reach ,960,000 cubic meters.
(VII) Islets demining
    Due to needs for combat readiness and defense, Kinmen and Matsu 
areas have laid extensive and large areas of landmines in the past. 
However, as years go by, geographical alterations and circumstance 
changes set in, the minefields’ combat readiness functions have gradually 
been lost. Although the military has commissioned others to undertake 
demining since 998, removal on a full scale could not be executed, 
constrained by factors such as incomplete record on minefields, data loss, 
unclear labeling and huge costs. Beginning from October 006, the Army 
Engineer Corps attempted independent demining of minefield at Kinmen 
Xishan shooting range. They successfully accomplished the task by end 
of November of the same year and proved their undertaking to be feasible 
with great results. As such, the Army Command Headquarters established 
a demining force on April , 007, dedicated to implementing independent 
demining and commissioned demining management tasks. 
    Kinmen and Matzu areas have 308 minefields currently on the listing, 
occupying approximately an area of 3,870,880 square meters. Since the 
attempt to demine independently in October 006, Kinmen area has had 
4,950 square meters of minefields cleared and 5,030 landmines of 
various types removed. Commissioned demining was enforced in Matzu 
area since 007. Up to this day, 7,086 square meters of minefields have 
been cleared and ,443 landmines of various types removed. In addition, 
the minefield removal task between 008 and 3 will be carried out as 
soon as each type of demining machinery and equipment fills in place to 
accelerate the demining operations and complete the minefield removal 
tasks ahead of time. See Table 0-6 for statistics on the 006 and 007 
results.

1. Civilian affairs coordination conferences
   In 007, various area commands called upon responsible units, veterans 
service departments, military personnel service stations and local government 
representatives and convened altogether  civilian affairs coordination 
conferences. The “responsible district units” conducted 66 meetings to 
deliberate, propose and coordinate support for major military-civilian issues 
such as disaster rescue, emergency condolences, dispute resolution, social 
resource integration and exercise and training, so that communication falls

effectively enhance resident civil-military relations. 
3. “ National Defense Service Division ” in the regional joint 
services centers of the Executive Yuan
    In coordination with the Eastern, Southern and Central Taiwan Joint 
Services Centers of the Executive Yuan, the MND set up the “National 
Defense Service Division” to enable the area commands to integrate 
their respective tri-service forces. Personnel are assigned to station on 
fixed roster and establish regional coordination mechanisms with various 
departments and divisions, so a “single window” can be provided to the 
public for inquiries and services on national defense affairs, and for taking 
up cases of trust, complaint and resistance. In 007, 89 cases including 
“counseling to the public in-person” and “advice on pleadings” were 
processed, all of which were dealt with by the respective area commands 
case by case with great results.
III. Future Direction
(I) Perfect disaster response mechanisms to facilitate disaster 
rescue and evacuation
    Based on the spirit of “you drown, I drown; you starve, I starve”, 
incorporate disaster relief as a task under the Armed Forces’ “homeland 
defense” mission. Adhere to the guidance of the “Central Disaster 
Response Center” of the Executive Yuan and coordinate with the operation 
of various disaster response mechanisms to synchronously set up disaster 
relief command centers of all levels. This is so when major disaster occurs 
in the community, rescue and evacuation can be enforced immediately to 
safeguard the lives and properties of our people.
(II) Strengthen medical care and disease prevention to safeguard 
the servicemen and people
. Continue to fight for budget funding, implement medical treatment 
concessions for servicemen and increase quality of medical treatment and 
care capacity for servicemen.

Medicine to ensure sea-level and deep-water operational safety of the 
navy servicemen and strengthen the combat capabilities of the navy ships.
4. Continue to bolster the biodefense and medical treatment capabilities of 
the Armed Forces hospitals and health service troops. Conduct biodefense 
education and training courses for military medical personnel and nurture 
seed instructors to enhance the servicemen’s knowledge on biodefense. 
Engage in active R&D and collection of relevant medicine, health care 
materials and vaccines to truly evoke the effectiveness of protective 
medical care against biological and toxic substances.     
5. Strengthen medical and health care dissemination and related 
amendments on disease control amongst command headquarters of 
each force and the military medical cadres of Armed Forces hospitals 
at all levels to effectively control, coordinate and manage diseases. 
Upholding the approach of early awareness and prompt report, follow 
the professional system for speedy feedback and control to facilitate 
monitoring of information related to the epidemic.
(III) Implement environmental protection to sustain ecological 
balance and development
. In coordination with the national environmental protection policy, 
promote the military clean homeland environment protection efforts, 
waste reduction by classification, resource recycling and reuse and 
green purchases, and water pollution control and prevention. In addition, 
update regularly relevant information on the major pollution emergency 
response system according to Armed Forces’ capacity to support maritime 
pollution contingencies. This will maintain the normal operation of 
communication and response for maritime pollution incidents as well as 
soil and groundwater contamination control, and ensure follow-up and 
implementation of improvements to further prevent contamination hazards 
38to soil and groundwater.
. Strengthen the security control of operation on toxic chemical 
substances by various military agencies and prevent the occurrence of 
toxic chemical substance disasters.

control of red fire ants. Work in conjunction with the technical assistance 
from the Endemic Species Research Institute to ensure military bases 
safety and the sustainable and balanced development of the environment 
and ecology.
(IV) Accelerate islets demining to promote local development
    Implement on a full scale the management tasks of independent 
demining and commissioned demining to save public funds and 
collaborate with the state’s policy in building the islets. Actively collect 
various demining machineries and equipment to accelerate the demining 
operation schedule, so as to complete the removal of landmine areas 
before the statutory deadline, thereby facilitating the local development of 
off-shore islands, Kinmen and Matzu.
(V) Improve functionality of civilian affairs coordination 
conferences to enhance military-civilian interaction
    Continue to communicate fully through the civil affairs coordination 
conferences to make use of the mechanism’s functions. At the same time, 
◎ Full efforts in self-demining and delegated demining tasks to promote 
local development of Kinmen and Matzu islets

authorize  Armed Forces civil affairs units in major weaponry training 
grounds, airports and others to conduct various family and good neighbor 
gatherings in a time and manner that work appropriately in conjunction 
with the dynamic activities of all-out defense. This enhances resident 
military-civil relations, benefits enforcement of all-out defense mobilization 
tasks, thereby realizing the all-out defense policy.
Section 3 
Protection of Rights and Interests
    Democracies governed by the rule of law underscore administration 
by law. The MND has thus engaged in the formulation (enactment), 
amendment or abolishment of existing national defense statutes by 
integrating movements of the current era and the people’s needs. It 
hopes to realize protection of the rights and interests of the Armed Forces 
and public through the legal system. In addition, in consideration of a 
balanced development of national defense security and people’s living 
needs, the MND also takes the initiative to review the scope of “garrisons” 
and “no- or limited-construction”, so as to accommodate for both the 
community development and the public’s rights and interests surrounding 
the military control zones. At the same time, administrative relief matters 
such as “Servicemen’s rights and interests protection”, “Appeals”, “State 
compensation” and “Compensation for damages from military activities” 
are also given special attention to create an atmosphere of people-
trusted and people-supported national defense and thereby enabling the 
implementation of all-out defense mobilization.
I. Policy Objectives
(I) Ensure legal rights of servicemen
    To implement protection of the servicemen’s rights and interests, 
the MND specially set up a “Military Personnel Rights Committee”. The 
Committee was formed according to the prescribed percentage that “the 
number of representatives of organizations and members of society shall 
not be less than half of that of the Committee in which the number of 
female committee members shall not be less than one third”. Members 
30included representatives of government agencies, non-government 
professionals and chiefs of related units in the MND. They are designated 
to deliberate on cases pertaining to the protection of servicemen’s 
rights, instruct investigations, and offer advice regarding protection of 
servicemen’s rights, thereby facilitating the impartiality and fairness of the 
deliberations.
(II) Review carefully the appeal cases
    Appeals are the basic right specified and protected by the Constitution. 
Based on the principle of “administration by law” and in order to 
implement the administrative relief system, the MND established the 
Petitions and Appeals Committee in accordance with the “Administrative 
Appeal Act”, “Organization Act of the Ministry of National Defense” and 
“Organization Regulations Governing Appeals Committee of the Executive 
Yuan and Administrative Agencies at All Levels”. The Committee conducts 
deliberations on cases of appeal and corrects administrative disciplines 
that are illegal or inappropriate according to law, thereby fulfilling 
administrative relief tasks pertaining to the rights of the servicemen and 
public.
(III) Implement the state compensation policy
    In order to protect the legal rights of our people, the MND and its 
various commands have all set up their respective State Compensation 
Case Committee. They process compensations for deliberate or negligent 
violations of the people’s freedom or rights resulting from military 
activities, or damages to the people’s lives, bodies or properties due to 
deficient installation or management of public facilities. 
(IV) Disengage military control and no- or limited-construction 
zones
    In response to the changes in domestic political and economical 
conditions and in conjunction with the state’s overall development, the 
MND has successively reviewed venues with common characteristics or 
compatibility for appropriate mergers or agglomeration, so as to reduce 
the number of control zones.
(V) Compensation for damages from military activities
    In order to demonstrate the Government’s sincerity in looking after 
civilian casualties and people whose properties are lost due to military 
activities, the “Regulations of Compensation for Damages to the Public 
from Military Activities” was formulated and promulgated on December , 
999 to console civilian casualties and grieved families. The valid period 
for application is two years. Further, in order to protect the rights of those 
who have not applied, the “Compensation Regulations Amendment” was 
put into effect on January 7, 004, which extended the application date to 
3National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
November 30, 007. 
(VI) Compensation for wrongful imprisonment 
   Pursuant to Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 6 4 dated April 7, 007, 
and the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Act amended on July 
, 007, the MND included military justice in the scope of wrongful 
imprisonment compensation. Cases admissible by the Military Justice 
Law that are compliant with Article  of the Wrongful Imprisonment 
Compensation Act may request state compensation in accordance with 
the law. In addition, after the Military Justice Law came into effect on 
September , 959, persons meeting the aforementioned criteria may 
make the request within two years of the date of promulgation of this 
Interpretation, so that the public’s rights are protected.
II. Actions and Results
(I) Implement the national defense legal system
    To implement legalization of protection of the servicemen and people’
s rights, the MND has conducted detailed planning and regulated annual 
formulation (enactment), amendment or repeal of statute types and 
schedule on 66 existing national defense statutes. For statutes vital to 
protection of rights, urgent, and deemed necessary after review by forces 
at all levels, timely and pertinent formulation (enactment), amendment 
or repeal are also conducted. In coordination with the national defense 
policy in 007, 43 statutes such as “The Armed Forces Uniforms Act”, 
“Compensation Regulations Governing the Government’s Use and 
Removal of Destructive Landmines” and others are formulated (enacted), 
amended or revoked. See Appendix 4 for details.   
(II) Carefully process cases concerning rights protection 
    The deliberation of cases pertaining to the rights protection of military 
personnel undergoes a two-review and two-tier system. The first-tier 
committees are established under the jurisdiction of the General Political 
Warfare Bureau and various Commands, responsible for the preliminary 
deliberation of case pertaining to the protection of servicemen’s rights. 
The second-tier committee (the MND Military Personnel Rights Committee) 
is directly subordinate to the Ministry of Defense, supervised by the Deputy 
Minister, and responsible for coordinating cases concerning the protection 
of servicemen’s rights, and re-deliberation of cases that repeal against the 
decisions of the first-tier committee. Statistics on cases deliberated and 
re-deliberated by the Military Personnel Rights Committees of all levels 
from 005 to 007 are indicated in Table -7, and a chart of the rights 
protection cases handled from 005 to 007 in Figure -.

deliberated by the personnel rights committees of 
all levels33National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
(III) Careful process of appeals and campaign 
    Pursuant to the “Administrative Appeal Act”, “Organization Act of the 
Ministry of National Defense” and “Organization Regulations Governing 
Appeals Committee of the Executive Yuan and Administrative Agencies of 
All Levels”, the MND established the “Petitions and Appeals Committee” 
comprising of 5- 5 committee members dedicated to deliberating MND 
appeal and litigation cases. The post of the executive committee member 
is served concurrently by a MND senior personnel or counselors with 
legal system specialty for a -year appointment. 4 committee members 
were chosen in 006 and 007, 5 in 008 and 009. Two thirds of the 
committee is comprised of scholars and experts outside the MND, all of 
whom possess legal system expertise. The remaining committee members 
are served concurrently by Director-generals and their deputies of relevant 
agencies within the MND and are adjusted as their posts change. 
. From September 006 to March 008, 33  cases of appeal were 
processed, out of which 9  were overruled, 5 were not applicable by 
law, 37 had their existing punishment revoked and received alternative 
punishment deemed suitable by the original disciplinary agency, 88 were 
transferred or withdrawn. The categories of the appeal cases between 
September 006 and March 008 are detailed in Table -8.
Table -8     Category of appeal cases34. In order to ensure compliance with the state’s information disclosure 
policy and push for the computerization of appeal matters, the MND 
Petitions and Appeal Committee has put up the deliberation results of 
the appeal cases on the MND website. Relevant information on appeal 
regulations is also provided, and inquiry into the progress of deliberation 
of the appeal cases is added.  
3. Decisions of MND appeal cases in 006 and 007 were compiled 
into the “MND Appeal Decisions Collection”, and a good selection of 
frequently-committed mistakes and correct practices of past administrative 
punishments of the MND agencies were compiled into the “MND Appeal 
Decisions Selection” to serve as a reference for each agency, so as to 
increase the accuracy of the administrative punishments.
4. In order to realize the objective of “legalizing national defense”, 
guidance for implementing appeal operation and visitations were 
conducted for MND-affiliated agencies annually on an ongoing basis. This 
gains an in-depth understanding of the implementation of appeal operation 
by the various agencies, and helps propagate regulations, communicate 
ideas and improve shortfalls, thereby increasing administrative efficiency 
and effecting administration by law.   
(IV) Implement the state compensation system
    The MDN has set up the “State Compensation Commission” with a 
committee member of 3 people. Out of which, 6 are from the MND, 
who are senior officers responsible for principal affairs within the MND 
including human resource, logistics, military laws and political warfare. 
7 are appointed from outside the MND, who are prominent persons with 
specialties such as national defense affairs, motor vehicle accident 
assessment, forensic science or law. The commission holds meetings 
of deliberation on an irregular basis and engages in fair, just, objective, 
and careful deliberation based on their areas of expertise to ensure the 
public’s rights and interests. In 007, 65 state compensation cases were 
processed by the MND and its various Commands. Out of which, 34 
were not compensated upon deliberation or litigation, and 3 reached an 
agreement or received compensation. 
(V) Military control and no- or limited-construction zones
    In conjunction with the comprehensive homeland development, the 
MND actively drafts and amends the Vital Area Regulations and no- or 
limited construction zones regulations. It integrates the no- or limited 
constructions of military zones with the comprehensive homeland 
development plan, regional plan or urban plan to designate zones for 
military purposes.
1. Review garrisons
35National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
    In coordination with the Jingjin Program of organization reengineering 
and retirement of weaponry and armament, methods such as “elimination” 
and “altering status” have been reviewed to reduce the range of garrisons. 
In total, 786.  hectares of controlled area were released between 005 
and 007.
2. Adjust military control zones
    The Armed Forces have been active in reviewing and adjusting the 
range of controlled zones. 4 zones of important military control were 
released, 30 were reduced by 4,0 9.75 hectares between 005 and 007.
(VI) Compensation for damages to the public from military 
activities
   Up till January 9, 008, there were a total of ,49 applications for 
compensation of civilian casualties and property losses caused by military 
activities. ,77 were deliberated and damages of ,40,700,000NTD were 
paid out to showcase the good will in legalizing compensation. See Table 
-9 for statistics on the cases.
Table -9     Statistics of compensation cases for civilian casualties 
and property losses caused by military activities36(VII) 2007 Reduced sentencing on criminals
    To commemorate the 0th anniversary of the lifting of martial law, by 
order of the President, the “ 007 Criminal Reduced Sentence Act” was 
promulgated to give the criminals an opportunity to better themselves. 
478 persons met the criteria for reduced sentence. In response to the 
implementation of the said Act on July 6, 007, besides administering 
out-of-prison education to the offenders, coordinating with rehabilitation, 
employment training and health organizations to promote various 
protection and guidance measures in prison, the MND is also active in 
helping those in rehabilitation to return to the military and society.
(VIII) Compensation for wrongful imprisonment
   Since April 7, 007, the day of Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 6 4 
of the Judicial Yuan, the MND has released news and conducted press 
conferences and radio broadcasting to propagate application procedures 
on compensation for wrongful imprisonment. Since that date, the military 
courts and prosecutor’s office of all levels have received a total of 
0 compensation cases from the public.  cases were granted with 
compensation in the amount of NT$ 0,003,000.
III. Future Direction
(I) Implement administration by law and perfect the national 
defense legal system
. Build the “National Defense Law Database” on military and civilian 
websites so that military servicemen and the general public can browse 
online for accurate and convenient retrieval of information on national 
defense laws.
. Compile the basic concepts, regulations, templates and standard 
operating procedures and other information on legalization. Print a 
“legalization manual” for all MND-affiliated agencies, academies, troops 
and request compliance from executives and legalization personnel of all 
levels.
3. Constantly review the formulation (enactment), amendment and 
abolishment of national defense laws in light of the national defense 
policies and actual needs in the interest of the servicemen and public, so 
as to fully safeguard the servicemen and people’s rights.
(II) Promote concepts of rights protection to ensure the rights and 
interests of servicemen
. In view of the principle of a “human rights focus” for a modern and 
democratic society, and under the premise of “ensuring the right to 
know”, the “Military Personnel Rights Committee” will fulfill its “obligation 
37National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
to inform” through the following means to fully protect the servicemen’
s rights and eliminate any trouble. They include producing promotion 
booklet, cards and notebooks; organizing trivia quiz with prizes; making 
promotion films and Ju-Kun TV Campus panel discussions; conducting 
supervisory evaluation, questionnaires and committee member forum and 
visits amongst the troops.
. The “Military Personnel Rights Committee” will continue to uphold the 
principle of “fast, fair and comprehensive” in dealing with rights protection 
to ensure the servicemen’s legal rights and perfect the protection relief 
system for servicemen.
(III) Review appeals prudently by appointing special personnel for 
audit and progress
. Review appeals prudently by ensuring that the Administrative Appeal 
Act, the “Deliberation Regulations Governing Appeals Committee of the 
Executive Yuan and Administrative Agencies of All Levels” and the “Control 
Guidelines on the Period of Review for Appeal Cases of the Executive Yuan 
and its Subordinate Agencies” are adhered to and the cases are closed 
within the statutory time limit. 
. The MND will continue to enhance the legal competency of the 
personnel in charge to improve the quality of appeal operations, thereby 
increasing the maintenance rate of the administrative courts on the MND’s 
decisions for appeals. 
3. For appeals whose administrative punishments are revoked upon 
deliberation, continue to request the original disciplinary agency that 
issued the punishments to administer a suitable alternative punishment 
within the designated deadline. Appoint special personnel to follow-up 
control, audit and progress to avoid delayed handling or inappropriate 
punishments by the same disciplinary agency again. Furthermore, inform 
the various units of correct operation and compliance therein to fulfill 
administration by law.
(IV) Promote the state compensation act to protect the legal rights 
and interests of the people
    MND personnel can obtain the latest regulations through the online 
“national defense law database” and serve in accordance with the law 
to reduce negligence and misconduct. For cases of state compensation, 
deliberation is conducted by the committees of various levels with a 
“fair, just and objectively prudent” attitude. At the same time, in order to 
implement administration by law and effectively reduce state compensation 
cases, the MND conducts annual itinerant visits and counseling to 
affiliated units to promote regulations and precedents related to the State 
Compensation Act. Commands of various forces are also asked to engage 
38the affiliated units in frequent dissemination to achieve the objective of 
safeguarding the people’s rights.  
(V) Military control and nor-limited-construction zones to 
accommodate for community development and the public’s rights
    In view of the balanced development of national defense security and 
our people’s livelihood needs, the Armed Forces will actively reduce vital 
area control zones and the range of no-or limited constructions by means 
of “disarmament” and “re-establishing control”. The no-construction 
zones will be developed as parks, green space, level car park and others 
to enhance efficiency of land use. The limited construction zones will 
have volume control imposed on the height of the buildings to supplant 
control on military controlled zones. This will reduce the negative impact 
to a minimum and accommodate both the community development 
surrounding military controlled zones and rights of the public .

Chapter  Defense Mobilization
    Defense mobilization is the concrete implementation of all-out 
defense. In order to respond to the military threats of the PRC and non-
conventional security threats and to attain the national defense strategic 
basic objectives of "war prevention, homeland defense, counter-
terrorism and contingency response," defense mobilization involves the 
all-out defense mobilization mechanism “incorporating mobilization in 
policy implementation and assimilating combat readiness in economic 
infrastructures”. Through political and military collaboration, domestic 
emergency response systems such as disaster prevention and relief, 
communicable disease control, nuclear disaster response and counter-
terrorism operations are being effectively integrated to build a well-
established and comprehensive all-out defense system, to harness enough 
mobilization capacity, establish homeland security network, and to achieve 
the objectives of protecting the homeland and solidarity in peacetime and 
wartime, evoking a deep-rooted and well-implemented all-out defense.
Section 1. 
All-out Defense Mobilization System
   All-out defense is based on the axis of crisis management and war 
preparation. Through the all-out defense mobilization system, overall 
capabilities in political, economical, military, psychological, and 
technological aspects are integrated to accommodate for peacetime 
readiness and wartime response, thereby ensuring national security. 
The legal investigations and statistics performed on manpower in the 
governmental and private sectors, and material mobilization resources 
during peacetime are integrated with the disaster prevention and relief 
system to provide pertinent support in the event of a disaster and to 
achieve the effect of resource sharing. In wartime, military needs are 
333National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
quickly and efficiently responded to fulfill functions of supporting the 
frontline, securing the rear area and stabilizing the society, establishing a 
winning foundation for defense and combat. 
I.All-out Defense Mobilization System
   The Executive Yuan follows the regulations in the “Act of All-out Defense 
Mobilization Preparation” to set up mobilization systems at three levels, 
namely, the Conference for All-out Defense Mobilization Preparation of 
the Executive Yuan, conferences of various mobilization preparation 
proposals, and mobilization preparation Conferences of special municipal 
and county and city governments. The systems are task-oriented and 
categorized into mobilization preparation and mobilization implementation. 
During peacetime, the mobilization preparation phase integrates with 
policy implementation to complete comprehensive preparation of combat 
capabilities in manpower, materials, finance, technology and military to 
reserve overall combat capabilities for wartime. It also supports disaster 
prevention and relief in coordination with the “Disaster Prevention and 
Protection Act”. During wartime, the mobilization implementation phase 
integrates and leverages capabilities from all citizens to support military 
operations and emergency relief, and maintains emergency responses of 
public agencies and basic living requirements of the people.
(I) All- out defense mobilization preparation conference of the 
executive yuan 
    The Executive Yuan Premier and Vice Premier serve as the chairperson 
and deputy chairperson respectively. The ministers without portfolio who 
supervise national defense affairs at the Executive Yuan and ministers 
of relevant departments are appointed to serve as committee members. 
The Minister of National Defense also acts as the chief executive for the 
Executive Yuan Mobilization Conference. According to the order of the 
Executive Yuan, the Minister conducts secretarial works of the Executive 
Yuan Mobilization Conference and is responsible for coordinating 8 
ministerial mobilization preparation conferences and 5 mobilization 
preparation conferences of special municipalities, county and city 
governments to promote all-out defense mobilization preparation matters. 
See Figure - for the system configuration.
(II) Conferences of various mobilization preparation plans 
    The chairpersons are served by the heads of the organizations, whilst 
the committee members and executive secretaries are appointed by 
the chairpersons. The chairpersons also designate units and particular 
persons to conduct mobilization preparation operations. THE REPUBLIC OF CHINATAIWAN
Chapter  Defense Mobilization
334Meetings are held twice a year. And as directed by the Executive Yuan 
Mobilization Conference, the conferences work hand in hand with 
the chiefs’ implementation plans to promote mobilization preparation 
operations together. The competent authorities of various mobilization 
preparation plans for the conferences are:
1. Morale mobilization preparation plan: 
    The Ministry of Education is responsible for establishing morale 
mobilization preparation plan.
2. Manpower mobilization preparation plan: 
    The Ministry of the Interior is responsible for establishing manpower 
mobilization preparation plan.
3. Material and economy mobilization preparation plan:
    The Ministry of Economic Affairs is responsible for establishing material 
and economy mobilization preparation plan.
4. Finance mobilization preparation plan: 
    The Ministry of Finance is responsible for establishing finance 
mobilization preparation plan.
5. Transportation mobilization preparation plan: 
Figure - Taiwan All-out Defense Mobilization System

(III) Mobilization preparation conferences of special municipalities 
and county and city governments
    The mayor of the special municipality, county, or city serves as the 
chairperson. The number of deputy chairperson can be one to two persons 
and served by the deputy mayor, secretary-general or chief secretary of 
the special municipality, county or city. A few committee members and 
one executive secretary are appointed or employed by the mayor of the 
special municipality, county or city amongst internal personnel, or experts 
and scholars. Units and special personnel are designated to conduct 
mobilization preparation operations. Meetings are held once to twice a 
year. And as directed by the Executive Yuan Mobilization Conference and 
various ministerial mobilization conferences, mobilization preparation 
works are implemented accordingly.
II.Functions and Tasks
    Modern warfare and national defense are no longer straightforward 
military behaviors but the comprehensive display of the national strength, 
military capabilities and public resoluteness. In view of the national war 
strategy concepts and defense needs, mobilization properly plans and 
prepares the national defense resources in manpower, material and 
finance, so that, in times of war or critical period, they can be converted 
from the peacetime status to wartime status immediately, fully utilizing the 
overall national strength to safeguard homeland security. That is the main 
function of all-out defense mobilization. The effectiveness of mobilization 
capability can be seen as a major part of a nation’s warfighting potential 
as well as an indicator of the strength and weakness of a nation’s 
deterring capability. 
    Taiwan’s mobilization is an all-out defense mobilization implemented in 
accordance with the “Act of All-out Defense Mobilization Preparation” and 
its relevant sub-regulations. The basic policy is, under the consideration 
336of accommodating for both national defense and the people’s livelihood, 
to incorporate mobilization in policy implementation and assimilate 
combat readiness in economic infrastructures, so as to harness the 
nation's combat potential and implement all-out defense mobilization 
during wartime, leveraging the strength of all citizens and striving for 
victories in defense and combat. The tasks are as follows:
(I) Mobilization preparation phase:
    To integrate with policy implementation and accomplish the 
comprehensive capability preparation in manpower, material, finance, 
technology and military so as to reserve overall combat strength for 
wartime and reinforce disaster prevention and relief in coordination with 
the Disaster Prevention and Protection Act.
(II) Mobilization implementation phase:
    To integrate and utilize all-out strength to support military operations 
and emergency relief, and to maintain emergency responses of public 
agencies and basic living needs of the citizens.
III.Actions and Results
    Taiwan’s all-out defense mobilization system is categorized into 
two systems, “administrative mobilization” and “military mobilization”. 
“Administrative mobilization” integrates and leverages the overall national 
strength to reinforce military operations, while “military mobilization” 
makes economic and efficient use of the combat potential harnessed by 
administrative mobilization to achieve operation tasks. The main contents 
of work undertaken are the formation and establishment of military reserve 
◎ Integrating with policy implementation to complete 
comprehensive preparation of combat capabilities in 
manpower, materials, finance, technology and military 
to reserve overall combat capabilities for wartime◎ The combat capability of the reserve force is one link of 
the Armed Forces’ overall combat capabilities and its 
operation and utilization must be closely coordinated 
and collaborated with the standing forces

The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
troops and the utilization of private manpower, finance, material and other 
mobilization capacities. Both of which directly affect the people’s rights 
and interests and result in a direct relationship with the people’s vested 
interests. The MND follows the stipulation in Article 8 of the “Act of All-
out Defense Mobilization Preparation” and acts as the secretarial agency 
of the administrative mobilization conferences to promote Taiwan’s all-out 
defense mobilization preparation under the full support and collaboration 
of various central mobilization ministries, special municipalities, county 
and city governments and state and private enterprises. Concrete results 
are as follows:
(I) Implement basic combat capability investigation and utilization
    Coordinating with agencies that implement requisition to accomplish 
various military and transportation mobilization preparation tasks by 
following procedures for detailed investigation, advance supply and 
demand endorsements, regular requisition and drill, and wartime budget 
establishment. In order to effectively integrate the overall strength of the 
theater of operation, combat capabilities coordination conferences at 
various levels are to request relevant competent agencies to provide the 
basic manpower and materials under their respective jurisdiction every 
half a year and conduct sample testing and review together. For annual 
materials required by the military, the plan is to purchase and expropriate 
8 types of important materials: machinery, chemicals, minerals, basic 
metals, building materials, transportation equipment, fiber neoprene and 
medical and pharmaceutical materials, totaling 59 items. In addition, 
fixed facilities will be expropriated: 0,388 classrooms, 3 school halls, 
5,330 cubic meters of warehouses, 794 stadiums, 3 8 activity centers 
have all been included in the annual plan to enable peacetime efforts in 
disaster prevention and relief and wartime support in military operations. 
(II) Computerized management increases mobilization efficiency
   In May, 007 the MND completed the installation of the “material 
mobilization management information system”, which uses electronic 
maps to label the quantity and location of the material mobilization 
capacities of various ministerial and governmental mobilization 
conferences. The information system has also implemented reinforcement 
dispatch, endorsed demand and supply and production of requisition 
booklets. And in coordination with the relevant drills of “Han Kuang 3 
(Tung Hsin No. 9)” and “Wan-An No. 30”, 9 agencies, including the 
Tainan County government, Army 54th Engineer Corp and Tainan County 
Reserve Command, implemented the“Material mobilization computerized 
operation model observation”, “Wartime troop material procurement and 
requisition document endorsement and delivery by the reserve troop 
338organizations”, and“Management and operation of joint requisition 
site for material procurement and requisition during the mobilization 
implementation phase and integration of material management information 
system” respectively on May , 3 and 4. After verification, the information 
system could be used to produce procurement and requisition documents 
and provides the troops with instantaneous information on mobilization 
materials available for procurement and requisition and their storage 
locations. The system functions well, effectively reducing the operation 
period and increasing mobilization efficiency. It also achieves timely 
reinforcement of military operation tasks. 
(III) Exercise verification
.The combat capability of the reserve force is one link of the Armed 
Forces’ overall combat capabilities. Its operation and utilization must 
be closely coordinated and collaborated with the regular forces. After 
separating the regular and the reserve forces, the regional reserve 
commanders will serve as deputy commanders for the respective 
theaters of operations, carry out reserve troop combat preparation and 
readiness, and provide advice on operation practices in accordance with 
the operation guidance from the commanders of respective theaters of 
operations. The scheduled annual manpower and material mobilization 
exercises such as Tung Hsin, Tzu Chiang, and Shen Chu will combine with 
Han Kuang Exercises to be implemented on the Taiwan Island at different 
theaters of operations, but at the same time and by means of actual 
force, actual objects and actual practices. Verification seeks to summon 
and call for manpower and material resources to implement battlefield 
management, airport runway emergency repair, aircraft and fishing 
boats combat tactics and mining, infiltration and transport, private plants 
reinforcing military needs and expanding production and repair and other 
matters.
   The 007 “Tung Hsin No. 9” Exercise carried out reserve force 
mobilization drill in the northern, central and southern regions of the 
island simultaneously. And after impromptu combat and training, under the 
united command of the district commands, the reserve force collaborated 
with the regular force to engage in cooperated homeland defense combat 
drill, effectively strengthening the combat capability of reserve forces to 
realize“spontaneous attack by standing force and township defense by 
the reserves” practices.
.All-out defense mobilization (Wan-An) exercise is the concrete practice 
of all-out defense; it is also a display of the effectiveness of the annual 
mobilization preparation works undertaken by the Executive Yuan 
Mobilization Conference. The 007 all-out defense mobilization Wan-An 
339National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
Exercise centered around homeland security and performed mobilization, 
civil defense, emergency medical care, counter-terrorism attacks, disaster 
prevention and rescue and nuclear incidents and other contingency 
response mechanisms of the special municipalities and county and city 
governments as the exercise themes. Three phases were implemented: 
“wargame”, “military drill”, and “all-out air defense evacuation drill”.
    The MND serves as the secretarial agency to expand the scale of the 
exercises and training based on relevant regulations such as the “Act of 
All-out Defense Mobilization Preparation” and “All-out Defense Education 
Act”. The Armed Forces st, nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th theater of operation and 
Kinmen and Matzu Defense Command implemented the first phase 
wargame from February 5 to March 5, 007, which was also performed in 
conjunction with the central ministerial annual exercises held by the Office 
of Homeland Security of the Executive Yuan. At the same time, 5 county 
and city governments and relevant military troops were coordinated to 
implement theater-by-theater military drill and air defense evacuation 
and drill from April to July 6, 007.
    Throughout the exercise period, approximately 3 ,000 personnel 
from police, firefighting, civil defense and state enterprises and 
military forces, 4,500 various motor vehicles and heavy construction 
machineries, 7 ships, and 8 helicopters were mobilized. Various 
kinds of materials and resources were also involved. These were 
to integrate all-out defense mobilization exercises that were highly 
difficult, large in scale, long in duration and wide in coverage. They 
were effective in enhancing the combat capability of all-out defense 
mobilization.
IV .Direction of Policies and Progress
(I) Consolidate an all-out defense consensus and strengthen all-out 
defense mobilization mechanisms
    Continue to educate the public on matters relevant to cooperating with 
all-out defense mobilization through all-out defense education channels. 
Coordinate closely the all-out defense mobilization conferences of various 
counties and cities to reserve mobilization capacity and strengthen 
homeland defense preparation work on an active front. Furthermore, 
collaborate with the overall building of communities to implement 
disaster prevention and relief, communicable disease control and other 
disaster emergency response measures in everyday lives. Establish an 
all-out defense consensus of “home security, property safety, township 
preservation and country protection”, and implement the policy of “uniting 
340
National Defense Reportnational defense and the people’s livelihood”.
(II) Perfect mobilization plans and actions and implement all-out 
defense mobilization exercises
    Based on the guiding principle of “incorporating mobilization in 
policy implementation, assimilating combat readiness in economic 
infrastructures”, the MND’s “Tung Hsin”, “Wan-An”, and “Tzu Chiang” and 
other all-out defense mobilization exercises and “Han Kuang” Exercise will 
be combined together to carry out exercises successively in the country 
or northern, central, or southern regions depending on the objective 
and nature of the exercises and training. The relevant central ministerial 
departments, special municipalities and county and city governments, 
and various types of military reserve forces will be mobilized to implement 
“integration of mobilization locations and tactical positions”, “mobilization 
logistics”, “outlying islands infiltration and transportation”, “demining and 
mining by expropriated fishing boats”, “mobilization of medical supplies”, 
“rear area security maintenance”, “procurement and requisition of military 
supplies”, “military transportation mobilization”, “all-out air defense”, 
“warfare disaster rescue”, and “security maintenance of major economic 
infrastructures and facilities” for an in-depth evaluation of the suitability 
and feasibility of the mobilization plans. 
Section 2  
Political-military Collaboration
    Taiwan’s all-out defense mobilization mechanism is categorized into 
two sub-systems: “administrative mobilization” and “military mobilization”. 
Administrative mobilization preparation is executed by the various central 
agencies and special municipalities and county and city governments. 
Military mobilization preparation is executed by the MND with the 
collaboration of various central agencies. At the same time, in order 
for “military mobilization” and “administrative mobilization” to integrate 
closely, an interface, the “All-out Combat Capabilities Coordination 
34National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
Organization” is established to coordinate and integrate the bridging 
works between the government and military for the realization of all-out 
defense mobilization.
I.Administrative Mobilization and Military Mobilization
(I) Administrative mobilization
    Various central agencies and governments of special municipalities, 
counties and cities are responsible for its implementation. They conduct 
investigation, tabulation, plans and arrangements on the nation’s 
manpower, material, technology, facility and transportation machineries 
available for mobilization, so that they may be effectively integrated 
for disaster prevention and relief reinforcements during peacetime and 
military operation reinforcements during wartime as well as catering for 
people’s livelihood needs.
1. Manpower mobilization
     This involves the establishment, assignment, training, replenishment, 
supervision and other preparations of manpower organization and 
planning during mobilization preparation to improve manpower quality 
and expand reserve capacity. This is so that manpower can be properly 
utilized during mobilization implementation and human resources can be 
leveraged to the fullest, achieving the effect of coordinating with national 
infrastructure, strengthening national strength, fully supporting military 
operations during wartime and maintaining the people’s livelihood.
2. Material mobilization
    This involves collaboration with various ministerial mobilization 
conferences to direct or supervise mobilization conferences of special 
◎ The All-out Combat Capabilities Coordination Organization 
performs the bridging function of coordinating between the 
government and military to consolidate and harness the 
overall strength of the people, government and military◎ Set local mobilization, local operation response, 
spontaneous mobilization and spontaneous operation as 
the highest goals to strengthen requirement in mobilization 
combat readiness and preparation34municipalities and county and city governments for reinforcements in 
military operations, and conducting investigations and calculations on 
various civil and material resources stored and available for mobilization 
within respective administrative districts on a regular basis. -3 months 
of abundant mobilization capacity is to be reserved. We also promote 
the material mobilization management information system to stay on top 
of actual figures. In addition, on June , 007, the Ministry of Economic 
Affairs, together with the MND completed the revision and formulation 
of Implementation Regulations Governing Materials Investigation and 
important material investigation items in accordance with the economic 
infrastructure development and military operational needs, so as to better 
material resource investigations.
(II) Military mobilization
    All-out defense mobilization is the main body of national mobilization, 
and is categorized into two parts: military force mobilization and 
military supply industry mobilization. Military force mobilization includes 
manpower and materials, where material mobilization includes military 
transportation mobilization, military supply procurement and requisition, 
etc; and military supply industry mobilization includes production and 
repair systems. These are to fully utilize the manpower and material 
capacity reserved in the private sector to achieve reinforcements in 
military operations.
1. Military force mobilization:
    Based on the concept of nurturing a few servicemen in peacetime and 
expending many servicemen in wartime and following the policy guidance 
of “streamlining standing forces and widely reserving reserve forces”, 
the biggest objective of mobilization is to ensure local mobilization, local 
operation response, spontaneous mobilization and spontaneous operation. 
There should also be a focus on “helping the public in peacetime, utilized 
in the military in wartime” and “transforming the people’s strength into 
our strength, and turning our strength into operational strength”. Military 
buildup guidelines in technological leadership, information and electronic 
advantages, joint interception and homeland defense are also to be 
observed for implementing mobilization readiness principles, which set 
ground forces as the main body and theaters of operations as the core 
based on the force buildup plan that separates the regular forces from the 
reserves. This will streamline requisition and collection operations, fully 
utilize all-out mobilization manpower and materials capacity, and reinforce 
demands in mobilization combat readiness and buildup. 
2. Military supply industry mobilization:
    Selected and eligible private factories are used to build the production 
343National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
and repair systems of military supply industry mobilization and accomplish 
mobilization preparation operations, so as to facilitate expanded 
production and repair capacity during wartime and reinforce military 
needs.
II.All-out Combat Capabilities Coordination 
Organization
    In order for administrative mobilization and military mobilization 
of peacetime and wartime to truly integrate with one another, the All-
out Combat Capabilities Coordination Organization was set up. The 
organization uses the theaters of operations as the operation center, local 
reserve commands and county and city reserve commands as bridges, 
various levels of administrative agencies and state and private enterprises 
as backup, reserve soldier and civil defense organizations as foundation. 
In peacetime, mobilization preparation is accomplished by means of 
conferences for coordination and communication. In wartime or times of 
emergencies, operations are carried out under the united command of 
military orders to achieve mobilization and support military warfighting 
missions.
(I) Organization establishment
    The All-out Combat Capabilities Coordination Organization is the 
coordination interface between the administrative agencies and military 
units. It is a secondary organization within the All-out Defense Mobilization 
Preparation System and categorized into three levels:Taiwan island, 
regional and special municipality, and county and city. Since September 
004, joint meeting of the “Three-in-one conference of mobilization, 
disaster prevention and combat capabilities of special municipality 
and county and city” has been promoted to enhance effectiveness of 
communication networks and increase response speed towards disasters. 
See Figure - for organization establishment.
3441. Taiwan combat capabilities coordination conference
    The Commander and Deputy Commander of the MND Reserve 
Command concurrently serve as the chairperson and deputy chairperson. 
The chairperson appoints the executive secretaries of relevant central 
ministerial mobilization conferences, deputy commanders of various 
military commands, and directors of key state and private enterprises to 
serve concurrently as committee members. Meeting is held annually. The 
secretariat under it is served concurrently by specific units appointed by 
the MND Reserve Command.
2. Regional and special municipality combat capabilities 
coordination conference
    Meeting is held twice a year and categorized into three conferences 
based on administrative districts:
(i) Combat capabilities conference of Taiwan island 
regions                  
    There are four regions: northern, central, southern and eastern regions. 
The secretariat under it is served concurrently by specific units appointed 
by the respective District Reserve Command.
(ii) Combat capabilities conference of offshore and 
outlying islands

    There are three regions: Penghu, Kinmen and Matzu. The secretariat 
under it is served concurrently by specific units appointed by the 
respective Defense Command.
(iii) Combat capabilities conference of special 
municipalities               
    There are the Taipei City and Kaohsiung City with one chairperson 
served concurrently by the mayor. The secretariat under it is served 
concurrently by specific units appointed by the Reserve Command of the 
respective special municipality.
3. Combat capabilities coordination conference of counties and 
cities
   There are 3 counties and cities with one chairperson each served 
concurrently by the respective mayor. Deputy Chairperson is however 
served by two people, but only one for Kinmen County and Lienchiang 
County. They are served concurrently by the respective deputy mayor 
and the county and city Reserve Command commander. There are a few 
committee members who are appointed by the chairperson from amongst 
department chiefs or executives of the county and city governments, 
representative of military agency in the administrative district, head of 
township and village, and director of key state and private enterprises 
and associations to serve concurrently. The secretariat under it is served 
concurrently by specific units appointed by the Reserve Command of the 
respective county and city.
(II) Functions and tasks
    The All-out Combat Capabilities Coordination Organization performs the 
bridging function of coordinating between the government and military. 
It works using the special municipal and county and city administrative 
districts as core centers, various level of administrative agencies, 
state and private enterprises as backup, theaters of operations as the 
integration units for meeting mobilization needs of the operating forces 
and assigning forces for local reinforcements, and district and county 
and city Reserve Commands as the political-military coordination and 
communication channels, so as to consolidate and harness the overall 
strength of the people, government and military. In peacetime when 
encountering major disasters or accidents, the administrative agencies 
will coordinate the military’s support in disaster prevention and rescue 
through the All-out Defense Capabilities Coordination Organization of. 
In wartime, in order to reinforce military operations, the Armed Forces 
can utilize the Combat Capabilities Conferences for submitting operation 
reinforcements and requests to the administrative agencies. See Figure 
-3 for the political-military collaboration relationship. 
346III.Actions and Results
(I) Promoting the joint operation of “Three Major Conferences of 
Mobilization Preparation, Combat Capabilities Coordination and 
Disaster Prevention”
    The regional level combat capabilities coordination conference was 
convened 7 times in 007. The county and city level combat capabilities 
coordination conference was convened 46 times in 007. They were 
conducted in the form of joint operation among the “Three Conferences of 
Mobilization Preparation, Combat Capabilities Coordination and Disaster 
Prevention”, directed at relevant actions of hazard prevention and rescue. 
In addition to carrying out specific briefings on issues such as exercise 
planning and buildup, the meetings also seek to strengthen disaster 
prevention and rescue and support military operations by incorporating 
all-out defense education into the agenda, thereby effectively increasing 
the organization efficiency of the three major conferences and leveraging 
the spirit and efficiency of political-military collaboration. 
(II) Assisting in disaster prevention and rescue
    Promulgate regulations of “Disaster Prevention (Rescue) Mechanism 
Operations” in accordance with the “Implementation Guidelines for Contact 
Figure -3  Political–Military Collaboration Relationship 
of Taiwan’s All-out Defense Mobilization347National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
Officers Assigned by the MND to Station at the Disaster Response Centers 
of Local Governments and Reinforcing Disaster Rescue Operations” 
promulgated by the MND and the Combat Capabilities Coordination 
Conference. Upon establishment of various levels of response centers, the 
Reserve Command and regional and county and city Reserve Commands 
shall assign personnel to station. A total of 404 personnel were assigned 
to station during natural disasters including Sapat, Krosa, Mitag and 0608 
Flood. In addition, the various regional (theater of operation) combat 
capabilities conferences have established disaster response command 
centers to process applications for military support made by county and 
city governments. 3 ,40 force personnel and 3,369 motor vehicles and 
machineries of various types were dispatched. All these have successfully 
and timely assisted the local governments accomplishing disaster rescue 
and restoration tasks, which were well praised and applauded by the 
public.
(III) Conducting all-out defense mobilization executives and cadres 
workshops
    From October to December every year, the “All-out defense 
mobilization executives and relevant cadres and personnel workshops” 
are conducted. More than a thousand people including the executive 
secretaries, chiefs and personnel of mobilization conferences of central 
ministries and local governments, and chiefs and relevant personnel 
of military mobilization operations are gathered in the northern, central 
and southern regions to participate in the workshops. Through studying 
the theory and regulations and practices, the operational guidance and 
coordination ability of the mobilization cadres are strengthened, and the 
professional skills of grass-roots level mobilization staff are increased. A 
consensus of mutual collaboration and support between the government 
and military is also established, so as to facilitate the promotion and 
coordination of mobilization preparation. 
(IV) Implementing guidance and visits
    In order to understand the implementation and degree of 
progress of mobilization preparation carried out by the various 
operational units, the Executive Yuan Mobilization Conference, under 
the secretarial agency’s planning, formed the “ Joint Visitation Team” with 
relevant central ministries between February and March, 007. The Team 
visits the eight competent authorities of mobilization preparation plans: 
Ministry of Education, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Economic Affairs, 
Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transportation and Communications, 
Department of Health, National Science Council, and Ministry of National 
defense. By means of planning, review, on-site visitation and investigation 
348and panel discussions, they seek to understand the working status 
of various ministerial mobilization conferences and any impediments 
to implementation and in turn deliberate on relevant solutions. This 
measure of guidance and visitation fully demonstrates the effectiveness of 
political-military collaboration, which enables the peacetime and wartime 
mobilization conferences to proceed smoothly, providing timely support to 
military operations.
IV .Direction of Policy and Progress
(I) Enhance effectiveness of political-military collaboration to carry 
out all-out defense mobilization
    In order to strengthen the functions of the All-out Combat Capabilities 
Coordination Organization and effectively integrate “administrative 
mobilization” and “military mobilization”, which will reserve overall combat 
capabilities for wartime and support military operations and emergency 
disasters, the MND is to establish the consensus and conviction that 
all-out defense mobilization is the responsibility and obligation of 
all citizens based on the principle of incorporating mobilization in 
policy implementation and assimilating combat readiness in economic 
infrastructures.
(II) Strengthen conference guidance system to improve lateral 
liaison mechanisms among ministries 
    Continue to observe guidance from the “Conference for All-out Defense 
Mobilization Preparation” of the Executive Yuan for the “Central Ministerial 
Mobilization Preparation Conference” and “Special Municipality and 
County and City Government Mobilization Preparation Conference”. 
Strengthen the lateral liaison and coordination among various ministries, 
enhance activities and resources planning and integration related to all-
out defense operations at all levels, implement defense mobilization 
preparation tasks, increase civil defense and military familiarity, timely and 
pertinently support military operations and disaster prevention and relief, 
and reduce the damage caused by emergency disasters and war.
(III) Stringently review applications for supply items to enhance 
military-civilian cooperation mechanisms
    During annual mobilization plan workshops and advance allocation and 
coordination meetings on procurement and requisition, relevant promotion 
and briefings on actual practice are to be conducted to enhance the 
mobilization skills and knowledge of military agencies. Also, the Armed 
Forces mobilization troops are asked to submit requests that strictly 
follow the regulations prescribed in the Implementation Regulations and 
Operation Manual of Material Investigation promulgated by the Ministry 
349National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
National Defense Reportof Economic Affairs. The theaters of operations are to convene review 
meetings and remove items that are requested by the requisition troops 
that do not comply with the operation manual. For logistics equipment 
that could be budgeted but not included in the procurement and 
requisition operations, and for materials that could not be required from 
the private sector, they should be reviewed and included for production 
by the mobilization factories of the military supply industry, or supplied 
by proposed projects, so as to simplify the complexity of needs proposed 
by the Armed Forces’ mobilization troops and accomplishing material 
mobilization preparation in a prompt and practical manner.
Section 3  
Building Homeland Security
    The protection of homeland security involves not only external military 
threats, but also natural disasters and man-made threatening factors. 
To safeguard homeland security, we will effectively coordinate domestic 
disaster prevention and relief, communicable disease control, radiation 
disaster response, counter-terrorism operations and other emergency 
response systems, enhance the lateral and vertical liaison mechanisms 
between various emergency response systems, and promptly integrate 
national resources as a whole and mobilize overall strength from all 
citizens. By setting homeland defense and peacetime and wartime 
integration as our goals, we will build the homeland security network and 
implement all-out defense.
I.Homeland Security Policy Objectives
    In order to prevent future society panic and economic crisis that could 
be caused by various emergencies and compromise homeland security, 
the Executive Yuan has been convening the “Executive Yuan Homeland 
Security (all-out mobilization, disaster prevention, counter-terrorism) 
Three-in-one Joint Policy Conference” since 007. The Executive Yuan 
350mobilization conference system follows guidance from the Joint Policy 
Conference and integrates domestic disaster prevention and relief, 
communicable disease control, radiation disaster response, counter-
terrorism operations and other emergency response systems, enhance 
the lateral and vertical liaison mechanisms between various emergency 
response systems, and promptly and comprehensively gathers national 
resources and mobilize overall strength from all citizens. The system sets 
homeland defense and peacetime and wartime integration as goals in 
implementing all-out defense.
II.The Role of the All-out Defense Mobilization System in 
“Homeland Security Network ”
    Modern mobilization system has evolved from a single warfighting 
function to the dual function of warfighting and contingency response 
(including emergency response, major disaster relief and others), 
highlighting the importance of all-out defense mobilization system 
in homeland security network. The well-established all-out defense 
mobilization organization and comprehensive political-military 
coordination system can dispense energy during peacetime to various 
response mechanisms so that they can utilize their own laws and 
regulations for procurement and requisition and become the main reserve 
reinforcements. And in wartime, an all-out strength can be mobilized to 
maintain homeland security.
III.Actions and Results
(I) Integrating with regulations of emergency response systems
◎ Conduct exercise verification to increase operation 
experience in practical integration ◎ Integrate with the all-out defense mobilization system 
to carry out emergency medical care35National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
    In order to strengthen response capability to emergencies, promptly 
and effectively coordinate relevant manpower, material resources in early 
warning and aftermath handling, the all-out defense mobilization system 
have integrated with emergency response systems and legal frameworks 
including “Disaster Prevention and Protection Act”, “Civil Defense Act”, 
“Communicable Disease Control Act”, “Emergency Medical Services Act” 
and “Nuclear Emergency Response Act” to legalize the homeland security 
network and achieve the ultimate objectives of homeland defense and 
peacetime and wartime integration.
. Integrating with disaster prevention and protection: According to the 
regulations of the “Disaster Prevention and Protection Act”, various 
levels of disaster prevention and protection conferences shall integrate 
with the all-out defense mobilization preparation system to implement 
relevant disaster prevention and protection, contingency responses and 
summoning matters.
(i) For resources required for emergency disaster relief, various levels 
of disaster prevention and protection conferences shall coordinate with 
the mobilization conferences of the respective level to provide relevant 
information on disaster prevention and protection, contingency responses 
and summoning measures and specify thereof in each other’s plans.
(ii) Various levels of disaster prevention and protection conferences 
shall coordinate major disaster prevention and protection measures, 
countermeasures and disaster emergency measures with relevant 
mobilization conferences for collaborated implementation or providing 
advice.   
(iii) The special municipal and county and city disaster response centers 
shall coordinate with the corresponding All-out Combat Capabilities 
Coordination Conferences and assign personnel for station. The 
coordination in which the Armed Forces reinforce disaster disposals has 
worked quite well since it started operation. In addition, it is stipulated 
that disaster relief during wartime will be integrated and coordinated by 
the All-out Combat Capabilities Coordination Conferences of respective 
theater of operations for alleviating major disasters.
. Combining with civil defense: According to the regulations of the “Civil 
Defense Act”, competent authorities at various levels, when necessary, 
shall combine the civil defense team establishment with the all-out 
defense mobilization preparation system to help relieve major disasters 
and support military services during wartime.
3. Combining with communicable disease prevention: According to the 
regulations of the “Communicable Disease Control Act”, in the event of 
serious epidemic conditions of communicable diseases within the country 
35and overseas, or epidemic conditions induced by terrorist incidents of 
biological agents, competent authorities at various levels shall integrate 
with the national defense mobilization preparation system to implement 
relevant disease control measures.
4. Combining with emergency medical care: Abiding by the “Emergency 
Medical Services Act” with regards to prevention and response measures 
of disasters and wars, health authorities at various levels shall implement 
matters concerning emergency medical services; when necessary, the 
all-out defense mobilization preparation system may be combined to 
implement emergency medical services.
5. Combining with the nuclear emergency response: According to the 
regulations in the “Nuclear Emergency Response Act”, the central 
Competent Authority may call upon the all-out defense mobilization 
preparation system to carry out relevant emergency response actions 
when necessary.
(II) Convening coordination meetings
    In order to strengthen the lateral liaison and communication exchange 
among systems including disaster prevention and protection, civil 
defense, emergency medical services, communicable disease control, 
nuclear emergency response and all-out defense mobilization, the MND 
appoints personnel to participate in the “Central Emergency Response 
System Coordination Meeting” on every emergency response system, 
including mobilization, civil defense, disaster prevention and protection, 
toxic chemical disaster prevention, emergency medical services, 
communicable disease control, and nuclear emergency response, so as 
to deliberate on the interconnection and integration among the various

emergency response systems. On May 6, 006, the Coordination Meeting 
passed the amendment of “Implementation Regulations Governing the 
Central Emergency Response System Coordination Meeting”, which 
has included the National Security Council and the Office of Homeland 
Security of the Executive Yuan as the presiding guidance agencies to 
enhance coordination of emergency response systems and consolidate 
integration of central-level response mechanisms.
(III) Promoting district joint defense (2004NDR: regional 
cooperative network/system defense) with major infrastructures
    Major infrastructures such as reservoirs, power plants, transportation,     
communications, information, finance and other projects, if damaged, 
not only pose threats to the people’s lives and safety, they also disable 
government agencies from normal operations. In peacetime, the civil 
defense teams, that are affiliated to the respective infrastructures and 
established by relevant personnel, have implemented training and 
simulation exercises as well as reserving various rescue equipment. 
Should there be more requests upon consideration, assistance from the 
combat capabilities coordination conferences at various levels could 
be sought to sign a force reinforcement agreement with the nearby 
garrison force. This will establish a local joint defense mechanism to 
ensure the security and protection of important political and economical 
infrastructures. 
(IV)Homeland security prevention and protection drill
. According to the policy directives of the Executive Yuan’s “Homeland 
Security Network”, in order for various plans, proposals and standard 
operating procedures to take effect, the Ministry of the Interior and MND 
are to formulate the annual exercise plans and items and jointly conduct 
exercise verification with various competent authorities to increase 
operation experience of practical integration, so that the Homeland 
Security Network could operate more effectively. Since 004 the MND 
began to coordinate relevant ministries as the secretarial agency of the 
Executive Yuan Mobilization Conference, individual exercise of various 
disaster response mechanisms including mobilization, civil defense, 
disaster prevention and protection, emergency medical services and 
communicable disease control have been integrated to become the 
homeland security exercises and named the “All-out Defense Mobilization 
(Wan-An) Exercise”.
. According to the plan of the Executive Yuan Mobilization 
Conference, the county and city governments changed their existing 
full-scale drill to every 3 years and by means of ministerial joint 
guidance. The chiefs of local governments, in accordance with the 354
respective local characteristics, will preside and plan the drill items 
and command the police, firefighting, civil defense and medical 
care manpower and materials and the reinforcing Armed Forces 
troops within the respective administrative districts to carry out 
comprehensive drills. From 005 to 007, livelihood rations and 
allocated sales during times of shortage, toxic chemical disaster 
response and rescue and flood prevention exercises were also 
stepped up to reduce the burden of various local governments. 
The objective of the exercises is also to be achieved by pooling of 
resources.
3. The 006 “Wan-An No. 9” exercise centered around homeland security 
defense and took on special municipal and county and city governments’ 
mobilization, civil defense, emergency medical service, counter-terrorism 
attack, disaster prevention and protection and nuclear accidents and 
other contingency mechanisms as drill themes. They were implemented in 
three phases: “wargame”, “emergency response mechanism operational 
synergy”, “all-out air defense”, to respond to the development of modern 
warfare and various compound disasters. Approximately 3 ,000 personnel 
of police, firefighting, civil defense, medical care, state and private 
enterprises and military manpower and material, more than 3,000 vehicles 
of various types and heavy construction machineries, 6 helicopters, 8 
ships were mobilized to participate in the exercises, fully demonstrating 
the reserve capacity of all-out defense mobilization and efficiency in 
contingency response and combat readiness both during peacetime and 
wartime.
4. In order to strengthen mobilization preparation, verify the 
effectiveness in implementing mobilization, face up to conventional 
and non-conventional security threats, the 007 “Wan-An No. 30” 
exercise continued to center around homeland security protection and 
adopted the conceptual framework of the Armed Forces “Han Kuang 
No. 3” exercise. Through collaborated drill, collaborated contingency 
functions that integrate the mechanisms, unite the government and 
military, and enable military-civilian compatibility were enhanced, 
effectiveness of the Homeland Security Network consolidated and all-
out defense realized. “Wan-An No. 30” was also implemented along 
the Armed Forces’ “Tung Hsin No. 9” and various relevant central 
ministerial annual exercises.
IV .Direction of Policy and Progress
(I) Assist in the convening of Coordination Meetings to integrate 355National Defense Report
The Republic of China TAIWAN Republic of China  	2008  
capacities of all-out mobilization, disaster prevention and counter-
terrorism and contingency response 
   According to the decision of the 007 “Executive Yuan Homeland 
Security (All-out Mobilization, Disaster Prevention, Counter-terrorism) 
Three-in-one Joint Policy Conference”, the “Central Emergency Response 
System Coordination Meeting” is to be conducted by the Office of 
Homeland Security of the Executive Yuan and co-organized by the MND 
Department of Reserve Affairs and National Firefighting Agency of the 
Ministry of the Interior, The meeting convenes every half year where 
the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan acts as the chairperson 
and deputy executives and relevant staff of agencies related to each 
emergency response system including mobilization, civil defense, disaster 
prevention, toxic chemical disaster control, emergency medical services, 
communicable disease control, and nuclear emergency response 
participate. Whenever necessary, relevant agencies such as the National 
Security Council, National Security Bureau, and Research, Development 
and Evaluation Commission of the Executive Yuan are to be invited to 
deliberate together on the interconnection and integration of among 
various emergency response systems. 
(II) Improve the Wan-An exercise approach to help promote 
homeland security
    In order to strengthen homeland security, and learning from the “Han 
Kuang No. 3”, “Tung Hsin No. 9” and “Wan-An No. 30” exercises, the 
refined plan of the 008 “Wan-An 3 ” exercise is as follows:
1. Wargame
   Combine with “Han Kuang No. 4” exercise to implement computer 
wargaming. The Combat Capabilities Coordination Conferences of 
various special municipalities and county and city governments will 
form streamlined command teams to be incorporated into the Combat 
Capabilities Coordination Conferences of the respective theater of 
operations (Defense Command) for drill participation.
2. Combined practice
    Set administrative mobilization’s reinforcing military operations as 
the key exercise item to combine with thepractical verification schedule 
(006 NDR: field exercise) of the “Han Kuang No. 4” exercise for 
implementation.
3. All-out air defense
    By means of district divisions and different schedules, issue air-defense 
sirens at different times during the day and night to implement air-defense 
evacuation drills.

    In order to make our people understand national defense and 
to display transparency in policy implementation, the MND has 
published the “National Defense Report” every two years since 
99 to explain national defense concepts and results of policy 
implementation and show accountability to the people in hope of 
increasing their faith in national defense, which in turn evokes 
their support and participation in national defense establishments, 
thereby achieving the objectives of consolidating an “all-out 
defense” consensus and building modern defense.
   This ( 008) National Defense Report is the 9th publication 
of its kind. In addition to the consistent publishing style of this 
series, more importantly, it seeks to express the Armed Forces’ 
fearlessness in the face of dangerous environment and difficult 
times and their pragmatism in taking one step at a time. Having 
accomplished the short term mission of military affairs innovation in 
a gradual process of “national defense transformation”, the MND is 
now actively working towards a “reliable national defense”. Through 
the elucidation and communication of the concepts, we hope to 
evoke unity among all citizens to recognize enemy threats and hold 
fast to patriotic beliefs and increase the international communities’ 
understanding and support for Taiwan’s dedication in maintaining 
the peaceful status quo across the Taiwan Strait and willingness to 
contribute to the global village, so as to defuse the possible crisis 
brought upon by cross-Strait conflicts and make way for Taiwan’s 
international visibility and opportunity to exert an influence. 
   The compilation of the 008 National Defense Report is 397National Defense Report
