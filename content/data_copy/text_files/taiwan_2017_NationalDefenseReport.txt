Foreword
For a long period of time, the ROC has played an important role in maintaining peace, stability 
and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. Although the ROC does not have formal diplomatic 
relations with neighboring countries, we have engaged in substantive exchange based on the principles of goodwill, good faith and mutual benefit to build a stable security environment and have actively made a significant contribution to peace and stability, not just regionally, but 
globally.
In view of the overall development of the situation in the Asia-Pacific region recently, there 
are some obvious causes for concern. North Korea is developing nuclear weapons and ballistic 
missiles at an astonishing speed, increasing tension on the Korean Peninsula. Disputes surrounding 
the sovereignty of islands and reefs in the South China Sea and disagreements over freedom of navigation have sparked a regional military contest; the PLA Navy and Air Force have conducted 
multiple long-distance missions in 2017, crossing the first island chain through the Miyako 
Strait and Bashi Channel, and have even carried out various exercises in the Western Pacific, 
representing a severe threat to security in the Taiwan Strait.
We recognize the fact that the ROC cannot match the PRC’s national defense budget and military 
development. The speed and extent of its increase in military strength far exceed predictions. 
Facing a worsening security threat, we must adjust defensive concepts and force buildup and 
readiness strategies with foresight. This year, we presented the military strategy of “resolute defense and multi-domain deterrence”, which was tested in the 33
rd Han Kuang Exercise. We have 
reviewed and formulated our thinking on the development of asymmetric combat capability to 
deter reckless military advance by the PRC with concrete and pragmatic actions.
In terms of force restructuring, the Information, Communications and Electronic Force (ICEF) 
has been established to strengthen protection of infrastructure and information security. The air-
defense missiles of the Air Force and artillery units have been integrated into the Air Defense and 
Missile Command, greatly increasing operational command efficiency. Also, the commissioning of P-3C anti-submarine and maritime patrol aircraft allows the Air Force to carry out longer duration 
and more wide-ranging anti-submarine patrols to ensure homeland security .
As for self-reliant national defense, programs for indigenous warplanes and Navy vessels have 
both been officially launched. National security must be controlled in our own hands. Fully 
89Minister of National Defense
2017/12committed to overcoming all difficulties, we have been encouraging armament technology R&D 
through government incentives and, through long-term national defense requirements, promoting 
the development of the defense industry, and thus gradually reducing the reliance on foreign 
acquisition.
The ROC Armed Forces cannot avert the impact of the low-fertility trend on the transition to a 
volunteer force. To build a volunteer force that is able to retain personnel long-term and have 
strong warfighting capabilities, we have simplified administrative affairs and increased allowances according to different skill sets, while renovating old barracks under the Xing An Program for 
higher living quality for service personnel. We have also provided incentives for further education 
to facilitate personnel reentering the work force upon leaving the military .
Besides diligently fulfilling our core mission of operational training, the Armed Forces have 
also assisted the people when they face danger and hardship through disaster rescue, emergency 
response, helping with the harvest and other activities. The annual Min An and Wan An drills 
are staged together with local governments to promote all-out defense education and consolidate 
overall national war resources.
Facing future national defense and security challenges, I will do my utmost to achieve the 
objectives of protecting national security and the well-being of the people. Externally, I will strive 
to continue to maintain good interaction with friendly countries and, internally, win the respect of 
the people, to give military personnel the dignity they deserve. The MND will build good relations 
with the Legislative Yuan and all citizens based on mutual trust and interaction to ensure that the 
ROC Armed Forces are outstanding, strong and can be relied on by the people.
Finally, this report describes the efforts of the Armed Forces over the last two years and future 
developments in a reader-friendly way to increase the public’s understanding of our Armed 
Forces; it features more illustrations and statistics than previously,  addresses every important 
issue and uses lively pictures and text to increase readability for military personnel and the general 
public, with the aim of cultivating mutual respect between the people and the Armed Forces.

Article 30 of the National Defense Act  stipulates that the Ministry of National Defense 
(MND) periodically publishes a national defense report to elaborate changes in the strategic 
environment and the effectiveness of national defense policies to the people. This year’s is the 14th 
report released, with “Guarding the borders, defending the land -The ROC Armed Forces in view” 
as the theme. The report affirms the efforts of the Armed Forces to protect the ROC and its people 
and aims to remind citizens to have a sense of danger in peacetime, so they attach importance to national defense. As a guide for readers, this introduction is divided into 5 parts: Strategic 
Environment, National Defense Readiness, Self-reliant National Defense, National Defense 
Governance and The Honor of the Armed Forces. The report covers the period from May 2016 to 
November 2017.
Part 1: Strategic Environment
The global security environment at present is still characterized by uncertainty and complexity, 
while the Asia-Pacific security situation continues to be dominated by the US and the PRC. In 
addition, the search for coalitions among Asia-Pacific countries with respect to security issues, 
instability of the situation on the Korean Peninsula, rapid military reform of the PLA, arms race among countries in the region, and non-conventional security threats all affect strategic parity in 
the Asia-Pacific region and pose security challenges to the ROC. We must effectively leverage 
our geo-strategic advantage to engage in deeper cooperation with countries with which we share 
common interests and make a contribution to regional peace and stability through such ef forts.
Part 2: National Defense Readiness
The Armed Forces optimize combat readiness in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic 
of China (Taiwan) , the National Defense Act  and their mission. National defense and military 
strategies are formulated in response to changes in the strategic environment and the enemy threat 
to guide the direction of force buildup and readiness efforts. With innovative/asymmetric thinking, steady organizational adjustment is continually carried out and joint operation exercises and 
training enhanced in order to establish reliable defense power.Introduction11Part 3: Self-reliant National Defense
Pursuant to the requirements of Article 22 of the National Defense Act, weapon R&D, production 
and life cycle support capabilities are actively established in combination with the technological 
capabilities of industry, academia and the R&D sector. In addition, the government provides 
incentives to the private sector for its participation in flagship projects, including production of indigenous aircraft and vessels, with the aim of achieving national defense industry revival and 
self-reliant national defense through the combination of such participation and the resources of 
various government agencies.
Part 4: National Defense Governance
Guided by the 2017 Quadrennial Defense Review , the report elaborates the implementation of 
major policies, including volunteer military system, care of officers and service personnel, budget 
resources, weapons acquisition, military medicine, protecting human rights, active utilization of 
land managed by the military, national defense legal system, military cooperation and exchange, and international linkage. The aim is to promote excellent national defense governance and 
become a key force for maintaining regional security and stability with these ef forts.
Part 5: The Honor of the Armed Forces
Inheriting an honorable history, the Armed Forces promote force buildup and readiness, 
implement all-out defense, consolidate a national consensus, carry out operations to protect the 
people, reassure the people and maintain social order. The military also actively nurtures talent 
and provides a career coaching service to retired/discharged personnel, so they can contribute to society after being honorably discharged.12

The current global security environment is characterized by rapid change and great uncertainty. 
The international situation has become more complicated due to intertwined influences of 
political, economic and military security issues. The US continues to dominate regional security order with its great national power. Taiwan
,s security, however, is affected by the rapid military 
reform of the PRC, uncertainties on the Korean Peninsula, region-wide armaments modernization, 
growing unconventional security threats, and other factors. Situated in an important geostrategic 
location in the Asia Pacific region, we should pay attention to changes in the international security environment and expand our strategic value in order to make a contribution to peace and stability 
in the Taiwan Strait and the region.Part 1: Strategic Environment14Chapter 1 Security Situation
At the present stage, the regional security situation appears to be both cooperation and 
competition (coopetition) between the US and the PRC as each seeks alliances and 
strengthens strategic partnerships. The PRC has expanded its diplomatic and economic strategic influence, and expedited global and regional power projection capability through the “Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21
st Century Maritime Silk Road” (One Belt One Road Initiative). The 
DPRK seeks to further develop nuclear weapons and upgrade its ballistic missile capability, 
triggering strategic competition between the big powers in the region and affecting regional 
security. Regional non-conventional security threats are also on the rise. The disputes over sovereignty in the East China Sea and South China Sea and competition over natural resources 
continue. These are all transnational issues. The ROC should take advantage of its geo-strategic 
position and work together with other countries to deal with challenges through regional security 
cooperation mechanisms.
Section 1 Changes in the Asia-Pacific Security Situation
The main variables affecting the overall security situation in the Asia-Pacific region are the 
PRC’s acceleration of its military modernization and growing military activities, and the 
DPRK’s continuing development of nuclear weapons and ongoing missile tests. Also, since the US withdrew most of its troops from the Middle East, it has gradually turned its strategic focus and force deployment to the Asia-Pacific region. As countries of the region continue to acquire 
advanced armaments and increase their military power to protect their sovereign territory, the risk 
of potential conflict continues to challenge peace and stability.
I .   Adjustment of the US’s Asia-Pacific Strategy
Since taking office, US President Donald Trump has emphasized the principle of “America First.” Though the US has withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and abandoned 
the previous administration’s Asia-Pacific “rebalance” strategy, its focus on the region 
remains. The US maintains a large military presence, and continues to consolidate relations with traditional allies, such as Japan and the ROK, and strengthen security cooperation 
consensus, with focus on dealing with the North Korean issue and managing the coopetition 
between the US and the PRC.
The US Defense Department’s report Military and Security Developments Involving the 
People's Republic of China  issued in June, 2017 stated “the United States will continue to 
monitor China’s military modernization and it will continue to adapt its forces, posture, 
investments, and operational concepts to ensure the United States retains the ability to protect 
our allies and partners.” In the future, the US military strategy for the Asia-Pacific region will be developed through joint exercises to build alliance-oriented mission concept, command

and information networks. The US will also maintain navigation of its naval and air forces in 
certain areas to support its Asia-Pacific allies in maintaining regional peace and stability.
In November, President Trump attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
Economic Leaders’  Meeting and ASEAN Summit and made his first visit to 5 Asian countries 
during which he engaged in dialogue with leader. During his talk with Japan’s Prime Minister 
Shinzo Abe, he put forward the strategic view of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific region, 
including the vast ocean area from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean and peripheral countries, with an aim to bring India into US’s alliance system to share regional responsibility. However, 
related developments are ongoing. 
II . Rapid Growth in the PRC’s Power
After coming to power in 2012, the PRC’s leader Xi Jin-ping put forward “the Chinese 
Dream” and “Two Centennial Goals” as national strategic targets, aiming to build a 
“moderately prosperous society” by 2021, the year of the 100th anniversary of the founding

[Diagram of the PRC’s One Belt One Road]1717of the Communist Party of China, and “make China a prosperous, powerful, democratic, 
civilized, harmonious, beautiful and modernized socialist country” by 2049, the year of the 
100th anniversary of the establishment of the PRC. In his report at the 19th National Congress 
of the Communist Party of China in October, 2017, Xi put forward “Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,” demanding that the PLA actively carry out 
modernization in 4 dimensions, namely military theory, force structure, military personnel and weapons and equipment, to fundamentally achieve national defense and armed forces 
modernization by 2035. In addition, Xi also aims to build world-class armed forces by the 
middle of this century, consolidate the leading position of the CPC and facilitate economic, 
diplomatic and international activities.
In recent years, through political and economic strategies such as Regional Comprehensive 
Economic Partnership (RCEP) and “One Belt One Road,” the PRC has actively enhanced 
the security relationship with Russia and expanded the scale of military exercises, greatly 
expanding its political and security influence. In terms of military power, the PRC has allocated a large national defense budget over the years, actively expanded its military 
power, obtained advanced Navy and Air Force weapons purchased overseas and produced 
indigenously, developed cyber and Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities and continues with ballistic missile production and deployment. Today, the PRC’s Navy and Air Force have 
acquired long-range operation capability, pushing its military projection further into the area 
west of the second island chain and challenging regional security. It has also increased its 
ability to attack the ROC as well as raised the level of difficulty of military intervention by the 
international community, presenting a serious threat to our national defense and security. 
III .Disputes Over Island Sovereignty and Maritime Rights
There are numerous islands in the Asia-Pacific region and, with abundant minerals, natural gas, petroleum and fishery resources, countries are attaching increasing importance to 
maritime rights and are actively exploiting resources, a situation that is intensifying the 
competition over island sovereignty and exclusive economic zones. In particular, in the East China Sea and South China Sea, the exclusive economic zones of the nearby countries overlap 
as well as being located astride Western Pacific transportation lifelines, making the disputes 
difficult to resolve.
In terms of the East China Sea, following the so-called nationalization of the Diaoyutai 
Islands by Japan, the PRC announced the East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone and 
adjusted the deployment of its naval and air forces, began regular East China Sea patrols and 
has frequently crossed the first island chain for exercises in the Western Pacific. For its part, 
Japan has established the 9
th Air Wing at Naha, formed a Coast Observation Unit on Yonaguni 
Island and plans to station a garrison and missile force on Amami Ōshima and Miyako Island. 
The Japan Coast Guard has also added a Senkaku Islands Defense Force equipped with 12 
1000-ton patrol boats.18

Photo source: CSIS Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative20As for the South China Sea, the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM)  passed the framework 
of the Code of Conduct on the South China Sea (COC) in August 2017, the PRC continues 
to build islands by reclamation, militarize islands and reefs and continues its construction of 
infrastructure, such as runways and wharfs, and military deployment on many islands and reefs, including Fiery Cross Reef, Mischief Reef, Subi Reef and Johnson South Reef etc. in 
the Spratly Islands. In the future, each island and reef will be able to accommodate 20-26 
aircrafts, warships up to 10,000 tons and anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile forces, which will 
intensively protect the PRC’s rights at sea together with law enforcement vessels. Also, there has been friction between the US and the PRC when US Navy vessels carry out Freedom of 
Navigation Operations (FONOPs) inside a 12-nautical mile radius of the disputed islands and 
reefs.
IV .The Korean Peninsula Issue
Since coming to power in April 2012, the DPRK’s leader Kim Jong-Un has continued the 
country’s brinkmanship strategy and is continuing to develop and threaten to use nuclear 
weapons and enhance its intermediate and long range ballistic missiles. From February to 
November 2017, the DPRK staged 16 missile tests, claiming that the range of the Hwasong-15 10,000km1,300km4,500km
2,500km3,000km
The DPRK
8,000km6,700km6,000km21is capable of striking the whole mainland of the US The DPRK also carried out its sixth 
nuclear test on September 3, 2017, further increasing tension on the Korean Peninsula. 
Although large-scale military exercises and armed provocation and other means have put 
the country under severe economic pressure, the DPRK is accumulating key technology capabilities, such as ballistic missiles and nuclear weapon miniaturization, through its missile 
and nuclear weapon tests, seeking to increase its international bargaining chips to force the 
US to recognize it as a nuclear state and end the military exercises and economic sanctions 
against it.
The US, the ROK, Japan and the UN continue to handle the DPRK problem with caution and 
have actively adopted new diplomatic, security and economic sanctions, including limiting 
oil imports, banning textiles export and conducting military operations, such as launching 
interceptor missiles, flying B-1B strategic bombers across the Korean Peninsula and dispatching nuclear submarines to take part in combined military exercises.
President Trump reiterated in November 2017, that “the era of strategic patience is over.” 
A final consensus was reached with the ROK’s president Moon Jae-in on the revision of the ROK-US Ballistic Missile Guidelines , in which the 2 countries agree to remove the limit Scud-B

development programs.
The ROK has also deployed the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, 
established intelligence and command and control systems and expanded the range of radar detection to increase its early warning and defense capabilities. This move was met with 
strong opposition from the PRC, which believes that the THAAD system’s radar range will 
be able to monitor its missile activities and exercises in the Northern Theater, Yellow Sea 
and Bohai Sea, seriously affecting its strategic interests, sending China-ROK relations into a 
nosedive. However, in October 2017, the ROK gave three commitments, namely that it will not add more THADD systems, that its existing position of not participating in the US anti-
ballistic missile system will not change, and that South Korea-US-Japan security cooperation 
will not develop into a trilateral military alliance. Normal exchange was restored between the 
PRC and the ROK subsequently and the tension between the countries eased.
V  . Non-conventional Security Threats
Of all non-conventional security threats, complex disasters and cyberattacks represent the 
biggest threats to Taiwan. The spread of terrorism is also an issue that cannot be ignored. 
Taiwan is situated in the Pacific Ring of Fire earthquake zone and on the periphery of the 
Pacific and, as such, is frequently affected by earthquakes and typhoons which pose a threat to Taiwan’s national security on various levels. The threat to information network security

infrastructure have become the targets; the result of the damage suffered can be incapacitation 
of the government, social disorder and holes in national defense, seriously threatening 
national security.
Terrorism is gradually spreading around the world. If an attack occurs in Taiwan, it could 
directly cause serious loss of life and property, create panic and undermine  normal social 
and economic activities. Such security threats other than war are all international due to the linkage between countries that has resulted from globalization and need to be prevented and 
stopped through international security cooperation mechanisms.
The focus of the US’s Asia-Pacific strategy is dealing with the problem of the DPRK, the 
“coopetition” relationship with the PRC, and strengthening military cooperation with allies such as Japan and the ROK.

324Section 2 National Defense Situation of the Countries in the 
Region
In face of rapid changes in the international situation and new forms of threat, tension in the 
Asia-Pacific region continues to rise. The countries of the region have adjusted their defense 
strategies and accelerated national defense reform in response to military provocation and 
development of potential threats.
I .  The United States
The 2017 Defense Posture Statement  of the US Defense Department pointed out the 5 main 
threats faced by the US are Russia, the PRC, the DPRK, Iran and terrorist organizations. The 
US believes that threats to its own security and that of its allies, such as The Islamic State of 
Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the DPRK, should be dealt with on a priority basis. The policy towards the DPRK includes any option including military intervention.
The Trump administration’s policy of “making America great again” is reflected in strategic 
planning and budget allocation; the annual national defense budget for 2017 was increased to 
US$619.2 billon; the total defense budget for 2018 is almost US$700 billion, of which US$ 
626 billion is base budget and for Overseas Contingency Operations expenditure.
In US-China coopetition, complex problems are solved through various cooperation 
mechanisms to reduce the chance of military conflict or accident. In the South China Sea, 
US interests lie in maintaining Freedom of Navigation and legal commercial activities, and resolving territorial disputes peacefully. It will continue to carry out various missions within 
the scope of international law.
In response to the DPRK’s successive missile and nuclear weapon tests and increased 
tension in northeast Asia, the US has strengthened its regional missile defense capability, has 
deployed THAAD in the ROK and has also carried out intensive military exercises with Japan 
and the ROK to prepare for military counter action.
II .  Japan
The basic idea for guaranteeing Japan’s security is building a “Dynamic Joint Defense Force” to ensure maritime and air security around Japan. In 2015, the Legislation for Peace 
and Security was passed to change the country’s security legislation,  expanding the scope 
of operations of the Japan Self-defense Force and enhancing the legal basis for conducting overseas missions. The legislative development allows Japan to exercise the right of limited 
collective self-defense.
Prime Minister Abe has also expressed the aim of amending the constitution to continue the 
normalization of the armed forces. When President Trump visited Japan in November 2017, 
Abe advocated the “Strategic Diamond,” with Japan, the US, Australia and India forming a trade and security network to counter the PRC’s “One belt One road” strategic initiative. From 
Part 1 Strategic 
Environment
252013, Japan’s national defense budget has increased 5 years in a row and was JPY4899.6 
billion (around US$44.5 billion) in 2017.
Through the 3 strategies of building a Dynamic Joint Defense Force, new legislation for peace 
and security, and strengthening the US-Japan alliance, Japan continues to consolidate the US-Japan alliance, strengthen Southwest Islands defense capability, improve the Self-Defense 
Force’s joint operations capability and closely monitor the military situation in the DPRK and 
the PRC.
As the South China Sea is Japan’s transportation lifeline, it has taken part in US-led freedom 
of navigation operations. In 2017, its helicopter carrier JS Izumo sailed into the South China 
Sea for 3 months of blue water training and conducted joint training with the US Navy to 
ensure freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. Japan also actively cooperates with 
peripheral countries through military and diplomatic cooperation, such as defense ministerial meetings, national defense staff meetings and signing of security or defense agreements, 
gradually strengthening strategic security cooperation with other countries.
III .The ROK
The ROK’s 2016 Defense White Paper emphasized that the objectives of its national defense 
policy are to “protect the nation from foreign military threat and attack,” support the peaceful reunification of the Korean Peninsula,” and “strive for regional and world peace”. The 
DPRK’s nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, Weapons of Mass Destruction, cyber war and terrorist attacks were listed as the main threats.
Although President Moon Jae-in advocates dialogue and exchange with the DPRK, the ROK 
has formulated a three-tier defense plan comprising of the Kill Chain, the Korea Air and Missile Defense and the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation, in face of continuing 
missile tests by the DPRK, aiming to stop the missile provocation by the DPRK with a 
multi-tier method and show that they are not intimidated by the North’s saber-rattling. The 
ROK continues to strengthen the US-South Korea military alliance and enhance strategic 
partnerships with peripheral countries. Its national defense policy is focused on innovative development of national defense matters, enhancement of joint operations effectiveness, 
encouragement of national defense industry development, assurance of sufficient national 
defense budget and effective management of it, development of information defense capability and promotion of innovative development of logistics supply. As a result, the ROK’s military 
power has clearly increased. The 2017 national defense budget was KRW40.33337 trillion 
(around US$35.64 billion) and has grown continually since year 2000.26IV . India
The 2017 Joint Doctrine Indian Armed Forces  pointed that its external security threats come 
in the form of border security, competition over natural resources, cross-border and non-state 
terrorist attacks and other non-conventional threats, while the internal threats are attacks from 
terrorist organizations and rebel groups, illegal immigration and ideological conflict, amongst others.
The eastern, central and western sections of the China-India border are disputed. In June 
2017, in Arunachal Pradesh (called Zangnan by China), on the eastern section of the border, the scope of the dispute clearly enlarged. After the PRC completed the Qinghai-Tibet Railway 
and airport and highway construction in this area, India successively increased its forces here. 
Recently, a border dispute arose at Doklam. While Indian forces withdrew from the border 
of the disputed area on August 28, the dispute has not been settled. Also, the Kashmir border 
problem has caused friction between India and Pakistan for many years. In the year of the 70
th anniversary of the founding of both countries, the outbreak of conflict that resulted in 
bloodshed added to the instability of the situation in that region.
In response to the security threats, India has strengthened its military power by purchasing 
foreign armaments and domestically manufactured weapons. It has enhanced military cooperation with the US, Japan etc., and taken part in naval and air force joint exercises in the 
Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific to increase military operation capability.
V .   Australia
Australia has a long tradition of security cooperation with the US. In recent years, it has been 
more actively involved in ASEAN region security issues in hope of playing an active role 
in regional affairs. In terms of guarding against the military rise of the PRC and the issue 
of South China Sea sovereignty, it stands alongside the US. Australia’s 2016 Defense White 
Paper pointed out that the US’s China strategy is the most important variable for Asia-Pacific 
regional security and the US is Australia’s most important strategic partner.
The focus of Australia’s military strategy is increasing its military power; it sees terrorism 
and cyber security threats as major challenges and looks to establish a stable international 
environment. As of 2016, the Australian Defense Force (ADF) had expanded to a total of 62,400 service personnel. The process of Navy modernization has been accelerated, with 
Navy and Air Force weaponry upgraded and ground operation equipment replaced. In terms 
of military cooperation, Australia frequently engages in military cooperation with the US, Japan, India and the countries of ASEAN.
Part 1 Strategic 
Environment
27VI. Southeast Asia
The countries of Southeast Asia have adopted a policy of relying on the PRC economically 
while counting on the US for security. However, the PRC’s assertiveness with regard to sea 
and land territory in recent years has spurred these countries to engage in military cooperation 
through the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting (ADMM) and ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) to deal with regional navigation security protection, humanitarian assistance, anti-terrorism 
and anti-piracy issues for protecting their national security and national interests.
On the back of economic growth, the countries of Southeast Asia have increased defense 
spending and more defense resources have been used in recent years to acquire advanced sea 
and air weapon systems from the US, Europe, Russia and the PRC to upgrade operational 
capability and speed up military modernization.
The countries of the region are enhancing bilateral or multilateral relations to cope with the 
changing security environment. For example, with the US being Singapore’s most important military and security partner, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has also visited Myanmar, 
Mongolia, Laos, Japan, India and the PRC etc. in the past 2 years and expanded multi-lateral 
military cooperation, showing Singapore’s attempt to maintain an important strategic role in regional security cooperation.
Following the “pragmatic diplomacy” of President Joko Widodo, Indonesia has gradually 
moved closer to the PRC while also enhancing cooperation with the countries of ASEAN, the US, Japan, Australia and New Zealand to increase its counter terrorism and contingency 
response capability in face of the frequent activities of extreme Muslim groups within its 
borders. As for the Philippines, although the disputes with the PRC over South China Sea islands and reefs led it to apply for arbitration to the Permanent Court of Arbitration and the 
decision was unfavorable for the PRC, leading to a freeze in relations between the 2 countries 
for a time, its economic cooperation with the PRC has been deepened and the dispute over 
the islands and reefs set aside for the time being since Rodrigo Rody Roa Duterte became 
president.28Section 3 Taiwan’s Strategic Value
Taiwan is situated in a key geo-strategic position where land meets sea in the Asia-Pacific 
region. Security in the Taiwan Strait is vital for the security of international routes and global 
economic development, making it the key to regional security order and stability. For many years, the ROC has been an international model for its free economy, innovative information technology, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, democracy and freedom. We share universal values and 
common strategic interests with the democratic countries of the world and have made a more 
concrete contribution to the international community.
I .  The International Community’s View of Security Across the Taiwan Strait
With the ROC’s unique value and position, maintaining the existing peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is in the interest of all parties in the region. The government of the ROC 
is committed to creating an environment for rational cross-strait dialogue and building a 
consistent, predictable and sustainable cross-strait relationship. The US and other members of the international community universally hope that the two sides can display their 
determination and take actions to maintain the peaceful status quo.
(1) The United States
Since the US committed itself to the defense of the ROC in 1950 to the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act  in 1979, the US has been the most important source of security 
support for the ROC and an important pillar of Taiwan Strait stability. The commitments 
of the US with respect to Taiwan’s security and continuing arms sale have been one of 
the key factors in maintaining the cross-strait status quo. The US advocates that cross-
strait disputes should be resolved peacefully and with agreement on both sides. After President Trump came to office, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and other senior 
officials have stated openly on many occasions that the two sides should use constructive 
dialogue to avoid increasing tensions and damaging stability, opposing change in the cross-strait status quo by one side. The 2017 Military and Security Developments 
Involving the People's Republic of China report had a special chapter on the Taiwan 
Strait security situation, showing that the US believes that cross-strait stability has a big 
impact on the security situation in the Asia-Pacific region.
(2)  Japan
Japan is a resource-poor, export-oriented trading nation that depends on import of crude 
oil, industrial materials and other materials and export of various industrial products 
by sea and air. The maritime shipping must sail through and around the Taiwan Strait. 
Therefore, security in the Taiwan Strait is vital for Japan’s economic security and development. Japanese officials have stated publicly on many occasions that cross-
strait peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are vital for the region and the world. In

and the ROC was assessed, concluding that the PRC’s missiles pose a grave threat to 
the ROC, and showing the high level of concern of Japan about security in the Taiwan 
Strait.
(3)  Australia
Asia countries account for over 80% of Australia’s national trade volume and 8 of the 
top 10 recipients of its exports are Asian economies, accounting for 89% of total exports. 
Australia attempts to further its interests through regional stability with political and 
diplomatic actions and bilateral and multilateral mechanisms. The Australian government 
has also stated on many occasions that the ROC and Australia have significant mutual 30
economic interests and expressed its hope of peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues.
(4) European Union
The ROC shares common values with the EU in terms of democracy, rule of law and 
human rights. The European Parliament has, on many occasions, passed resolutions 
to support Taiwan’s participation in international organizations and assist us in getting 
more opportunities to make a contribution to regional security matters. It has expressed 
support many times for peaceful resolution of the Taiwan Strait problem, constructive 
dialogue, and its opposition to resolution by force or threat of any kind. 31
II.  Taiwan’s Contribution to Maintaining Regional Peace and Stability
On the basis of the values of freedom, democracy, human rights and rule of law, the ROC 
has enhanced exchange and dialogue with the US, Japan and other strategic partners with 
which it shares similar beliefs. The ROC has also expanded security cooperation in the areas 
of international anti-terrorism, disaster relief and non-proliferation to contribute our power to maintain regional peace and stability.
(1) Geo-strategic Value
Located in a central position with regard to the South China Sea, East China Sea and Western Pacific at the hub of transportation routes in the Asia-Pacific region, Taiwan has 
irreplaceable geo-strategic importance. The Indo-Pacific strategic vision proposed by President Tsai Ing-wen Hosted the P-3C Maritime 
Patrol Aircraft Commissioning Ceremony32the US and Japan further highlights its geo-political importance. As the PRC’s military 
strength increases and force projection capabilities continually expands, the ROC has 
developed dynamic monitoring and early warning capabilities that can help protect 
international maritime and air navigation security in the surrounding area. Its superior strategic position and value make it an indispensable security partner in the region.
(2) Free Economy and Innovation Drives Economic Momentum
Taiwan’s economy is free and open and performs outstandingly in terms of innovation. In the 2017 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook , the ROC ranked 14
th overall, 2nd for 
number of R&D personnel and 3rd for the high-tech industry’s share of manufacturing 
exports. These excellent achievements illustrate Taiwan’s R&D advantages and 
innovation capabilities that drive economic development.
(3) Abiding by Nuclear Non-Proliferation Rules
Based on the idea of maintaining peace, the ROC supports containing terrorist activities 
and respects the international nuclear weapon non-proliferation rules of not producing, 
developing, obtaining, storing or using nuclear weapons, and only developing defensive 
weapon systems.
(4) Cyber Security
As information technology has rapidly developed, protecting information and cyber 
security are new issues facing many countries. After developing for many years, 
Taiwan’s IT industry has world-class information security personnel, hardware 
technology and cyber security protection experience. Recently, the ROC came in an 
impressive 2nd place in the 2017 DEFCON CTF, showing the world its remarkable 
capabilities of information security. In the future, the ROC can continue to enhance 
information security cooperation with regional and advanced countries to stop malicious 
damage caused by international hackers, make a joint response to information security events, and build a better and secure information security environment.
(5) Active Participation in International Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief 
Operations
In recent years, various natural disasters have seriously threatened people’s lives and property around the world as climate change continues. The ROC has used the disaster 
relief and medical capabilities of the Armed Forces in its participation in multiple 
international humanitarian assistance tasks, fulfilling its responsibilities as a global 
citizen and obligation to provide humanitarian assistance. The ROC has received 
international praise for its efforts.
Part 1 Strategic 
Environment
33(6) Firm Adherence to the Universal Values of Freedom, Democracy and Human Rights
The end of martial law, direct presidential elections and other major democratic reforms 
have made the ROC a politically free, diverse democratic society, and led to it being 
internationally praised as a “ model of success in Asia.” The ROC continues to uphold the universal values of democracy, freedom and peace and cooperates with other 
democratic countries such as the US and Japan to bring the soft power of democracy 
into play, for achieving permanent peace and prosperity in the region.34
3435
Taiwan is situated in a key geo-strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region 
where land meets sea. For many years, we have made a concerted effort 
to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait, making a substantial contribution to 
regional stability.
35All-out Effort to Maintain Stability in the Taiwan Strait36Chapter 2 National Defense Challenges
The biggest security challenge faced by the ROC is the military threat from the PRC. The PRC 
has committed a large national defense budget to accelerating the modernization of national 
defense and the armed forces. It also continues to increase the operational capabilities of its Navy, Air Force, Rocket Force, and Strategic Support Force and has promoted force structure reforms that have greatly enhanced its force projection capability, seriously threatening our national 
security. In addition, as the ROC faces competition between great powers in the region, rapidly 
widening gap in cross-strait military balance and increasing complexity of non-conventional 
threats, force buildup and readiness present a challenge to Taiwan’s national defense and security.
Section 1  Military Threat from the PRC
The PRC’s military power continues to grow rapidly and it has adjusted its military strategy. 
It has also made significant progress in terms of military reform, joint operations, weapons 
R&D and manufacture, overseas base construction and force exercises and training. The military 
threat posed to Taiwan is constantly growing.
I .  The PRC’s Military Strategy
According to the military strategy of “active defense”, the PRC’s original “Three Steps” 
military development strategy consisting of three stages, namely 2000-2010, 2010-2020 
and 2020-2050 has been modified. This strategy has been adjusted to “solid achievement 
of mechanical and information infrastructure construction by 2020,” “solid achievement of modernization of national defense and armed forces by 2035,” and “building world-
class armed forces in every aspect by the middle of this century.” In the event of an attack 
by an enemy, a powerful counterattack will be immediately launched, expressing the firm 
determination to protect the PRC’s national sovereignty, security and development interests.
On the basis of the “near sea defense” capability, the PLA Navy is now pursuing a “far sea 
escort” capability. The Air Force and Rocket Force have seen big progress in terms of weapons 
and equipment and military technology, with battle space extending to the electromagnetic 
spectrum, cyber space and space to give the PRC offensive operation capability. The military strategy of “passive counterattack” based on “active defense” is being gradually abandoned 
and the concepts of "preemptive" and "initiative" actions are now emphasized to steadfastly 
defend national interests.
II.  Modernization of the PRC’s Military Power
(1) National Defense Budget Allocation
In 2017, the PRC’ defense budget was RMB 1,044.4397 billion (around US$157.3 
Part 1 Strategic 
Environment
37
[Diagram of the PRC’s “Three Steps” Military Strategy]
[The PRC’s 2008-2017 National Defense Budget Statistics]38billion), up by RMB68.327 billion on 2016 and accounting for 1.32% of its GDP. It’s 
the first time the budget has exceeded RMB 1 trillion. The PRC’s defense budget is 
second to the US and highest in Asia and the figure does not include funding for national 
defense technology research projects, arms sales revenue, weapons procurement expenditure and national defense industry revenue from foreign sources.
Although the PRC claims that the budget will be mainly used to modernize weapons 
and equipment, improve the work environment of lower level service personnel and the compensation and benefits of military personnel, and promote defense and force 
structural reform, a budget of this size can barely support around 2 million personnel, 
and is unlikely to be enough to also cover the cost of the Chinese People’s Armed Police Force and pay the pensions of retired service personnel. When other requirements such 
as military procurement expenditure are taken into account, the actual budget required 
will be even larger. It is widely estimated that actual national defense expenditure will 
be double the figure announced, will account for around 4% of GDP, and be hidden in 
the budgets for projects of non-military departments.
(2) Overview of the PRC’ s Military Reforms
According to the Resolution on Deepening the Reform of National Defense  and the 
Military released by the Central Military Commission in 2016, the PRC follows the 
principle that “the CMC takes charge of the overall administration of the PLA, theater 
command centers are in charge of operational activities, and headquarters of each service are in charge of establishment.” The model of “reform with simultaneous adjustment” 
was adopted to complete the stage mission of troop cuts of 300,000 in 2017. The PRC 
aims to obtain the desired results of reform in 2020 and build a modern military force 
that can win in informatized warfare. It remains to be seen if PLA reform can achieve 
these objectives as there are many challenges to be overcome.
1. Army
The PLA Ground Force has reduced non-combat organizations and units, improved 
the reserve force, integrated different military academies, border and coastal defense 
forces, streamlined the command system, adjusted skill configuration, improved 
structure and system, upgraded technological command and control, shortened 
information processes and enhanced command and control effectiveness. The original 18 Group Armies have been merged into 13. Army construction will move 
towards “digitalization, aviationization, special operations and unmanned operation,” 
increasing operational capabilities characterized by “precision, three-dimension, cross-theater, multifunction, and sustainability”.
Part 1 Strategic 
Environment
39
[Illustration of the PRC’s Military Capabilities and Threat]402. Navy
The PLA Navy has pursued a strategic transformation of “near sea defense and far sea 
escort” and diversification of operational capabilities. The North Sea Fleet, East China 
Sea Fleet and South China Sea Fleet are now under the command of the Northern, Eastern and Southern Theater Commands, respectively. The post of Commander of 
the Southern Theater has been filled by a Navy admiral for the first time. Also, the 
completion of construction on Spratly islands and reefs and the PLA overseas base 
in Djibouti means that the security and defense missions of the Marine Corps have 
increased. The original 77
th Motorized Infantry Brigade of the Northern Theater’s 26th 
Group Army has been transferred to the Marine Corps and the unit has been upgraded to corps level to increase overall utilization.
3. Air Force
In accordance with the adjustment of theater delineation, “local command post” has been upgraded to corps-level “base” under each theater command. Flight division-
level units have been dissolved and flight regiments upgraded to brigade level, and 
a “Theater-Base-Brigade” structure established. The 15
th Airborne Corps has been 
renamed the Airborne Force, while transfer of theater Air Force combat forces 
continues and stations adjusted in line with theater battle orientation and the joint 
operations command system to improve joint operations effectiveness.
4. Rocket Force
The Rocket Force has been upgraded from branch to service level. Force transfer, garrison and codename adjustment have been carried out in line with the principle of “theater command in charge of military operations” and the main battle units 
expanded. Meanwhile, the medium, long range and intercontinental ballistic missile 
forces continue to be enhanced, cross-theater maneuver and logistics maintenance 
have been simplified, upgrade of information capabilities have been speeded up, 
and both nuclear and conventional missile capability is being actively improved to increase strategic deterrence and precise strike capabilities.
5. Strategic Support Force
The aerospace, cyber warfare, electronic countermeasure and other units originally subordinated to the 4 CMC Departments have been merged to form the Strategic 
Support Force with the 2 main missions of aerospace operations and cyber, 
information and electronic warfare. The Strategic Support Force is in charge of conducting related assessment and establishment of satellite launch sites, monitoring 
and control management bases, spacecraft tracking ship bases, units of intelligence, 
reconnaissance and electronic warfare, cyber operation and other corps-level units to provide operational support.

Environment
41III. The PRC’s Weapons R&D and Manufacture and Export
(1) Weapons Procurement, Research and Manufacture
In 2000, the PRC was the world’s largest arms importer, accounting for 7.1% of the 
world market. However, imports from 2012 to 2016 accounted for 4.5% of the global 
market; the PRC ranked 4th in the world, behind India, Saudi Arabia, and the United 
Arab Emirates, showing that the PRC’s weapon production capability has increased. 
Nevertheless, the PRC still needs to purchase certain armaments and weapons, including 
precision missiles, vessel gas turbines, tank diesel engines, aerial tankers, fighter engines and long-range surface-to-air missiles from countries such as Russia, France and 
Ukraine.
(2) Armament Exports
In 2017, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reported that the PRC’s armaments exports from 2012 to 2016 were worth RMB60.4 billion (around 
NT$265.7 billion), up by 74% on the previous 5 years and accounting for 6.2% of the global armament market, only behind the US and Russia in 3
rd place and surpassing 
Germany and France. The main importers of the PRC’s armaments are Pakistan, 
Bangladesh, Myanmar and Algeria.
The armament exports include the SH-1 truck-mounted howitzer, VT-4 main battle 
tank, S20 and S26 submarine, P18N and C28A corvette, L-15 fighter trainer, JF-17 
fighter, HQ 9 surface-to-air missile, CH-4B UA V , and Pterosaur reconnaissance-strike-
integrated UA V . Also, the satellite launch centers and Long March series carrier rockets continue to support satellite launch for related countries, effectively increasing the 
PRC’s international aerospace industry’s competitiveness and regional influence.
IV . The PRC’s Operational Capabilities and Readiness
After the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the mission requirement 
of the PLA will gradually move from increasing the capability to win a local war “under informationized condition” to development of multi-domain operational capabilities. The 
PRC will follow the existing plan to expand operational scenarios and drills for an attack against Taiwan. The PLA Ground Force has successively received the new-type light tanks, 
helicopters, the Navy 10,000-ton destroyers and the first domestically-made carrier, and the 
Air Force stealth fighters, surface-to-air missiles, and the Rocket Force new-type missiles. In 
addition, the PRC will also deploy new-type reconnaissance and navigation satellites, improve 
new-type unmanned vehicles and other main and auxiliary battle equipment to meet the mission requirements of each service for increasing strategic deterrence, suppressive strike, 
anti-ballistic missile and strategic lift capabilities in order to acquire multi-domain operational 
capability.42(1) The PLA Ground Force (PLAGF)
The performance of the electronic and fire control systems of various types of armored 
vehicle continues to be improved, with the focus in the Eastern and Central Theater 
Commands on re-equipping units with amphibious armored vehicles to increase sea-crossing, island landing and amphibious landing operation capabilities. Aviation forces 
have been expanded in each theater with deployment of Z-10, Z-19 attack helicopters, 
Z-8 and Mi-171 transport helicopters. Meanwhile, the PLAGF has also improved the Z-9 utility helicopter’s operational functions to enhance force maneuver and strike 
effectiveness and strengthen command, control, reconnaissance, all weather operations 
capabilities, and three-dimensional warfare capabilities of sea-crossing and island-
landing operations. The main Group Army artillery units have undertaken conversion 
to long-range multiple rocket, self-propelled and amphibious howitzers, and developed rocket-assisted projectiles with a range of more than 200 kilometers, increasing their 
mobile operation capabilities and short-medium-long range precise strike capability. The 
PLAGF has also undertaken conversion to Hong Qi 16A and 17 mobile surface-to-air weapons to enhance the air defense capability for vital areas.
(2) Navy
In the last 2 years, almost 40 main and auxiliary warships of various types have been delivered to the Navy, including Type 054A corvettes, Type 056 light corvettes, 
Type 052C/D guided missile destroyers, ocean comprehensive supply vessels, tank 
landing vessels, amphibious dock landing vessels, minesweepers, and oceanographic comprehensive survey ships. In particular, the PRC’s first domestically-made aircraft 
carrier was officially launched at Dalian Shipyard in Liaoning on April 26 2017. On June 
28 the same year, the first Type 055 10,000-ton destroyer, that can carry 112 vertical 
launch systems for anti-ship, anti-aircraft or cruise missiles according to mission, was 
launched at Jiangnan Shipyard on Changxing Island, Shanghai. This shows the fact that the Navy continues to equip itself with new warships equipped with anti-aircraft, 
anti-ship and anti-submarine weapons and is rapidly replacing old vessels to meet its 
strategic requirements for “near sea defense and far sea escort.”
(3) Air Force
The PLA Air Force has successively received domestically-made J-20, J-11, J-10, Y-20 and Russian-made SU-35 fighters, moving from “homeland air defense” to 
implementation of “both offensive and defensive capabilities.” Indigenous HQ 9, 16, 
17 and 22 surface-to-air missiles have been deployed on a priority basis for Beijing, Yangtze Delta, the East China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, building a “far-middle-near 
and high-middle-low” dense air defense network. It continues to establish beyond-
visual-range radar systems with early warning function and convert to automatic radar 
intelligence processing and transmissions systems for utilization of C2 in operations. 
Part 1 Strategic 
Environment
43
The PRC’s arms exports go mainly to Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Algeria and 
rank 3rd in the world behind the US and Russia; arms export is used to rapidly increase the 
PRC’s competitiveness in the international arms market and regional influence.1 2
3
The Air Force has also received Y-20 transport aircrafts and converted to mechanized 
airborne weapons and heavy drop equipment for satisfying multi-domain mobility and 
air assault capability requirements.
(4) Rocket Force
It has promoted weapons and equipment self-reliance and innovation and developed 
new missiles through R&D and key technology breakthrough toward the direction 
of “intelligentized, automated and miniaturized” missiles. The destructive power and 
precision of the short, medium and long-range missiles that are currently in service have been improved and tested. In particular, the Dong Feng 21D and Dong Feng 26 anti-ship 
ballistic missiles and Dong Feng 10 cruise missile have a strike range that covers the 
second island chain, meaning that the PLA is approaching the objective of “maintaining

In recent years, the heavy-lift rocket launch Long March-5 (payload of 25 tons), medium-lift rocket launch Long March-7 (payload of 13 tons), small-lift rocket 
launch (Long March- 6 and 11) and other small-lift solid-propellant rockets have been 
developed and tested for establishment of a complete space transportation system. In addition, PLA continues to deploy satellites that can be utilized to support military 
operations, such as reconnaissance, communications, navigation and meteorology, 
effectively increasing joint operations support effectiveness.
V . The PRC’s Major Exercises
(1) Joint Exercises
Joint operations is the focus of PLA training and exercises, which are carried out to 
strengthen preparedness for military struggles in the Taiwan Strait, East China Sea, 
South China Sea and Yellow Sea, and to enhance military control ability, and optimize the command and control mechanism and force structure, with the aim of creating a 
multi-dimensional joint operations system. In response to the restructuring of the Joint 
Staff Department and reorganization of three services (PLA Ground Force, Navy, and Air Force) and the Rocket Force, the “separation of training and combat” model is adopted 
for training of cadres involving simulation and subsequent field maneuvers to rapidly 
improve the chain of command and horizontal communication, increase the effectiveness of cross-theater joint operations and boost “multi-domain, multi-dimensional, long-
range, precision strike” integrated operational capability.
(2) Ground Force Exercises
Long-range, cross-theater drills such as Huoli (Firepower) and Kuayue (Stride) exercises were conducted by PLAGF and Air Force forces as force-on-force exercises to test 
actual combat capability under informationized conditions. In response to potential regional conflicts, the Army has strengthened its operational capability under extreme 
weather conditions and enhanced its operational capability in terms of “precision, three-
dimension, multi-domain, multifunction and sustainability.”
(3) Navy Exercises
All branches of the PLAN, including ships, submarines, aviation units, shore-based missile forces and Marine Corps follow “training through operations” in combination with exercises simulating confrontation with the opposing force, in order to test the 
Navy’s reconnaissance, early warning, joint assault, multi-dimensional protection and 46precision strike capabilities. PLA Marines are dispatched from the Southern Theater to 
Xinjiang for long-distance, cross-theater exercises and to the Gobi Desert for extreme 
weather training to increase long-range mobility and multi-domain operation capability. 
These efforts are designed to develop multi-domain mobility and overseas deployment capability in preparation for diverse military missions in the future.
(4) Air Force Exercises
With “realistic combat training” as the objective, Hong Jian (Red Sword) maneuvers are conducted, and competitions including Lan Dun (Blue Shield) air defense and anti-
missile exercise, Jin Tou Kui (Golden Helmet) free air combat and Jin Fei Biao (Golden 
Dart) air penetration and air assault competition are held. Forces are also randomly selected for dispatch on a rotational basis to plateaus and island airfields for training to 
increase their multi-domain operation capability. Operational patrols in the East China 
Sea and South China Sea are also carried out on a regular basis to lay down a solid foundation of cross-island chain operation capability. Meanwhile, indigenous transport 
aircraft and helicopters have been delivered to the airborne troops, who are sent for 
plateau and frigid zone on-site training. The Air Force aims to reach the objective of “equal emphasis on deterrence and operational capabilities for multi-domain response” 
with these efforts.
(5) Rocket Force Exercises
According to the requirements of “possessing both nuclear and conventional military power for multi-domain deterrence and operation capabilities,” the PRC has tested its 
“multi-domain attack” and “precision strike” capabilities through the Tian Jian series of exercises in coordination with theater and Navy exercises and adoption of the model of 
“synchronous live-fire testing of multiple missiles at different sites”.
(6) Electromagnetic Spectrum Warfare
The electromagnetic spectrum warfare has become the 6
th operational domain after 
“ground, air, sea, space and cyberspace” domains. Guided by Xi Jinping’s goal of 
“Building a Strong Force through Science and Technology” and the objective of “winning 
a local war in a complex electromagnetic environment,” electronic warfare capability is being upgraded across the board. At present, the PLA has gained “partial information 
dominance” in terms of offensive capability and electromagnetic spectrum control 
capability and can exert effective deterrence when a powerful enemy intervenes.
(7) Non-military Operations
In line with the official implementation of the Counterterrorism Law  of the PRC, 
counter-terrorism has been included in national security strategy, with an emphasis on maintaining internal stability, emergency response and increasing the effectiveness of

to ensure social stability during major festivals. The joint counter-terrorism mechanism 
of the PRC-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) has also enhanced the PLA’s 
ability to carry out diverse missions.
(8) Multi-lateral Exercises
In 2016, the PRC took part in RIMPAC 2016, the second time it participated in these multi-national military exercises. In addition to RIMPAC, the PLA continues to engage 
in joint military exercises and international military competitions with the UK, Russia, Israel, ASEAN, etc., to expand the overseas arms sales market and military exchange 
and cooperation.
VI.The PRC’s Overseas Bases
On July 11, 2017, the Commander of the PLA Navy attended the PLA Support Base 
in Djibouti Establishment and Force Departure Ceremony and his presence attracted 
international attention. Djibouti is situated where the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea meet, at the 
eastern exit of the Red Sea, which links the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean via the Suez Canal. This country is situated on an important sea route of the PRC’s “One Belt One Road” 
economic and diplomatic strategy, at a key point that allows control of vital Middle East, 
Asian and European shipping routes. At the present time, the PRC’s peacekeeping forces are 
distributed around Africa and the Middle East. This base will facilitate military relay, transfer 
and assignment, and equipment maintenance, extending the PRC’s overseas military power.
[Illustration of Djibouti’s Relationship with Various Important Maritime Areas]48The PRC also leases ports such as Gwadar Port in Pakistan, Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka 
and Chittagong Port in Bangladesh and is actively carrying out construction to increase its 
influence in the Indian Ocean region.
VII.The PRC’s Participation in International Peacekeeping Operations
Since April 1990, the PRC has dispatched over 30,000 military service personnel and police 
to take part in UN peacekeeping operations. In 2017, the PRC was involved in peacekeeping 
operations in 11 countries (regions) including Lebanon, sending more peacekeepers than any 
other permanent member of the UN Security Council. In December 2014, a standard infantry battalion was dispatched on a peacekeeping mission for the first time. In March 2017, a 
peacekeeping police force formed by members of the Public Security Border Police Group 
was sent to Libya on a peacekeeping mission. In May, 2017, a helicopter division was sent on 
peacekeeping duties for the first time to Sudan. These peace-keeping missions illustrate that 
the PRC flexibly sends military or police personnel on peacekeeping missions according to requirements and operational capability to increase its international influence.
Also, the PRC has continued to send Navy ships on a rotating basis to the Gulf of Aden for 
escort duty and anti-piracy missions to hone the Navy’s open sea operation capability. The PRC has also expanded its international humanitarian assistance, foreign visits, exchange and 
cooperation to mold the image of a great power that is rising peacefully and responsibly .
VIII.The PRC’s Civil-Military Integration
Civil-military integration involves merging national defense infrastructure into national economic infrastructure to form a high-benefit, low-cost development model featuring comprehensiveness and depth and diversity of both defense and economic infrastructure, with 
the aim of laying down a shared, compatible technological foundation through integration of military-civil resources.
The PRC established the “Civil-Military Integration Technology and Equipment Special 
Committee” in 2014, promoting civil-military integration of equipment technology development and two-way transfer. In March 2015, the Civil-Military Integration Technology 
Assessment Center was established to oversee and guide civil-military technology transfer 
and technology industry transformation. In June 2017, the First Plenary Session of the Central 
Civil-Military Integration Development Committee announced the establishment of provincial 
(region, city) organizations, which are in charge of civil-military integrated development for integration of economic and military resources, effective sharing of resources and support for 
the objective of civil-military integration.
IX.The PRC’s Military Capability aginst Taiwan
(1) Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Capabilities
The PLA continues to develop command, control, communications, intelligence, 
surveillance, reconnaissance, navigation and targeting capabilities; its surveillance and 
Part 1 Strategic 
Environment
49reconnaissance scope already includes all the area west of the second island chain and 
it has actively developed global reconnaissance capability. It already possesses the 
capability to support all kinds of military action in the region.
(2) Strike Capability of the Rocket Force
The PLA Rocket Force is moving in the direction of munitions interoperability and striking diversity, with the aim of achieving strategic nuclear deterrence, nuclear 
counterstrike and precision strike capabilities of conventional weapons. The ranges of the deployed medium and short-range strategic ballistic and cruise missiles cover all of 
main island Taiwan, while emphasizing long-range anti-ship ballistic missile R&D and 
manufacture and deployment in order to build adversary force resistance capability .
(3) Integrated Air Operation Capability
The combat radius and long-distance support capability of the PLA Air Force’s main 
and auxiliary aircraft has been substantially upgraded. New unmanned aerial combat 
vehicles and advanced long-range precision weapons have come into service, new SAM systems have also been deployed and multi-service joint exercises have been conducted. 
The PLAAF now possesses multi-layer firepower, joint air defense and anti-missile 
capabilities and the ability to achieve air supremacy in the area west of the first island chain.
(4) Integrated Maritime Operation Capabilities
The focus of the PLA Navy is delivery of new-type large corvettes, landing ships and fast combat support ships and other main and auxiliary battleships to ensure that the strategy of “near sea defense and far sea escort” can be implemented in future. Also, the 
nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines can launch JL-2 intercontinental ballistic 
missiles, which represent formidable nuclear counter-strike capability. The PLA Navy 
has also conducted cross-theater, long-distance open-sea training missions to strengthen 
coordinated warfare operation capabilities, giving the Navy the ability to launch nuclear counter-strike, resist adversary forces and block and control the Taiwan Strait.
(5) Integrated Ground Operation Capabilities
The PLAGF is accelerating its efforts on mechanization, organizational adjustment for independent functioning of brigades and “realistic” exercises. Aviation units has successively received various types of indigenous helicopters and have carried out 
more exercises of various types with special forces to increase integrated ground strike, 
protection, command and communication capability. Also, various army branches have become familiar with landing operation tactics through joint landing drills. At present, 
the PRC possesses the triphibious landing operation capabilities to take Taiwan’s 
offshore islands.5050

The PLA’s electronic counter measure forces simulate the electronic environment in a 
cross-strait war and are working hard to formulate electronic warfare tactics to ensure 
electromagnetic dominance throughout different stages of operations. In response to 
information protection technology developments of other countries, the cyber warfare 
units have acquired electronic capabilities to carry out soft and hard kill missions that 
target Taiwan’s electromagnetic parameters, surveillance reconnaissance, command and control systems for surveillance, obstruction and interference activities.
1.2.3.4The combat radius and long-range support capability of the PLA Air Force gives it the 
capability to achieve air supremacy in the area west of the first island chain. Cross-
theater, long-distance open sea training missions have strengthened coordinated operation capability of the Navy’s fleet. Through different exercises, the PLAGF has 
enhanced its ground attack, protection, command and communications capabilities, 
aiming to achieve anti-access/ area-denial.
5.Recently, the PLA has conducted regular air and naval training in the East China Sea 
and South China Sea. The ROC Armed Forces have kept abreast of the movements of the PLA aircraft/vessel throughout their activities according to regulations, kept the military on alert and monitored their actions.1

4552Section 2 Effect of the Security Environment on ROC’s National 
Defense
Non-conventional security issues such as the economic and political situation in the Asia-
Pacific region, coopetition between superpowers, cross-strait military power imbalance, 
natural disaster, cyber secret theft and attack, and terrorist attack all pose a serious threat to Taiwan’s security and affect our national defense policy and the direction of force buildup efforts.
I .  Taiwan’s Role in US-China Coopetition in the Asia-Pacific Region
In face of 2 great powers, the US and the PRC, a delicate situation in which the countries in the region want to have close economic and trade relations with the PRC while, at the same 
time, hope that the US can be involved to protect regional security, has gradually arisen in 
recent years. The “coopetition” between the US and the PRC affects the trilateral US-China-Taiwan relationship, which involves complex issues relating to cross-strait relations, Taiwan-
US relations and arms sales to Taiwan. Geographically, the ROC has an important geo-
strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region and occupies a key location in terms of Sea Lines 
of Communication (SLOCs). It has a democratic system, prosperous economy, stable society 
and appropriately sized and high-quality defense and maritime patrol power. Facing the US-China “coopetition” in the Asia-Pacific region, the ROC can help protect Asia-Pacific security 
stability by providing strategic early warning for the Western Pacific first island chain. We 
can work with international cooperation mechanisms in the areas of counter proliferation, crime-fighting, counter-terrorism actions, and port and container surveillance. We can also 
assist with security maintenance and sea rescue operations involving the main SLOCs around 
Taiwan and also take part in regional disaster prevention and relief and humanitarian aid missions.
II. Force Buildup and Readiness in Face of the Cross-Strait Military Power 
Imbalance
The PRC’s national power continues to grow and a large budget has been allocated for national defense and military modernization, increasing the cross-strait military power gap. 
Based on the thinking of avoiding being dragged into an arms race while also considering the 
national fiscal situation, the ROC needs to integrate its limited national defense resources and invest in priority force buildup and readiness campaigns, with new military strategic thinking 
and refined tactics. We also need to continue to enhance key defensive capabilities and build 
operational capability characterized by high mobility, small quantity, high quality, high 
Part 1 Strategic 
Environment
53effectiveness and high precision strike to deter the enemy from reckless advance in order to 
ensure national security.
III. New Missions to Counter Non-Conventional Security Threats
Non-conventional security issues present the ROC with various challenges and have made the mission of the Armed Forces more complex. The ROC is often faced by earthquakes, 
powerful typhoons, torrential rain and major disaster caused by public safety accidents. The 
Armed Forces are always on hand to provide timely assistance, providing assistance with rescue and recovery. Facing cyber security threats, the Armed Forces must, in combination 
with the government’s actions to protect information security, prevent hackers from intruding 
into our national security network and sabotaging our command, control, communications 
and intelligence systems. We also need to strengthen electromagnetic dominance capability. 
In addition, as worldwide terrorist attacks become more frequent by the day, we need to be more vigilant, enhance international counterterrorism intelligence exchange and integrate 
the resources of government agencies to strengthen counter-terrorism response capability. 
As illegal activities at sea such as illegal fishing, drug smuggling, and illegal entry are dramatically increasing in frequency, we need to make an extra effort to protect the security 
of our peripheral sea area, display our determination to enforce the law in our jurisdiction and 
conduct regular joint fishery protection operations with the ROC Coast Guard to ensure the security of economic activities in our exclusive economic zone.54ୋɓᇐ኷ଫᐑྤ
55
The ROC Armed Forces are loyal to the country and its people, and diligently optimize 
operational readiness in accordance with the Constitution . Facing a changing strategic 
environment and enemy threats, national defense and military strategies are adjusted promptly based on new developments. The ROC Armed Forces have applied innovative thinking and have continuously enhanced joint operations capabilities to ensure strong defensive military power 
and national security.Part 2: National Defense Readiness56Chapter 3 Mission of the Armed Forces
The National Defense Act  stipulates that the objective of the ROC Armed Forces is to defend 
the security of the country and its people and help maintain world peace. As they belong to 
the nation and all of its people, the ROC Armed Forces strictly conform to mandatory rules as a 
nationalized military, and must obey the Constitution  and be loyal to the country. In protecting 
national security and the wellbeing of the population, they fulfill their responsibility to defend the 
country and its people.
Section 1 Reinforcing National Security
National security is the basis for long-term survival and development of the country, while 
national defense is the core of national security. In accordance with the national security 
guidance of the President, the MND directs the Armed Forces in force buildup and readiness efforts, and actively promotes national defense and reinforces national security to provide the people with a safe and worry-free living environment.
I . The Relationship Between National Defense and National Security
(1) National Defense is the Core of National Security
In an ever more complex security environment, the scope of national security has 
widened to include the political, economic, social, environmental, technological and 
cultural aspects, however, national defense and military security remain at its core. National defense capabilities are the strongest support in coping with conventional and 
non-conventional security challenges.
(2) National Defense as a Guarantee of National Security
The nation’s economic activities, technological development and civil infrastructure 
construction can only be effectively carried out with the guarantee of national security. 
As Taiwan is surrounded by sea, it must rely on national defense and use its military 
forces, at sea and in the air, to ensure its maritime sovereignty and rights and the safety of its fishermen as it manages maritime activities and actively pursues sustainable 
utilization of marine resources. As climate change accelerates, sea levels continue to rise, 
resulting in flooding that seriously affects civil facilities and the ecological environment. 
Meanwhile, threats from earthquakes, tsunamis, infectious diseases and other non-
conventional threats are also increasing, requiring the Armed Forces to conduct non-military operations to provide assistance. With the scope of “national security” becoming 
wider, and facing a complex and uncertain security situation, the Armed Forces must 
effectively enhance force buildup and readiness and carry out national defense reform to ensure sustainable national development and allow the people to live and work in peace.
Part 2 National
Defense Readiness

In peacetime, the Army is ready to carry out contingency operations, assist with protecting 
critical infrastructure, support anti-terrorism operations and proactively assist with local disaster prevention and relief. In the event of war, the Army will conduct joint operations 
with the Navy and Air Force to defend the homeland. 
II . Mission of the Armed Forces
The objective of ROC national defense is to build military strength, assist with disaster 
prevention and relief, ensure the security of the country and its people and maintain global 
peace. The steadfast determination of the Armed Forces to defend the nation, along with its 
diligent force buildup and readiness efforts, are an effective deterrent to potential enemy attack and reckless aggression, given the high costs of warfare. The Armed Forces aim to defeat the 
enemy’s mission through effective utilization of our integrated warfighting capabilities.
571 2
358(1) Army
In peacetime , the Army is responsible for protecting Taiwan proper and its outlying 
islands. The main focus of this protection is building basic warfighting and contingency 
response capabilities, carrying out contingency operations, and protecting critical 
infrastructure. When required, the Army also supports anti-terrorism operations and proactively assists with local disaster prevention and relief. During wartime, the Army 
will conduct joint operations with the Navy and Air Force to defend the homeland.
(2) Navy
In peacetime, the Navy conducts reconnaissance patrols over the Taiwan Strait, maintains 
maritime security and proactively assists with fishery protection and disaster prevention and 
relief. In wartime, it will, together with the Army and Air Force, take countermeasures against 
an enemy’s sea blockade or invasion to safeguard Taiwan’s shipping routes, gain maritime superiority and provide favorable conditions for joint homeland defense operations.
(3) Air Force
In peacetime, the Air Force conducts reconnaissance patrols over the Taiwan Strait, maintains 
airspace security and proactively assists with local disaster prevention and relief. In wartime, 
all effort will be made to gain air superiority to facilitate joint operations missions with the Army and Navy.

Defense Readiness
59Section 2 Building Strong National Defense
In accordance with the President’s national security concept and the Executive Yuan’s national 
defense policy guidance, assessment of the internal and external strategic environments, and 
review of national defense and security threats and challenges, we formulate forward-looking national defense and military strategies to serve as the basis for the Armed Forces’ current capability buildup, future joint capability development, and various defense reforms. Our overall 
aim is to build strong national defense and ensure national security .
I .   National Defense Strategy
The current and future strategic environment and security challenges require innovative 
thinking, pragmatic reform and effective use of resources to optimize force buildup and 
combat readiness. The ROC’s national defense strategic objectives at present include:
(1) Defending National Security
Deterring and defending against any hostile military action against the ROC are the priority 
tasks of national defense readiness. In particular, should the country come under military 
attack, its entire defense force must be used to defend the territorial integrity and sovereignty 
and protect the lives and property of the people.
(2) Establishment of Professional Armed Forces
The operational capabilities of the Armed Forces depend on highly professional manpower 
and a highly effective organizational system. To respond to continuing changes in the domestic 
and external environment, and build a force with high-tech and innovative capabilities, the Armed Forces must pragmatically implement improvements and reforms to raise the level of 
overall manpower quality and organizational effectiveness and build Armed Forces that are 
professional, sophisticated and resilient to meet and overcome future challenges.
(3) Achieving National Defense Self-Reliance
National defense development requires the buttress of a strong economy. In order to lay the foundation for self-reliance, national defense and economic development must complement 
each other. Combining the resources of government agencies and private sector capabilities, 
the Armed Forces are enhancing the development and application of defense technology and promoting indigenous development of weapons and equipment. The effort is expected to 
drive the growth of the defense industry and simultaneously satisfy defense needs and create 
economic benefit.
(4) Protecting the People’s Well-Being
Facing the various non-conventional security threats that have arisen in recent years, the 
Armed Forces should play a key role as a frontline relief provider to reassure the public. Also, 60

65as maritime rights are vital national interests closely connected to the wellbeing of the people, 
the Armed Forces help protect our maritime rights according to government policy.
(5) Promoting Regional Stability
In the era of globalization, national security, international politics and regional affairs are 
interconnected and cannot be handled separately. As well as establishing strong national defense capability to fulfill the aim of self-defense, the Armed Forces should also play 
the role of “staunch guardian of peace” internationally, making every effort to promote 
cross-strait peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
II . Military Strategy
Military strategy is the art of building and using military force. It guides the force buildup and readiness effort and how forces are to be employed. It is the basis for all military operations. 
The ROC’s military strategy is adjusted in accordance with national interests, national 
objectives and other factors including international situation, potential threats, technological capability, national resources, terrain advantages/disadvantages and types of warfare. Guided 
by the national defense strategy, the military strategy is formulated to achieve the primary 
objective—the defense of national security. In line with the military strategy, the Armed 
Forces develop joint operations capabilities for resolute defense, incorporate all national 
resources into national defense, create favorable operational conditions, and adopt measures of multi-domain deterrence to achieve strategic endurance and ensure homeland security .
(1) Resolute Defense to Ensure Homeland Security
The Armed Forces have been enhancing information, communications and electronic warfare capabilities, securing command and control systems and critical infrastructure, and improving force preservation measures. The aim is to increase joint counterattack 
and defensive operations capabilities. Meanwhile, they have used all-out defensive 
power and the natural advantages of the Taiwan Strait to build multi-layered defense in 
depth for operational sustainability and to achieve “strategic endurance.”66

Adversary Homeland
[Diagram on Strategic Deployment of Resolute Defense for Multi-domain Deterrence](2) Multi-Domain Deterrence with Joint Operations Capabilities
In order to achieve the objective of resolute defense through the means of multi-domain 
deterrence, “innovative-asymmetric” thinking is adopted to maximize joint warfighting 
effectiveness and thus create multiple dilemmas for the enemy, thus deterring it from imprudently starting a war. If the enemy still attempts to invade, the Armed Forces 
will implement the force concept of “preservation of warfighting capability, pursuing 
decisive victory in the littoral area, and annihilating the enemy in the beach area,” and conduct multi-layered interception and joint firepower strikes to erode the enemy’s 
operational force, break up the attack and block enemy landing forces.68Chapter 4 Development of Warfighting 
Capabilities
Considering future spectrums of war and assessment of PRC military development and threats, 
the Armed Forces have set capability development targets with limited national defense 
resources based on joint operational needs. We have actively built reliable deterrent capabilities through continuous improvement of joint operations effectiveness, adjustment of organizational structure, upgrades of weapons and equipment and development of asymmetric capabilities .
Section 1 National Defense Organization and Armed Forces Units
To implement the democratic concept of “civilian control of the military”, the President of the ROC is the supreme commander in chief of the Armed Forces while a civilian fills the post 
of Minister of National Defense. The MND is the ROC’s highest authority in national defense and military affairs and manages Armed Forces units at all levels. The organization and forces of the military respond to changes in the strategic security situation and are guided by the military 
strategy. Major organizational adjustments are carried out to keep up to date and adapt to the 
future spectrum of war.
I .  National Defense Organization
(1) National Defense System and Responsibilities
The structure and responsibilities of the national defense system of the ROC are as 
follows:
1. President: leads the 3 services of the Armed Forces as supreme commander in chief, 
exercising presidential powers to command the military and delegate the authority to the Minister of National Defense, who then orders the Chief of the General Staff to 
execute the President’s commands.
2. National Security Council: the President can convene a NSC meeting to decide major 
principles and polices regarding national security or deal with emergency national defense situations.
3. Executive Yuan: formulates national defense policy, integrates overall national power 
and supervises the handling of national defense related matters of each subordinate agency.

(1) 10-Year Force Build-up Program (1993-1996)
Following the withdrawal of the KMT government to Taiwan in 1949, the force size 
and structure was urgently in need of adjustment and integration. With the target of 
restructuring into “rational organizational framework of three forces and developing basic operational capability”, the need to replace or merge ineffective forces was 
reviewed to streamline the organization and build military power that was small (force), 
sophisticated (high quality weapons) and strong (operational capability). This program, launched in 1993, brought total force size down from over 490,000 service personnel to 
over 450,000.
(2)  Armed Forces Jing-shi Streamlining Program (1997-2001)
In 1997, the Armed Forces Jing-shi Streamlining Program was launched in line with the Executive Yuan’s organizational restructuring program. The force restructuring objective 
was to “build Armed Forces that have the concept of joint operations.” Taking into account mission types, organizational function, force buildup and readiness, education 
and training, management support and other factors, the Armed Forces achieved the 
goal of force transformation by reviewing and slimming down the senior ranks and strengthening basic echelons, reducing the force size from over 450,000 to over 380,000 
service personnel.
(3) Armed Forces Jing-jin Streamlining Program (2004-2010)
In response to changes in the international situation, rapid growth in the PRC’s military power, and the ROC’s limited national defense resources and other factors, we continued 
to strengthen operational capabilities and create a national defense organization characterized by “unified national defense authorities” and “civilian control of the 
military" based on the concept of “revolution of military affairs” and in line with the 
implementing of the National Defense Act  and the Organization Act of the Ministry of 
National Defense. With the full support of the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, 
we successfully acquired new-generation weapons such as the Patriot missile system 
and fixed wing anti-submarine aircraft, greatly increasing national defense operation capability. Force size was reduced from over 380,000 to over 270,000.
(4) ROC Armed Forces Jing-cui Refining Program (2011-2014)
The program was a continuous effort to further enhance strong defense forces with “suitable quantity, high quality and strong operational capability.” The strategic objective 
was to deny the enemy from landing and establishing footholds. “Disaster prevention 
and relief” was also identified as one of the central tasks of the Armed Forces. The promotion of a volunteer military system was on-going. The force restructuring efforts at 72this stage, therefore, aimed to flatten command hierarchy, increase command speed and 
facilitate logistics support. High-level staff units were streamlined. Outdated equipment 
was de-commissioned. Administration and logistics tasks were outsourced. 6 command 
headquarters were merged and became the Army, Navy and Air Force headquarters. National defense organization was developed in the direction of “small but high-quality, 
small but powerful and small but sophisticated” and the joint operations capability of 
three services was strengthened. Force size was further reduced from over 270,000 to 
over 210,000.
(5) Adjustment of Organization and Force Structure
In order to implement the military strategy of “resolute defense, multi-domain 
deterrence,” national defense organization and force structure have been adjusted, taking 
into account multiple factors such as enemy threat, overall national resource allocation, 
human resource supply and demand, new weapons and equipment acquisition and military modernization trends around the world. These adjustments will continue to 
move in the direction of organizational rationalization, structure clarification, reduction 
in personnel number and flexibility of adjustment, with the aim of building strong 
professional, technological and all-out Armed Forces.
1. On July 1, 2017, the ICEFCOM was established to integrate the information, 
communications and electronic capabilities of the Army, Navy and Air Force. In 
peacetime, its mission is to protect the various information communications and 
electronic systems of the Armed Forces, defend national defense information 
networks and support national-level cyber defense. In wartime, the ICEFCOM’s mission will be to ensure the effective operation of the Armed Forces’ command 
and control networks, information security, and intelligence, surveillance and 
reconnaissance systems to protect homeland security.
2. The Air Force created the ROCAF Air Defense and Missile Command on September 
1, 2017 by merging the Air Defense Artillery Command and the Air Defense Missile Command after taking into account the enemy threat and operational requirements. 
The new Command integrates and employs air defense and missile capabilities and 
is responsible for joint air defense operations; its establishment unifies the C2 of air defense, effecting an integrated approach to air defense operations.

The ROC will not engage in an arms race with the PRC in the face of its huge military threat, 
but will apply asymmetric capability to achieve relative advantage for our Armed Forces and 
ensure that the “resolute defense, multi-domain deterrence” military strategy is implemented.
I .   The Concept of Asymmetric Warfare
Asymmetric warfare is a warfare concept that employs asymmetric measures, unequal strengths, and non-conventional means in operations. The concept of asymmetric warfare 
is to evade the enemy's strength while using suitable military tactics and weapons to attack 
against their weaknesses in order to influence the result of battles so that the war develops in a favorable direction.
The ROC’s Armed Forces actively develop innovative/asymmetric capabilities. In wartime, 
we will take advantage of favorable timing and space to strike the enemy’s center of gravity 
and critical weakness to disrupt their battle tempo and paralyze their capabilities for achieving 
partial advantage with the aim of “small taking on large, weak striking strong.” 
Based on the military strategy of “resolute defense, multi-domain deterrence”, the Armed 
Forces have deliberated over and are strengthening innovative/ asymmetric capability and 
will utilize equipment and tactics that the PLA cannot easily predict or prevent. Weapons system development will proceed in the direction of “mobility, stealth, fast speed, low cost, 
abundance, minimum damage, and high effectiveness.” This will be the focus of future 
military investment, and the priority of armaments acquisition will be reviewed to build multi-layered defense and deterrence capability, thus preventing a military invasion of the ROC by 
the PRC.
II .  Planning Asymmetric Force Buildup
Future force buildup planning must break free from the traditional concept of building equal 
military power and concentrate use of national defense resources and technology on key 
capabilities to build a substantive deterrent force and effective counter-attack capability. The 
specific directions of force buildup will be:
(1) Focusing on the development of precision strike weapons to increase overall combat 
efficiency.
(2) Acquiring information, communications and electronic countermeasure equipment and 
reviewing the employment of innovative tactics to gain battlefield superiority in information 
operations and electronic warfare. 
Part 2 National
Defense Readiness
87(3) The Army will continue to acquire high performance anti-armor missiles and portable short-
range air defense missiles to enhance littoral attack-repelling capability.
(4) Continuing to acquire light, fast and multiple-purpose high performance warships.
(5) Acquiring new smart mines and fast minelayers to raise overall minelaying effectiveness to 
effectively delay and retard an enemy’s operations.
(6) Developing unmanned aerial vehicles to increase joint intelligence, surveillance and 
reconnaissance effectiveness and create an advantageous situation for joint air defense 
operations.88Section 3 Joint Operations Capabilities
Following the principle of “retire the old, retain the good” for equipment and “primarily 
domestic manufacture, secondarily foreign procurement” of armaments, and with an emphasis 
on joint operations, we are gradually enhancing the traditional capabilities of defense operations. Meanwhile, the strengthening of joint operations and inter-service personnel exchanges continues. Peacetime and wartime joint operations mechanisms have been implemented with available 
financial resources to increase the effectiveness of tri-service joint operations and ensure that 
overall operational capability does not decline.
I .   Air Defense and Strike
We are establishing multi-domain protection and all-weather air operation capabilities so as to achieve “early reconnaissance and warning, flexible command and control, long-
distance precision engagement and joint multi-layered interception”. The main aspects of the 
enhancement are as follows:
(1) Keep pushing forward the indigenous aircraft program and replace old trainers with new 
advanced trainer jets, coupled with the procurement of next-generation fighters down the road 
to increase capability availability.
(2) Upgrade F-16 and IDF performance to increase our air defense combat capability.
(3) Further enhance electronic warfare capability to support joint operations in a complex 
electromagnetic environment.
(4) Integrate deployment of the Intelligence Early Warning System and Early Warning Radar and 
establish a common operational picture to increase early warning capability.
(5) Purchase additional mobile radar systems, supported by electronic warfare protective 
equipment, to increase operational effectiveness of early warning, reconnaissance, 
identification, tracking, information transmission and countermeasures.
(6) Bring up and integrate various precision weapons system requirements on a priority basis and 
continue to acquire air-fired long-range precision munitions through procurement to retard the 
enemy’s offensive capabilities.
II .  Maritime and Anti-Submarine Operations
We are building a “highly effective, high quality, rapid-deployment, and long-range strike” 
capability, and developing sea control capabilities characterized by stealth, high-speed, long-
range, precision strike, high-survivability and multi-purpose capability. This will enable us 
to protect our islands’ sovereignty and maritime rights, while ensuring security in the Taiwan Strait. The main aspects of the enhancement are as follows:
(1) Continue to promote the indigenous shipbuilding program,  and build new-generation missile 
frigates, light and fast warships and main battleships in the coming years to enhance the fleet’s 
overall sea control capability.
Part 2 National
Defense Readiness
89(2) Acquire new-generation diesel-electric submarines to enhance underwater capability.
(3) Upgrade the aging main warships such as Kangding, Chengkung and Keelung class warships 
in the coming years to maintain sea control capabilities.
(4) Increase surface reconnaissance range and monitoring capability, and overall sea control 
operational effectiveness.
(5) Acquire mobile anti-ship missiles and radar vehicles, taking advantage of mobility to increase 
survivability and conduct surprise attacks to effectively cover and support the sea control 
operations of our surface task force.
III.Ground and Amphibious Operations
Buildup of ground troops is directed at achieving characteristics of “long-range, precision and 
mobility” and aims to achieve the objectives of becoming “three-dimensional, digitalized and 
automated.” The main aspects of the enhancement are as follows:
(1) The Armed Forces continue to integrate ground forces’ command, control, communication and 
information systems, building a networked operation platform to increase the effectiveness of  
command and control of the ground force.
(2) Artillery units are converting to new guns and a multi-function radar observation system and 
acquiring fire command and control vehicles, coupled with precision munitions, precision 
rockets and other highly effective munitions, to enhance artillery firepower and targeting 
capability so as to facilitate birth (beachhead and anti-wave) operations.
(3) Main battle tank performance is being improved and new field air defense systems are being 
established to supplement strike force manpower and equipment and increase coastal and 
beach counterattack capability.
(4) We are acquiring new amphibious transport docks and supplementing equipment which the 
AA V7 Amphibious Assault Vehicle lacks to facilitate amphibious fast response by the Marines and conduct support operations and supply missions to outlying islands.
(5) Military police units continue their conversion to the CM32/33 Fighting Vehicle and highly 
effective anti-armor weapons, and are enhancing urban warfare as well as special operations 
capability.
IV . Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Capabilities
The Armed Forces’ various radar and intelligence interception systems, intelligence collection 
techniques and tactical ballistic missile warning systems are used to monitor the force 
deployment and activities of the enemy, and collect important strategy-related information 
regarding the political, economic and public sentiment status of the enemy. 3 services of the Armed Forces use new forces and armaments, such as UA Vs and various low-speed 90aircraft, to carry out joint intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and coastal patrol 
missions, effectively increasing early warning capability. We are constantly enhancing our 
reconnaissance, target identification, and intelligence transmission, processing and control to 
effectively monitor military activities that pose a threat.
V .  Information, Communications, and Electronic Warfare
To ensure the effective operation of the C2 networks, information security and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems and acquisition of national-level contingency 
operation capabilities to assist with the protection of key national information infrastructure 
facilities, the focuses of the enhancement are as follows:
(1) To build on the foundation laid by the former ICEFCOM, various information, communications 
and electronic units were integrated to form the Information, Communications and Electronic 
Warfare Command. Through recruitment, training, equipment acquisition, and collaboration with external information security communities, the Command has integrated and utilized information and cyber security capabilities within the nation.
(2) Information and electronic warfare capabilities will continue to be enhanced, gradually 
adjusting the information and electronic warfare command system and echelons of the unit. 
Supported by a hardened, mobile and flexible information and communications infrastructure, 
we will maximize information, communications and electronic effectiveness to gain 
dominance in electronic warfare.
(3) The military has continued to adjust operation mission assignments based on the structure of 
the ICEF. Meanwhile, various types of information and electronic operation equipment are 
being acquired to achieve national level cyber-security incident response and management 
capability.
Part 2 National
Defense Readiness
91Section 4 Sustainable Operation Capabilities
Under threat of a sudden enemy attack, the Armed Forces are always seeking to build an 
operational force with high survivability in the event of surprise missile attack. To ensure 
optimized performance of subsequent operations, we will retain the integrity of the combat force through force preservation, complete logistical support, military morale and rapid mobilization.
I  .   Logistics Maintenance & Repair
(1) In order to ensure the availability of various weapons and equipment, a life cycle management 
system has been implemented to closely monitor equipment maintenance cycles, and overall 
planning of old equipment replacement is carried out to reduce the workload of maintenance. 
(2) Maintenance and repair capabilities have been developed and acquired in response to the 
commissioning of various kinds of new weapons and equipment in recent years, with respect 
to logistics readiness, life cycle management, overall logistics support, and other aspects. 
Current campaigns include industrial cooperation, technology transfer of existing tri-service 
capabilities, certified production (trial production) by state-owned private companies and defense resources release to the private sector.
(3) In line with the follow-up fleet maintenance requirements of new helicopter forces, the 
Guidelines for Mutual Support for Repair and Maintenance Operation of Helicopters  have 
been issued. An integrated repair and maintenance information platform and inter-service equipment workshop will be set up to enhance repair and maintenance support capabilities and lower maintenance costs.
II .  Military Morale
In order to further cultivate personnel patriotism, the MND uses various channels to 
disseminate educational materials, articles and news reports through education programs for 
schools, military forces, reservists and all-out defense activities and runs various related art 
and promotional campaigns. The overall aim is to instill military personnel with firm belief, promote martial morality, increase cohesion and nurture military morale.
(1) Strengthening Morality Education
Martial morality courses are taught at the stages of basic, further and advanced education, with military academies as the starting point, to enhance the understanding of 
the concept of martial morality of cadres at every level. Also, every level of the military 
uses the Juguang Day televised education, psychological capabilities training, monthly meetings and academic lectures to strengthen martial morality education, nurture correct 
military values and establish correct understanding with multiple means. The aim is to 
mold the ROC military into strong elite forces that practice martial morality, are highly disciplined and win a high level of affirmation from the people.92

(2) Cohering Defense Awareness
The military promotion campaign mainly targets military personnel, while reservists 
and dependents are also included. By using various promotion channels and new media 
platforms to promote government policies and report defense policy implementation 
and related events, we combine political ambience and latest news in the presentation of 
mission characteristics and policy requirements, with the aim of cultivating the concept 
of all-out defense, enhancing mutual trust and forming consensus.
(3) Enhancing Security Measures
The PRC has engaged in intelligence gathering directed against the ROC in various 
ways in recent years. According to the analysis of cases of the Armed Forces members 
being recruited and used by the PRC’s intelligence units, the PRC’s main infiltration 
9495methods are recruiting overseas-based Taiwanese business people, drawing in former 
acquaintances in the military, and targeting personnel in intelligence units, highly 
sensitive units and retired service personnel with coercion or temptation means. This 
situation highlights the increasing importance of counterintelligence. The mental defenses of service personnel, their families and reservists are strengthened through a 
comprehensive security group reporting mechanism.
(4) Strengthening the Strategic Communication Mechanism
Strategic communication is a major task for both national security and defense. The Public Opinion Analysis Center was established to gain the acceptance and support of 
the domestic public and the international community, keep abreast of the characteristics of modern warfare and information dissemination trends, and flexibly utilize the 
media to enhance the strategic communication mechanism. Through its links with 
government and civilian statistics organizations, the Center works to understand the issues that society is concerned about and strives to gain support and acceptance 
through various dissemination channels. Also, the Media News Center’s equipment is 
being supplemented and a psychological warfare information surveillance system and 
psychological information platform are being established. The communication objectives 
are identified through policy promotion discourse and the inter-agency mechanism to counter the PRC’s Three Wars and create an ROC-friendly environment.
III. Reserve Mobilization
With the aim of creating a reserve force that can be mobilized in a timely way and promptly get ready for operations, mobilization readiness work is properly carried out during 
peacetime. The reserve force can be quickly organized in wartime as part of the order of battle 
for defense operations in accordance with the objectives of simplifying operations, rapid force formation and fast combat recovery.
(1) Reserve Mobilization Policy
In line with the transformation of the military service system, the one year of compulsory military service is to be replaced by 4 months of military training; after completion 
of training, conscripts will be organized and managed as reservists. In response to the 
yearly increase in the proportion of conscripts assigned to reserve forces after 4 months of training, education recall courses will be adjusted to be more intensive in training. 
Effectiveness of training will be tested by participation of reserve forces in major annual 
exercises to ensure that reserve forces have substantive operational capability . 96(2) Trial of Part-Time Volunteer Military Service
To allow the military expertise of discharged or retired military personnel to continue to 
be utilized by the Armed Forces, from 2017 the “reservist voluntarily part-time service”  
(Reserve Warrior) program has been implemented on a trial basis; it allows former service personnel who are in a full-time civilian job to return to camp for 2 days a month 
to maintain their familiarity with weapons operation, allowing them to immediately use 
their abilities in event of war. The number of participants will be increased year by year in accordance with verified trial results.
(3) Mobilization Information System
In 2017, a QR-Code call-up enquiry system was launched to increase the speed and effectiveness of mobilization, allowing reservists to check muster-call related 
information in advance to increase the recall force reporting rate. Also, in line with 
information technology developments, reservist “hometown reporting” can now be completed electronically for “simplified administration and public convenience.”
(4) Manpower Mobilization Organization and Management
After their 4 months of military training are completed, conscripts will be organized and managed as reservists in line with the military specialty requirements of reserve units to supplement reserve manpower and increase operational quality. Following the principles 
of “young combatants and senior skilled personnel” and “last out, first in”, reservists 
listed as discharged within 8 years will be brought in for duty on a priority basis to 
ensure the operation capability of reserve force.
(5) Materials Mobilization Preparedness
In order to integrate national resources to support military operations, the military will 
work with the relevant departments, county and city governments and supervising 
agencies for establishment of a resource integration platform to facilitate mobilization 
and preparedness that follows the process of “determining required items for operation, conducting detailed survey of such requirements, collecting, compiling and managing 
survey results, establishing preliminary understanding on supply and demand, setting 
reasonable procurement and requisition prices, carrying out regular requisition and 
procurement exercises and allocating wartime budget.” At present, a total of 341 items 
in 67 sub-groups within 10 main categories are classified and managed, facilitating rapid mobilization in support of defensive operations in wartime.

97Section 5 Exercises and Training
In addition to continuing to improve individual physical fitness and basic military training, the 
Armed Forces have also integrated reliable operational capabilities of military services, special 
forces, logistics support and new services to enhance the overall capabilities of joint operations. Meanwhile, annual major exercises and base open days are used as an opportunity to display the results of Armed Forces training and increase citizen participation in and support for national 
defense affairs, with the aim of enhancing all-out defense education and raising the level of overall 
operational capability.
I .   Joint Exercises and Training
In order to achieve all-dimensional readiness for the defense of Taiwan and Penghu and enhance operation of the joint operations command system, the Armed Forces follow the 
principles of “refined and realistic, strict and hard” and “practice command first, then train 
actual troops”. With a tri-service joint operations framework, attack and defense gaming through computer-aided command post exercises and “live exercises” are carried out to build 
reliable national defense military power.
(1) Hankuang Exercises
For the 2017 Han Kuang Exercises, the Armed Forces conducted virtual exercises 
via the computers at command posts in May. The joint theater war game simulation 
system was used to carry out 24-hour continual gaming in accordance with engagement processes such as operation schedule. The focuses were force preservation, joint 
utilization of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance information, joint counter 
blockade and anti-landing operations. The aim was strengthening the operation decision-making abilities of commanders of all levels and operational capabilities of staf f.
As for live exercises, live-fire exercises were conducted in the Penghu area for joint anti-landing operations, simulating the attacking force moving from exercise to operations using the principles of “short time, small scale and small force”. Using the “full-force, 
full equipment, partial live fire operation” model, 5 days and 4 nights of continuous attack-defense confrontation exercises were staged, implementing “island all-out defense 
operations” by utilizing civil and material resources in accordance with the concept of 
“all-out defense operations.”98(2) Lianyong Exercise
Every 2 years, the Combined Armored Brigade of the ground force enters the joint 
training base for further training after branch base training. Simulation of real combat 
scenarios increases the intensity of joint operations training and live-fire attack capabilities. Integration of the entire firepower allows all cadres to understand the 
characteristics and constraints of each service. This helps improve their performance in 
terms of taking concerted action during joint operations, and thus strengthens the forces' 
integrated operational capability of ground and air strike and increases the effectiveness 
of joint operations. 
(3) Lianxing Exercise
Marine forces that have completed annual amphibious base training and Navy, Air Force 
and ROC Army Aviation and Special Forces Command forces form the joint amphibious 
task force. Joint amphibious operation exercises are carried out against an opposing force. In coordination with readiness mission training, anti-landing operation exercises 
are conducted in subordinate operation areas to increase the Navy’s amphibious landing 
capability and its defensive capability in these areas.

II .  Military Training
The military’s new forces have been commissioned in succession and multiple conversion 
programs have been carried out according to plan. The effort to build innovative/asymmetric 
operation capability continues. The training of each force simulates real battlefield scenarios 
and uses an adversarial “realistic combat” training model. Fitness, combat skill, base and joint operations training continue to be enhanced. In particular, the training focuses on weapons 
firing capability, rapid force and firepower projection, joint electronic and information 
warfare, cyber warfare and joint operations, with the aim of acquiring the ability to “be 
capable to fight after training and win”. Skills refresher training is also provided to inactive 
service personnel to ensure the capability of mobilized reserve forces.
99100(1) Fitness and Combat Skill Training
In response to changes in the volunteer military system and to enhance the training of 
volunteer service personnel, force fitness and combat skill training focuses on combat 
fitness, general shooting, combat shooting and mixed martial arts. Random testing is carried out by the service HQ every year at company level with a target average pass rate 
of 85% as the training objective. The Armed Force Cup sports competition has also been 
reinstated, increasing unit cohesion, stimulating the will to win and consolidating force unity through sporting competitions. The Armed Forces also try to mold a positive force 
atmosphere and improve the fitness of officers and other ranks through autonomous 
training and friendly competitions, and increased military-civilian exchange.
(2) Military Training of Regular Forces
To give service personnel practical skills and exercise experience, since 2017 “military training of regular service” has been divided into stage one initial entry training and stage 2 specialty training to increase the intensity of military training and participation 
in important exercises and strengthen marching, shooting and encampment training courses. The aim is to increase the basic combat capability of the Armed Forces and 
expand the operational capability of the reserve force.
(3) Station Unit Training
Strengthening general training at military bases of each branch is at the core of training. The focus of station unit training is skills and team training so that military personnel 
possess “expertise in one field and knowledge and ability in many others.” With 
actual combat orientation, “strict, hard, realistic” training is provided for continued enhancement of different combat training and courses, such as fitness and combat 
skills of military personnel, tactical marching, and combat shooting, to raise the overall 
combat capability of forces.
(4) Base Testing
Each of the services has a dedicated testing center and verifies the results of its 
station unit training in high-quality training venues with complete scenarios, vigorous 
training and fair testing, in order to evaluate whether its force possesses the capability 
to carry out readiness missions. Meanwhile, the ROC military also plans to upgrade 
multifunction training grounds in the southern and northern Army testing centers and the integrated firing range of the joint training base to increase forces’ operational capability 
by using training venues that simulate actual combat conditions.
Part 2 National
Defense Readiness
101(5) Military Doctrine
With reference to the advanced concepts of the US military and in accordance with the 
joint operation command framework, the Armed Forces have developed 1,110 doctrines 
in 3 categories to assist force buildup and meet readiness requirements, and to act as an important reference for force operational plans and training. In 2017, 155 doctrines 
were revised as a result of collecting and sorting the conclusions of combat training 
and exercises and the commissioning of new forces. In the future, we will continue to borrow from the training strengths of allies, refine the meaning of doctrines and 
nurture the compliance habits of military personnel. This will ensure that full synergy of 
manpower and existing weapons and systems will be optimized, thus raising the level of 
professional skills and knowledge of military personnel.
III. Reserve Force Mobilization and Training
(1) Reserve Force Training
In order to improve the command capability of cadre and combat skills of soldiers, 5-7 days of muster-call training is given on a biennial basis, focusing on skills refresher 
training, shooting practice, combat training, team training and disaster prevention and relief.
(2) Testing Mobilization Effectiveness
In order to test mobilization effectiveness, operational capabilities such as reserve force organization, combat training, materials and vehicle/aircraft mobilization and 
homeland defense were tested based on the scenario of the Han Kuang Exercises 
according to exercise sequence, in conjunction with live exercises of Tongxin (manpower mobilization) and Tzuchiang (physical resource mobilization), with the aim of increasing 
integrated operation capability of mobilized reserve force.102

To develop the weapons systems and equipment needed for future operations, in 
accordance with the regulations of Article 22 of the National Defense Act and in 
combination with civilian industrial, academic and technology research capabilities, the MND actively develops weaponry R&D, production and full life-cycle support capabilities to increase national defense self-reliant technological capability; 
overseas purchase is also used to carry out industrial cooperation and technology 
transfer to move towards the objectives of revitalizing the national defense industry 
and national defense self-reliance.
Part 3: Self-reliant National Defense110Chapter 5 National Defense Technology
The core concept of national defense self-reliance is establishing self-reliant national  
technological capability, that is to say that R&D and design, manufacture, testing and logistics 
support capabilities must be possessed to achieve substantive national defense self-reliance. Looking ahead to national defense requirements, with respect to indicator projects such as the indigenous aircraft and navy ship programs, according to requirements, the MND guides the 
participation of private sector companies in combination with inter-agency resources to drive the 
development of the national defense industry and create a military-civilian mutually-beneficial 
win-win cycle.
Section 1 National Defense Technology Development
National defense technology must foresee technology trends and joint operations requirements, 
and follow a target-oriented schedule to gradually achieve key technology breakthroughs 
and develop advanced technology to boost national defense self-reliant R&D capability .
I .  Foreseeing Long-term Requirements
Foreseeing national defense development trends, combining, short-mid-long-term requirements and stocktaking gaps in current technological capability, each stage of national 
defense planning is conducted. Seven categories of required items, namely, joint information 
and electronic warfare, joint contingency operational capability, joint air defense operational capability, joint interception operational capability, joint homeland defense operational 
capability, innovative/asymmetric warfare capability and advanced technology operational 
capability guide national defense technology development. The aim is to ensure that national 
defense technology is target-oriented and is a continuation of policy.
II . Key Technology Breakthrough
(1) After assessing readiness level, advanced, sensitive and hard-to-obtain national defense 
key technology is developed in a systematic and focused way. Through overseas purchase and industrial cooperation, joint R&D, technical cooperation and technology 
transfer, the technology level of readiness weapon system development has been raised 
and the risk of system development lowered.
(2) Industrial, government, academic and research resources are integrated to develop 
system components and parts to gradually move towards achieving key project full self-
manufacture capability; also, with regard to non-key items sold on the market, goods in 
stock are bought while giving consideration to cost to avoid waste of R&D resources 
and reduce R&D costs. In 2017, 11 key technology R&D projects were carried out, 
Part 3 Self-reliant 
National Defense
111including information system, C4ISR system and future weapons systems, with a budget 
of NT$489.73 million.
III. Development of Advanced Technology

projects such as “display and confirmation,” “engineering development” and “combat 
system development” are being carried out according to technological readiness level. 112Section 2 Self-development and Self-manufacture of Weapons
In accordance with National Defense Technology Planning, the MND conducts weapons system 
self-development and self-manufacture to build R&D, design, manufacturing, testing and full 
life-cycle support full-timeline, self-development and self-manufacture capabilities; the current focus is on aerospace, navy ships and information security.
I .   Indigenous Military Aircraft 
(1) To build combat power that will meet the requirements of future joint air defense 
operations, it is planned to upgrade the performance of existing fighters on the basis 
of the National Chung-shan Science and Technology Research Institute’s R&D; also, 
integrating domestic and foreign systems manufacturers, new advanced trainers are being developed and key component parallel R&D carried out to concentrate research 
and manufacturing capabilities; an engine research plan has been formulated and 
program established, continuing to launch fighter key technology R&D work according 
to the national defense technology planning schedule.
(2) The New Advanced Trainer Outsourced Manufacture and Cooperation MOU 
Signing Ceremony was hosted by President Tsai on February 7, 2017, announcing the determination to jointly develop the aerospace industry. The Air Force and 
National Chung-shan Science and Technology Research Institute (NCSIST) have signed an outsourced manufacturing agreement for 66 advanced trainers, integrating

(1) Short, mid and long-term development strategies are drawn up involving development of 
military-civilian dual use products, linking industry, academic and research capabilities 
and nurturing information security talent; in accordance with readiness preparation 
requirements, budget is allocated and projects that domestic information security companies can take part in are released to give domestic manufacturers a chance to 
participate in national defense research and manufacture.
(2) In 2017 to the present time, 20 information security workshops have been held including 
the National Defense Information and Electronic Dominance Symposium; in 2017, the Military Academy Cup and Armed Forces Cup Cyber Defense Exercises were held and 
had 16 teams from 14 units participate. 38 information security technology seminars 
were held including Taiwan Cyber Security Summit and Advanced Persistent Threat 
(APT); also, a strategic alliance partnership was signed between the MND and National Taiwan University, National Chiao Tung University and National Taiwan University of 
Science and Technology, under which the universities will be commissioned to carry 
out research to allow advanced information security technology to be acquired and thus strengthen the information, communication and electronic capabilities of the Armed 
Forces.
(3) Cyber security has become an important national strategic objective. To cope with the 
threats that represent an increasingly serious challenge by the day, the Armed Forces must maintain the highest information security specifications. In the area of information 
security R&D, universities in Taiwan already are world class; in the future, through continued cooperation and exchange, and holding academic research and information 
security forums, practical training and seminars, the aim is to stimulate the interest 
of more students in national defense information security; utilizing this advantageous 
situation, outstanding young people will be recruited to store up a pool of national 
defense information security talent and expand information security capability .120Chapter 6 National Defense and Public 
Welfare 
The MND seeks to strengthen national defense technology development and application 
utilizing the resources of various government agencies. The MND also promotes green energy 
and environmental protection to drive the development of the national defense industry and move towards achieving the dual objectives of meeting national defense requirements and creating economic effectiveness.
Section 1 National Defense Industry
The national defense industry is an important force supporting national defense self-reliance. In order to develop the national defense industry, the transfer of national defense related R&D 
and technology to the private sector continues. Further to this, steps to upgrade domestic industry and build an end-to-end national defense industry supply chain are being taken. In addition, by releasing resources from national defense to private enterprises, domestic manufacturers are given 
trial opportunities of production technology, and this helps to expand the scale of the national 
defense industry.
I  .  Transfer of National Defense Technology to the Private Sector
(1) In line with government policy, the MND promotes the development of the national 
defense industry and increased national defense self-reliance through “transferring 
national defense technology to industries, creating industry value” and “private sector 
power supporting national defense technology.”
(2) Visits to national defense related companies aim to understand national defense industry 
capacities and the results of national defense technology R&D are transferred to guide 
companies to develop system components and high value core products. In addition, intellectual property rights strategy has been strengthened, a mechanism for R&D revenues flowing back established, and the revenues invested in the R&D of national defense 
technology.
(3) To nurture the domestic defense industry, through a military hardware research, 
manufacture, and maintenance mechanism, a defense industrial supply chain with 
private enterprise participation has been built. In the last five years the amount of 
outsourced research, manufacture, and maintenance has totaled over NT$5.01 billion.
II .  Developing Military-civilian Dual-use Technology
(1) Military-civilian dual-use technology R&D is carried out, and industry-academia-
research upstream and downstream cooperation teams are built, developing weapons 
systems in line with national defense requirements; mature national defense technology

is converted to products connected to people’s livelihood, to raise the technology level 
and international competitiveness of domestic industry, and to create derivative benefits 
for industry.
(2) In 2017, in coordination with the Ministry of Science and Technology, military-civilian 
dual-use technology was applied to the electric vehicle and green energy industries, and aerospace industry development was promoted by linking the materials, manufacturing, 
processing, testing, verifying and aerospace application industry chain.
(3) With people’s livelihood industry requirements as the base, the NCSIST is implementing 
25 technology projects, with a total budget of NT$886.07 million. The development of the national defense industry is being supported in conjunction with private industry to increase national defense self-reliance and revitalize the national defense industry .122III. National Defense Manufacturer Security Control
To maintain national defense and security and also protect the results of key research, in 2017 
the MND drew up the Guidelines for Establishment of Confidentiality Review Committees 
and Review for National Defense Affairs, Execution Methods of Security Investigation 
on Defense Manufacturers of Technology Cooperation and purchase agreement “Special Confidentiality Clauses (template)” with reference to the US’s confidential security control 
mechanism and checking standards; confidentiality protection manpower was adjusted to set 
up the Security Investigation Office, with the indigenous aircraft and navy vessel programs 
and other major projects as the pilot projects; control actions such as security investigation 
and confidentiality auditing are carried out with respect to the NCSIST and manufacturers’ personnel, facilities, and information security involving confidentiality, providing assistance 
so that the security standards in the agreements are reached, protecting sensitive assets in the 
execution process, and preventing the occurrence of leaks and illegal acts.
Also, to strengthen control of confidentiality of personnel taking part in national defense 
affairs, the Control Standards Practice Manual for the Participation of Personnel in National 
Defense Affairs was drawn up in April 2017, specifying confidentiality security control measures and auditing actions with respect to non-MND personnel visiting or attending 
meetings at the MND or engaging in academic exchange, to maintain confidentiality discipline 
and ensure that personnel taking part in national defense affairs meet the requirements of confidentiality security.
IV .  Resource Releasing
The releasing of national defense resources to private enterprises is guided by the principle of “absolutely no overseas purchase when domestic manufacturers can supply; when capability 
is lacking, provide guidance to upgrade technology level.” Non-sensitive, non-readiness 
time-critical and non-core capability weapons, equipment and supplies are released to the private sector to increase the military product R&D, manufacture and repair and maintenance 
capabilities of domestic suppliers. When purchases must be made overseas, the contracted 
overseas supplier is required to, according to the Industrial Cooperation Program, transfer 
technology to the ROC to build a national defense technology industry foundation and move towards achieving the policy objective of national defense self-reliance.
Releasing of national defense resources can be divided into 3 types: “military hardware 
procurement,” “military hardware maintenance,” and “general military hardware,” with 
the annual planned objective of releasing set according to force buildup concepts and weapons reconstruction guiding principles. In 2016, the planned objective of releasing was 
NT$81 billion and the actual achieved amount was NT$104.7 billion, an achievement rate 
of 129.36%. The planned objective of releasing for 2017 is NT$93 billion. The focus is on 8-wheeled armored vehicle manufacture and maintenance, upgrading of F-CK-1 Ching-kuo 
Fighters, manufacture of advance trainer jets, strategic commercial maintenance of military 
aircraft, vessels and vehicles, and GOCO for military industries.
Part 3 Self-reliant 
National Defense
123Section 2 Environmental Protection and Energy Conservation
In line with national environmental protection and green energy policies, related measures are 
actively promoted while taking into account national defense and security and combat readiness, 
to facilitate energy conservation and sustainable use of environmental resources.
I .   Energy Conservation and Carbon Reduction
The Armed Forces have implemented various measures to reduce energy use; in the area of combat readiness and training, greater use of training simulators is being made to reduce 
energy consumption, and decommissioning and sealing of outdated old weapons continues. 
New building project design must feature natural lighting and ventilation, sunshade equipment and solar powered water heating, as well as a dual water supply system, water storage 
pool and shower wastewater re-use. Electrical equipment and appliances that have energy 
conservation and environmentally protection marks are purchased on a priority basis and 
good individual water and electricity use habits are promoted to save water and electricity. 
Energy conservation and carbon reduction measures have been adopted in line with national sustainable energy and environmental protection policies and in accordance with the 
Executive Yuan-approved Four-saving Projects among Government Agencies and Schools, 
Energy Conservation Action Plan among Government Agencies and Schools , and the MOEA 
Water Resources Conservation Normalization Action Plan. In terms of energy saving results in 2016, water saving percentage was 6.64% on 2015; as for 2017, in the first three quarters, 
water saving percentage was 0.04% on the same period in 2016; electricity saving percentage was 3.23% on the same period in 2016.
II . Military Airbase Noise Control
To reduce the effect of airbases noise on surrounding residents, annually the MND provides subsidies for noise-control facilities at 12 airbases. Since 1998, subsidies have been provided 
for the installation of noise-control facilities by schools, libraries, hospitals, public facilities 
and households in the vicinity of military bases. As of 2016, NT$2,342.77 million had been allocated. In 2017, NT$106.2 million was set aside for airbase noise control and subsidy 
operations have already been handled according to schedule control. Also, to strengthen flight 
and airbase management and implement environmental flight paths and flight time periods, 
aircraft or engine test muffler facilities have been installed, noise barrier walls erected around 
airbases, green buffer zones established in control areas and other measures taken to allow readiness mission execution requirements to be met and the impact of noise on local residents 
reduced.124III. Harbor Pollution Prevention
In line with the Environmental Protection Administration’ s Marine Oil Pollution Emergency 
Response Plan, areas of responsibility have been delineated on wharfs at Zuoying and Qijin 
harbors in Kaohsiung, and Magong, Keelung and Su-ao harbors and are regularly patrolled. 
Ships docked in harbor areas and wharf units are required to carry out clean up, reporting and prevention operations in the event of a major oil pollution incident to maintain harbor area 
environmental cleanliness. In 2016, 3 ocean oil pollution exercises were held in coordination 
with the Executive Yuan and local governments; in both 2016 and 2017, 2 educational 
lectures on sea area oil pollution and sea-transported chemical pollution response were held 
to enhance the military’s emergency response operational capability in the event of a marine pollution incident.
IV . Military Green Energy Facilities
In line with the Executive Yuan’s policy of using central government owned building roofs and land for the installation of solar photovoltaic systems to promote energy diversity and 
self-supply and build a green energy low carbon environment, sites suited to the installation of 
solar photovoltaic systems were reviewed by the MND and list of sites passed to the Bureau of Energy, MOEA for selection. 127 buildings were deemed suitable, the area involved over 
204,000 square meters. Follow up invitation of tenders and installing of systems is being 
handled by various units. The deadline for completion of the systems is the end of June 2018.
V .  Environmental Protection Actions
(1) Green Procurement
In accordance with the Executive Yuan Environmental Protection Administration’s “promotion 
of green procurement by government agencies” policy, the production and use of green 
products is encouraged by the MND. As of 2016, the environmental protection product 
designated procurement case amount was NT$153 million and the total environmental protection product procurement amount was NT$158 million, giving a designated procurement case achievement rate of 98.09% and green procurement case achievement rate 
of 99.25%, exceeding the Executive Yuan’s target of 90%.
(2) Maintaining Bio-diversity
Taiwan has a unique and diverse ecosystem. Invasive species threaten the existence of native 
species and alter the existing ecosystem, and affect the agricultural economy and residential 
quality of citizens, therefore prevention of invasive species is necessary to maintain native bio-
diversity.

Sustainable Development Implementation Plan, and its allocation of labor table, environmental 
ecological protection work is carried out by the Armed Forces. As of 2016, infestations of red fire ant ( Solenopsis invicta ) had been eliminated at nine bases, bitter vine ( Mikania micrantha) 
at 12 bases, fragrant eupatorium ( Chromolaena odorata ) at 13 bases and biting midge 
(Forcipomyia taiwana ) at 30 bases.126
127
Public governance differs from traditional, compulsory “top-down” public administration in 
its emphasis on the participation of government, society, and the individual in the public 
policy processes, and all can equally contribute to the public policy dialogue. The MND has actively made changes in the administration of policy decisions and in communication methods and promoted policies favorable to service personnel, such as national defense reform, 
improving living facilities, and transforming the organizational culture. It has provided a policy-
recommendation channel to low-level service personnel, and the general public alike, which is 
expected to make for a superior, more democratic National Defense Governance.Part 4: National Defense Governance128Chapter 7 Policy Effectiveness
In its 2017 Quadrennial Defense Review , the MND announced several innovative policies, including 
refining the volunteer military system, optimizing quality of manpower, enhancing the image of 
service members, attending to the welfare of military personnel, and streamlining defense laws and 
regulations. There have been positive initial results, and the MND will continue to push through these reforms for improvement of the quality and effectiveness of national defense policies.
Section 1 Volunteer Military System
The volunteer military system is an important national defense policy. The MND has continued to promote the All-Volunteer Military Implementation Plan  ratified in 2012 by the Executive Yuan. 
It has adopted as a policy objective “increasing voluntary recruitment and reducing conscription year by year,” to ultimately arrive at a standing force comprised of volunteer service personnel on active duty.
I .   Effectiveness of Implementation
Under the Executive Yuan’s guidance and coordination, the MND has promoted accompanying 
measures and volunteer military system initiatives to raise the achievement rate of all-volunteer service 
personnel from 58.7% in 2012 up to 78% in 2017. The proportion of volunteer military personnel rose 
from 39% to 80.5%, which is a marked increase in volunteer manpower.
There is room for improvement in recruitment of officers, due to a decline in the number of conscripts 
over the years, the declining birth rate in the population, competition in the employment market, and 
heavier workloads borne by rank-and-file soldiers and officers. We will strengthen officer recruitment, 
provide incentives for them to stay in the military and encourage the long-term retention of high-quality active personnel through a number of continual actions, including increasing the recruitment sources of junior officers, improving recruitment outreach, adopting more flexible means of recruitment, 
enhancing the military’s image, improving the active-duty environment, and refurbishing personnel 
dormitories.
II.  Support Measures
To achieve stable recruitment and retain the needed personnel, the MND continues to implement recruitment support measures for the volunteer military system to enhance professional military skills 
and the capability to carry out readiness missions.
(1) Comprehensive Legal Basis
The Provisional Act for the Implementation of the Volunteer Military System  was formally 
enacted on October 2, 2015. There has been comprehensive legislative drafting to date, 
with 26 regulations completed, including Military Education Regulations , and 5 other 
regulations, including Statute of Welfare for Military Service Members , currently in the 
draft stage. The interim regulations will continue to apply to the various ministries until the

(2) Enhanced Compensation Scheme
The Executive Yuan approved adjustment of the Allowance for Personnel in the Outlying Islands of Penghu Area, which took effect on January 1, 2017. On July 1, 2017, the adjusted V olunteer Company-grade Officer Allowance, Company-grade Officer Retention 
Bonus, Information (cyber warfare) Service Bonus, Air Traffic Control Operation Service 
Allowance, Electronic Signals Detection Personnel Allowance, and Tri-Service Color Guard Allowance were approved. On October 1, the Second Phase Combat Unit Allowance was 
approved.
The adjustments in allowance described above will help in the retention of low-level 
soldiers, officers, and specialized personnel. In addition, the MND will seek to expedite 
allowance adjustments for Master Chief Petty Officers as a morale incentive and to increase 
volunteer manpower.
(3) Training in Multiple Specializations
Military personnel are encouraged to pursue advanced education, either full-time or 
during off-hours, studying for academic degrees or professional certifications according 
to their duties, on the condition that such pursuit does not affect their operational training and missions. In cooperation with public and private universities, In-Service Education 
Programs are set up at camps, along with Certification Training Classes. We have worked 
with National Open University on the provision of advance education for those stationed in remote areas, in mountainous stations, and personnel onboard Navy vessels through 
the online education platform. In addition, we also help discharged military personnel 
participate in vocational training set up by the Veteran Affairs Council and the Ministry of 
Labor. This effort allows military personnel to acquire both military expertise and civilian 
certification for smooth transition to the civilian labor market after their military service. 
Part 4 National

[Integrating Military Members into the Civilian Job Market]131Section 2 Caring for Officers and Service Personnel
The service environment of officers and the service personnel has been improved, with 
renovated living quarters and facilities, military uniforms of improved quality, better food 
services and supplies, and care for family dependents. Existing facilities and amenities have been upgraded as a policy incentive for talent recruitment and retention.
I .   Renovation of Living Quarters
Considering that the living quarters for units have exceeded their age limit, a priority has been placed 
on refurbishing old camps into standardized military accommodation. New camp construction 
has multi-use facilities for living activities, administration, and leisure activities, providing well-
rounded life functionality. With the extended term of service for the volunteer military system, more consideration has been given to human concerns of privacy, though the Xing An Project, with family as the guiding concept: apartment-style modular design creates a family-like atmosphere. 
In 2017, 16 construction projects of the Army’s Huadong Defense Command have continued to be 
implemented, with another 99 planned. At present, 10 of the projects have been initiated and will be carried out according to a rolling review of priorities.
To minimize the disruption to service members’ households and family life, existing dormitories are 
renovated but not demolished. By doing so, the old structures are made new, creating an excellent 
living environment. In 2017, there were 819 refurbished service dormitories in 21 villages and planned construction of new dormitories to address a lack in some areas.
II.  Improved Quality of Military Uniforms
Starting in 2017, the fixed clothing allowance for officers and service personnel rose from 
NT$4,803 to NT$9,860 annually, which improved the quality of their attire. In addition, to address 
future needs in combat and to increase the effectiveness of camouflage, Tri-Service and military 
police combat units have changed the uniforms to the new digital camouflage patterns; the switch to 
digital camouflage uniforms for the Marines is ongoing. Disaster relief troops and recruits have been allocated digital camouflage crewnecks, and conscripts undergoing short-term military training have 
been allocated more PT shirts. Dedicated management of military apparel will result in increased 
clothing quality and more effective supplementary allocations, which will meet the needs of officers and service personnel for practical clothing.
III.Food Supplies and Services
The MND takes the actual needs of officers and service personnel into account in promoting its services, providing superior medical care and innovative welfare commissaries, strengthening crisis 
support services, benefiting officers and service personnel and their dependents and helping them 
solve difficult problems. This enables both officers and service personnel to focus on the tasks of military operations and training.132(1) Innovative Services
As new media on mobile devices gradually replaces traditional media, new marketing 
channels such as the MND’s General Welfare Service e-commerce website, combined 
with the group buying website Good Life, can use various social media groups or apps to broadcast information about deals. This provides an innovative, fast, and convenient 
service platform for service members, their dependents, and the families of veterans, 
allowing welfare work to reach everywhere; the online store can proactively provide a touring service at fixed points, allowing an understanding of the needs of units and 
individuals to be acquired, and based on this, a diversity of products can be promoted 
and discount prices offered, deepening the connection with the lives of the service 
members and their dependents.
(2) Diverse Service Initiatives
There is active discussion with civilian companies to provide reliable products and 
preferential deals to service members, their dependents, and the families of veterans, 
and to start programs with them for discount services. These include providing discount vouchers for well-known businesses, actively getting merchants to participate in 
campaigns that honor military personnel with discount deals as a way of supporting 
government efforts to stimulate the tourism industry and provide service members with 
suitable leisure-time services. This will broaden the scope of services to meet consumer needs and allow service members to feel the respect and deference of the country and of 
civilian companies.
(3) Comfort and Counseling for Service Members
For the comfort and encouragement of the units involved in military training or disaster relief, set procedures have been implemented to provide comfort to emergency response 
forces, so when a crisis erupts, materiel and resources are given priority deployment, enabling service members to give their undivided focus to their respective tasks. To 
this end, mobile commissaries have been set up to facilitate the giving of prompt and 
convenient service to officers and service personnel. For service members and their dependents undergoing hardships or disputes, or who are suffering indigence or illness, 
the Friends of the Armed Forces Association provides help with counseling services, 
patient visitations, and emergency relief. This helps to fortify the family ties of service 
members, and by promptly addressing their critical hardships, they are enabled to 
perform their duties free from distraction. From 2016 through November 2017, there have been 1,390 cases of urgent illness, death or injury, or comfort, for which over 
NT$8.69 million in consolation allowances have been issued.
Part 4 National
Defense Governance
133(4) Care of Military Families
The sale of scattered units in refurbished 3rd and 4th echelon Military Dependents’ 
Villages resulted in 656 advertised new units, which has been effective in bringing 
stability to the lives of military personnel and their dependents. The Guidelines on 
Care of Military Families  provide military dependents with some cost reductions 
when receiving medical treatment at military hospitals. It also provides for preferential treatment by public power and water utility companies for their water and electricity 
usage. Military accommodation facilities also give preferential treatment, as do veterans’ 
savings banks. Financial assistance for childcare, education, and funeral expenses, as 
well as emergency financial help for health emergencies and crises of indigence are also provided. There are 395 first-rate registered childcare organizations that have signed 
contracts to provide service members and their dependents with substantial care services. 
This has helped to address the issue of childcare.
(5) Optimizing Medical Services
Effectively raising the standard of medical care and treatment is accomplished through 
comprehensive military medical education, constant training of military medical 
practitioners, acquisition of cutting-edge medical equipment, planning the building of 
modernized medical buildings, comprehensively updated medical information systems, 
and optimized workflows. Health education and policies push for physical conditioning, optimal sleep health, emotional management, healthy eating and drinking, prevention 
and treatment of tobacco and betel nut-related diseases, weight management, and 
tracking of physical examinations. This deepens service members’ basic knowledge and conceptual understanding of self-management, and through big-data statistical 
analysis, their health and treatment needs can be grasped. In this way, appropriate health 
services and healthy work environments can be provided, enabling the service members to undergo strict combat skill training, and thereby enhance the military capability of 
personnel.134Section 3 National Defense Financial Resources
Under the rubric “active acquisition, reasonable allocation, and effective utilization” of 
financial resources, the MND continues to anticipate combat needs and available financial 
resources. Making an integrated assessment of effectiveness, based on equipment performance, acquisition priorities, and full lifecycle costs, funding outlays are made to comply with the volunteer military system’s legally-required expenditure on a priority basis; the MND places an 
emphasis on enhancement of indigenous capability, procurement of advanced weapons systems, 
improving main battle equipment availability, and improving the living facilities of service 
members. These measures enhance administrative efficiency overall. Moreover, the MND also has 
implemented cost systems, carried out active fund management and developed cloud solutions as strategic moves to effectively support management decisions.
I . Budget Allocations and Future Planning
(1) MND Financial Resource Analysis
The national defense budget is drawn up by the Executive Yuan, which weighs up 
the needs of national economic development as a whole, the government’s financial 
resources, and the financial requirements of social welfare programs, educational  expenditure, scientific and cultural expenses, together with the force buildup timeline, 
for appropriate allocation of national defense budget. Over the past 10 years (2008–
2017), the budget has been between NT$294.6 billion and NT$334 billion, comprising approximately 16.17% to 19.51% of the total overall budget of the government.
(2) Principles of MND Budgetary Allocations
The MND’s fiscal plan is based on the level of funding the government is currently able to allocate. Budgetary categories are divided into the 3 areas of maintenance of 
personnel levels, operations and maintenance, and military investment. Within this 
budgetary allocation framework, the MND’s priority is funding regulatory outlays of the volunteer military system, while placing an emphasis on implementation of key policies, 
including increasing domestic capabilities of weapons development and manufacture, 
procuring advanced weapons systems, maintaining availability of main battle equipment, and improving the living facilities of service members, to ensure stable development of 
force buildup and combat readiness.
(3) Key Aspects of FY 2017 National Defense Budget Allocation and Policy Implementation
The annual MND budget for the 2017 fiscal year was NT$319.3 billion, with the following key appropriations:
Part 4 National
Defense Governance
1351. Personnel: NT$147.7 billion, mainly allocated to meet regulatory requirements for 
implementation of important government policies, including personnel compensation, 
allowances and insurance costs incurred from volunteer force recruitment, force 
retention and conscription and training of standing troops.
2. Operation and Maintenance: NT$81.2 billion, allocated chiefly to maintain the 
readiness posture of main battle equipment and to improve the living quarters of service members to meet the basic operational needs of all level unit for development of comprehensive integrated capabilities. A balance is struck between military 
exercises and training for combat readiness and disaster prevention and relief 
missions.
3. Military investments: NT$85.7 billion, used in continued contractual implementation 
of the new-type utility helicopter and PAC-3 missile programs, and to push major plans for domestic production of naval and air force vessels, including indigenous advanced training aircraft and subsequent mass-produced high-efficiency naval 
vessels. These initiatives are a specific demonstration of self-defense determination 
and ability.
4. Others: NT$4.7 billion, primarily for the budget of the National Security Bureau.05,00010,00015,00020,000

[MND Budget and the Central Government Budget]136II .  Financial Management
(1) Implementing Cost Systems to Support Management Policies
With procurement of military weapons and equipment subject to process re-engineering, 
cost analysis of weapons development investment based on product cycles, and depletion 
costs of combat units in the main force subsumed by operations, cost parameters are compiled for human resources, operation and maintenance, and equipment procurement 
at all levels, and a knowledge-sharing platform enables defense cost analyses operations 
to be established for all of the units in the MND. This provides reference and basis for procurement budgets and financial forecasting and brings out the functional potential of 
financial management in contributing to the goal of force buildup and readiness.
(2) Funds Activation to Develop an Optimal Environment
To meet the needs of national defense administration, national defense resources are 
integrated by leveraging special funds, importing enterprise management concepts, 
strengthening fund management, and extending the performance of financial 
investments. Disused military camp assets have been effectively activated to provide 
overall stable financial resources, providing sufficient investment to aid in the restoration 
of outmoded camps and accelerate the optimization of living quarters for service members. There have been concrete improvements in the living environment of service 
members. Comprehensive service operations have benefited from the ability to be more 
innovative, raising the quality of medical care for service members, providing better social services, better arts and education options, banking and financial, food supply and 
mess service.08751,7502,6253,500

[MND Budgetary Allocations]137(3) Developing Cloud Solutions and Strengthening Data Analysis
Based on the MND Financial Information Cloud Services Network, auditing and 
financial operations are integrated into information systems and cloud services. An 
auditing control system uses a consistent interface and centralized database, together with electronic signatures and digitized documentation. This simplifies operating 
procedures and improves the quality of operational data. In the future, with large 
transaction data volumes at its disposal, it will effectively utilize big data technology for analysis to find correlations and discrepancies among unit budget implementation, 
expense items and monthly financial statements with multiple perspective analytical 
techniques. This aims to facilitate subsequent budget preparation and enhance budget utilization effectiveness for supporting managers’ decision-making and expediting force 
buildup and readiness.138Section 4 Weapons Acquisition
One of the major issues in maintaining and upgrading military power is acquisition of 
equipment and weapons at reasonable cost. A stringent weapons acquisition system, 
including advance assessment operations, procurement method analysis, and improved case management, can guarantee that procurement of superior weaponry proceeds according to a scheduled program. This will meet combat needs and eliminate the military power gap, making 
the Armed Force an optimal fighting force.
I .   Military Investment Program Management
To refine the efficiency and quality of military acquisition procedures, and procure optimal weapons 
in terms of meeting operational requirements and demand for cost-effectiveness, the ROC Armed 
Forces have been integrating weapon acquisition processes, carefully reviewing all documentation, 
and utilizing professional personnel with more flexibility in operations, in order to make well-rounded programs for weapon acquisition, and achieve our goals of force buildup and self-reliant defense.
II.  Program Establishment
There are 2 stages in program establishment. In the first stage, the General Staff HQ determines operational requirements, and issues top-down force buildup directives in close harmony with the 
overall defense concept, supporting the needs of joint operations. In the second stage,  planning of 
procurement methods begins, and thereafter, comes a complete assessment of domestic production capability, systems analysis, and overall logistics support and industry economic benefit analysis. When this is completed, an overall acquisition planning report is made to address the mission of 
force buildup and readiness. This provides recommendations for optimal weapons to procure, a 
review of national defense financial resources, together with reasonable budget allocations.

Defense Governance
139III. National Defense Effectiveness Assessment
With respect to joint forces planning and the stage of weapons acquirement, the MND has continued 
to forge ahead in its assessment of national defense resources. This entails an overall assessment of 
weapons and equipment serviceability, cost assessments over equipment life cycles, and analyses of 
acquisition priorities. Using an integrated scientific, quantitative evaluation system, the effectiveness of joint operations is evaluated along with cost-effectiveness. The MND evaluates the effectiveness and cost of weapons and equipment in order to acquire weapons and equipment of appropriate 
quantity and quality and optimize the distribution and utilization of national defense resources.
IV . Procurement Operations
(1) National defense procurement is a key support of combat readiness, and lies within 
the scope of national defense administration. The procurement process must take 
into account overall factors of quality, cost, and effectiveness over time, as well as 
compliance with Government Procurement Act , and it must safeguard the public interest 
and the principle of fairness in transactions. Meanwhile, the MND continues to ensure 
procurement quality through auditing and supervisory efforts and professional training.
(2) With regard to acquiring large weapons systems, a determination is made according to 
the overall acquisition planning report, and an appropriate strategy is set. In meeting the need for force buildup, priority is granted the NCSIST for indigenous research and 
development and NCSIST specialists in the field of systems integration. They assist with specialized management and implement security controls with respect to military 
defense contractors involved with classified information.140Section 5 Military Medicine
Military medicine is a discipline that significantly differs from conventional clinical medicine. 
It is an integrated field of applied medicine devoted to promoting the mental and physical 
health of military personnel, preventing disease, and providing emergency medical attention and clinical care. It is subdivided into various medical fields such as battlefield medicine, aviation medicine, naval operational medicine, submarine and underwater medicine, combat psychiatry, 
and others. During peacetime, it is concerned with pre-planning work, including implementing 
service members’ health self-management, health promotion and disease prevention in the 
barracks, public health and infectious disease prevention and treatment, risk management on duty, 
and optimizing psychological strengths on the battlefield. These things are intended to raise the physical fitness level and combat skills of the service members, and the military effectiveness 
of the unit. On the other hand, during wartime, emphasis is placed on emergency medical care 
and rapid evacuation for combat injuries, relief of battlefield pressure and anxiety, ensuring that maximum care can be given to the wounded in the battlefield hospital, and making sure the supply 
line for blood and medicines remains unobstructed. In this way, both military effectiveness and 
troop morale can be maintained.
I .   Health Education in the Barracks
The health of service members is the foundation on which force capability rests. To establish 
awareness of health self-management with respect to healthy diet, bodyweight management, stress 
management, and optimal sleep habits, the MND has instituted a health education program, and 
has set up a systematized outreach program. A system to monitor the results of annual physical exams can target anomalies in particular service members via a “3-Level Diagnostic Referral for Physical Exam Anomalies.” Follow-up outpatient visits and retests can be more aggressively carried 
out, and with more active treatment and health education, the service member can recover his or 
her health. The MND has also implemented a military health management information system containing annual physical exam data for service members. Using big data analysis, changes in service members’ health status can be more deeply understood, enabling adjustments to be made in 
preventive health strategy and emphasis, so that early warning signs can be effectively identified and 
addressed. This has created a service environment for a modernized force, ensuring maintenance of current defense capability.
II.  Hearing Protection
When service members engage in combat readiness exercises, live-fire drills, disaster relief and rescue operations, flight service, or engage in engineering or factory (depot) work, they are 
frequently exposed to high-decibel noisy environments. If no suitable hearing protection is used, 
their hearing may be damaged, and they may suffer from noise-induced hearing loss. To address this, the MND complies with the national regulations on workplace noise, takes measurements of on-site ambient noise, performs risk assessments, arranges for health education on hearing 
protection, and carries out hearing tests, and health management.
Part 4 National
Defense Governance
141To address service members’ need for hearing protection when carrying out their military duties, 
the Occupational Hearing Conservation Program Guideline  has been devised. The MND has 
issued a Hearing Conservation Program Guideline for Military Service , which clarifies the rights 
and obligations of units with respect to statutory hearing protection rules at their posts of duty, and the modes of protection. Individuals are provided with means and tools to manage their sense of hearing’s basic physiological function, control environmental noise and for self-protection, and 
provided information on medical diagnosis and treatment. This has raised overall awareness and 
concern among service members about protecting their hearing.
Forging ahead in the area of hearing protection in the military, the MND has integrated the various 
interdisciplinary fields of military medicine, human-factor engineering, materials science, electrical 
engineering, and communications, information, and electronics. It has set up research teams, issued 
funding for national defense medical research, and invested in R&D projects analyzing main battle weapon noise levels, collection of statistical data in military facilities with high noise levels, and 
R&D of hearing-protection equipment and devices. It can be anticipated that industry and academia 
will jointly develop products for common use that conform with national military standards, such as active ear protection equipment, offering even better hearing protection.
III. Aviation Medicine
Aviation medicine is applicable to both Air Force units and the civil aviation industry. With regard to the Air Force, the central mission is to maintain safety in flight and enhance air defense combat 
capability. The aviation physiology training model enables Air Force personnel to better adapt to the 
potential physiological stresses and psychological burdens in the airborne environment. State of the art technical training equipment enables fighter jet pilots to safely experience virtual environments in which they may encounter high G force, G-force-induced consciousness loss, high-altitude hypoxia, 
spatial disorientation, motion sickness, and other aviation hazards. A series of stringent physical and 
psychological endurance tests not only prepares the pilot to execute his or her duties with a higher degree of safety, but also enhances their air combat skills.
The MND, in addition to analyzing the personality characteristics of its pilots, also undertakes 
analyses of health risk factors in the flight environment. Key issues here are integration of the 
human-machine interface of flight control and weapon systems etc., and a huge amount of resources has been invested with the aim that limited flight training resources yield the greatest effects in screening, training and utilization of talent. In addition to their medical duties relating to flight, 
aviation medical personnel must also perform the tasks of occupational and preventive medicine. 
The MND is committed to the ideal of both training talented people and fostering innovative, specialized research and development to solve practical problems relating to flight physiology. 
Meanwhile, it continues to train professionals in aviation medicine and sends its personnel to take 
part in international training and international military medical exchanges. It invites specialists in aviation medicine from Taiwan and abroad to further plans for aerospace medical research, exchange practical experience, and solidify the professional skills and abilities of its aviation 
medical personnel.142IV . Undersea Operations and Submarine Medicine
Other specialized medical disciplines of undersea operations and submarine medicine include 
undersea operations, submarine activity, emergency evacuation, healthcare, and health maintenance. 
Whenever service members carry out undersea missions, they must face the dangers of abnormal 
pressure, and so the MND has set up diving simulators in which personnel undergo pressure and oxygen tolerance tests. This enables them to simulate carrying out undersea combat missions safely in a controlled environment and lets on-duty servicemen become accustomed to abnormal 
pressure environments underwater, reducing the incidence of undersea accidents and increasing the 
completion rate of submarine missions. To treat personnel suffering from physical conditions related to their undersea service, the MND has also introduced hyperbaric oxygen therapy technology produced for clinical use, making it a pioneer in undersea and hyperbaric medicine in the country.
V .  Combat Casualty Care
Combat casualty care generally refers to the medical treatment of personnel who have been wounded under enemy fire, and its purpose is to lower the casualty rate of combat troops. Given the 
experience of the United States in the 2 Gulf Wars, preventable trauma accounts for most casualties. 
The MND has acquired a great deal of experience in the field of combat rescue training, and has increased its quality of care even as the Emergency Medical Services Act  was issued and went into 
force. The MND set up EMT-1, EMT-2, EMT-P, and instructor training courses for cultivation of 
emergency care talent. To date there are more than 10,000 emergency medical technicians regularly 
deployed in the military. To familiarize personnel with the skills needed for battlefield care, and to increase resistance to stress, county and municipal fire departments have entered into agreements to encourage those military personnel with EMT qualifications to actively serve in the fire system, 
providing emergency treatment. It is hoped that training will thereby unite with actual use in the 
field. Like the battlefield environment, care for the wounded is carried out under rapidly shifting circumstances. To help improve the capacity to care for wounded soldiers under enemy fire, the 
MND has trained staff in Tactical Combat Casualty Care, or TCCC. Emergency medical technology 
is melded with tactical ways of thinking to fortify the military medical specialist’s ability to provide Care Under Fire (CUF), Tactical Field Care (TFC), and Tactical Evacuation Care (TACEV AC). In wartime, this can help maintain both the military’s fighting ability and the morale of the troops.
Part 4 National
Defense Governance
143Section 6 Protecting Human Rights
Today, protecting human rights is a major issue in the international community. The MND also 
strives to safeguard the rights of service members. When the rights of a service member have 
been violated, they can obtain immediate relief; moreover, promotion of the policies of gender equality has made awareness of gender equality part of exercises and training as well as daily life.
I .   Relief System
(1) Appeals
The MND’s review committees for appeals and petitions are composed of fair and impartial 
committee members, both from inside and outside the MND. Whenever someone deems that 
a disciplinary action administered by a military unit, school, or department (facility) of the 
MND is illegal or improper, or if it has violated their rights or interests, they may file an appeal with this committee. After deliberations, the case will be duly resolved within 3 months. In 
addition, regular lectures are held to further service members’ practical understanding of 
normal legal procedures and administrative remedies, which helps with the proper handling of 
cases.
(2) National Compensation
In recent years, national compensation process committees have carried on an education initiative among mid- and high-level cadre to acquaint them with the national compensation 
system and take action to prevent any practices that may result in national compensation claims. They have done outreach visits at all levels and held workshops to further understanding of military cadre about the national compensation system and prevent such 
cases at source.
(3) Protecting the Rights of Service Members
1. If a service member becomes subject to an improper administrative measure or 
punishment, or if they become involved in a lawsuit while carrying out their duty and 
need to apply for assistance, or have suffered some other damage to their individual 
rights, they may petition committees for the protection of service members' rights and interests (Rights Protection Committees). These committees are in the Army 
Command Headquarters, Navy Command Headquarters, Air Force Command 
Headquarters, and Political Warfare Bureau. If their case is denied, they can petition the MND Rights Protection Committee again for reconsideration of their case.
2. At all levels, the Rights Protection Committees deliberate on cases brought by service 
members, and both impartial civilians, as well as executives within the department, are brought in to discuss the case and try to reach a decision promptly, after due 
consideration.
3. In safeguarding the legal rights and interests of service members, from 2016 to 144November 2017  the Rights Protection Committees at all levels accepted a total of 543 
cases for consideration or reconsideration and adjudicated 482 of these. The remaining 
61 outstanding cases are being tracked and under investigation to ensure the rights of 
our service members.
4. Service members are encouraged to boldly take on responsibility and are given support 
in duly carrying out official business. There were 8 applications for legal assistance for service members in all ranks involved in lawsuits arising from official business. Of these, 6 investigations were completed, and 2 were ongoing. Service members who 
request such assistance are given legal advice at all stages of the process.
II.  Complaint System
The MND complaint system is intended as a means of communication to protect the legal rights of 
service members, civilian employees in the MND, and their dependents. The most direct complaint 
line is the “1985 Consultation Helpline.” In order to improve the service quality and shorten the 
processing time of the 1985 Consultation Helpline, we have elevated the supervision level of complaint handling to army corps headquarters and the equivalent, increased manpower for the hotline service and expanded its information system deployment. From 2016 to November 2017, 4,543 complaints 
were received. Of these, the majority had to do with internal administrative matters, military-civilian 
complaints, or disciplinary issues. All were handled or resolved within the requisite deadline.
III.Gender Equality
In line with global social trends and developments in gender issues, the government has kept pace, adopting various policies to promote gender equality. In recent years the MND has taken steps to 
implement various gender equality initiatives.
In realizing gender equality and shaping values that support equal rights, the MND has promoted 
gender equality in the administration of operations, training, rights protection, and daily life. These active measures include the educational television show Armed Forces Juguang Park, discussion events 
on gender issues, and various courses on awareness of gender equality, with the aim of eliminating 
gender-based verbal violence, sex discrimination, and gender-based stereotypes. These efforts help establish proper ways of interacting, for the creation of a work environment that fosters mutual cooperation, respect and acceptance and is friendly.
There has been a gradual increase in recruitment of women in the military since the 1990s, and the 
system of military service has transformed in kind. Women were allowed to become enlisted members in 2007. In recent years, measures have been adopted to enable women to balance career and family and reduce disparities in treatment in the workplace, such as unpaid parental leave for raising children; 
and a 4-year amelioration plan has been adopted to verify the effectiveness of such measures in order 
to extend women’s opportunity for participation. Since 2013, the Army has opened armored branch specialization courses to female service members, and women have been gradually deployed to 
armored units. In the Navy, since 2014, changes and alterations have been progressively made on board 
navy vessels to improve work and living spaces, increasing opportunities for women to serve on navy vessels. In addition, in the Air Force since 2016, excellent female pilots have been trained for first-line fighter aircraft conversion.
Part 4 National
Defense Governance
145Section 7 Active Utilization of Land
In line with national policies on land revitalization and due to military downsizing and 
organizational readjustments, a policy of joint resource use by all three military branches was 
adopted after a comprehensive overview of forward planning for the sustainable use of camp properties. The policy enhances land use efficiency, promotes reciprocity and mutual benefit. The MND also carries out review of disused camp properties when appropriate for land revitalization.
I .   The Culture of Military Dependents’ Villages and Their Conservation
(1) Enacting Cultural Preservation
Military Dependents’ Villages, which housed service members and their dependents 
that moved to Taiwan, represent a microcosm of life in Taiwan in the second half of 
the 20th century, and are an important part of our cultural heritage. Preservation of the 
culture of these villages is visible evidence of the country’s development. In accordance 
with the Act for Rebuilding Old Dependents' Village  and Regulations Governing the 
Selection and Review of old Dependents' Village of the ROC Armed Forces for Cultural 
Preservation, the MND has chosen Zhongxin New Village in Taipei and another 13 villages as military dependents’ villages cultural preservation areas. Furthermore, we 
have selected an additional 30 military dependents’ villages recognized as cultural assets 
and, by collaborating with local governments, revitalized or renovated them through 
urban planning changes and urban renewal measures so as to preserve their cultural legacy and mold a new military dependents’ village spirit.
(2) Land Revitalization for Military Dependents’ Village
To actively address the difficulty of disposing of large plots of Military Dependents’ Village land through open tenders, the proposal for revitalization of 174 locations (i.e. Military Dependents’ Village land) has been approved and the total assessed value 
amounts to NT$88.4 billion. Between January 1, 2017 and November of this year, 
disposal of Military Dependents’ Village land brought a total of NT$86,023 million in 
income, including sale of the old military dependents
, villages through open tenders, 
local governments’ installment payment of consideration and royalties for creation of 
superficies.146Era of the old Military

147II .  Management and Utilization of Military Properties
(1) Releasing Disused Land
National security is a priority concern of the MND’s management and utilization of 
its military properties, which first consider the needs of military training for service 
personnel. To facilitate the management of military land disposal, comply with government social housing policies, and assist local government in acquisition of land, 
the MND regularly convenes a Military Properties Movement and Release Review 
Meeting for gradual release of idle military properties over the coming years. The aim is achieving a balance between military land utilization and the government’s overall 
administrative needs and economic development for effective utilization of governmental 148assets. As of November of 2017, more than 2,331 hectares had been released with the 
MND’s consent.
(2)  Promoting Local Development
To balance the needs of local environmental green areas and expedite disaster relief operations, a review was carried out of land not in use for military training operations, making a provisional determination of land that could be granted to local government 
for green spaces, leisure, or settlement of disaster victims, without impacting defense 
needs. As of November 2017, 65 such plots of military land, totaling over 68 hectares, 
were lent. The MND has carried out another review of properties with a high potential 
value, and letters of intent were signed jointly with local government. A plan was created to transform the Yongchun Slope Camp, located in Taipei’s Xinyi district, 
into an urban wetland park, the first of its kind, combining conservation, culture and 
history, and sustainable development. New developments in urban planning and floor area adjustment are expected to increase its land-use efficiency. In the future, financial 
resources can be transferred to the ROC Armed Forces Camp and Facility Rebuilding 
Fund to meet the needs of construction funding for old camps. As of November 2017, a total of 164 military properties, or more than 330 hectares of land, had been reviewed 
and disposed of, generating over NT$77.7 billion of revenue for the Fund. This has 
created a win-win situation for multiple parties by contributing to the domestic economy 
and stimulating prosperity at the local level.
Part 4 National

149Section 8 National Defense Legal System
“Administration by Law” is the basis of national defense administration. The military must 
abide by legal statute when engaging in its various missions and operations. The MND 
has, in recent years, issued Rules of Engagement of the Armed Forces , and has drafted Regulations 
on Reinvigoration of Defense Industries . We have consulted legal precedent in advanced nations 
to plan specific stipulations protecting service members to safeguard their legal rights. In addition, 
authorities in the judiciary have set up a civil-military judiciary liaison mechanism to put an end 
to illicit drug use among service members, effectively fighting crime.
I .   Rules of Engagement
To ensure that military operations comply with national policies, international law, and domestic 
regulations, and to strengthen the foundation for joint military cooperation with allies, the MND 
issued Rules of Engagement of the Armed Forces  in 2017. This gives commanders the authority to 
execute operations “according to law, suitably, and legitimately,” ensuring that military actions are in 
the national interest and comply with relevant laws and statues. It also empowers them to promptly adopt contingency responses when dealing with regional security threats.
II.  Defense Industry Regulations
The national defense policy of self-reliance emphasizes integrating government and civilian resources, and is supported by defense industry development, domestic R&D, and production of 
weapons systems. The MND has drafted Regulations on Reinvigoration of Defense Industries to 
give a legal basis for defense industry development with the aim of increasing its effectiveness. The 
national policy objective is “to use the national economy to develop defense, and use defense to spur the economy.”
III.Specific Protection Act for Service Members
According to Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 430 , service members’ task is to fight, and they are to 
follow orders. For this reason, they may not be regarded the same as civilian officers. In a broader 
sense, however, the service member is a type of civilian personnel, and their occupation has a legal 
connection to the public law. Service members do not differ from other public servants except in relation to the military’s right to issue commands and exercise reasonable rewards and punishments.
To improve the system by which military personnel obtain legal redress, the MND has considered 
the interpretation of the Justices of the Constitutional Court of the Judicial Yuan with respect to 
the laws guaranteeing the legal protection of civil servants and related regulations, and is pushing regulations governing protection of the right interests of military personnel. The legislation will 150guarantee the rights and interests that service members enjoy, and stipulates that human rights within 
the military must be protected. This makes for a sound national defense legal system.
IV . Judicial Contact Mechanisms
After revising the  Code of Court Martial Procedures, legal cases involving active service members 
are submitted to the regular judicial system. In order to allow the regular judicial system to recognize 
the unique nature of military service and management, the MND has established exchange between 
our judge advocates and judicial officials to share military law case-handling experiences. To align with national drug enforcement policy and reinforce drug search and seizure operations within the military, a mechanism has been established by the Ministry of Justice and the National Police 
Agency to link investigation reports and search-and-seizure actions. Drug interdiction is executed 
across departments, targeting the drug selling networks infiltrating or supplying the military with illegal drugs. To root them out, service-wide search and seizure is carried out, regularly and randomly, which effectively combats the threat of illegal drugs in the military.
Part 4 National
Defense Governance
151Intentionally Blank152Chapter 8 Partnerships
The MND furthers government policies by promoting international military exchange and 
cooperation. Through military affairs interaction, ties with friendly and allied nations are 
consolidated. The MND has also actively sought opportunities to expand strategic dialogue and cooperation in security matters with countries having common strategic interests, for maintenance of security across the Taiwan Strait and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
Section 1 Military Cooperation
Interaction and collaboration with allied countries in security matters yield dividends in knowledge 
in areas including advanced military technology, force buildup concepts, warfighting experience, and 
education and training. This serves as reference for the MND in formulating defense strategy and 
strengthening readiness and preparedness in force buildup and readiness.
I .  Taiwan and the United States
The basis of the bilateral relationship between Taiwan and the United States is the Taiwan 
Relations Act , under which the United States continues providing the ROC with the necessary 
defensive weapons systems to ensure that the ROC maintains sufficient defense capabilities. It also established channels for comprehensive military exchanges at all levels, including on-job training, exercise observations, overall capability assessment, and high-level talks and visits. There has been substantive progress made, both qualitatively and quantitatively, symbolizing the United States’ 
concrete support for Taiwan and commitment to its security and also demonstrating stable and solid 
friendship between the ROC and the US military.
(1) Foreign Military Sales (FMS)
Unlike conventional profit-driven commercial transactions, the FMS programs are 
“government to government” sales of weapons systems and technology services and a 
reflection of US foreign policy. FMS to Taiwan put the emphasis on security cooperation and maintaining regional security, and are one of the utmost priorities in the Taiwan-US relationship. After taking office in June 2017, US President Trump announced 7 items of military sales to Taiwan, including follow-up technical support for the Surveillance Radar Program (SRP); a demonstration of the United States’ concrete political 
commitment to support Taiwan and its security. Militarily, in addition to weapons 
acquisitions, Taiwan’s defense capabilities are practically enhanced through combat 
training, intelligence exchanges, and logistical maintenance extended from FMS.

(2) Military Exchanges
The MND engages in a variety of interactions to advance and promote joint military 
capabilities. These include policy exchanges, FMS project management, academic 
exchanges, intelligence exchanges, combat training exchanges, logistics exchanges, 
information communications and electronic warfare (EW) exchanges, armaments 
exchanges, defense assessments, and education and training.
(3)  US Congressional Support
Representatives friendly to Taiwan in the United States Senate and House of 
Representatives have always placed great importance on Taiwan’s defensive security 
and Taiwan-US security cooperation. Other than visiting Taiwan annually, they also 
propose articles and resolutions in favor of Taiwan, showing their steadfast support of the ROC during every review period for the next year’s  National Defense Authorization 
Act (NDAA). During periods of adjournment, the ROC Legislative Yuan’s foreign affairs 
and national defense committees also visit the United States to meet with congressmen 
and women and government officials. The strong support coming from both legislative 
sectors for ROC national defense continues to drive an ever-closer Taiwan-US cooperation relationship.155II.  Taiwan and Other Allies
In line with the needs of the government’s overall diplomatic work, the MND posts military attachés 
to carry out military diplomacy in Central America, the Caribbean, the South Pacific, and Africa 
under the direction of ambassadors to our diplomatic allies. Maintaining sound relations and strong 
military friendship with allied countries is facilitated through intelligence exchanges, education and training, high-level military mutual visits, military medicine, military observation programs, and foreign military training in Taiwan.
In addition, military representatives are deployed to friendly countries for promoting defense 
exchanges; meanwhile military officers, government officials, and scholars from those countries are also invited to come to Taiwan to engage in conferences or forums on national security, intelligence, diplomacy, and Mainland affairs. The MND also invited graduates of the National Development 
Course, sponsored by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, from diplomatic and friendly allies to 
participate in advanced courses, such as the National Development Course for Senior Officers and National Development Course for General/Flag Officers, in 2016 and 2017, respectively, to create platforms for high-level officer/official interaction, with the aim of facilitating international 
diplomatic and military exchanges. To date, 12 such courses have been held with 464 participants 
from 11 countries.156

157Military diplomacy forms one part of the nation’s overall diplomacy 
and is promoted through high-level interactions, security dialogues, 
and humanitarian medical assistance.Military Exchanges to Cement Friendships158Section 2 Think-Tank Exchanges
We have continued to strengthen exchanges with well-known international think-tanks through academic 
conferences, workshops, project collaboration, and sending research personnel to think-tanks for on-site 
training, to elaborate our national defense policy and expand the network of friendly connections.
I .   Reciprocal Exchanges
To allow major think-tanks in the world to speak out for Taiwan and garner recognition and support 
for its defense security stance, 3 visits by the MND were made to think-tanks in the US, Japan, 
and Europe to exchange views with scholars and experts on bilateral defense strategies, military 
thinking, and concepts in force buildup. In addition, through Track II Exchanges, opportunities were sought for bilateral military exchanges. In 2017, another 4 visits were paid to the United States, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Europe, respectively, to broaden the scope of exchanges and share the 
democratic values of the ROC as well as concepts of regional security cooperation in combination 
with our government’s New Southbound Policy, and build on existing foundations in think-tanks exchanges.
The MND invited 15 think-tanks scholars from 6 countries, namely, the United States, Japan, South 
Korea, India, Indonesia, and Singapore to participate in the Defense Forum on Regional Security 
and held discussions and view exchanges with regional countries on areas of shared interests; and held strategic forums together with think-tanks in the US with over 50 military officers and government officials attending from Taiwan. These addressed issues of national defense and 
security, with the aim of raising awareness of Taiwan’s external defense policy and gain better 
knowledge of regional political and security situations, cross-straits relations, and Taiwan-US security cooperation and other issues, to form reference points for further promoting of defense 
security cooperation and exchanges.
II.  National Defense Think-Tank
To meet challenges of the strategic environment and the requirements of government policy, the 
MND, referring to experiences of think-tanks in advanced countries such as the US and UK and 
opinions from scholars and experts, is setting up a National Institute for Defense Studies in May 
2018 in accordance with Directions for Administrative Supervision of Government-Donated 
Foundations stipulated by the Executive Yuan. The mission of the think-tank will be to provide 
professional reference and consultation for policy making, broaden defense-relevant academic 
exchanges and cooperation, and promote international strategic communications and dialogue. 
In the future, it will conduct in-depth research regarding politics and military affairs in support of effective strategic communications with other think-tanks with an independent, objective, farsighted, and global perspective in order to facilitate sound implementation of defense policy and force 
buildup.

159Section 3 International Linkages
Given Taiwan’s difficult diplomatic situation, the MND takes pragmatic approaches with a proactive 
attitude, utilizing soft power to acquire international linkages and show our international vision in a bid 
to further the best interests of our nation and continue contributing to the international community.
I .   Clean and Transparent Force Buildup
To align with the era of transparency, accountability, and clean government, the MND’s Ethics 
Office and the Office of the Inspector General work on the principles of “working in parallel 
with multiple supervision” and “coordination with functional integration,” to address the tasks of 
eliminating corruption and wrongdoing as well as maintaining order and discipline to maintain a clean and transparent image in military force buildup.
Transparency International, a non-governmental organization, is currently the only international 
organization specializing in fighting graft and corruption. Its 2015 Government Defense Anti-
Corruption Index (GDAI), with rankings from A through F, ranked the ROC Grade B for its low levels of graft and corruption. Sharing the same ranking with the US and Singapore among over a hundred countries evaluated indicates the MND’s effort towards clean government and transparency 
continues to gain recognition from the international community.

[2015 Government Defense Anti-Corruption Index]160II.  Midshipman Cruise Training
Midshipman cruise training to promote friendly relations is, among many others, a major task of the 
Armed Forces. The Navy dispatches a midshipman training squadron annually to visit our allies and 
friendly states as a means to acquaint cadets about to graduate with life at sea, provide professional 
training, as well as widen their international horizons. It also serves to validate the fleet’s long-distance operational capabilities, strengthen interstate alliances and friendship, and demonstrate solidarity with citizens living abroad. It is a concrete demonstration of how national defense and 
diplomacy work together.
(1) Midshipman Home Training Round the Island
Home training is designed to inure students to maritime life and teach them seamanship, 
strengthening their fitness for duty. The training combines academic theory and practical 
experience to increase their vocational capabilities, to eventually qualify them as naval 
officers after graduation for immediate deployment to the fleet. During the home training in Taiwan, and as part of student recruitment drives, the vessels are open to public tours. 
The general public is invited, together with foreign officials stationed in Taiwan, where 
they can see firsthand the results of force buildup and readiness. An onboard outreach exhibition displays specialized items in the realms of technology, the arts, and cultural 
and creative products, showcasing the military’s own achievements, so citizens are able 
to understand the ROC’s determination to achieve self-reliant national defense and the 
concept of all-out defense, and therefore support the government's national defense 
policy.
(2) Midshipman Cruise Training Abroad
Most of the task forces sent abroad for midshipman training go to allied countries, 
where there are courtesy calls with senior officials and various patriotic and goodwill 
events held such as flag-raising ceremonies, vessel open-house exhibitions, outreach exhibitions, honor guard performances, military aid, and dinner functions. These events 
strengthen the sense of identification with the ROC of overseas compatriots and fortify 
their patriotism, deepening relationships with allies and manifesting the effectiveness of military diplomacy while establishing interaction models that deepen military exchanges 
substantively.
III.Humanitarian Assistance
To improve humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) capabilities in the Asia-Pacific 
region, county and municipal governments hold Ming-An (public safety) exercises, inviting 
disaster prevention specialists and NGOs from allied countries to observe. Disaster prevention 
and relief units from the ROC share their knowledge and experience in humanitarian assistance operating mechanisms and promote international cooperation for disaster relief. Also, during the annual International Conference on Military Education, a forum on HA/DR was held to expound to 
other countries the ROC’s disaster relief system, capabilities of the military for rescue operations, 
Part 4 National
Defense Governance
161and experience overseas with humanitarian assistance with the aims of increasing international 
recognition and promoting further military exchanges and cooperation.
(1) Improving Overall Humanitarian Assistance Capabilities
To respond to the national policy on humanitarian assistance, general preparations are 
actively made in sea and air transport mission capabilities, so that whenever a disaster happens abroad, assistance can be promptly dispatched in the form of rescue personnel 
and supplies. Through mutual cooperation with various countries based on military 
diplomacy and drawing on new knowledge in advanced military medical technology, exchanges of medical expertise and skills training, rescue capabilities are enhanced, and 
opportunities for cooperation in medical assistance are broadened.
(2) Broadening International Humanitarian Assistance Exchanges
The ROC has publicly demonstrated its experience in carrying out humanitarian 
assistance and disaster relief through its participation in courses and programs on 
international humanitarianism and observing disaster relief drills in allied countries. This 
has also shown its strong political will to become both an international humanitarian 
assistance provider and regional peace facilitator and further promote exchanges and 
cooperation with neighboring countries. The ROC’s visibility in the international community has thus been enhanced.
Allies and countries in the Asia-Pacific region, together with international non-
governmental aid organizations are invited to Taiwan to observe disaster relief exercises, 
participate in international military education conferences, and visit the ROC’s 
emergency, fire, and search-and-rescue units in a bid to demonstrate the ROC’s overall 
capabilities in disaster relief, share experiences and learn from each other, and promote multilateral joint disaster relief exercises, with the goal of eventually establishing a 
cooperative mechanism for international humanitarian assistance.162

IV . Cooperation in Anti-Terrorism
The anti-terrorism capabilities of the special forces of the ROC Armed Forces have been improved 
by absorbing real combat experiences through anti-terrorism training provided by partners and 
friendly nations. Training facilities have been established, such as the “Limited-space Combat 
Shooting Range,” “Virtual Environment Classrooms,” and an “Anti-Terrorism Training Center.” Combat scenarios for anti-terrorism training are simulated based on real objects, situations and operations, improving the effectiveness of special forces. Furthermore, personnel also participate 
in international conferences on subjects such as anti-terrorism or anti-piracy, where practical 
experience is shared, which helps enhance the special operations capability in the area of anti-terrorism.164
165
According to the responsibility to defend the country and protect the people given by the Constitution , 
the Armed Forces have written a glorious and heroic history with lives and blood, in doing so 
laying down the foundation for the ROC to freely develop and consolidating peace across the Taiwan 
Strait. Inheriting this glorious history, today’s Armed Forces actively promote force buildup and combat readiness, and guided by the spirit of “military-civilian as one,” implement all-out defense and operations 
to protect the people. Also, to stimulate the sense of honor and mission of service personnel and fully 
bring into play the effectiveness of national defense human resources, we have continued to refine talent 
training and military education and actively promoted guidance and care for retired or discharged military 
personnel, so that service personnel can quickly adapt to civilian life after leaving the military and thus continue to contribute to society.
Part 5 The Honor of the Armed Forces 166Chapter 9 The Military and People United 
as One
Modern national defense requires the support and cooperation of all the people to be able to 
achieve the greatest strength. To put the idea of all-out defense into practice, the Armed 
Forces continue to enhance all-out defense education and military-civilian interaction, as well as hold base open days and Armed Forces history exhibitions, with the aim of forming a national consensus on all-out defense. Facing the ever-increasing threat from non-traditional security 
threats, guided by the belief “suffer what the people suffer”, the Armed Forces are always quickly 
on the scene when disaster strikes, caring for and assisting the people, effectively calming popular 
sentiment and stabilizing social order.
Section 1 All-out Defense
Article 3 of the National Defense Act  stipulates that the national defense of the ROC is “all-out defense.” 
In accordance with the All-out Defense Education Act , the MND actively holds various events to 
increase military-civilian interaction and, through Facebook, interacts with the public and collects 
suggestions about military affairs from the people. At present, the Military Spokesman Facebook page has over 300,000 fans. The MND has invited loyal fans of this Facebook page to take part in national defense to put the idea of all-out defense into practice.
I .   All-out Defense Education
Since the All-out Defense Education Act  came into effect in February 2005, the MND has actively 
integrated the resources of various ministries, local government, schools and society for “school 
education”, “social education”, “on-the-job training at governmental agencies (institutions)” and 
“protection, promotion, and education of national defense relics”. Through classes, academic discussions and sorting and re-using of national defense artifacts, holding diverse events and designing innovative promotional materials, the MND has propagated five educational themes, 
namely, international situation, national defense policy, all-out defense, defense mobilization and 
defense technology, in order to plant the belief of all-out defense deeply in people’s minds and arouse the public’s national defense awareness.
(1) Diverse Activities to Cultivate School Education
The Ministry of Education (MOE) is the competent authority for all-out defense school 
education. As well as holding various educational courses and events in line with the MOE’s annual planning, the MND also proactively holds various events to strengthen 
the understanding of and support for national defense affairs of youth.
1. Going onto campus: an exchange channel between students and military schools and 
forces is provided, and a variety of on-campus activities that involve all-out defense

To implement the Guidelines for the Implementation of All-out Defense Education by 
Government Agencies (Institutions) , the MND accepts applications from central government 
Through opening of bases, Spratly Islands study camps, utilizing national defense artifacts, and 
holding a variety of activities, the MND has increased the public’s understanding of and support for national defense affairs, arousing patriotic consciousness and allowing the idea of all-out 
defense to take root in people’s minds.1

Yuan’s e-learning website (https://elearn.hrd.gov.tw/mooc/index.php), an All-out Defense Education Workshop has been established to deepen the public’s understanding of the idea 
of all-out defense.
(3) Promoting National Defense Understanding
The MND held 6 base-opening events, including one at the ROC Military Academy, with over 550,000 visitors received. Also, an all-out defense online quiz with prizes for 
the right answers was held, attracting over 1.4 million participants, and eligibility for the Armed Forces Literature and Arts Gold Award was also expanded to members of the 
public, with the aim of planting the idea of all-out defense deeply in people’ s minds.
(4) Promoting Historic Sites
To promote the protection of national defense artifacts, in line the government’s tourism 
policy and in coordination with local governments, the MND provides spots that 
have national defense artifact preservation value for inclusion in travel planning. The 
“Introducing National Defense Relics and Military Sites in Various Counties and Cities” 
film series has been posted on the All-out Defense Education website, which also provides 
local tourist information.
(5) Rewarding Outstanding Contribution
In accordance with the regulations of the All-out Defense Education Act , the all-out 
defense education execution results of city/county governments are evaluated and units with outstanding performance are rewarded. Also, the All-out Defense Education Outstanding Contribution Award is given to commend various quarters for all-out defense 
education excellence. 
II.  Military-civilian Interaction
The relationship between the military and civilians is vital for the promotion of readiness 
training and affects the force buildup and comprehensive military power of the Armed Forces. 
To promote military-civilian interaction, the Armed Forces have established channels for 
communication and negotiation with local government and elected bodies and integrated local resources to implement a military-civilian interaction mechanism that is dedicated to 
executing related civil activities, promoting community relations work, caring for the socially 
disadvantaged and fulfilling social responsibility. The overall aim is to present the image of the 
Armed Forces serving society and caring for the people.
In the new digital era, the Armed Forces keep abreast of online information at all times and take 
appropriate action, communicating with the media to give the public a correct understanding

173of the facts. Reports on positive issues such as service personnel being “good people who do 
good deeds”, disaster prevention and relief and readiness training are issued at suitable times to 
expand the propaganda front and win the public’s support and trust. Also, the media is guided 
to produce positive reports through holding press conferences, media visits, online communities and other dissemination channels.
The MND produces Armed Forces image promotion advertisements and mini films. 
Performances by the Tri-Service Honor Guards and displays of combat capability by readiness 
forces at national ceremonies, sports competitions, battle commemoration events and other 
suitable occasions show the military’s strong capability.
III.Improving the Image of the Armed Forces
The basic values of military service personnel are defending the country and protecting the people. The people expect service personnel to charge and break through enemy lines and 
defeat the enemy in the event of war, therefore service personnel formative education places 
special emphasis on obedience and sacrifice. The core beliefs of military personnel are “country, duty, and honor”. When the country is in difficulty, the ROC military will not hesitate, even if it 
means injury or death.
Looking at the war history of the Armed Forces, numerous martyrs gave themselves selflessly to 
the country. “Heroes, facing increasing world tension, gathered together during turbulent times 
and sworn to give their lives for their country” is the best explanation of the “soldier’s soul.”  From the moment of joining the Armed Forces, soldiers have to be prepared to go into battle in 
service of the country. The words inscribed over the entrance to the ROC Military Academy “If 
you are afraid of death, do not enter, if you desire promotion and wealth, pick another career” are not just words of encouragement, they also reflect the danger of death that being a soldier 
involves. 
Through the 6 direct presidential elections and 3 changes in ruling party the ROC has seen, 
the Armed Forces have always faithfully fulfilled the role bestowed by the Constitution, 
maintaining neutrality and becoming the guardian of democratic transformation. In the 21
st 
century, in addition to the traditional fitness requirements, soldiers must possess new skill sets to cope with the development of technology and new forms of warfare. Different specialisms 
such as cyber-attack-defense, system integration, medical healthcare, intelligence analysis and strategic communication mean that the Armed Forces now have a new look, characterized by a 
diversity of talent.
As well as diligently patrolling sea and sky and protecting the homeland, the Armed Forces 
make every effort in the area of participation in disaster rescue. Taiwan is located in a high-
risk area for natural disasters. The Armed Forces always rush to disaster areas to help. The image of the military suffering what the people suffer, caring for and helping people has been 
deeply embedded in the public consciousness after earthquakes, typhoons and floods on many 
occasions.
The occupation of the soldier is characterized by limited freedom, high-risk, 24-hour a day 174standby and absence from home. Complaint, understanding and acceptance sum up the mental 
journey that almost all military families undergo.
The Armed Forces are a microcosm of society, made up of people from all different walks of life, 
making it difficult to avoid mistakes. We expect high standards to be met by military personnel and accept encouragement and suggestions from all quarters. When problems are encountered, 
they should be faced up to honestly and corrected. However, exaggeratedly negative reporting 
often has a detrimental effect on morale. We hope that a mature, rational society can give service 
personnel the respect they deserve and, by doing so, raise military morale and attract outstanding 
talent to join the Armed Forces.
The honor of the Armed Forces is not only the duty of officers and other ranks, but also requires 
the support of all citizens from the heart. The performance of the military and the encouragement 
of society complement each other, and both are indispensable. With harmonious military-civilian relations, when the country is in need the military will be even more willing to give their all for 
the people without hesitation.
IV . Promoting Armed Forces History
To pass on and commend the glorious past deeds of the Armed Forces in defending the country 
and protecting the people and increase the military literacy of officers and other ranks, the 
MND continues to compile historical collections and translate foreign military publications. To 
commemorate the arduous process of Armed Forces force buildup and the development of each force, special exhibitions are staged at the Armed Force Museum combined with promotion of 
national defense policies and ideas. Also, to highlight the contribution of the military in terms of 
“safeguarding our nation and people” and display the past deeds of the ROC Armed Forces in 
resisting foreign aggression, it is planned to build the national military museum at Dazhi District 
of Taipei City. The museum will properly preserve, study and exhibit Armed Forces historical relics and documents and, by doing so, carry out the mission of all-out defense education.

used to show the Air Force’s historical evolution and mission, promote its history and sustainably pass on the Jianqiao spirit.
(3) Planning of the National Military Museum
The aim of establishing the museum is to promote soldiers’ martial ethics and all-out defense. Combining history, military, science, education, culture and art thinking, the 
museum’s core values will be “passing on history, promoting martial ethics, molding the 
military soul, sustainable operation” and it will effectively bring into play the display, education, collection and research functions of a modern military museum. In 2016, the 
display design requirement planning case was handled, an important basis for the design 
stage. In 2017, entrusted planning and design and supervision tender operations were 
completed, and detailed design is now being undertaken. In the future, the national military 
museum will continue to collect and sort historical relics and documents with collection value, refine the design of processes and facilities and complete construction and operation 
planning to allow construction preparation work to be carried out on time, to the required 
quality and within budget.

Section 2  Operations to Protect Citizens
To protect the lives and property of citizens and national maritime rights and interests, the Armed 
Forces continue to enhance their capabilities in disaster prevention and relief, counter-terrorism support, 
emergency rescue, cloud seeding and medical service, and protect our fishery rights and the security of 
SLOCs in close cooperation with the Coast Guard.
I .  Disaster Prevention and Relief
Taiwan is exposed to typhoons, torrential rain, earthquakes, gas explosions, swine flu and other threats. In line with their statutory responsibility to assist with disaster prevention and relief, the 
Armed Forces, in support of local governments, carry out disaster prevention and relief missions. In 
peacetime, the military keeps abreast of high-risk areas and availability of disaster rescue resources. When there is a disaster warning, various disaster prevention efforts are put in place following the principle of “forward deployment, force pre-positioning, and timely disaster prevention and 
relief” and the spirit of “disaster relief is warfare.” When a disaster happens without warning, the 
MND commands all forces to support the local government, rapidly getting involved in the rescue effort and showing the effectiveness of the Armed Forces and ability to carry out disaster relief in peacetime and fight in wartime.
(1) Disaster Relief Force Preparedness
The Armed Forces deploy forces and equipment to places susceptible to mud/landslides 
or flooding 24 hours before a typhoon strikes. A total of 2,300 personnel are deployed to 
121 locations, with 23 in northern Taiwan, 23 in central Taiwan, 45 in southern Taiwan 
and 30 in eastern Taiwan, while over 33,000 troops stand fast in each theater.
(2) Medical Team Preparedness
Military hospitals throughout the country and medical corps have organized 154 medical 
teams for peacetime preparedness, numbering 512 service personnel, and completed 
preparations of relevant supplies in order to increase emergency rescue capability in relief events. When a disaster strikes, they are able to enter the disaster area immediately, 
providing medical assistance to victims and arranging evacuation.
(3) Mental Counseling in Relief Ef forts
The Armed Forces have a total of 214 mental health centers at all levels. In the event of 
a major disaster, each theater can immediately integrate all local mental counselors and 
establish a Major Disaster Mental Health Center. Together with civic social welfare and 
charity groups, mental counseling and care are provided to service personnel conducting relief efforts and people affected by the disaster.185(4) Disaster Relief Resources Preparedness 
In peacetime, the Armed Forces have a total 1,700 pieces of relief equipment for 
preparedness, including 2,000 wheeled vehicles, 240 armored vehicles, 30 aircraft, 80 
inflatable boats, along with light and heavy construction and search and rescue machines 
and tools, such as multi-function combat engineering vehicles, excavators, shovel loaders, life detectors and others available for relief efforts when needed. In the event 
of a major disaster, this equipment can be immediately employed for rescue work. In 
addition, in response to ordinary or compound disasters, each theater has shelters able to

Whenever a disaster strikes, the Armed Forces immediately join in the 
relief effort regardless of the hardship, and are always present where 
people need them the most; the impression of the military protecting 
and helping them is deeply imprinted in people’s minds.To Share the Suffering of People, Protect 
and Help Them

people affected when a request is made by the city/county government.
(5) Instructors T raining for Disaster Prevention and Relief  
Officers, NCOs, and the enlisted with experience in disaster prevention and relief are 
selected for the Armed Forces Instructor Comprehensive Training Course for Large-
scale Disasters at the National Fire Agency Training Center in Zhushan, Nantou County to hone the disaster prevention and relief skills of the Armed Forces as a whole. From 
2010 through 2016, 1,568 service personnel completed this course, with another 120 
completing the course in 2017.
(6) Disaster Prevention and Relief Exercises
In 2016 and 2017, 22 city and county governments jointly held disaster prevention and relief exercises prior to the flood season, combining all-out defense mobilization exercises in accordance with the Executive Yuan’s planning. The Armed Forces 
dispatched over 4,000 service personnel, 10 helicopters and over 1,600 vehicles to 
take part in the exercises to enhance tacit understanding between the military and local government in the area of disaster prevention and relief. Also, the MND supported 
the Nuclear Safety Drills No. 22 and 23 organized by the Atomic Energy Council of 
the Executive Yuan. In the scenario of compound disasters and threats caused by an earthquake-triggered nuclear incident, over 19,000 people were involved including 
specialized military personnel, police, fire departments, medical and government agency 
teams, members of the public and students. Through war games and field exercises, the

(7) Assisting with Disaster Prevention and Relief
Under the direction of the Central Emergency Operation Center of the Executive 
Yuan, the MND, in coordination with all emergency response mechanisms in place, 
simultaneously sets up emergency operation centers at all levels that operate 24 hours a 
day, so that manpower, transportation, equipment, and other resources can be effectively utilized in response to different natural disasters and protect the lives and property of 
the people. From 2016 through November 2017, the Armed Forces engaged in 13 major 
relief missions, i.e., cold damage, the February-6
th Tainan earthquake, avian flu outbreak, 
the June-1st and June-13th floods, typhoons Nepartak, Meranti, Malakas, Megi, Nesat and 
Haitang, Hato, and Talim; and 86 mountain and sea evacuations and emergency rescues 
were carried out. The Armed Forces were able to effectively deal with the aftermath 
of natural disasters and complete their tasks, reducing loss of life and property and significantly mitigating the impact of disasters.
[Statistics of the Armed Forces Conducting Disaster Prevention 
and Relief Efforts in 2016 and 2017]190II . Counter Terrorism Support
Following the National Security Council’s and Executive Yuan’s policy guidance of “taking 
terrorism seriously and responding cautiously, remaining alert even in peacetime and preparing 
ourselves with a low profile,” the nation is strengthening counter-terrorism response capability and 
enhancing early warning and contingency handling mechanisms for political and economic critical infrastructure and military base protection to ensure overall national security.
In line with our capabilities and nature of terrorist attacks, Armed Forces counter-terrorism units 
such as special service companies from the Military Police, Marine Corps, and Army stand fast 
for anti-kidnapping, anti-sabotage, anti-hijacking, and other missions in all areas nationwide. Also, domestic terrorist attack scenarios are designed in accordance with observed patterns of transnational terrorism, and corresponding response mechanism and reinforcement preparedness 
are gradually improved; in compliance with the government’s overall counter terrorism policy 
and building on existing counter-terrorism combat capability, intelligence exchanges, equipment preparations, specialized training and other concrete actions shall continue to be enhanced to form strong counter-terrorism capabilities and ensure overall national security.
The 2017 Taipei Universiade was the highest level and largest scale international sporting event held 
in the ROC’s history, with over 10,000 athletes and team staff from 131 countries and regions taking part. To ensure the games went smoothly, the government committed related resources to security 
work. During the Universiade period, nearly 1,000 men and women in uniform from the 3
rd TO, the 
Military Police Command, and other units were also engaged in support of security operations.
They were mainly responsible for perimeter security and assisted with maintaining security during 
the opening and closing ceremonies. To maintain games security, the entire security team also 
utilized various types of high-tech equipment, including the NCSIST-provided IED radio frequency interference system that can detect and jam roadside bombs, and an interception system that 
can prevent drone attacks. Various Armed Forces units collaborated to accomplish their security 
missions during the Universiade.
III.Backing up Fisheries Protection
Following the government policy of Navy escorts the Coast Guard (CG) as CG provides protection to our legal fishery practices, the Armed Forces, in coordination with the CG, conduct regular joint 
fisheries protection missions in the ROC’s exclusive economic zone, using various Navy and Air 
Force assets to show the government’s ability and determination to protect fishing rights and assert sovereignty.
(1) W ith an understanding of the areas where fishing boats congregate during high fishing 
seasons in waters around Taiwan and in coordination with the CG’s fishery protection 
force, the military deploys its vessels in an adaptive manner to allow routine fishery 
protection patrols to be conducted.
(2) Communications mechanisms, information sharing, joint exercises on fisheries 
protection, and regular exchanges and interactions between the military and CG are held 
to increase tacit understanding as the two sides fulfill their duties.
Part 5 The Honor of
 the Armed Forces
191(3) Overall, combat air patrols were conducted with more than 2,220 sorties, along with 1,820 
maritime patrols by Navy vessels from 2016 to November 2017. Together, the Air Force 
and Navy also engaged in joint ISR missions and combat readiness drills other than 
routine joint fisheries protection missions with the CG.
(4)In August and November 2016 and March 2017, the Armed Forces assisted the CG in 
carrying out drills, i.e., Lian An Fisheries Protection, Nan Yuan No. 1 and Hai An No. 9 in southern Taiwan, Taiping Island (in the Spratly Islands) and Taiwan’s northern waters, respectively. The exercises displayed the government’s determination and efforts 
with regard to protecting the ROC’s maritime rights, humanitarian assistance, counter 
terrorism and fisheries protection.
IV . Cloud Seeding
Taiwan’s main rainfall comes in the rain period during spring, monsoon season, and typhoon season. 
With the idea of “share the suffering of people” deep in mind, the Armed Forces, in cooperation with 
the Water Resources Agency (WRA) of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), carry out cloud 
seeding missions whenever a drought hits. Overall, 15 sorties (including rehearsals), 299 service personnel and 90 vehicles in different types were involved in the missions from 2016 to November 2017; the MND accomplished the mission bestowed by the Disaster Response Team within WRA 
each time and will continue to make such efforts to help ease droughts.
V .  Emergency Lift
When private transportation operators are overwhelmed in workload due to bad weather or 
major national holidays, the Armed Forces, in coordination with the Ministry of Transport and 
Communications and under the precondition that regular missions are unaffected, will dispatch 
military aircraft to help lift people from outlying islands. Over 5,000 people were lifted by 100 C-130 transport flights from 2016 to November 2017 and returned home in a timely way, which once again demonstrated the exemplary Armed Forces tradition of protecting and helping the people.
VI. Medical Service
The Armed Forces medical system can be divided into “base health services” and “regional medical care” and operates under the principle of “getting treatment in proximity before medical evacuation 
if necessary.”  Base health services promote prevention work, such as vaccination and other health 
care, and also carry out heat injury prevention, smoking hazard and betel nut prevention education, urine screening and self-and mutual rescue training, as well as removal of and education on infectious disease breeding sources in coordination with the government efforts.
In regional medical care, each TO is assigned with a medical area of responsibility and has its 
own Armed Forces hospitals and medical centers that are responsible for providing outpatient, emergency and inpatient medical services to active members. Those hospitals also provide 
citizens with the same services in line with national medical care policy .192
192Disaster relief efforts
Cloud seeding
Emergency lift for outlying 
islandMedical evacuation193(1) Integrated Emergency Rescue Network
To allow an effective response in an emergency medical situation, we are actively 
nurturing emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to increase the capacity of company-
level personnel in emergency treatment before quick evacuation in order to enable the personnel injured during operations to quickly receive proper treatment before moving 
to nearby hospitals. This serves as a means to effectively support the regional medical 
responsibility system.
The Health Services Training Center of the National Defense Medical Center together 
with Armed Forces hospitals organizes EMT training and advanced courses in different 
areas. As of October, 2017, the number of qualified EMT totaled over 10,000, among which 237 are EMT-P (paramedic). The MND has signed MOU with the fire departments 
in five major cities and counties, based on locations of the Armed Forces hospitals, to 
The Armed Forces assist with disaster prevention and relief efforts, cloud seeding, medical 
evacuation and other operations, as well as work together with the CG to carry out regular fisheries protection missions as a way to show the effectiveness of the Armed Forces and the 
ability to carry out disaster relief in peacetime and fight in wartime.1

45194build an across-the-board cooperation platform and provide proper medical treatment to 
sick or injured active members and civilians alike.
Facing all kinds of compound disasters, the MND follows the policy guidance of “disaster 
relief equates with fighting a war,” and “avoidance, then prevention, then relief efforts,” assisting local governments with disaster prevention and relief efforts in incidents, 
such as the Kaohsiung gas explosion, TransAsia Air plane crash, Formosan Water Park 
explosion, and the February 6
th Tainan earthquake, where our members were in the 
frontline of the rescue and relief effort.
(2) Improving the Quality of Medical Service
Armed Forces hospitals hold mass casualty handling drills aligning with the time of the major annual military exercises and are continuing to refine their management 
and quality of service. A medical information platform has also been built to achieve 
the objectives of automatic administration, digital management, and business-running model. In the meantime, the quality of medical care for active members stationed on 
outlying islands should continue to be improved by, for instance, improving emergency 
medevac operations and making the best use of remote medical services.
In response to the development of e-commerce and promotion of smart medicine and 
integration of mobile technology, the MND and the National Credit Card Center together 
formed a strategic alliance to actively build a credit card and Easy Card payment system for Armed Forces hospitals; it formally started operating on July 1, 2017, making the 
Armed Forces hospitals the first state-run organizations to provide such a service. 
Furthermore, driven by the desire to serve the public, military hospitals received both quality certification and awards from government agencies and civic units, e.g., Ministry 
of Health and Welfare Health Promoting Hospital Creative Plan Competition Merit 
Prize, National Biotechnology and Medical Quality Award, Symbol of National Quality (SNQ), 13
th National Innovation Award, 14th Global Views Five-Star Service Awards-
First Prize, Hospital Category, hence reinforcing the positive image of the professional 
work done by the medical personnel of the Armed Forces.
Part 5 The Honor of
 the Armed Forces
195Intentionally Blank196Chapter 10 Talent Succession
With the aim of bringing the effectiveness of national defense manpower fully into play, 
through overall planning, the MND has built a sound military education and national 
defense civilian personnel nurturing system, to mold excellent manpower and nurture leadership, force buildup and readiness preparation and national defense affairs talent. The Armed Forces do not just provide a stage to allow talented people to bring into play their skills in service of the 
country, at the same time they bring together the elite in various fields. They also provide various 
consulting services and related information to allow service personnel to seamlessly find civilian 
employment that utilizes their skills after they leave the military, so they continue to contribute 
their skills to society.
Section 1 Talent Nurturing
With the aim of achieving “education for purpose,” every level of education from basic, further to advanced etc. has been strengthened and the national defense civilian personnel system made 
complete. As well as promoting exchange between military and civilian academic institutions, 
long-term retention of military personnel is also actively planned to ensure that trained personnel continue to bring their expertise into play.

At the various military academies, design and planning of basic training, military style life management, mentor system, winter and summer vacation training and combat force 
internship give students soldierly demeanor, physical fitness, good character and the ability to 
think clearly. The aim is to allow the cadets to quickly align with force practice after they are commissioned as officers.
(1) In concert with the diversified admission and physical fitness policies of the Ministry of 
Education (MOE), coupled with the basic physical fitness requirements of the Armed Forces, we have added a physical fitness test to the cadet admission requirements. By so 
doing, only individuals with good physique and fitness can be admitted to our military 
academies.
(2) Military academy cadets are sent for branch internship in summer vacation. According 
to their branch, they go to take part in practical training to refine the results of military training, allowing them to become acquainted with the force operating situation early on 
so that cadets can fulfil the duties of low level cadres after graduation.
(3) Our 2-year Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) Program focuses on imparting 
occupational skills and acquiring certificates. It is hoped that all graduating NCO cadets can be awarded with an occupational certificate and a degree diploma before being 
commissioned so as to improve their technical competencies.

197II.  Advanced Education
Further education for Armed Forces officers is divided into 2 levels: command and staff level 
and strategy level to achieve the objective of “training to use, using to train, training and 
using, integration of selection, training and use”. In line with the personnel requirements of 
each unit, talent that has development potential and command and general staff and national defense management competency is nurtured step by step and continually. As well as the core 
courses for each service and specialized job type, personnel and course cross training is also 
carried out to enhance the grasp of the concept of joint operations. Advanced education for 
NCOs is based on related theory courses of the NCO Advanced Course with equal emphasis on advanced leadership and management, the aim being to allow senior NCOs to be able to 
effectively assist commanding officers to lead and manage subordinates.
III.Overseas-based Personnel Management
Talent with international basic and advanced education, master’s or PhD degrees and overseas work experience are cultivated for the command system; they gain necessary command 
experience under the arrangement of the MND; most of them have to work as HQ staff, 
armament R&D personnel and school education and research institution faculty. Some personnel with outstanding performance are selected to receive training at overseas think-
tanks and strategic forums. These efforts are designed to nurture a varied pool of talent for 
national defense.

closer ties with scholars in friendly academic circles. In future, cooperative relations 
with leading think tanks in various countries will continue to be developed to expand the nurturing of military affairs research talent.
V . Exchanges Between Military and Civilian Educational Institutions
The MND has been expanding academic exchange between foreign and domestic civilian universities and our service academies and National Defense University to instill in our 
cadets more innovative and flexible thinking through studying together and absorbing diverse 
concepts. During winter and summer vacations, selected cadets can join exchange activities in foreign countries to broaden the international perspective of future cadres.200VI. Nurturing National Defense Civilian Personnel
Ever since the Two Defense Acts  that characterize our national defense organization as 
professional division of functions, civilian control of the military and convergence of military 
command and administration systems came into force in 2002, the MND has recruited 
highly capable civil servants to join in the national defense community as civilian officers through civil service examinations and open selection processes.  For over a decade, civilian 
officers have worked alongside their military colleagues, making a notable contribution to 
national defense affairs planning and execution. Also, to increase the military competencies 
of Armed Forces civilian personnel, and promote military-civilian interaction and nurture 
their professional ability to handle national defense affairs, education and training is provided according to job level with the aim of building up national defense specialized knowledge.
(1) Enhancing Pre-Service Training
Every year, pre-service training is conducted for newly recruited civil servants to allow them to acclimatize to the national defense system and quickly become familiar with the MND’s organizational attributes and national defense affairs. In addition, military-
related visits are arranged to increase their sense of belonging to the Armed Forces and 
achieve the objective of long-term retention of personnel.
(2) Military Education by Recommendation
Since 2017, in accordance with job level and MND seniority, and in line with military personnel of the same rank, mid and high level civil servants have been selected to attend in-service courses at the NDU’s War College and Army Command and Staff 
College. The aim is to hone their military competencies and promote exchange between 
military and civilian personnel, to nurture national defense professional talent that will gain promotion in future and serve the nation.

201Section 2 Gathering of Talent
The ROC Armed Forces are stationed across Taiwan and its outlying islands, with missions conducted 
from skies above to seas below, requiring skills in many areas. Guided by government policy, specialists 
in different fields are nurtured, and career development opportunities are provided for women as well. 
Also, to continue to raise morale, every year military service personnel models and model units are chosen to commend units and individuals for outstanding performance.
I .   International Recognition
After entering active service, members of the ROC Armed Forces engage in core training 
diligently on a daily basis as well as promoting their skills and knowledge in the civilian 
arena. To continually inject innovation into Armed Forces units, during their period of service, 
military personnel also continually engage in self-study and take part in various international competitions at which good results have been achieved.

II .  Heroines
In earlier days, the stereotypical image of the military was that it was male-dominated. As 
the concept of gender equality has gained ground in recent years and with the opening of 
the Armed Forces system, the proportion of women in the military has gradually increased. 
Women perform with excellence not only in logistics units but also combat units. They are fine examples of the saying “A heroine is a good as hero” and provide powerful combat 
capability for the defense of the country. As of 2017, there were more than 20,000 women in 
the Armed Forces, accounting for 13.5% of personnel overall.
Major Chang Shu-yu, company commander of Military Police Command which is tasked with 
protecting Taipei, signed for the Military Police upon graduation and was appointed platoon 
203204commander of the Military Police Motorcycle Company, becoming its first female platoon 
commander. The training process involving riding a 366kg motorcycle was arduous but she 
showed great determination and overcome the natural physical disadvantages of women 
compared to men to qualify as a rider, and has since taken part in various exercises. For her outstanding performance, she was named one of the winners of the 24
th The Ten Outstanding 
Young Women Award in 2017.
Sergeant Jian Pei-hua of Mechanized Infantry Battalion, Taitung Area Command passed 
the tough wilderness solo survival training and completed concealment, tactics application, designated marksman and other courses, showing the characteristics of calmness, steadiness 
and precision which are required to be a sniper. Able to execute a kill-shot over 1 kilometer, 
she was the champion of the 2017 Special Forces Sniper Training.
After female NCOs were allowed to become tank drivers, in 2017 the ROC Military Academy 
for the first time allowed women to choose the armor branch. Second Lieutenant Kang Jia-
xin and Second Lieutenant He Wen-qian made a special effort to increase their fitness on a 
daily basis and included weight-training to increase leg strength. They came out ahead of the 
competition and will become the Army’s first female tank commanders.
Captain Huang Su-qing, captain of Wu Chang Warship (La Fayette-class frigate), and 
Commander You Yi-lian, captain of Chung Ping Warship (Newport class tank landing ship), 
are, respectively, the Navy’s first grade 1 and grade 2 warship captains. Since becoming captains, following the anchor chain spirit (everyone on board closely linked) and idea that 
“everyone is in the same boat,” they have led all their crew members carrying out their tasks, 
with the objectives of nurturing Navy talent and fully bringing operational capability into play to maintain security in the Taiwan Strait.
Amongst the recipients of the Military Model award in 2017, seven were female, the largest 
number ever and all are members of combat units. Major Huang Li-si, commander of a rocket company, 43
rd Artillery Command, ROC Army, led her unit through the Lei Ting Exercise and 
achieved full marks. Captain Chung Jing-yi is an F-5 pilot in 7th Flight Training Wing of the 
Air Force; every day she guards the front-line skies over the Taiwan Strait. Major Kuo Shi-yu, 
commander of Chinese Marine Corps Amphibious Reconnaissance and Patrol Unit, is the first 
female officer to complete amphibious frogman training.
More than 60 countries in the world have female military personnel and more and more are 
allowing women to join combat units. The performance of female officers and other ranks is 
equal to that of their male counterparts. Females can be seen all around in the ROC Armed Forces. They have broken through gender barriers, bravely taken on various challenges and 
share the major responsibility of protecting the nation. Women in the military use their ability 
to show again and again that a heroine is as good as a hero.

The ROC military’s special forces assist with special missions such as crime-fighting, 
counter-terrorism and anti-hijacking. Of these units, the Military Police Special Service Company, the Chinese Marine Corps Amphibious Reconnaissance and Patrol Unit, and 
the Army Special Forces strike fear into the hearts of the enemy and offer powerful combat 
capability to defend the nation.1 2

205III.Special Operation Elites
The Armed Forces are ready for war but do not want war. Facing a complex situation at home 
and abroad, special forces are not only focused on core tasks, they also support crime fighting, 
counter-terrorism, counter-hijacking and other national security operations. 
Stealthy, mobile, unpredictable, the Army Special Forces specialize in shocking their 
opponents with surprise attacks. Special Forces can be organized flexibly according to enemy 
threat, mission type and operational requirements. They are modern, elite forces that can carry 
out short range assault, long-range sniper kill, target marking for airstrikes, infiltration and sabotage missions, and possess all-terrain and all-time communications capability. They are 
mainly responsible for quick reaction contingency response, protection of main targets and 
counter-terrorism support in northern, central and southern Taiwan, as well as carrying out 206
Part 5 The Honor of
 the Armed Forces
disaster situation reporting and frigid zone rescue work. In recent years, the Special Forces 
have been involved in disaster relief and rescue. They evacuated residents when typhoons 
Soudelor and Nepartak struck, searched for the crashed Air Force AT-3 trainer, and conducted 
search and rescue after the collapse of the Weiguan Building after the February 6 Tainan Earthquake in 2016, as well as for climbing accidents on Mt. Daxue and Mt. Shuangqi.
The Special Service Company, Chinese Marine Corps Amphibious Reconnaissance and Patrol 
Unit has triphibious capability, strategic, and surprise assault characteristics. The Special 
Service Company can be organized flexibly according to mission type, hostile threats and 
operational requirements. It can carry out a variety of missions including rapid strike, sea infiltration, high altitude parachute jump, assault and sabotage, long-distance sniping and 
counter-terrorism missions. In ordinary times, it is the quick reaction force and provides 
counter-terrorism support in southern Taiwan; it is also responsible for counter-ship hijacking operations at all major ports in Taiwan and for supporting high mountain disaster relief 
and rescue (Kaohsiung City’s Namasia District and Taoyuan District). In recent years, the 
Special Service Company has undertaken missions including the Daliao Prison hostage-taking incident. Guided by the “three unafraids” of the Marines, namely unafraid of hardship, 
unafraid of difficulty, and unafraid of death, and semper fidelis to country, this all-around and 
fearless “black-uniform force” will always be on hand to tackle any mission it is given with 
everything it has.
The Military Police Special Service Company(MPSSC) is a counter-terrorism force that 
deals with hijacking and hostage taking situations. They are responsible for counter-terrorism 
support in northern Taiwan and island-wide counter-hijacking missions. Its wartime role is to 
protect the national leader, VIPs, and locations in the capital. Missions such as New Year’s Day Security Taipei Universiade Security, Minan No. 3 and Haian No. 9 exercise and National 
Day Security have been completed successfully, fully displaying the brave and tenacious 
fighting spirit of special forces personnel.
Members of special services are trained by creating a high-pressure environment as well as 
making extreme demands of fitness to increase pressure resistance and willpower. They must 
be fearless, possess excellent combat skills and have will of steel to push themselves beyond their limit. Also, through messing up their routine, continual counterterrorism assault training, military hand-to-hand combat skills, combat casualty care courses, and so on, the members of special services achieve mastery of counter-terrorism and special operations skills. The spirit 
of diligent training and fearlessness in taking on hardship and difficulty makes special services 
elite units that the enemy fears.
IV . Models
The duty and mission of the members of the Armed Forces are to defend the country and protect the people and, when the country and people are threatened, to stay at their posts and 
do their utmost to protect the country and its people; they are also to actively hone various 
skills in addition to diligently carrying out core tasks, apply what they learn to their jobs, 207

have made significant achievements in terms of force buildup and readiness and promotion of all-out defense. Meanwhile, they take on their tasks with enthusiasm, which has, in turn, 
created a favorable image for military personnel and driven overall enhancement of the Armed 
Forces. Prominent members of the Armed Forces have set a good example to all military 
personnel.

209Section 3 Career Development
To provide guidance to and care for service members when they leave the military and allocate 
human resources to where it is needed most, MND makes every effort to combine with the 
resources of each ministry. The MND’s employment and occupational training budgets have 
been gradually increased year by year.  As well as providing Adaptive Assessment and Career Counselling Service to veterans, occupational training and industrial training courses are run to 
help veterans acquire various skills that will help them seamlessly adapt to civilian life and gain 
employment after leaving the military.
I .  Guidance to Help Service Personnel Transfer to Civilian Work
To allow service personnel to quickly join the civilian workforce after they leave the military, employment service events are held for retired/discharged service personnel together 
with other ministries, and varied vocational training courses are offered by specialized 
institutions. Of these courses, management practice (international logistics, international trade marketing, digital marketing planning etc.) and operating practice (vehicle maintenance, 
computer graphics) courses can help ex-service personnel find employment and obtain skills 
certificates. 166 employment service events were held of various types in 2016 and 2017, 
offering 248,425 job opportunities, allowing service personnel to quickly find employment 
and smoothly return to civilian life.
Serving officers and other ranks are also, with the precondition that their core tasks are not 
affected, encouraged to use their off-duty time to undertake second skills training and obtain 
skills certificates to assist with transfer to civilian work after leaving the military .
II . Continuing to Contribute to Society

pragmatism, as general manager of a private company he won the affirmation of the Golden Merchants Award-Outstanding Firm in 2015. While serving in the military, Major Liao passed 
the grueling frogman training course that requires strong willpower, giving him a determined 
never-say-die approach to challenges. Using the organizational management model he learned in the military, he set up a management system and mechanism that put his company on the 
right track and opened up a successful second career, allowing him to continue to make a 
contribution to society.
