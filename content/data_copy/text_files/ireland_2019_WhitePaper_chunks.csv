48,"# # # executive summary defence remains of paramount importance to this state and, as a vital element of overall security policy, provides the bedrock of stability and prosperity across political, social, economic and environmental domains. the white paper on defence was approved by government in july 2015 and provides the strategic and comprehensive defence policy framework for the period up to 2025. it was developed following a lengthy consultation process that involved extensive stakeholder consultation. while ultimately approved by government, and reflective of the fact that a range of government departments and state agencies have primary responsibilities when it comes to the security of the state and its citizens, development of the white paper was led",768,117,130,2,ireland_2019_WhitePaper.md,2025-01-28 18:54:22
49,"by the minister for defence, supported by a high - level civil - military steering group. one of the most significant commitments made by government in the white paper is to ensure that defence policy remains up to date and to bring certainty and regularity to the process of defence planning and overall preparedness. this is being achieved through the introduction of a new fixed cycle of defence reviews, to be carried out every three years. the first such review is this white paper update, with the next iteration under the cycle being a more comprehensive strategic defence review. the white paper specifies that these reviews are to encompass a fully updated assessment of the security environment and a",710,119,130,2,ireland_2019_WhitePaper.md,2025-01-28 18:54:22
50,"fresh consideration of implications for overall policy requirements, associated tasks, capability development and resourcing. into the future, the fixed cycle reviews will be integrated with the security assessments undertaken by the newly established national security analysis centre. the hallmarks of defence policy will continue to be : - a policy of active military neutrality ; - a highly engaged and participative approach internationally, particularly through the united nations ( un ) and european union ( eu ) ; 1 - - - - - - a commitment to defence provision appropriate to present and contingent requirements ; - strong recognition of the individual and collective contribution of members of the defence forces and the requirement to",745,116,130,2,ireland_2019_WhitePaper.md,2025-01-28 18:54:22
51,"value these as vital elements of ireland ’ s statehood. at the outset, the 2015 white paper sets out a comprehensive and forward - looking assessment of the dynamic security environment. this provides the context for the government ’ s defence policy response and the defence contribution to security, including defence of the state from armed aggression and the defence contribution to domestic security through provision of a wide range of day - to - day supports to an garda siochana. furthermore, in an effort to maximise value for money achieved from defence expenditure, for the broader benefit of the state, the white paper also makes provision for “ non - security ” policy requirements with",699,116,130,2,ireland_2019_WhitePaper.md,2025-01-28 18:54:22
52,"the associated provision of a range of services to other departments and agencies. all of these requirements are reflected in the various roles that government assigned to the defence forces in the white paper. the updating of the security environment assessment from the 2015 white paper is the starting point in this update. the review was completed by a high - level inter departmental / inter - agency group led by the department of defence. this comprised senior defence forces ’ representation as well as various other departments and agencies with security responsibilities, including the department of justice and equality and an garda siochana. the review concludes that while the essential aggregate level of threat facing this state",743,118,130,2,ireland_2019_WhitePaper.md,2025-01-28 18:54:22
