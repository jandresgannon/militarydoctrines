30,". - - - - - the european idea itself, designed to promote peace and prosperity after the dramatic events of the previous century, is being challenged by brexit, the refugee crisis, and rising doubts about europe ’ s ability to protect its population. in such an environment, which challenges three decades of certainties and references, only a strong france, in control of its own destiny, can provide answers to today ’ s major crises, promote its values and assert its interests. first - class defence and diplomacy are critical to this ambition, along with strong and credible armed forces, capable of dealing with all kinds of threats, in every field",654,111,130,4,france_2017_DefenseAndNationalSecurityStrategicReview.md,2025-01-28 18:55:36
