       The national defense of the Republic of China aims to build 
a defense force with comprehensive national strength, to 
provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR), and thus safeguard the nation and its people and preserve world peace.
       During peacetime, the Army safeguards Taiwan as well as its offshore 
islands, supports anti-terrorism actions when ordered, and actively 
engages in HADR . During wartime, the Army integrates ground forces for 
joint operations to destroy invading enemy forces.

       7
       8
       During Peacetime, the Navy is responsible for maritime reconnaissance, 
patrolling and safeguarding maritime security across the Taiwan Strait, 
and actively engaging in HADR. During wartime, the Navy will conduct joint operations with allied forces to against the enemy’s maritime blockade or military invasion, thereby securing the sea lines of communication (SLOC).
9
       10
       During peacetime, the Air Force is responsible for aerial reconnaissance, 
patrolling the Taiwan Strait and securing national airspace, and actively 
engaging in HADR . During wartime, the Air Force will coordinate with allies 
to gain air dominance and conduct air defense operations.
11
       12
       The ROC Armed Forces has stepped up for HADR  measures, and 
is actively improving its preparedness for the threat of complex 
disasters. It conducts various live exercises in order to safeguard the 
field and assets of citizens.
13
       All-out defense activities are organized to inspire 
patriotism, build esprit de corps, and achieve “all-out 
concern, all-out support, and all-out participation.”

       15
       Article 138 of the Constitution of the Republic of 
China states: “The land, sea and air forces of 
the whole country shall be above personal, regional or party affiliations, shall be loyal to the state, and shall protect the people.”

       Minister’s Foreword

        The National Defense Report is a critical window to the transparency of 
defense policies. It not only expounds the overall security situation, defense 
policies, force buildup, and readiness preparations, but also allows citizens to examine and supervise defense administration. Early this year (2013), The Transparency International announced the “Government Defense Anti-Corruption Index,” which is based on objective indicators. Among the 82 countries evaluated, the ROC was rated in Band B (low-risk rank) along with 6 advanced countries, including the US and UK. This result shows that we have made significant progress in “defense transparency” and won the recognition from a specialized international organization.
Despite easing tension across the Taiwan Strait, the PRC’s has insisted on the 
path of military preparation against Taiwan, and has not renounced the use of force against Taiwan. Hence, the PRC remains the greatest threat to our national security. Furthermore, East Asia has been a region of uncertainty over the past year due to disputes over sovereignty and maritime rights, as well as the confrontation in the Korean Peninsula. The disputes over Diaoyutai and islands in the South China Sea bear the most significant implications for our national security. To safeguard national security, the ROC Armed Forces are dedicated to building defensive capabilities. An adequate level of defense budget will be allocated to step up force training and acquire advanced weapon systems. Furthermore, in coordination with the government’s overall policy planning, the ROC Armed Forces will continue to strengthen maritime patrol capabilities, and collaborate with the coast guards to defend our sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.
O n the relations with the US, President Ma Ying-Jeou, since assumption 
of office, has been building on the existing foundation  and making further impovements on the premise of being “pragmatics and surprise free.” US President Obama also noted that the US will continue to provide Taiwan with necessary defensive  weapons based on the Taiwan Relations Act and its consistent  commitments to Taiwan. Recently delivered systems include attack helicopters, utility helicopters, P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and PAC-3 missiles, not only indicating our robust military relations with the US, but also our determination to 
18
       build self-defense capabilities.
The transition to a volunteer force and the implementation of the Jingtsui 
Program, have resulted in significant progress in the defense transformation. 
Amended Act of Military Service System and Enforcement Rules of Military Service System were already passed by the Legislative Yuan. However, the timetable for completing a volunteer system is extended to the end of 2016 because the number of volunteers did not meet expectations. Furthermore, the legislative procedures for the six defense organization acts, which concern adjustments to high level staff organizations, were completed on November 27
th, 2012 and 
promulgated by the President on December 12th, 2012. The acts provide the legal 
basis for organizational adjustments of the Jingtsui Program. The armed forces are on track to formulate future plans based on  the concepts of innovation/asymmetry and focused force buildup, The force structure and organization will continue to be adjusted on a rolling basis in response to changes in the overall national security situation.
In the wake of the unfortunate development of a recent incident of 
mismanagement of the troops, the Ministry of National Defense has run an intensive review, and the Code of Court Martial Procedure was also amended for a major reform. The hope is to respond to public expectations for improving human rights conditions the military to regain the citizens’ trust.
Let me thank the advisory committee and fellow colleagues who dedicated 
their hearts and minds into this report to bring greater public awareness on defense affairs. I also express my sincerest gratitude to all the men and women of the armed forces for their dedication and contribution to national defense and disaster  relief missions. Finally, I hope the citizens will continue to maintain their security awareness and also provide guidance and the greatest support to the MND.

       Introduction
The Ministry of National Defense (MND) 
periodically publishes national defense 
reports in accordance with Article 30 of the “National Defense Act.” On one hand, the reports describe the current status and results of the national defense policy and national defense administration, so as to gain citizens’ identification and support. On the other hand, the reports show the ROC’s military transparency to the international society, and declare our determination for self-defense.

       The Ministry of National Defense (MND) periodically publishes national 
defense reports in accordance with Article 30 of the “National Defense 
Act.” On one hand, the reports describe the current status and results of the national defense policy and national defense administration, so as to gain citizens’ recognition and support. On the other hand, the reports show the ROC’s military transparency to the international society, and declare our determination for self-defense.This national defense report describes implementation results of the organizational system, force structure, talent cultivation, resource distribution, capability buildup, and gender equality. Furthermore, it explains how the ROC Armed Forces stepped up its training in response to changes in the security environment, so as to prevent war and preserve peace in the Taiwan Strait, enhance disaster relief capabilities to ensure the safety of people’s lives and assets, and build an elite defense force capable of disaster relief during peacetime and combat during wartime.Cross-Strait relations have gradually improved in recent years, and the situation across the Taiwan Strait has become growingly relaxed. However, considering the significant growth of the PRC’s comprehensive national strength, as well as the PRC’s refusal to renounce the use of military force against Taiwan, which has led to its deployment of over a thousand missiles along the coasts, we cannot neglect the PRC’s threat to Taiwan, and consolidating our defense capabilities is the only way to truly ensure peace in the Taiwan Strait.The ROC Armed Forces serve as a defender of national security and the people’s welfare, and a guardian of constitutional democracy. It resolutely holds the belief to “fight for the survival and development of the ROC, and fight for the safety and welfare of people in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matzu.” The MND practically carries out force buildup and readiness, and enhances the ROC Armed Forces’ joint operations capabilities under the guidance of the military strategic concept of “resolute defense and credible deterrence,” aiming to achieve war prevention and deterrence. Based on the principles of “smart and steadfast, strict and arduous,” exercises and training missions, such as the 
22
       Han Guang Exercise, are utilized to pragmatically review the Armed Forces’ 
training results, thereby enhancing the Armed Forces’ overall capabilities.Volunteer force is an important part of national defense transformation, and aims to recruit outstanding men and wemen to join the military and build a “small but superb, strong and smart” elite force. Furthermore, drafted age men are required to receive four months military training to ensure reserve mobilization capabilities. After they complete training, they are included in the reservist system for management, accumulating mobilization capabilities and reinforcing them through all-out defense.This report features “integration and innovation” and contains 4 parts and 8 chapters, each of which is further described below:
Part 1 Strategic Environment
This part summarizes developments in the global security environment and trends of the security situation, and analyzes current traditional and non-traditional threats. Furthermore, it discusses the PRC’s rise and the “three step” strategy for its military modernization, as well as the influence on global and regional security environments, allowing citizens to understand the current security challenges we face.
Part 2 General Plan of National Defense
The ROC Armed Forces formulated the general plan of national defense in response to national security challenges, and uses it as a basis for force buildup and readiness, as well as national defense administration. Its objective is to build a strong defense force that can achieve “resolute defense, credible deterrence” and safeguard national security.
Part 3 National Defense Capabilities
Part 3 describes the efforts of the ROC Armed Forces in defense infrastructure, capability preparedness, and defense management, expounding the results of efforts in “national defense organization,” “joint operations effectiveness,” 
23
       “information and electronic warfare capabilities,” “logistics support,” “reserve 
capability buildup” and “intangible combat capability” in recent years. This 
part also explains how the ROC Armed Forces maximize the effectiveness of human, financial and material defense resources to support the execution of its missions.
Part 4 All-out National Defense
Efforts of the ROC Armed Forces in all-out defense and citizen services are described in four aspects, namely national defense education, defense mobilization, disaster prevention and relief, and military-civilian services, emphasizing its endeavors and contribution to disaster relief and citizen services.
24
       Part 1
Strategic Environment
Economic growth of the US and European countries 
fell short of expectations as a result of the European 
Debt Crisis that began in 2011. Countries cut their defense spending and reduced the scale of their military to reduce government expenditure, which affected their strategic development directions. Major security challenges in the Asia-Pacific currently include territorial land and sea disputes, confrontation in the Korean Peninsula, and the PRC’s military expansion. Although cross-Strait political and economic relations are currently stable, the PRC has not renounced the use of military force against Taiwan, and remains a major threat to the stability of the Asia-Pacific and the future development of the ROC.
25
       Chapter 1  Security Situation
The global security situation currently presents diverse forms 
of competition and cooperation that exist at the same time. 
Traditional political or military conflicts are mainly derived from territorial land (sea) and sovereignty disputes, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Furthermore, non-traditional security issues, e.g. climate changes, maritime rights and interests, major natural disasters, international terrorism, resource competition, infectious diseases, and malicious cyber actions, also pose challenges to the security environment.

Chapter 1 Security Situation
MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Section 1  Global Security Environment
The United States remains the dominant force in the global security environment. 
However, the EU, Russia, the PRC, India, and Japan have gained growing influence in international and regional affairs, but the overall situation remains “one superpower and many powers.” Generally speaking, in the current global security situation large countries continue to play a leading role in regional situations, while medium and small countries form alliances, regional security cooperations, and engage in economic and trade interactions to show their influence and existence value.
I. Asia
( I ) Mainland China
The PRC’s fifth generation leaders Xi Jin-Ping and Li Ke-Qiang fully took over in March 2012. Current objectives of their administration are to maintain economic growth, maintain internal stability, reduce the poverty gap, secure the party’s political leadership, and prevent corruption and uphold integrity. Under the military strategy of “active defense,” the PRC emphasizes a number of “core interests,” including safeguarding its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national unification. Besides advocating communication, cooperation and mutual benefits when dealing with sovereignty disputes in the East China Sea and South China Sea, the PRC will also continue to show its determination that it will not back down on matters concerning its territory and sovereignty.To reconcile the “China Threat Theory,” the PRC hopes to create a peaceful image via frequent visits by high level military and government officials and providing financial (military) aid, especially in the Asia-Pacific. Furthermore, the PRC uses its political and economic strength to consolidate military exchanges with Russia and India, and strengthen relations with countries in the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa, ensuring its energy and mineral resource supply, as well as stable national development during a “stage of strategic opportunities.”
27
       ( II ) Northeast Asia
1. Korean Peninsula
After Jeong-eun Kim, the leader of North Korea, assumed important 
positions in the party, government, and military in April 2012, he continued to follow through with the “army-first policy” and stepped up education of military ideology. He further conducted long and short-range ballistic missile tests and nuclear tests to consolidate his political power. North Korea conducted its 3
rd nuclear test even after the U.N. Security Council imposed 
sanctions, and went as far as to scrap the Korean Armistice Agreement. Relations between the North and South tensed when North Korea cut military hotlines with the US and South Korea, creating an immense impact on the regional stability of Northeast Asia.
Park Geun-hye was elected as South Korea’s first female president in 
December 2012, and continued many policies of the former president Lee Myung-bak, actively implementing Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) and continuing the policy to transfer command of the South Korea-US joint force during wartime by 2015. Furthermore, Park Geun-hye is actively seeking to reopen dialogue with the North in hopes of relaxing the tense situation on the Korean Peninsula and improving relations with North Korea.
2. Japan
Japan naming and nationalizing uninhabited islands around Diaoyutai in 2012 caused the PRC to dispatch vessels to conduct active operations in the area. Japan redeployed its Navy and Air Force reconnaissance and patrol units in response. Furthermore, in response to the threat of nuclear tests and ballistic missiles of North Korea, Japan actively engaged in dialogue with the US and South Korea, strengthening contingency measures, intelligence sharing, and exchange and cooperation mechanisms, and further planning 
28
       Part 1 Strategic Environment 
Chapter 1 Security Situationthe enhancement of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities 
for surrounding areas.
Japan Ministry of Defense announced its “Defense of Japan 2013” in July 
, and considered the PRC’s military expansion and North Korea’s nuclear weapon and ballistic missile developments to be potential threats in the region. Furthermore, Japan will strengthen its defenses on islands in the southwest and build mobile defense capabilities, consolidating its alliance with the US to enhance its overall deterrence.
( III ) Southeast Asia
Southeast Asian emerging economies have attracted global attention under the “ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) integration.” Yet, there remain sources of conflict rooted in their history, religious differences, and struggles for independence. Moreover, there are a number of factors causing uncertainty in 
Japan naming and nationalizing uninhabited islands around Diaoyutai drove the PRC to 
dispatch vessels to conduct active operations in the area, causing an escalation of 
conflict within the region. 
29
       Southeast Asia, including differences in the social structure of ASEAN countries, 
different degrees of economic development, and the US, PRC, Japan, and Russia all seeking leadership over security affairs.Under the growing demand on ocean development, most countries have increased their defense budget to strengthen their military power; they also frequently conduct joint military exercises with other countries to strengthen regional joint defense capabilities. With consideration to the frequent disasters caused by earthquakes and tsunamis, the ratio of humanitarian aid and disaster relief has also been increased in military training and exercises, so as to build large scale disaster response and relief capabilities.
( IV ) South Asia
India is located at the center of South Asia. In recent years, India has significantly increased its defense budget under its strong economic growth, and has actively procured armaments from the US, Russia, and France, enabling it to become a political, economic, and military power with growing influence.To summarize the situation in South Asia, there remain border disputes between the PRC and India at the McMahon Line and in Aksai Chin; Afghanistan and Pakistan must still face the threat of expanding terrorist organizations and armed forces; the PRC is attempting to expand towards the Indian Ocean; and the US return to Asia “rebalancing” strategy. These developments all have an effect on the regional security situation.
( V ) Middle East
After US and NATO forces left Iraq, civil war in Syria and conflict between Israel and the Hamas have attracted global attention. Iran announced a religious decree in January 2013 to ban the development of nuclear weapons, but its nuclear development program continues to raise suspicion and concern, causing surrounding countries to purchase advanced weapons and equipment and strengthen their own defense capabilities. The moderate conservative and former nuclear negotiator Hassan Rouhani won Iran’s presidential election in June 2013 
30
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 1 Strategic Environment 
Chapter 1 Security Situationunder the Iranian people’s hopes for a better economy. After Rouhani assumes 
office, Iran’s tense relations with the Western world are expected to gradually relax.Poor administration of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi led to Egypt’s unstable political situation in July 2013, resulting in a bloody conflict between millions of supporters of different sides. Turmoil will continue in Egypt within the near future. In addition, civil war broke out in Syria in 2011, and prolonged military confrontation between the government and rebel army led to the chemical weapons attack in August 2013. The international society strongly condemned this attack and imposed sanctions. Israel and Palestine reached a cease fire agreement under mediation by the international society, and commenced negotiations after prolonged conflict. However, the borders and expansion of settlements in East Jerusalem and the Palestine Autonomous Government gaining observer status in the UN remain obstacles of their negotiations.
II. Europe
( I ) European Union
Most European countries cut defense spending in response to the European Debt Crisis, implementing a number of measures to lower the cost of military maintenance, including personnel quota reduction, organization streamlining, combined training, and eliminating old equipment. Under the framework of the EU(European Union) and NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), European countries are expanding their capabilities in dialogue, readiness training, and contingency response, in hopes of preventing crises and maintaining a stable security environment.
( II ) Russia
Russia crosses over the Eurasian continent. After President Vladimir Putin assumed office, Russia once again directed its attention towards Asia in the light of global development trends, and intends to strengthen its political and 
31
       economic influence in the Far East. Russia’s objective is to complete its military 
modernization by 2020, and is reforming its military command structure; it has invested great resources into developing strategic nuclear weapons, is conducting long-range operation exercises and training, and is actively developing and exporting armaments in hopes of restoring its status as an international power.
III. Americas
(  I  ) United States
US President Obama released the Defense Strategic Guidance titled “Sustaining US Global Leadership: Priorities for 21
st Century Defense” in early 2012, 
planning to cut the defense budget and force size until 2021 to achieve “spending reduction without capability loss.” Furthermore, the US initiated a mechanism to cut government spending in March 2013, and the additional budget cuts are expected to affect the US’s government operations, power projection, armaments maintenance, and weapons development,as well as the strategic deployment in Asia-Pacific rebalancing.
(  II  ) Central and South Americas
Economic development of Central and South Americas have long been affected by extreme weather, earthquakes, and hurricanes. Current disputes in the region include England and Argentina’s dispute over sovereignty of the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas); El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras’s dispute over ocean borders; Nicaragua and Costa Rica’s border issues. Furthermore, transnational crime, including illegal economic activities, gang crimes, and drug trafficking all affect the regional security situation.In addition, whether or not Venezuela adjusts its anti-US policy that has been in effect for years concerns the development of relations between Latin America and the US. Also, under the calls of Latin American countries, the UN has urged the US numerous times to lift economic sanctions on Cuba, which were imposed 50 years ago, hoping to improve their relations and reduce factors of uncertainty in the region.

Part 1 Strategic Environment 
Chapter 1 Security SituationIV. Oceania
In September 2012, the US lifted the ban on naval vessels of New Zealand 
anchoring in US ports or bases, and lifted restrictions on meetings between ministers of national defense and military exercises to further strengthen military cooperation in regional security. Australia has always been an ally of the US and plays an important role in the US “rebalancing strategy.” In Australia’s “Defense White Paper 2013” released in May 2013, besides reiterating that it will maintain its alliance with the US, it also welcomed the rise of the PRC. However, in the election of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia on September 7
th, 
the Liberal Party won and gained the right to form a cabinet. Therefore, whether or not the Liberal Party continues national policies of the Labor Party, which was formerly in power, is worth our further attention.Due to their geostrategic position and rich natural resources, Southern Pacific island countries are actively implementing regional cooperation through the “Southern Pacific Islands Forum,” attracting leaders of large nations to participate in the form and thus attracting large nations to invest resources to aid their development. However, accelerated melting of the polar ice cap caused by global warming, extreme climate, and frequent earthquakes has had a major impact on the social stability and survival of countries of Oceania.
V. Africa
Africa’s development has long been behind other continents, but its rich natural resources, including minerals and energy, and market potential have attracted the US, PRC, EU, and Japan to strengthen their relations with African countries. However, Africa’s overall security situation continues to be threatened by instable regimes, war between groups, religious conflicts, and border disputes. Moreover, African countries are impacted by weapons proliferation, pirates, and terrorist attacks. At present, South Africa is the only emerging power in Africa, and it will continue to play an essential role in the region under the support of the US, Russia and PRC.
33
       Section 2  Asia-Pacific Security Situation
Asia-Pacific countries, such as the PRC, India, and members of ASEAN, have 
become the engine of global economic growth with their great populations, resources, and market scale, and it has also affected global politics. However, as such countries are showing rapid development, they face a number of security issues, such as the PRC’s military expansion, the US “rebalancing” strategy, territorial land and sea disputes, sovereignty disputes, prolonged confrontation on the Korean Peninsula, resource competition, and non-traditional security issues, causing security difficulties in the region. As a result, countries are competing to procure armaments, and it has formed challenges and threats to overall regional security.
I. Traditional Security Situation
( I ) Significant Expansion of the PRC’s Military Power
The PRC’s defense budget has maintained high growth rates for numerous years benefitting from the rapid growth of its comprehensive national strength. However, the transparency of its defense budget is far from meeting the international society’s expectations, and its rapid military modernization has raised suspicion and alerted surrounding countries. In recent years, the PRC has used “World of Harmony” and “Good Neighbor Diplomacy” and participated in international peacekeeping and anti-piracy operations to remove suspicions of the international society regarding its military expansion.The PRC’s current national strategy is to maintain domestic political stability, drive comprehensive economic development, and maintain peace in the surrounding environment. Its military development aims to gain leadership in the Asia-Pacific by 2020, and to strengthen “Second Artillery new ammunition development and deployment,” “Navy and Air Force modernization and power projection expansion,” and “information and electronic warfare and joint 
34
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 1 Strategic Environment 
Chapter 1 Security Situationoperation capability buildup.” Furthermore, the PRC is actively developing 
“Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD)” capabilities as well as related strategies and tactics, in hopes of deterring other military forces from intervening in the situation of the Taiwan Strait or disputes in the Asia-Pacific.
( II ) US “Rebalancing” Strategy
The US published the “Defense Strategic Guidelines” in early 2012 to actively expand its military presence beyond Northeast Asia. The US has demonstrated its determination to maintain regional stability via various military cooperation measures, such as expanding joint military exercises and stationing the US Marines in Australia.However, under the policy to reduce government spending, some force buildup plans have been suspended or delayed, affecting the timetable as much as 10 to 15 years. With the Middle East still instable and powers in the Asia-Pacific, such as Russia, the PRC, and India, waiting for the opportunity to expand, the Obama Administration will have to face the issue of how to implement its “rebalancing” strategy and maintain US leadership.
(  III  ) Situation on the Korean Peninsula
North Korea adopted the “brink of war” measure in February 2013 in hopes of gaining national interests and international attention, during which the PRC expressed its position on a nuclear- weapon-free Korean Peninsula and supported the international sanction against North Korean operations. Future developments in the Korean Peninsula will not only be determined by the political situation of North Korea, but also by the influence of the US, PRC and Russia in Northeast Asia.
( IV ) Territorial Land (Sea) and Sovereignty Disputes
Current territorial land (sea) disputes in the Asia-Pacific include oil and gas fields in the East China Sea, the northern islands (Kuril Islands), Takeshima (Dokdo Island), and exclusive economic zones. In the South China Sea, the 
35
       PRC in recent years has used navy warships and public service ships to drive 
away ships of other countries and declare its sovereignty. The PRC further announced the establishment of Sansha City in Hainan Province on June 22
nd, 
2012, and its deployment of Navy and Air Force troops indicates that its South China Sea policy has gradually shifted from “joint development” into “effective management.” Vietnam also enacted its “Vietnam Maritime Law” in late June 2012, and extended its “sovereignty” and scope of “jurisdiction” to the Paracel and Spratly Islands. The responses of surrounding countries to disputes in the South China Sea will affect the security situation in the Asia-Pacific.
The tense situation on the Korean Peninsula has become a challenge and threat to the 
security of Northeast Asia. The illustration shows South Korean officers and personnel of the 
US Army examining remains of the Cheonan ship that was sunk by North Korea during a sneak attack. ( photo: US Navy)

( V )  Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation
Although the fight against terrorism has been somewhat effective, WMDs have 
not been completely controlled and the risk of its proliferation still may not be overlooked. For example, the issue of nuclear weapons in Iran and North Korea continue to affect regional and even the global security situation.
II. Non-traditional Security Situation
( I ) Economic Security
The US and Japan have used economic stimulation, quantitative easing, and exchange rate policies under the pressure of financial retrenchment and economic slowdown, hoping to benefit exports and reverse its economic downturn. Yet, the abovementioned policies have aggravated fluctuations of exchange rates and impacted the market competitiveness of other Asia-Pacific countries. Furthermore, competition between the “Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)” of the US and the “Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)” of ASEAN will affect the investment amount of international capital in Asia-Pacific emerging markets, and result in more severe market competition that will increase regional economic security risk.The free trade agreement between the US and South Korea took effect in March 2012; the “Agreement among the Government of the People's Republic of China, the Government of Japan and the Government of the Republic of Korea for the Promotion, Facilitation and Protection of Investment” was formally signed in May 2012 and accelerated regional integration. Other developments that have a profound effect on the economic security of the ROC and Asia-Pacific include the accelerated rise of Northeast Asian countries, as well as the US and PRC separately implementing economic and trade integration, deepening political exchanges, and forming economic alliances in the Asia-Pacific.
37
       ( II ) Climate Changes
Droughts, floods, strong precipitation and snow, and more frequent and stronger 
typhoons in the Asia-Pacific caused by weather anomalies in recent years have severely affected the ecological environment and economic development of countries in the region. According to statistics of the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR), a total of 83 natural disasters occurred in East, Southeast, and South Asia in 2012, and caused 3,103 deaths, affected 64.5 million people, and resulted in damages reaching US$15.1 billion. The Asia Disaster Reduction Center (ADRC) combined the strengths of countries around the world and established an integrated disaster relief mechanism and dialogue framework, so as to jointly face challenges brought by climate changes.Taiwan has an extremely sensitive and vulnerable natural environment and geological conditions, so extreme weather caused by global climate changes can easily cause a disaster, resulting in great losses of lives and assets. The 
Droughts, floods, strong rainfall and snow, and typhoons with growing intensity and 
frequency caused by climate anomalies in recent years have severely impacted the 
ecological environment and economic development of countries around the world. The image shows a site struck by a tornado in Oklahoma, US. ( photo: US Navy)

use policies, carried out adjustment measures of international organizations to alleviate the effects of climate changes, and actively seeks to joint international disaster prevention organizations to ensure the sustainable development and prosperity of the ROC and other countries in the region.
( III ) Ocean Development Disputes
In recent years, claimant countries, such as Vietnam and the Philippines, have become growingly aggressive in gaining sovereignty over islands in the South China Sea, in which there remain unresolved disputes over maritime rights and interests between claimant countries and the PRC. The PRC’s regular patrol of the region has caused disputes to further escalate. As sovereignty disputes over Asia-Pacific islands become growingly difficult, although the “United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea” states that related disputes may seek international arbitration or mediation, the decision might be affected by 
Terrorist attacks and conflicts still occur in the Middle East, South Asia, and 
Southeast Asia, endangering local security and social stability. ( photo: US Navy)

       the intervention of any power, making the peaceful resolution of disputes quite 
difficult.In terms of ocean development disputes in surrounding sea areas, the ROC signed an agreement with Japan in the 17
th Fishery Conference in April 2013 as 
a result of President Ma’s “East China Sea Peace Initiative,” and has received recognition and approval from the international society. The incident of the Philippines shooting a Taiwanese fisherman on Guang Da Xing No.28 in the South China Sea in May 2013 caused tense relations with the Philippines, and showed the severity of overlapping exclusive economic zones. To prevent such disputes from affecting our national security and people’s well-being, it is necessary to have strong military strength to protect our maritime rights and interests.
( IV ) International Terrorism
Frequent terrorist activities in the Asia-Pacific in recent years have severely affected regional stability. International terrorism is prevalent in the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia due to history, religious differences, and struggles for independence, endangering national security and social order in many countries, and severely impacting regional security and economic development.The main cause of frequent terrorist activity in Southeast Asia are conflicts that arise from demands of the Kachin Independence Army in Southeast Asia for autonomy, demands of the Sulu Army in Sabah Malaysia for sovereignty, demands of separatists in southern Thailand for independence, and Islamic movement in the Philippines. In South Asia, conflicts caused by religious differences in Pakistan and India have not decreased even today. Therefore, Asia-Pacific countries discuss counter-terrorism measures through a multi-lateral mechanism, and deal with counter-terrorism issues through international cooperation. The ROC has also stepped up counter-terrorism cooperation with Asia-Pacific countries using the Counter-Terrorism Task Force (CTTF) of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) as a platform.

Chapter 1 Security Situation( V ) Energy Security
Increasing global energy demand driven by economic development has raised 
tensions in the PRC, Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines, and resulted in energy contention in surrounding sea areas. This has caused Asia-Pacific countries to

       reexamine the key position of energy in national security issues.
At present, the main energy supply of East and Northeast Asian countries, including the ROC, Japan and South Korea, is the Middle East and Africa. An exception is the PRC, which produces oil and also imports oil through oil pipes in Central Asia. The oil supply of Southeast Asian countries besides Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei, a handful of countries that produce oil, is also from the Middle East. Therefore, the Strait of Malacca, a main passageway for transporting oil, has become an important area protected by Asia-Pacific countries to protect energy security. Joint patrol currently carried out by Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand has significantly reduced pirate incidents in the area, effectively improving energy security in the Asia-Pacific.
(VI) Infectious Diseases
Climate changes, globalization, and frequent international exchanges have caused the rapid spread of infectious diseases, including H5N1, H7N9, novel influenza, super bacteria NDM-1, Ebola, and Norovirus, posing a great challenge to the current public health system. Resources invested by countries into preventing and responding to new infectious diseases is not less than large scale military operations or force buildup.Although the ROC is currently an observer in the World Health Assembly (WHA), we cannot directly and fully participate in the global infectious disease prevention network as a peer, greatly constraining infectious disease prevention in Taiwan. In the future, the government will endeavor to join international cooperation platforms, so as to eliminate the threat of infectious diseases on the public health system of the ROC and the Asia-Pacific.

The PRC has actively participated in international affairs and 
implemented military diplomacy in recent years. Under the economic integration in East Asia, the PRC is building multilateral political, economic, and security cooperative relations with Asia-Pacific countries, which constrains the ROC’s space for political, diplomatic, and economic development. The PRC's current military strategy is to focus on handling issues in the East China Sea and South China Sea, but it has not renounced the use of military force against Taiwan and remains our greatest military threat. Furthermore, escalation of disputes over territorial sovereignty in the East China Sea and South China Sea also forms challenges to our national security.

Part 1 Strategic Environment 
Chapter 2 Security Challenge
Section 1  Current Status and Developments of the 
PLA
The PRC has absorbed force buildup experiences of advanced countries in 
Europe and the US, and actively adjusted its force organization, revised its training outline, deployed new weapons, and cultivated military talents to conduct joint operations. These measures were carried out based on the political report of the “18
th National Congress” of the PRC in 2012, which demanded 
“accelerating the modernization of national defense and the armed forces,” President of the PRC Xi Jin-Ping's force buildup guidance to “be called and come at any instant, come and be able to fight, fight and be sure to win” in 2013, and the strategic guidance to “quickly win long distance battles and fight a first decisive battle.” The PRC hopes to build a modernized force able to “win a local war under conditions of informatization,” and has devoted its efforts to field exercises targeting Taiwan, using new tactics, strengthening force training, and enhancing joint operations capabilities.
I. The PRC's Military Strategy against Taiwan
Although cross-Strait relations have become growingly relaxed, the PRC continues to strengthen its military preparations against Taiwan, and is actively developing and procuring new weapons platforms and precision weapons, so when a dispute arises in the Taiwan Strait, it can deter or delay a foreign military force from intervening.
( I ) Creating a Peaceful Atmosphere to Weaken Awareness of the 
Enemy
The PRC’s “National People’s Congress” and “Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference” (the “Two Sessions”) made a resolution in 2013 and reiterated the “1992 Consensus,” insisting on the policy of “One Country Two Systems and Peaceful Reunification,” and adopting the model “into the island, into the households and into the hearts” to expand its interactions with 
45
       political parties, organizations, and people of Taiwan. This shows that the PRC 
is using relaxed cross-Strait relations and expanded exchanges in an attempt to create advantageous conditions for cross-Strait political negotiations. It hopes to gradually change the Taiwanese people’s impression of it being militaristic, and to weaken the awareness of servicemen in the ROC Armed Forces, so as to 
weaken our determination to resist the enemy.
( II ) Hindering ROC Weapons Procurements from the US to Increase 
its Chances of Victory Using Military Force
The PRC indicated numerous times to the US that arms sales to Taiwan is the 
main obstacle of their military exchanges and relations. The “Two Sessions” reiterated in 2013 that the PRC will properly handle the Taiwan issue based on the “three communiques,” and demanded that the US government “gradually reduce arms sales to Taiwan” as stated in the communiques. Xi Jin-Ping, President of the PRC, during his visit the US in June the same year once again expressed his wishes to US President Obama for the US to stop arms sales to Taiwan, hoping that the US will gradually reduce and eventually end arms sales to Taiwan. The PRC intends to suppress the further upgrade of our defense capabilities and increase its chances of victory when using military force against Taiwan.
( III ) Claiming a Defensive Strategy to Remove Doubts of the 
International Society
Based on the thought to “focus on the Taiwan Strait, manage the South China Sea, stabilize sensitive regions, and step up border control,” the PRC is strengthening targeted exercises, but also intentionally emphasizing “self-defense” and “striking only after the enemy has struck” to remove doubts of the international society on its military expansion. Although the PRC publicly claimed that it hopes to peacefully resolve the dispute across the Taiwan Strait, the PLA has the ability to intimidate Taiwan with military force. It is apparent that the PRC’s thought on “driving unification with military force” and military preparations against Taiwan were not adjusted as cross-Strait relations

       Part 1 Strategic Environment 
Chapter 2 Security Challengeimproved.
II. Current Status of the PRC’s Military Preparedness
The PRC is actively improving the management performance of its 
headquarters, and is adjusting the scale and outfit of military branches based on development requirements of information infrastructure, building an elite joint, multi-functional, and highly efficient force. The PRC’s defense technologies and indigenous weapons and equipment development capabilities have significantly improved as a result. In recent years, the PRC has actively strengthened its global reconnaissance and surveillance as well as regional strategic warning capabilities, and the new air defense missiles deployed along its southeast coast can reach airports in Taiwan and the patrol area of the ROC Air Force. Furthermore, the PRC is implementing military-civilian collaborative defense and autonomous air defense training, and has achieved the objective of cross military branch and cross department joint training.

weapons systems; the right is a 054 frigate made by the PRC. (photo: US Navy)
47
       In response to strategic force buildup requirements for the East China Sea, 
South China Sea, and open sea operations, the PRC will continue to conduct cross fleet and cross military branch joint training, and actively develop and procure advanced combat and support aircraft for future operational requirements. The PLA Ground Force consists of composite forces that carry out sea and air joint landing, blockade, and firepower strike exercises along its southeast coast targeting nearby islands. These exercises enhance its amphibious landing operations, cross-region mobility operations, air strike, joint air defense, special operations, and informatized command and control capabilities.The PLA sequentially completed its organizational restructuring and integration from 2011 to 2012 according to the training reform plan of the Twelfth Five-year Plan.

The PRC is planning high-tech developments with the purpose of deterring and denying intervention from foreign military forces when there is a conflict or other sudden incidents in the Taiwan Strait.
( I ) The PRC's Defense Budget
As a result of its economic development, the PRC’s defense budget has averaged double digit growth every year to reach second in the world. In terms of budgeting and execution, its defense budget is mainly used to upgrade the PLA ’s overall capabilities, traditional and non-traditional weapons, aerospace, manpower and training, and to achieve strategic objectives of its policy to “build a modernized defense and elite force.” Since the PRC’s defense budget of GDP Total of GDP Growth %Converted into US$100

countries consider the PRC to be a potential threat and believe that it might start a new armaments race, affecting regional security and stability. The PRC’s defense budget from 2004 to 2013 is shown in 
Table 2-1 .
1. Budget Overview
The PRC's defense budget was RMB720.2 billion (roughly US$116.3 billion) in 2013, growing 7.4% compared with the 2012 budget (RMB670.3 billion, roughly US$106.4 billion). According to “China's National Defense in 2010” and the 2012 report “The Diversified Employment of China’s Armed Forces,” the increased defense budget was mainly used to increase salaries for its servicemen, improve conditions for coast guard and forces in remote and difficult regions, increase non-war military operation capabilities and infrastructure, ensure earthquake disaster relief, and carry Year Budget Total Budget Growth % Execution Total Execution Growth %Execution Compared

Chapter 2 Security Challengeout convoy missions in the Gulf of Aden and Somali waters. However, 
considering the cost of procuring, modifying, outfitting, and maintaining new strategic equipment, the budget announced by the PRC cannot support other military developments, indicating that its actual expenditure must be concealed in other non-military budgets.
2. Immense Hidden Budget
In response to requirements of defense missions, the PRC is actively purchasing new weapons and equipment from Russia, and uses arms purchases to negotiate technology transfers; the PRC also uses reverse engineering together with its scientific research results to indigenously develop weapons and equipment, hoping to achieve national defense autonomy. The PRC’s expenditure on defense technology research, weapons sales income, weapons procurement expenditure, revenue of defense industries, and expenses of the People’s Armed Police (listed under the public security budget) have all been excluded from its defense budget. Considering that the various expenses are distributed under different departments, we can determine that there remains immense expenses concealed under non-military budget items, and that the PRC’s actual defense spending is 2 to 3 times the amount it discloses (roughly US$232.7-349.0 billion).
3. Rapid Increase of the Budget of the People’s Armed Police
While the PRC promoted economic development, local governments adopted the policy to put economic development above all else, and used public power to remove all investment obstacles, which led to frequent large scale protests and conflicts. Furthermore, the PRC considers separatism in Tibet and Xinjiang to be a serious threat to the stability of its borders. For this reason, the People’s Armed Police’s budget has showed double digit growth every year since 2006, purchasing new equipment to 
51
       carry out missions for maintaining stability and handling conflicts, so as 
to ensure regional stability and the CCP’s political power. The People’s Armed Police’s budget and execution from 2004 to 2013 is shown in 
Table 
2-2.
( II ) Deployment of New Strategic Equipment
To realize its military modernization and in response to multiple military threats, the PRC in recent years has been actively developing new unmanned aircraft, fighters, stealth bombers, nuclear-powered submarine and submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missile, aircraft carrier, helicopter carrier, and carrier-based aircraft.
1.  Current Status of Strategic Equipment
The PRC’s first aircraft carrier Liao Ning was formally handed over to the Navy for training; nuclear-powered attack submarines and ballistic missile submarines have been handed over to fleets for service, and are currently testing the JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missile; the Air Force has been outfitted with the new strategic bomber and air-refueling tanker, and the Second Artillery has been outfitted with new tactical (strategic) missiles and new strategic nuclear missiles.
2. Development of New Equipment
The PLA is actively developing and modifying weapons and equipment, such as the Ground Force’s new heavy tanks, armed reconnaissance, transport, and attack helicopters; the Navy’s helicopter carriers, aircraft carriers (traditional and nuclear powered), amphibious landing vessels, new warships, and new nuclear-powered submarines; the Air Force’s stealth bombers, stealth fighters (fourth and fifth generation fighters), ships          unmanned aircraft, large warning aircraft, large (medium) transport 
aircraft, and long-range bombers; the Second Artillery’s new tactical (strategic)

Chapter 2 Security Challengemissiles.
3. Current Status of Foreign Military Purchases
The PRC has continued to purchase large hovercrafts, AIP traditional submarines, 
Su-35 fighters, and D-30KP-2 engine from Russia and Ukraine. It has further purchased Ka-28 and Ka-31 helicopters for its aircraft carrier Liaoning, and has developed new warning and anti-submarine helicopters through reverse engineering.
( III ) Active Management of the East China Sea and South China Sea
After cross-Strait relations gradually relaxed, although the Taiwan Strait remains the strategic emphasis of the PRC, the strategic importance of the East China Sea and South China Sea has significantly increased. The PRC is currently actively managing its air superiority in the regions, expanding Far Sea contingency response forces, and has delivered the first aircraft carrier to its Navy to declare its sovereignty. When ships of the PRC and the Philippines confronted each other in the South China Sea, and when Japan raised the dispute over sovereignty of Diaoyutai, the PRC immediately assembled a mobile fleet to the sea areas of dispute.
1. Management of the East China Sea to Safeguard Sovereignty of Diaoyutai
Due to the naming and nationalization of uninhabited islands of Diaoyutai by Japan, the PRC dispatched military aircraft and ships to gradually expand the patrol intensity of Diaoyutai and surrounding sea areas. This also caused Japan to strengthen surveillance over surrounding sea areas and air space, and strengthen its defense capabilities via the “Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan,” resulting in numerous confrontations between the PRC and Japan.
2. Management of the South China Sea to Safeguard Sovereignty of 
Islands in the Region
Disputes in the South China Sea and exclusive economic zone issues 
53
       are affected by claimant countries and the PRC’s sovereignty protection 
and military deployment, becoming a new factor in regional stability. At present, Vietnam purchased high-tech weapons from Russia in hopes of matching the PRC. After the confrontation between ships of the PRC and the Philippines in March 2013, the US and Philippines expanded their 29
th 
Balikatan Exercises in April 2013, and the Philippines agreed to let the US used its military bases, forming a challenge to the PRC in managing the South China Sea and safeguarding island sovereignty.
3. Strengthening Public Ship Support Mechanisms
The PRC handed over 10 decommissioned Navy ships that were refitted to the China Maritime Surveillance and China Fisheries Law Enforcement Command to better defend its sovereignty in sea areas. During annual training evaluations and live exercises, the ships are assembled under the State Oceanic Administration as ocean pollution monitoring ships to carry out guard missions, so as to strengthen the command and control mechanism between ships. Starting in January 2013, Hainan Province’s Public Security Department and Border Control Department authorized the boarding, detaining and chasing away of foreign ships illegally in sea areas under its jurisdiction in accordance with the “Hainan Province Coastal Border Control Regulations.” This is expected to make the PRC’s force utilization at sea even more flexible.
( IV ) Strengthening A2/AD Capabilities
The PRC believes that in the event it uses military force against Taiwan, its greatest threat is the intervention of foreign forces. Therefore, in order to effectively resist and deter foreign forces from intervening, the PLA is actively developing regional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems and new weapons to gradually enhance its comprehensive A2/AD capabilities in the West Pacific. Furthermore, the PRC is actively conducting exercises 
54
       Part 1 Strategic Environment 
Chapter 2 Security Challengefor its action plans in response to possible intervention operations of foreign 
forces. The PLA Navy’s fleets once simultaneously traveled to the waters of Okinotorishima for cross-region Far Sea training, conducting drills of the action plan to resist foreign forces, so as to gain superiority within the first island chain and gradually achieve strategic objectives of Far Sea defense.
( V ) Response to Multiple Security Threats
To execute diverse military missions, the PRC utilizes international organizations, such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), to organize joint counter-terrorism and joint search and rescue exercises in sea areas around the Asia-Pacific with multiple countries, using the exercises to strengthen its influence on international affairs. Furthermore, the PRC expanded 
PLA Navy vessels passed through the Osumi Strait, Japan and its operations 
crossed over the Bonin Islands into the West Pacific, indicating that the PRC has 
extended its reach beyond the first island chain and expanded trainings are the new norm.
55
       non-war military operations training, increasing the ratio of simulated training 
for high-tech weapons and equipment, and emphasizing exercises related to nighttime, complex climate, and complex electromagnetic environments. This shows that the PLA is capable of effectively completing diverse military and non-military missions under multiple security threats.
( VI ) Significant Expansion of Maritime Operations
The PRC began actively managing the South China Sea in 2010, and accelerated its force buildup at the same time, strengthening its sea and air superiority to declare its sovereignty. PLA Navy vessels passed through the Osumi Strait, Japan twice and its operations crossed over the Bonin Islands into the West Pacific, indicating that the PRC is exercising its right of freedom of navigation on high seas and expand its training sea area. PLA Navy fleets conducted roughly 30 cross region Far Sea trainings from 2005 to 2013, reaching as far as the area east of the Ogasawara Islands, showing its ambition to achieve Far Sea defense.

2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 1 Strategic Environment 
Chapter 2 Security ChallengeSection 2  Military Capabilities and Threat of the 
PRC
The PRC published its Defense White Paper “The Diversified Employment 
of China’s Armed Forces” in April 2013, in which it stressed the purpose for strengthening defense infrastructure was to safeguard national sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity. Although the PRC claims that it will not invade others for expansion in hopes of eliminating concerns of other countries related to the China Threat Theory, it directly put on paper its six core interests, namely national sovereignty, national security, territorial integrity, unification, political system, and sustainable economic and social development, as well as separatism of Taiwan independence, Tibet independence and Xinjiang independence, and sovereignty disputes in the East China Sea and South China Sea, strictly prohibiting foreign forces from interfering with China’s domestic affairs. The PRC made clear that it will never back down when defending its territory and sovereignty.
I. The PRC’s Military Capabilities
The PRC has invested immense funds into national defense, is actively implementing defense modernization, and has accelerated “mechanization” and “informatization,” carrying out military training under conditions of informatization to strengthen its ability to “win a local war under conditions of informatization.” As a result, the PRC is capable of blockading Taiwan and seizing our offshore islands. A comparison of the military capabilities of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is shown in 
Table 2-3.
( I ) Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Capabilities
In order to compensate for its surveillance and reconnaissance blind spots, the PRC strengthened its real-time target indentitication ability to satisfy requirements of reconnaissance, missile warning, target surveillance, identification, and operation command and control. The PRC further deployed 
57
       strategic unmanned reconnaissance aircraft and established a data link 
communication system. Furthermore, the PRC’s UA Vs conducted operations in the sea area of the Diaoyutai Islands for the first time on September 9
th, 
2013, from which we know that its current surveillance and reconnaissance forces and range can achieve all hour military command, control, intelligence and communication for all regions west of the first island chain, enabling it to effectively carry out long-range precision strikes. The PRC’s capabilities are enough to support the use of military force for resolving the Taiwan issue and disputes in the East China Sea and South China Sea.
( II ) Capabilities of the PLA Ground Force
The PLA Ground Force has a total of roughly 1.25 million servicemen, in which roughly 400 thousand are stationed at borders. The Ground Force is undergoing modernization, mechanization and force restructuring into a flatter hierarchy under the strategic guidance of “global mobility and solid attack and defense.” Furthermore, it is conducting technological group training for armored vehicles, air defense, ground forces, land and air collaboration, and electronic warfare, and has stepped up training for military operations against Taiwan, land and air joint operations, and cross-region mobility operations, aiming to strengthen its overall strike, defense, and command and control capabilities. To gradually enhance land and air integration, long-range mobility, rapid strike, and special operations capabilities, the Ground Force conducts intensive joint landing exercises to become familiar with tactics and strategies of landing operations. The PLA Ground Force is capable of conducting triphibian landing operations to seize offshore islands of the ROC.
( III ) Capabilities of the PLA Navy
Vessel modernization is a priority of the PLA Navy’s force buildup to satisfy Far Sea strategic requirements, in which the aircraft carrier Liao Ning was already formally handed over to the Navy. The Navy is actively replacing new nuclear and traditional powered submarines; surface ships are equipped with YJ series

       Part 1 Strategic Environment 
Chapter 2 Security Challengeanti-ship missiles and HQ series air defense missiles; built new 094 nuclear-
powered submarines carrying ballistic missiles; replaced old 091 nuclear-powered attack submarines and 092 nuclear-powered missile attack submarines. Furthermore, the Navy continues to use exercises and Far Sea patrol training to test its plans for operations against Taiwan and resisting foreign forces, so as to enhance its comprehensive sea control operational capabilities. The Navy’s ability to carry out diverse military missions is further verified through convoy Table  2-3 Comparison of Military Strength on Both Sides of the Taiwan Strait

( IV ) Capabilities of the PLA Air Force
To achieve the strategic requirements of “from homeland air defense to balanced offense and defense,” “from quantity to quality and performance,” and “from tactics to strategies,” the PLA Air Force modified its H-6 bombers into air-refueling tankers, and purchased D-30KP-2 engines from Russia to enhance its performance and range; accelerated the commissioning of J-15 and J-16 fighters, and is developing J-20 and J-31 stealth fighters and new warning aircraft to enhance strike and aerial command and control capabilities. The PLA Air Force has also deployed HQ and S series air defense missiles, unmanned aircraft,

weapons at the borders, hoping to build complete air defense anti-missile, air strike, warning and reconnaissance, strategic delivery, and strategic deterrence capabilities. The above shows that the PLA Air Force is already capable of fighting for air superiority and control over the first island chain.
( V ) Capabilities of the PLA Second Artillery
Under the strategic guidance to “prevent crises, control the war situation, and win the war,” the PLA Second Artillery not only focuses on the development and deployment of new DF-21D ballistic missiles, as well as the replacement of old equipment, but also aims to also meets requirements of “possessing both nuclear and traditional” and “emphasizing both deterrence and combat” to enhance overall joint operations capabilities, so as to effectively carry out strategic (tactical) operations. At present, the Second Artillery has deployed 
The PLA Navy is actively replacing new nuclear and traditional powered 
submarines based on its Far Sea strategic requirements, developing towards 
vessel modernization.
61
       over 1,400 missiles that can be used for operations against Taiwan. Combined 
with the Navy and Air Force, the PLA is now capable of conducting large scale joint firepower strikes and denying foreign forces from intervening in disputes across the Taiwan Strait. Furthermore, the PRC has adopted the principles “general, serial, and module” to develop towards the second island chain and achieve strategic objective of denying foreign forces. The PRC developed multiple new missiles, including the DF-21D missile, to satisfy requirements of diverse military missions, including ground, anti-carrier, and nuclear strike operations.
( VI ) Information and Electronic Warfare Capabilities
To strengthen the effectiveness of joint operations against Taiwan, electronic warfare forces at each level of the PLA have completed the use of communications interference equipment, anti-radiation weapons, and independently produced long-range electronic jammers in simulations of the electronic environment in the Taiwan Strait. The PLA conducted attack and defense exercises targeting weaknesses of command and control systems of the US and Japan, hoping to gain electromagnetic control throughout the entire battle. The PLA has conducted joint electronic warfare exercises, which integrate information and electronic technologies in joint operations exercises to increase the performance of equipment and flexibility of tactics and strategy. Determining based on the PLA ’s force deployment and electronic warfare equipment, the PLA is capable of electromagnetic parameter reconnaissance and possesses initial capabilities of blocking and interfering with the surveillance, reconnaissance, command, and control system of the ROC Armed Forces.
( VII ) Military Cyber Capabilities
The PRC’s 4 headquarters, 7 military regions, defense technology research agencies, defense mobilization, intelligence, and militia departments form its basic cyber-attack and defense capabilities. Starting in 2010, the PRC began 
62
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 1 Strategic Environment 
Chapter 2 Security Challengedeveloping new spy software to steal classified information on the internet. The 
software was developed with automated functions capable of changing data encryption, concealing transfer channels, and countering tracing attempts by network security personnel.
( VIII ) Military Aerospace Capabilities
The PRC’s satellites are divided into 6 categories, namely reconnaissance and surveillance; communication, command and control; navigation and positioning; meteorological observation; resource prospecting; and scientific experiment. The Beidou navigation satellite developed by the PRC is already capable of covering the Asia-Pacific, and will reach the strategic objective of covering the entire world by 2020. The PRC is also actively developing high resolution ground observation, global positioning, and large capacity communication satellites, as well as large payload rockets, so as to further enhance the PLA ’s surveillance, reconnaissance, command, control, and precision strike capabilities.
II. PRC Military Preparedness against Taiwan
The PRC’s military strengthen has rapidly expanded in recent years. However, its strategic intent remains unclear and the military continues to lack transparency. Hence, its strong awareness and actions to defend territorial sovereignty and gain maritime interests have become a potential threat to regional peace and stability. Moreover, the PRC emphasized that “Taiwan is China’s core interest and it will not renounce the use of military force,” indicating that the risk of military conflict across the Taiwan Strait continues to exist.
( I ) Organization Adjustment and Emphasis on Modernization
The PLA established the “Military Reform Master Plan Before 2020” at the end of 2010 based on mechanization, informatization and collaboration requirements. Starting in June 2011, the PLA sequentially completed its 
63
       organizational reform and adjustments, and its strategic focus gradually moved 
towards the West Pacific and South China Sea. The PLA adjusted its force buildup, including the Navy, Air Force and Second Artillery, to “deny foreign forces” and cohere with the strategic development of defense modernization. Its development towards an extrovert military and military power has gradually increased the contrast of military strength across the Taiwan Strait.
( II ) Improving Surveillance and Reconnaissance Equipment and 
Deployment
Besides accelerating military branch developments, the PRC is also actively combining strengths of military, civilian and international cooperation, and is gradually building intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms. Based on the size and deployment of surveillance and reconnaissance forces of the PRC, the diversity of its surveillance and reconnaissance measures, and its reconnaissance range covering all of East Asia, its capabilities are enough to support the use of military means to resolve the “Taiwan issue” and territorial disputes in the East China Sea and South China Sea.
( III ) Upgrading Weapons for Deterrence
To achieve capability requirements of A2/AD, the PRC is dedicated to upgrading new deterrence weapons and military modernization to deter foreign forces from intervening. The PRC currently has a variety of tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, air-to-ground precision missiles, and precision bombs, in which tactical ballistic missiles are capable of carrying different kinds of warheads for attacking different types of targets; air-launched precision missiles are capable of attacking ground command and control systems, and are characterized by their diversity, large range, and multiple tactical applications.
( IV ) Incorporating the Three Warfares into Military Thought
To follow through with its preparations for military conflict with Taiwan, the PRC strengthens its psychological warfare advantages through the Political Warfare Regulations and Outline of the Three Warfares, and integrates politics, 
64
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 1 Strategic Environment 
Chapter 2 Security Challengeeconomics, diplomacy, military, and psychology into its modern military 
thought, developing towards combining military and non-military missions. The PRC uses “public opinion warfare” to raise national consciousness, gain international support, and deter enemy forces; it uses “psychological warfare” based on the two-hand strategy of peace and war to deter and destroy the enemy’s will of resistance; it uses “legal warfare” to establish the legitimacy of its wars in an attempt to win great victories in small battles or win without war.
( V ) Expanding Results of Military Soft Power
In recent years, the PRC has been devoted to developing its military soft power, in which main measures include strengthening political work, core values of military personnel, talent cultivation, all-out defense, foreign military sales, increasing its defense budget, military promotion talent cultivation, celebrations, and completing its military operations legal systems, aiming to gain the ability to win over and control other states through conciliation.
(VI) Cultivating Military Talents for Joint Operations
With consideration to future forms of warfare, the PRC released the “Military Talent Development Outline Before 2020,” in 2012, which plans military talent cultivation for joint operations, dividing them into four levels - basic command, military branch command, collaborative operation command, and joint operation command, forming a system of cultivation by level supported by job training, and training coherent with application, hoping to cultivate cross region and cross military branch joint operations command talents.
(VII) Building Diverse Military Capabilities
The PRC has carried out organization adjustments and outfitting, stepped up joint training of different military branches, procured (modified) high-tech weapons, and established strategic (tactical) unit intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms. Determining based on its military modernization progress, strategic ideology development, force structure and deployment, and 
65
       weapons research and development, the PRC now possesses air-and-ground 
reconnaissance and surveillance methods, versatile firepower, and multiple intimidation options, which increases the intensity of its subsequent military operations and benefits mobile adjustment of force deployment.
III. The PRC’s Military Threat to Taiwan
The PRC stresses that the “Taiwan independence separatist force” and its activities are still the greatest threat to the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, and pointed out that the PRC’s purpose for strengthening defense infrastructure is to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity. During the 18
th National Congress, the PRC revealed that it will 
continue to carry out preparations for military conflict, build a powerful military force that matches its international status, and follow the “three step” strategic concept to make significant progress in mechanization and informatization by 2020. The PRC’s military modernization still emphasizes the development and deployment of high-tech weapons, the development of cyber force attack and defense technologies, and the enhancement of overall capabilities via a number of measures, including mobilizing fighters and air defense missile forces to borders, the navy conducting cross region Far Sea training, and tri-force joint landing exercises. The PRC plans to build comprehensive capabilities for using military force against Taiwan by 2020. In the future, the PRC will continue to use joint operations as the basic form of operations, and aims to effectively prevent foreign forces from intervening in its operations against Taiwan, posing a growing threat.

       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 1 Strategic Environment 
Chapter 2 Security ChallengeSection 3  Security Challenges of the ROC
The PRC's military threat remains the primary challenge in our current security 
environment. The PRC has not renounced the use of military force against Taiwan, and its defense budget has maintained double-digit annual growth rate for over twenty years. This has driven its military development and significantly improved its weapons and equipment development capabilities, continuously enhancing its military deterrence, which forms a major threat to our national defense. Furthermore, disputes over island sovereignty in East Asia and maritime rights and interests have escalated in recent years, as well as domestic issue such as growing non-traditional security threats  the economic downturn, changes in demographic structure (low birth rates), increasing threat of natural disasters, cyber-attacks and the gradually weakening defense awareness among citizens. These are all challenges to our national security that may not be overlooked.
I. Rapid Expansion of the PRC’s Military Strength
The PRC’s comprehensive national power has rapidly grown in recent years, and with the substantial increase of its defense budget, the PLA ’s capabilities have significantly increased, accelerating the imbalance of military strength across the Taiwan Strait and tilting situation in their favor. The PLA ’s overall ability to blockade Taiwan and seize offshore islands is a serious threat to our national security. The PLA ’s strength will continue to grow within the foreseeable future, and it will actively develop A2/AD strategies and tactics, develop long-range precision weapons, and extend its power projection range, which will become challenges to our national security.Threatened by the PRC’s refusal to renounce the use of military force against Taiwan, our national defense policy is to build a “Hard ROC” defense force, and to adopt “innovative/asymmetric” concepts based on trends of the security environment, technological innovations, and strategic requirements, so as to enhance joint operations performance, establish a robust armaments 
67
       development mechanism, and combine the people’s strength to develop a “small 
but superb, strong and smart” elite force that can defend the ROC’s sovereignty and national interests, as well as maintain peace and security in the Taiwan Strait.
II. Sovereignty Claims over Disputed Islands and Maritime 
Rights and Interests
Regional conflicts over island sovereignty and maritime rights and interests are also security challenges to the ROC, in which the disputes over Diaoyutai and islands in the South China Sea are especially complex. In recent years, these disputes have caused confrontation between law enforcement ships of different countries or military conflicts and operations, directly affecting our national security. The government calls on countries surrounding the East China Sea and South China Sea to exercise self-restraint, to resolve disputes via negotiation and dialogue mechanisms, and to avoid armed conflicts based on the fundamental principle that “safeguarding sovereignty, shelving disputes, pursuing peace and reciprocity, and promoting joint exploration and development.” The ROC Armed Forces will continue to strengthen maritime patrol capabilities, and use military strength to maintain island sovereignty, maritime rights and interests, and freedom of citizens to navigate through public sea.
III. Defense Resource Constraints
The Financial Tsunami and European Debt Crisis indirectly led to an economic downturn in the ROC, and defense resources gradually decreased as the government’s financial situation became more and more difficult. Yet, as factors causing instability in the Taiwan Strait continue to exist, it is necessary to continue purchasing or developing asymmetric and innovative weapons to enhance our defense capabilities. Furthermore, military personnel salary increase, benefits, and service environment improvement in coordination with the implementation of voluntarism will also be a burden on the defense budget.
68
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 1 Strategic Environment 
Chapter 2 Security ChallengeUnder the challenge of the government’s financial burden, the ROC Armed 
Forces must continue to allocate a reasonable and suitable budget, refine the armaments management mechanism, suitably allocate and use defense financial resources, and maximize the effectiveness of the defense budget, so as to alleviate the impact of mid- to long-term administrative plans. At the same time, the MND encourages the private sector to participate in the development and production of military products, and seeks for maintenance technologies of high-tech weapons and equipment that are procured to be transferred to domestic firms. Besides vitalizing the domestic industry and economy, these measures also benefit subsequent maintenance and upgrade of domestic industrial technologies.
IV. Low Birth Rates
Birth rates have sequentially decreased in recent years, and the number of young adults in the population structure also decreased. In the future, there will eventually be insufficient draft age men. Moreover, low birth rates will result in an aging and insufficient labor force, and affect overall economic development. In the light of changes in social and population structures, as well as warfare changes, the ROC Armed Forces will suitably streamline its force and gradually adjust the defense organization, force size and structure. Also, the military service system will be converted from conscription to voluntarism, and excellent long-term volunteer manpower will be recruited to maintain credible capabilities.
V. Disaster Relief and Response
Due to climate changes in recent years, the impact on national security of natural disasters and the complex disasters that they cause is not less than a war. With consideration to the threat of natural disasters, the ROC Armed Forces has listed “disaster relief” as one of its core missions, and enhances “military operations other than war” capabilities during regular exercises and 
69
       training. This will build a force with immediate disaster relief and contingency 
response capabilities, which are strengthened through proper pre-disaster planning, equipment, and disaster relief training. Furthermore, the ROC Armed Forces will closely cooperate with government agencies and local governments in disaster relief drills, complete human and material resource mobilization preparations, carry out resource integration, utilize private organizations, and build cross-area support capabilities. These measures aim to fully utilize the nation’s overall disaster relief, mitigation and prevention capabilities, and thus lower the threat of natural disasters on national security.
VI. Information Security
Cyberspace has become an important battlefield in modern warfare in a complex information and electronic warfare environment, and the PRC’s military cyber capabilities and hacking have become a threat to our national security. The PRC Cyber Force continues to use remote infiltration and viruses (malware) to infect, steal information or monitor our websites, affecting the normal operation of information systems. Once a conflict arises, these operations will enable them to cripple our command, control and logistics network, which will affect the normal operation of the ROC Armed Forces’ information systems, and delay its contingency response time.In the light of this, the ROC Armed Forces will persistently uphold information security and work with the national information security system, raising information security awareness through information security lectures, reports, sudden inspections, and contingency response exercises. In the future, the ROC Armed Forces will strengthen the protection of command, control, communication, and information platforms, increase the strength of overall information security, and ensure information security and a smooth network by enhancing information, network and electronic warfare defense capabilities.

Under the government's efforts, the situation across the Taiwan Strait has 
been peaceful and stable, and cross-Strait relations gradually relaxed, but this has also caused citizens to gradually lose their awareness of the enemy. Furthermore, the PRC utilizes the "three warfares" strategy, namely psychological warfare, public opinion warfare, and legal warfare, to weaken the people's awareness of the enemy and separate their unity, using the war fares to weaken their defense awareness and support for defense affairs.The ROC Armed Forces referred to the experiences of other countries in all-out defense education, and is actively integrating government, school, and social resources, implementing all-out defense education to raise citizen's defense awareness, and encourages the public to participate in defense affairs to gain their support of defense infrastructure, ensuring the nation's long-term stability and sustainable development.

The primary objective of our national defense policies is to build a “Hard 
ROC” defense force. The ROC Armed Forces will continue to implement national defense transformation and military preparations, in order to deter enemies from launching an attack and to achieve the goal of deterrence and war prevention. This will allow people to live in peace and prosperity and the nation to achieve sustainable development. On this basis, the seven strategies implemented at the current stage are as follows:
I. Build Credible Capabilities
Based on trends of the security situation, technological innovation and strategic requirements, the ROC Armed Forces will continue to reform its defense organization and modernize force structure, adopt “innovative/asymmetric” concepts, enhance joint operation effectiveness, establish a robust armaments development mechanism, and combine the strength of all citizens to deter any attempts to invade Taiwan. These measures will enable the ROC Armed Forces to serve as a strong support for peace across the Taiwan Strait, ROC territorial integrity and regional stability.
II. Demonstrate Defense Resolution
Military and civilian should demonstrate determination to defend national security by allocating a reasonable defense budget, carefully planning military investments, effectively distributing resources, facilitating development of self-reliant national defense, strengthening peacetime mobilization capabilities, and consolidating people’s will to fight against the enemy.
III. Safeguard Regional Stability
Under the government’s diplomatic policy, the MND will establish solid relations with friendly and allied countries, increase dialogues and exchanges on 
75
       regional security, and actively participate in international security affairs. Based 
on the principle of “safeguarding sovereignty, shelving disputes, pursuing peace and common interests, and promoting joint exploration and development,” the MND will support to secure our sovereignty over islands and maritime rights and interests, and jointly promote regional security and stability together under Asia-Pacific countries.
IV. Strengthen Intangible Combat Capabilities
The MND will build the ROC Armed Forces into a force with core values and military ethics that aims to consolidate national identity, shape military disciplines, foster military virtues, and build a sense of honor among military personnel.
V. Enhance Disaster Prevention and Relief Readiness
Based on the principle of “disaster relief is akin to fighting a battle” and guidance of “prepare for disasters in advance, deploy troops with an eye to disaster relief, and ensure readiness for rescue operations,” The ROC Armed Forces should strengthen disaster relief capabilities and assist disaster prevention in accordance with the law.
VI. Promote Volunteer Force
In consideration of the nation’s long-term development requirements, in response to the public’s expectations, and under the premise of effectively safeguarding national security and maintaining military obligation as stipulated in the Constitution, the military conscription is transforming into a volunteer force. The active duty force will entirely consist of volunteers, building a “small but superb, small but strong, small but smart” elite force.
VII. Improve Welfare for Military Personnel
Military servicemen defend the nation and people’s survival, rights and interests

with the support and encouragement of their families. Therefore, it is necessary to defend the dignity of military servicemen. The MND will continue to care for the welfare of military personnel, improve working conditions and provide better protection of their rights, at the same time, improving the quality of life for military families, providing comprehensive services and accommodations, offering better consultation for reterans, caring for veterans and military families living near military barracks, so as to boost the morale of the Armed Forces, and encourage military personnel to make the military their career 
choice.
77
       Section 2  National Defense Strategies
The MND establishes national defense strategies in response to changes in the 
internatonal strategic environment and security challenges faced by the nation, so as to ensure the nation’s survival and sustainable development. At the current stage, objectives of national defense strategies are war prevention, homeland defense, contingency response, conflict avoidance, and regional stability, which are further described below:
I. War Prevention
( I ) Strengthen Defensive Operations Readiness
The MND is actively implementing defense transformation, developing defense technologies, continuously procuring defensive weapons, establishing “innovative/asymmetric” capabilities, and strengthening force preservation and infrastructure protection capabilities. Furthermore, it is enhancing mobilization capabilities of reserve forces and implementing all-out defense to effectively defend homeland so as to demonstrate our determination to face any threat or 
challenge.
( II ) Promote Regional Military/Security Exchanges and Cooperation
Taiwan is located at the center of the First Island Chain of the West Pacific, an 
important geographic location in terms of military strategy. Hence, Taiwan maintains good relations with other countries through high level visits, security dialogues, track two exchanges, education and training, military procurement, and military assistance, and strives to engage in bilateral or multilateral military exchanges and cooperation, so as to collaboratively establish security 
mechanisms and maintain regional peace and stability.
( III ) Consolidate Defense Capabilities

Standing by the abovementioned principles, the ROC included contents of the “Missile Technology Control Regime” into the “Foreign Trade Act” in 1998 to provide a basis for transferring strategic high-tech commodities (SHTC), and has continuously controlled the export of sensitive technologies and missile systems.
84
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 2 General Plan of National Defense
Chapter 3 National Defense Strategy Section 3  Military Strategies
In consideration of the regional security environment and strategic postures of 
Taiwan and potential enemies, the ROC Armed Forces has adopted “resolute defense and credible deterrence” as its military strategic concept under the defense strategy guidance, and will never evoke war. Only when the enemy is persistent and war is inevitable will the ROC integrate its joint armed forces with all-out defense capabilities to engage in homeland defense, protect 
territorial integrity, and ensure national security.
I. Military Strategic Missions
In order to implement the military strategic concept of “resolute defense and 
credible deterrence,” the ROC Armed Forces must effectively carry out the 
following missions:
( I ) Resolute Defense to Ensure the Security of National Territories
In conducting defensive operations, the ROC Armed Forces need to survive 
the enemy’s first strike, avert decapitation, maneuver forces to counter strikes, and sustain operations. We will adopt fortified defensive, mutually support and recapture measures to achieve “strategic sustainment and tactical decisiveness.” Strategically, the ROC Armed Forces will assume a defensive posture to fight for time and space and create advantageous conditions. Tactically, the ROC Armed Forces need to fully utilize favorable conditions of force, space and timing, effectively counterstrike, apply all-out defense to resist enemy invasions 
and ensure homeland security.
( II ) Credible Deterrence of Any Hostile Intention to Launch an Attack
The ROC Armed Forces will persistently carry out force training and 
readiness preparations, and integrate operational capabilities of weapons systems belonging to each armed service, thereby enhancing joint operation performance and overall capabilities. This will force the enemy to consider the 
costs and risks of war, and thus deter any hostile intention to launch an attack.
85
       (III)Counter Blockade to Maintain Sea and Air Lines of 
Communication
Most of the ROC’s major livelihood and strategic supplies are imported. 
Therefore, sea and air lines of communication are critical to national survival. In peacetime, the ROC Armed Forces need to maintain security in surrounding airspace and waters. In wartime, it will integrate joint operations capabilities to counter the enemy’s blockade forces against Taiwan, open safe air and sea transportation routes, maintain communication to the outside world, and ensure 
the continuity of its capabilities.
(IV) Joint Interdiction to Delay Enemies from Approaching the 
Homeland
The ROC Armed Forces follows guidelines of defensive operations in learning 
the enemy’s route of approach, and utilizes temporal and spatial factors in seizing advantageous tactical positions, where it can utilize joint capabilities and gather superior forces and firepower for joint interdiction and striking the 
enemy when transiting across the Taiwan Strait.
( V ) Ground Defense to Deny Enemy Landing and Setting Footholds
If the enemy attempts an amphibious landing with its superior naval and air 
support, the ROC Armed Forces needs to apply the overall capabilities of all-out defense, construct defensive systems in the entire in-depth defense area, and conduct continuous counter strikes to defeat enemy forces at the beachhead 
before lodgments are secured.
II. Future Requirements for Defensive Operations
In order to fulfill the missions defined in the military strategies and address the 
conditions of battlefields in the Taiwan Strait, characteristics of modern warfare, and developments in military technologies and weapons systems, the ROC Armed Forces’ readiness for future defensive operations needs to be developed according to the following principles:
86
       Part 2 General Plan of National Defense
Chapter 3 National Defense Strategy ( I )Force planning, building and deployment must focus on preventing 
enemy’s possible surprise attack, decapitation, paralysis or other 
asymmetrical operations, and also focus on strengthening far-seas rapid response and recovery capabilities, gradually building a modernized defense force that satisfies requirements of defensive operations.
(II)Capabilities of all services (or branches), force structure, command 
mechanisms, military doctrines, tactics and strategies, and education/training should be integrated toward joint operations, in hopes of multiplying combat capabilities and gaining local battlefield superiority.
(III)All major weapon systems and platforms should be linked to reduce the 
time required for the cycle of “detection - processing - decision - action”, so that integrated warfighting capabilities can meet the objectives of effective and rapid command and control, real-time and uninterrupted

       communication, and precise and highly effective firepower.
(IV) Facing the threat of high-intensity minimum-warning assaults, the ROC 
Armed Forces, in terms of defensive operations, should emphasize 
redundant capacity and sustainability of operation functions, and enhance critical infrastructure protection to avoid main combat capabilities being paralyzed in the initial stage of military operations, and thereafter failing to achieve strategic sustainment.
(V) Considering the reality that the ROC Armed Forces will be outnumbered 
in defensive operations, capability development should emphasize effectiveness of contingency operations and force/firepower mobility for swifter response and smarter maneuvers, which will enable the ROC Armed Forces to take advantage of tactical situation and reverse unfavorable conditions.
(VI) Develop the ROC Armed Forces’ “innovative/asymmetric” capabilities 
targeting at the enemy’s COG and critical vulnerabilities, to utilize the advantages in time and space in defensive operations to disrupt or paralyze enemy attacks.
(VII ) The ROC Armed Forces carries out military mobilization preparations 
that integrate personnel, equipment and training based on the military strategic concept of “regular forces conduct strikes and reserve forces defend the homeland.” Furthermore, military mobilization preparations will be integrated with the administrative mobilization system, so that manpower and materials can be rapidly mobilized to reinforce the armed forces’ capabilities, and enable defensive operations to be successfully carried out.
III. Force Buildup Plans and Objectives
The ROC Armed Forces established force buildup policies and objectives are based on considerations of future strategic situations, the PRC’s military threat, Revolution in Military Affairs, projections of defense resources,

Part 2 General Plan of National Defense
Chapter 3 National Defense Strategy and requirements of defensive operations, drawing out specific plans for a 
modernized defense force. This will establish reliable warfighting capabilities required for the strategic objective of “resolute defense and credible deterrence.” The acquisition and development of major weaponry and equipment are summarized as follows:
( I ) Information and Electronic Warfare
The new generation satellite communications system will continue to be upgraded, radio models will be replaced, information and electronic warfare equipment will be developed, and defense capabilities of critical C2 (command and control) posts will be further solidified, establishing an automated comprehensive C4ISR system and cyber protection and counter attack management system capabilities.
( II ) Joint Counter Air Operations
Procuring advanced high performance fighters and upgrading capabilities of Chingkuo Fighters (Indigenous Defense Fighter, IDF), as well as F-16A/B fighters will equip the Armed Forces with long-range and beyond visual range (BVR) combat, advanced electronic warfare system, and air-to-ground and air-to-sea missile capabilities. Furthermore, by procuring the Patriot III missile system, enhancing the performance of the Patriot II missile system, and building ground-based air defense missile systems, the ROC Armed Forces will gain mid-range anti-missile, low altitude air defense and mobile anti-aircraft missile system capabilities.
( III ) Joint Sea Control Operations
Procurement of diesel-electric submarines, P-3C long-range fixed-wing anti-submarine aircraft, Perry class frigate, high performance combat ships, and minehunters will enhance the Armed Forces 3 dimensional joint sea control capabilities, and strengthen counter blockade and joint interdiction capabilities. In addition, fuel and fast combat support ships, rescue ships, and amphibious 
89
       transport docks will be constructed to maintain the capabilities of surface 
operation groups, thus building a sea control force with ASW, AAW and regional maritime surveillance capabilities.
( IV ) Homeland Defense Operations
The continued procurement of new attack and utility helicopters, armored infantry combat vehicles, and short-range anti-armor missiles will further enhance surveillance and mobile strike capabilities of ground forces. Furthermore, disaster relief becoming one of the ROC Armed Forces’ main missions, a number of disaster prevention and relief equipment will be procured, including new amphibious assault vehicles, CNBR (i.e. chemical, nuclear, biological and radilogical) protection equipment, and de-contamination equipment so as to gain emergency response, counter-terrorism support, and CNBR protection capability.

Administration
The ROC Armed Forces has been actively implementing defense 
transformation in recent years to adapt to various forms of challenge. 
The MND recently amended and enacted the “six defense organization acts,” which makes high level staff organizations more efficient and the force structure more robust based on the principles of “streamlining high level staff organizations” and “eliminating outdated equipment.” At the same time, the MND carefully considers administration plans and carries out defense readiness and disaster prevention and relief work.
92
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 2 General Plan of National Defense
Chapter 4 National Defense AdministrationSection 1  Military Strength Reformation
The ROC Armed Forces builds a defense organization capable of satisfying 
future warfare requirements based on the enemy threat, national security situation, overall resource allocation, and transformation into volunteer force. Furthermore, it concentrates defense resources under cost considerations to build joint operation forces so as to create a relative advantage in key situations, thus achieving strategic sustainment and winning victory in defensive operations.
I. Building a Modernized Defense Force
The ROC Armed Forces is enhancing joint operation capabilities with an emphasis on “basic capabilities,” “innovative/asymmetric capabilities,” “force preservation” and “disaster prevention and relief.” It has concentrated and utilized defense resources in coordination with available financial resources and the force buildup plan. New weapons and equipment will continue to be procured to increase the cost of using military force against Taiwan, achieving “deterrence and war prevention.” In addition, the MND will continue to procure advanced weapon systems that are defensive in nature, cannot be indigenously produced or replaced, and carry out technology transfer to achieve autonomous national defense.
II.Continued Force Restructuring
The MND has continued to implement the “Jingtsui Program” and will reduce the personnel quota of the ROC Armed Forces from 275,000 to 215,000 by the end of 2014 based on the principle of “streamlining the regular force and extensively building the reserve force.” Furthermore, military services organization will continue to maintain combined arms brigades, fleets, and wings, and concentrate resources in combat forces to ensure that joint defensive operations are successfully carried out.
93
       Section 2  Military Service Reformation
In the light of future digitized battlefield environments and high-tech weapons 
and equipment, the ROC Armed Forces require highly professional servicemen with long-term commitments. However, due to the shortened mandatory military service in the ROC, conscripted servicemen are near the end of their service period once they become skilled in a certain specialty, and it is thus difficult to maintain a professional force with expertise. The military service system will be changed from “both conscription and voluntarism” towards “volunteer force” to build a highly professional elite force, maintain a small force during peacetime and have a large force available during wartime, and fit in with the future strategic environment, and strengthen national competitveness. The MND hopes to thus recruit high quality servicemen with long-term commitments and build an elite armed forces.
I. Epochal Transformation of Military Service Systems
The ROC Armed Forces will step up talent recruitment to reach policy objectives of volunteer force and properly utilizes its human resources under the premise of a fair military service. The Executive Yuan organized the “Volunteer Force Promotion Ad Hoc Group”, supervises and integrates interagency resources, and implements measures associated with human resources, financial resources, military service adjustment, and talent recruitment for volunteer force, as well as retention, training, and veterans affairs while taking government’s financial situation into consideration. Furthermore, the mandatory term of service was reduced from 1 year to 4 months in accordance with the law. This measure extensively builds the reserve force both in quantity and quality, and aims to achieve military service transformation.
( I ) Recruiting High Quality Manpower
To steadily promote volunteer force and satisfy manpower requirements of the ROC Armed Forces, besides revising laws and orders, the MND has referred to 
94
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 2 General Plan of National Defense
Chapter 4 National Defense Administrationthe methods of advanced countries for forming a volunteer force and revised its 
timetable and regulations. Furthermore, the MND is actively planning support measures, such as adjusting the starting salary of volunteer soldiers, additional pay for combat forces, and retention compensation, to attract outstanding youth to join the military, and thereby recruit the manpower that is needed.
(II) Converting Military Training
Starting from 2013, young men who were born after 1994 receive 4 months of military training as their regular service. The military training is implemented in two stages - recruit and specialty training. New recruit training fosters qualities of a soldier and is when draft age men learn basic combat skills. Training is intensified in the second stage to meet requirements of “strict and difficult,” so that draft age men are equipped with specialties of their military branch. After training is completed, servicemen are added to the reserve mobilization system and expand capabilities of reserve forces. (see 
Appendix 1 )
( III ) Improving the Military Service Environment
In coordination with economic development and trends in the social environment, the MND is improving servicemen’s living facilities, improving medical care and military dependents’ welfare, providing thorough career planning, and on-the-job training. The MND hopes to create an excellent military service environment, recruit competent youth to join the military, and make outstanding servicemen willing to remain in the military.
(IV) Timetable Adjustment in Response to Defense Requirements
The growth in number of volunteer servicemen did not meet expectations in the 1 year and 8 months from the beginning of 2012 until now. The Executive Yuan has approved the extension of the timetable for “voluntarism” to the end of 2016, during which draft age men born in and before 1993 will continue to be conscripted to perform military service, so as to satisfy the ROC Armed Forces’ manpower requirements for disaster relief, readiness exercises, and 
95
       contingency response missions. This extension will provide more sufficient time 
for recruiting volunteer servicemen and establishing well-rounded measures. Additionally, the quota for alternative military service of the Ministry of the Interior will be based on plans of the Executive Yuan, and will be distributed among government agencies to support their duties.
II. Enacting Military Service System Related Laws
( I ) Completing Laws and Regulations on Military Service System
The MND has completed legal procedures for amending the Act of Military Service System, Enforcement Rules of Military Service System and Act 
Starting from 2013, draft age men born after 1994 will receive 4-month military training. 
Upon completion of the training they will be included in the reserve mobilization system, and 
their capabilities will be validated via muster calls during Han Kuang Exercises each year, expanding capabilities of reserve forces.
96
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 2 General Plan of National Defense
Chapter 4 National Defense Administrationof Military Service for Volunteer Enlisted Soldiers with support from the 
Legislative Yuan, laying the legal foundation for volunteer force. The MND will continue to review laws, orders, and administrative rules on military service, recruitment, training, service, benefits, salary, insurance, and compensation, so that implementation of volunteer force will abide by administration according 
to law.
( II ) Revising the Deductable Military Training Time
The MND revised Article 16 of the Act of Military Service System to 
comply with the Executive Yuan’s guidance on “meeting military training requirements” as well as “actual review and reasonable reduction.” Draft age men who take and pass All-out Defense Education Military Training Courses offered in senior high or higher education schools may deduct up to 15 days from their regular service military training time so as to meet the principles of 
administration by law and fair military service.
97
       Section 3  Talent Cultivation
Talent cultivation in the ROC Armed Forces is purpose-oriented and plan-
based, and aims to build a military backbone with firm belief, excellence, and diligence, cultivating talents that satisfy requirements on leadership, defense management, communication and coordination, and force buildup and readiness. In the future, the MND will continue to improve the education quality of military academies and expand lifelong learning channels to cultive excellent servicemen.
I. Robust Military Education System
Talent cultivation is implemented in three stages defined by the Act of Military Education, namely basic education, advanced education, and further education, and is divided into commissioned officer education and NCO education. For commissioned officers, basic education includes credit courses that meet requirements of the University Act and specialty and planned education required by basic level officers; advanced education mainly includes courses of military schools and specialty courses; further education mainly includes strategy, command and staff education of the National Defense University and master’s and doctoral programs of each college, and civilian master’s and doctoral programs may be chosen as an alternative. For NCOs, basic education mainly includes specialty and planned education for NCOs, and support is provided for NCOs that graduate from military schools to acquire entry level technology certificates; advanced education mainly includes advanced courses of military schools for NCOs, and specialty courses and intermediate level technology certificates serve as an alternative; further education mainly includes military school courses for master chiefs, and advanced technology certificates or civilian degree programs may be used as alternatives. In addition, volunteer soldiers mainly receive initial entry training and specialty training, but may be selected for NCO training in coordination with their career planning, so as to meet the demand on basic level NCOs.
98
       II. Actively Encourage Off-Duty Further Education
The Regulations on the Implementation of Lifelong Education for Military 
Servicemen and Regulations on Military Personnel Pursuing Further Education Off Duty were enacted based on the Act of Military Education, the Ministry of Education’s Towards a Learning Society policy, and the Council of Labor Affairs’ “Towards an Occupational Certification Society,” so as to promote lifelong learning and improve the quality of servicemen. Servicemen are encouraged to engage in learning activities and attend certification training courses under the premise of not affecting their duties. Appropriate subsidies are provided to those with the qualifications. Furthermore, the quota for pursuing further education off duty will be sequentially increased each year, and the quota for pursuing full-time education will be sequentially decreased, so as to improve the quality of servicemen while effectively utilizing defense resources.
III. Establishment of a National Defense Think Tank
The Preparatory Office of the National Defense Think Tank was established on March 1
st, 2010 to carry out legal procedures and make preparations. In the 
future, the National Defense Think Tank will build professional defense analysis and evaluation capabilities, and focus on carrying out track two exchanges. The Preparatory Office is currently under the Department of Integrated Assessment and consists of personnel concurrently holding positions in the National Defense University and related units. Research fields mainly include defense strategy, security of the Taiwan Strait, international security, PLA studies, and regional cooperation. Future members of the think tank will mainly be civilian scholars with related academic backgrounds and experiences, and military personnel will concurrently hold the position of researcher. The combination of military personnel and civilian scholars will provide complementary specialties, turning the think tank into a platform for discussions on defense affairs and inspire innovative thoughts, which will further strengthen its strategy and policy consultation capabilities.
99
       Section 4  Armaments Mechanisms
The MND evaluates domestic capabilities at the investment proposal stage in 
accordance with Article 22 of the National Defense Act, giving consideration to readiness efficiency and degree of military threat when deciding whether to procure, develop, or jointly produce armaments. Also, outsourcing is implemented to utilize civilian forces to develop defense technology industries, which will expand domestic demand and vitalize the market economy, achieving a win-win for both military and civilian by strengthening national defense autonomy and stimulating economic growth.  Furthermore, the MND is actively transforming the Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology (CSIST) into an administrative legal person to meet the public’s expectations and continue enhancing defense technology research capabilities.
I. Well-rounded Military Investment Plans
The MND has completed “operational requirement documents,” “system analysis” and “investment outline plans” based on concepts of “innovation/asymmetry” and guidance of the “Quadrennial Defense Review.” Limited defense resources are used to build the most effective capabilities and thereby ensure national security.
II. Stepping Up International Exchanges and Cooperation
Foreign exchanges and cooperation are actively carried out in academic discussions, workshops and conferences, and technology forums based on the principles of “equality,” “mutually beneficial” and “resource sharing,” so as to jointly expand information exchange and cooperation opportunities in defense technologies. These exchanges and international cooperation will be gradually converted into an operation model suitable for Taiwan’s situation, developing  more international and specialized armament organizations to enhance joint operation capabilities.
100
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 2 General Plan of National Defense
Chapter 4 National Defense AdministrationIII. Elevating Domestic Scientific Research and Development
A shared platform was constructed for joint operations and logistics based on 
the concept of “all-purpose equipment for the tri-services with multiple effects.” Moreover, capabilities of domestic industry, government, academic and research sectors have been integrated for the development of key technologies, as well as deterrence capabilities of weapons systems, gradually building a modern force that meets defense requirements of the ROC.
IV. Strengthening Self-reliant National Defense
Capabilities of the private sector are utilized for developing the defense technology industry. Weapons and equipment acquisition gives priority to those produced in Taiwan, and technology transfer should be a term in foreign procurements. The objective of “strengthening defense technologies, consolidating defense capabilities, integrating domestic industries, and achieving national defense autonomy” is achieved through operating procedures of investment plans and evaluations of the production capabilities of domestic industries.
V. Improving Industrial Cooperation Mechanisms
To achieve national defense autonomy via the industrial cooperation mechanism with Ministry of Economic Affairs, the MND integrates domestic resources, verifies specific items for military-civilian industrial cooperation, adopts implementation methods advantageous to defense technology autonomy, such as requiring technology transfer in foreign procurements, and has completed industrial cooperation plans to effectively support logistics and maintenance of the ROC Armed Forces’ weapons and equipment, as well as establish depot level maintenance capabilities, which will shorten the maintenance timetable and reduce cost.
101
       VI. Strictly Auditing Procurements
The “Defense Procurements Office” was established after the Organization Act 
of the Ministry of National Defense was amended on January 1st, 2013, and is 
responsible for procurements of the ROC Armed Forces. The MND hopes that elevating the level of procurement management will strengthen the defense procurements system and improve policy planning. Furthermore, the “Ethics Office” was established and will collaborate with the “Inspector General’s Office” in “parallel, double supervision” of procurement cases, implementing internal control to satisfy requirements on “administration according to law” and “anti-corruption.”
Domestic military-civilian technology exchanges and international armaments 
cooperation are integrated in armaments acquisition. Furthermore, technology 
transfer and mutual beneficial industries are applied for military and civilian technology development to complement one another, and thus achieve defense autonomy.
102
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 2 General Plan of National Defense
Chapter 4 National Defense AdministrationVII. Managing Major Programs
Weapons system acquisition of the ROC Armed Forces must be carried 
out through complete operating procedures and strict evaluation standards. The MND’s robust program management mechanism was established after referring to the weapons acquisition management system of the US Army, and emphasizes reducing acquisition risk and life cycle cost. The MND established regulations on weapons acquisition program control, progress authentication, delivery and payment, and supervision of contracts to ensure the performance and quality of weapons systems, and further enhance the ROC Armed Forces’ capabilities.
Capabilities of domestic industrial, government, academic and research sectors have 
been integrated for the development of key technologies, as well as deterrence 
capabilities of weapons systems, gradually building a modern force that meets defense requirements of the ROC.
103
       VIII. Improving the ROC Armed Forces’ Construction 
Management
To provide a safe environment for military servicemen, the MND follows 
the policy guidance and complies with supervision measures of the Public Construction Supervision Commission. The MND routinely convenes military construction review meetings to review the progress and budget execution of projects. Operation nodes and target milestones are set to control military projects so that they are completed as scheduled, meet quality requirements, and stay within budget. This will maximize results of the defense budget.In order to achieve well-rounded management of the ROC Armed Forces’ military bases and land, military bases with plans for future use are adjusted and merged based on the principles of concentrating forces, merging small military bases into large ones, and Army, Navy and Air Force encamped in one military base. These adjustments are made under the premise of not affecting defense readiness and aim to effectively use military base resources. As for military bases with no plans for future use, they are transferred and released according to the Regulations on Military Base Transfer and Release Inspections and Operations for national economic infrastructure and local development. 
IX. Organizational Transformation of the Chung Shan 
Institute of Science and Technology
In order to enhance defense technology R&D capabilities and competitiveness and achieve autonomous defense infrastructure, the MND has referred to development trends of defense technology research institutes in countries around the world, as well as transformation experiences of domestic research institutes, and plans to transform the Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology (CSIST) into an “administrative legal person” in coordination with the “Jingtsui Program.” To achieve this objective the MND enacted the Regulations on the Establishment of the National Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology (Draft), which was reviewed and approved by the 
104
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC

review and political party negotiations before second reading concerning the regulations were completed. The MND will continue to push forward legislative procedures in hopes of completing the CSIST’s transformation.
105
       Section 5  Military Exchanges
Military diplomacy is a link in the nation’s overall diplomacy. The MND 
engages in military exchanges for other countries in coordination with the national security policy, and is actively expanding strategic dialogue and security cooperation opportunities with countries in the region that share the same strategic interests. It hopes to widely build connections and consolidate relations with friendly and ally countries, and further jointly maintain security in the Taiwan Strait, as well as peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific. Furthermore, interactions and cooperations of military diplomacy enable the MND to gain knowledge on the advanced military technologies, force buildup plans and concepts, combat experiences, and training of other countries, which will serve as a basis for formulating defense policies and improving training.
I. Build Friendly Relations to Lay the Foundation for 
Cooperation
Low sensitivity measures, such as “think tank cooperation,” “academic exchanges” and “humanitarian aid” are first adopted in coordination with the government’s diplomatic progress, building friendly relations with other countries to lay the foundation for expanding military exchanges.
II. Increase Military Interactions to Consolidate Relations 
with Friendly and Allied Countries
Mechanisms for dialogue between higher level military officials are gradually being built on the existing foundation. The foundation built by “visits between high level government and military officials,” “sending government officials to participate in armaments and logistics related conferences,” and “arms sales and military education exchanges” allows efforts to be directed towards signing agreements or MOUs based on the principles of equality, mutually beneficial, and pragmatism.

of National Chung Shan Institute of Science and 
Technology to Enhance Operation Competitiveness
The Regulations on the Establishment of the National Chung Shan Institute of 
Science and Technology (Draft) was established to enhance the management performance and competitiveness of the CSIST. The regulations specify the purpose, organization, scope of affairs, and procurement methods of the CSIST, and that the MND is the supervising agency, responsible for approving development objectives and plans, examining assets and financial situation, evaluating operation performance, selecting directors and supervisors, and giving suggestions. The MND will continue dedicating efforts in this area to complete legislation as soon as possible.
IV. Reviewing Laws Related to the “Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against 
Women” to Achieve Gender Equality
In coordination with the “The Enforcement Rules of the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women” that took effect on January 1
st, 2012, which stipulates that laws should be enacted, revised 
109
       or abolished and administrative measures should be improved to conform to 
the enforcement rules within three years after it takes effect. The “Guidelines on Conducting Gender Impact Assessments for Laws under the MND” was promulgated on this basis, and the MND completed the assessment of 32 laws under its jurisdiction as scheduled on March 25
th, 2013. The review report was 
submitted to the Executive Yuan Department of Gender Equality to continue subsequent reviews of laws, orders and administrative rules.
V. Amending the Act of Punishment of the Armed Forces and 
Reviewing the Confinement System
The MND has referred to the punishment system, e.g. confinement, of the US, England, Japan, Singapore and other countries based on human rights protection concepts of the “International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights” and “International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights.” Furthermore, the MND organized academic forums and invited elected representatives, scholars and experts on human rights, gender equality, and law, hearing the opinions of all sectors to establish well-rounded policies, so as to find a balance between force management and protection of servicemen’s human rights.Before the Act of Punishment of the Armed Forces was amended, the MND took a number of measures to improve the confinement system, including revising procedures for sending servicemen, improving the quality of management, making courses more reasonable, improving hardware facilities, forming a dedicated management unit, and improving supervision mechanism. The purpose of thses measures is to eradicate all inhumane actions.
VI. Returning Jurisdiction of the Military Justice System to 
the Judicial Yuan in Coordination with the Amendment 
to the Code of Court Martial Procedure
The Legislative Yuan passed an amendment to the Code of Court Martial 
Procedure on August 6th, 2013, which will take effect in two stages. Stage 1 
110
       Part 2 General Plan of National Defense
Chapter 4 National Defense Administrationtakes effect on the day the amendment is promulgated (August 15th, 2013), in 
which district prosecutors offices and courts take over cases concerning Articles 
44~46 of the Criminal Code of the Armed Forces and Paragraph 1 of Article 76 of the Code of Court Martial Procedure. Furthermore, inmates of Tainan Military Prison will be transferred to prisons under the Agency of Corrections, Ministry of Justice. Stage 2 takes effect 5 months after the amendment is promulgated and all other military justice cases are transferred to judicial agencies; remaining inmates are also transferred to prisons under the Agency of Corrections. Thereafter, servicemen who violate the Code of Court Martial Procedure or its special law will be tried by the Judicial Yuan during peacetime and by military courts during wartime.The MND has organized a task force to adjust the organization and duties of military courts and prisons, in which preliminary plans are as follows:
(I)Establish regional legal service centers to expand legal services 
and consultation for litigation. Military judges act as attorneys for 
The number of female officers has gradually increased in recent years, and the 
ROC Armed Forces is actively implementing“gender mainstreaming”to satisfy 
demands on“gender equality.”
111
       military servicemen and personnel in civil cases, criminal cases, and 
administrative litigation, and provide tour legal services, actively explanaing any questions servicemen may have regarding legal issues and litigations.
(II)Establish legal affairs departments in related units to assist with legal 
procedures, legal education, and legal consultation. The departments will carry out administration according to law, establish contacts for coordination with judicial agencies, and provide assistance to judicial officers in handling violations by active servicemen.
(III)A portion of military court personnel will become military law 
instructors in military academies, and legal education courses will be provided according to basic, advanced and further education, improving servicemen’s knowledge of the law.
(IV)The MND will coordinate with the Examination Yuan in continuing 
to hold military judge examinations, so that military justice personnel can continue to acquire military judge qualifications during peacetime, and be able to handle investigations and review cases during wartime. Furthermore, the MND has coordinated with the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) in holding examinations that will allow military prison personnel to become judicial correctional personnel. Contract-based personnel of military prisons will continue to fulfill their contracts after Tainan Military Prison is transferred to the MOJ.

2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 2 General Plan of National Defense
Chapter 4 National Defense AdministrationSection 7  Morale and Ethics Education
Morale and ethics education is carried out to consolidate the ROC Armed 
Forces’ “soft power” and build intangible combat capabilities. It is integrated into force training and exercises and changes and influences unobtrusively and imperceptibly, so that servicemen will not be threatened by force or lured by gain, which will prevent corruption and misconduct, preserve their moral integrity, place honor first, strictly abide by military code, fulfill their duties, uphold military ethics, abide by the law, and jointly defend the dignity and image of the ROC Armed Forces. By achieving this, tangible and intangible combat capabilities will complement one another to gain multiplicative effects.
I. Promoting Patriotism Education
The ROC Armed Forces’ patriotism education is based on the Constitution of the ROC, and upholds the core values of “country, duty and honor,” strengthening servicemen’s belief in democracy and their patriotism. Comprehensive and systematic education plans for military academies, forces, recruits, and reservists will instill the principles of democracy and partiotism, and inspire servicemen’s sense of honor and obligation. The purpose is to build a loyal, united, consolidated, and well-trained force of steel that safeguards national security and citizen’s well-being.
II. Reinforcing Military Ethics  
Education in military academies is the starting point, after which there are three stages - basic, advanced and further education. The ratio of military ethics education will be increased to foster the right military values in cadets, and workshops for military officers will be organized to strengthen military ethics among cadres at all levels. Military ethics education for all level forces is implemented via multiple channels, including the “intangible combat capability week” project, monthly gatherings, and academic lectures, so that servicemen gain a correct understanding. This will turn the ROC Armed Forces into an 
113
       elite armed force that practices military ethics, which is highly disciplined, and 
is highly supported by citizens.
III. Embedding Legal Education
Servicemen are divided based on the level of their missions, legal education subjects are divided into 26 areas of responsibility and course contents are differentiated according to leadership rank, staff, and servicemen. Legal education is carried out by personnel of military law units periodically dispatched to military agencies, forces and schools within their area of responsibility. Furthermore, during major exercises and long holidays, military law units step up legal education for their area of responsibility. Furthermore, legal education forums are held for basic level unit commanders to strengthen their legal concepts and achieve administration according to law. On-site surveys are conducted annually to understand the actual situation, and rewards and penalties are given to help servicemen gain correct legal concepts for the purpose of crime prevention.
IV. Stepping Up Military Discipline Education
Maintaining military discipline is the responsibility of all servicemen. All level cadres should repeatedly promote and verify military discipline by providing examples to deeply root discipline in the hearts of servicemen, so they abide by the law and code of conduct and gain a correct understanding. The MND upholds military discipline from three aspects - law, education and execution,”rectifies the common practice so servicemen maintain their integrity, creates an excellent work environment, establishes good military discipline, and builds a modernized ROC Armed Forces with “strict discipline, strong capabilities, and all-out support.” Furthermore, the  MND website is utilized to promote anti-corruption measures, and encourage servicemen and the public to report corruption and illegal actions, hoping to eliminate all corruption and misconduct and maintain the ROC Armed Forces’ military discipline.

( I)  Hierarchy of Authority of the Counter-terrorism Mechanism
In accordance with the National Security Council’s “Major Domestic Incident 
(Crisis) Response Mechanism” and the Executive Yuan’s “Regulations on Operations of the Central Counter-terrorism Center,” the ROC Armed Forces has assembled dedicated, specialized regional contingency response forces and backup forces for large scale counter-terrorism operations based on the capabilities of its troops and the nature of terrorist attacks; the backup forces provide backup and engage in mission preparations, supporting counter-
terrorism operations when ordered.
( II ) Counter-terrorism Operations Readiness and Guidance
The ROC Armed Forces’ counter-terrorism mechanisms are based on the 
The ROC Armed Forces' counter-terrorist operations aim to“prevent internal 
jolts and external assaults,”carrying out crisis management in the event of an 
emergency situation to rapidly control and reduce damages.
117
       ROC Armed Forces Joint Operations Command System, which has the Joint 
Operations Command Center at the core. When terrorist activities occurs, Theaters of Operations(TO) or county/city administrative areas are the units for 
backing up local governments in counter-terrorism operations.
III. Disaster Relief
The ROC Armed Forces carries out disaster relief missions in accordance with 
the Executive Yuan’s “Disaster Prevention and Relief Act” and the “Regulations on the ROC Armed Forces’ Assistance in Disaster Relief” to protect the safety of citizens’ lives and assets. Furthermore, with “disaster relief” listed as one of its main missions, the ROC Armed Forces is building disaster relief capabilities under the guidance of “disaster relief is akin to fighting a battle” and “emphasize disaster prevention over disaster relief, and prioritize disaster avoidance over disaster prevention.” In the event of a major disaster, the ROC Armed Forces implements the active measure to “prepare for disasters in advance, pre-deploy troops for disaster relief, and ensure readiness for rescue operations” under the 
premise of not affecting combat readiness, and fully engages in disaster relief.

Chapter 4 National Defense AdministrationSection 9  Care for Servicemen
The MND is improving the military service environment and the existing 
mechanisms of benefits, living facilities, military families services, and housing services. These endeavors aim to better care for servicemen and increase incentives for recruitment and retention, hoping to attract outstanding youth to join the military and build a volunteer force.
I. Well-rounded Benefits
To institutionalize military personnel benefits, the MND will continue to promote legal procedures associated with the Regulations Governing Benefits for Military Personnel. The MND will provide service institutions, preferential nursery fees, service counters, and family visiting activities, improve servicemen’s living quality, help resolve emergencies off base, and provide military families services to let servicemen feel at ease, gain public support, raise morale, strengthen unity, and improve esprit de corps.
II. Improving Living Facilities
Military bases may invite convenience stores to operate with consideration to servicemen’s needs. This measure aims to provide better consumer goods and services for servicemen in accordance with the Regulations on the Establishment and Management of Cooperative Stores in Military Bases.
III. Implementing Military Families Services
An innovative policy and approach was adopted to expand services for active volunteers. Military families benefits and service measures and resources of each military branch are integrated to provide military families services and benefits so as to maintain the armed forces’ morale.
IV. Improving Housing Services

       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 2 General Plan of National Defense
Chapter 4 National Defense AdministrationSection 10  Gender Equality
“Gender equality” is an important indicator of a modern society. The ROC 
promulgated the Gender Equality Policy Outline and established the Executive Yuan Department of Gender Equality in 2012, charging it with the overall planning of gender equality policies and implementation. In recent years, the ROC Armed Forces has been carrying out gender equality related work, and besides forming a Gender Equality Task Force, gender equality work groups were assembled in the headquarters of each military branch to extend the scope of gender equality mechanisms. A work environment with gender equality is created from efforts in several aspects, including policy, law, and enforcement. Military units are required to include a gender perspective during law enactment, project proposal, problem analysis, internal management, leadership, and resource allocation, practically implementing “gender mainstreaming” and driving “gender equality.”
I. Summary of Implementing “Gender Mainstreaming”
“Gender mainstreaming” refers to assessing the different implications for women and men of any planned policy action, so that the perspective of different genders is gradually included into existing concepts, attitudes and activities. It demands that past policies, laws and resources must be reallocated or changed to truly achieve gender equality. With feedbacks from experts, the ROC Armed Forces promotes gender equality during routine military law education, so that servicemen understand the three gender laws (Act of Gender Equality in Employment, Sexual Assault Crime Prevention Act, and Sexual Harassment Prevention Act) for crime prevention. Furthermore, the Youth Daily News and televised Jyu Guang program are also utilized to promote gender equality. In addition, experts are periodically invited to hold forums on gender topics, in-depth interviews with basic-echelon troops are conducted, and pre-marital education and domestic (international) academic conferences are organized to raise awareness on gender equality and sexual harassment 
121
       prevention and allow servicemen to develop correct concepts.
II. Human Rights Protection in Coordination with the 
Enforcement Rules of the “Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women”
The ROC Armed Forces amended and promulgated the “Enforcement 
Rules for Sexual Harassment Cases in the Military” and “Regulations on Handling Sexual Assault, Sexual Harassment, or Sexual Bullying in Military Preparatory Schools and Military Academies” in 2012, and revised internal management regulations and operating mechanisms. Furthermore, a lecture tour was organized for all forces between July and September 2012 to enhance servicemen’s gender sensitivity and help them understand the rules. Assistance is provided to all units in building capabilities for law enforcement and examining administrative measures, thereby implementing the “Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women” and protecting gender rights.
122
       Joint operations are the key to victory in modern 
warfare. All services must be coordinated and 
utilize joint capabilities for the best results in defensive operations. When facing an enemy with superior numbers, the ROC Armed Forces develop combat capabilities that target the enemy’s weaknesses based on the concept of “innovation/asymmetry.” Defense resources will thus be effectively utilized for force buildup and readiness, and achieve the objectives of defending homeland security, sovereignty over offshore islands, and maritime rights.Part 3  National Defense

123
         
Chapter 5  National Defense Force
The ROC Armed Forces’ strong capabilities maintain peace 
across the Taiwan Strait and safeguard national security. 
Hence, the ROC Armed Forces must continue to strengthen its intangible combat capabilities, joint operations performance, information and electronic warfare capabilities, and logistic support in a defensive posture based on the strategic concept of “resolute defense and credible deterrence” so as to achieve “strategic sustainability and tactical decisiveness, ” failing enemy’s attempt to fight a quick battle and force a quick conclusion. Endeavors in each area will achieve integrated effects that will create a relative advantage, and thus reach objectives of defensive operations.

Chapter 5 National Defense Forceplans to maximize results of joint operations, the Air Force renounced the 
conventional concept of winning a total war, and concentrates resources in building “low loss, low cost, and easily maneuverable firepower that is highly effective and precise, so as to win at decisive points.” The Air Force is currently focused on “establishing long-range surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities to gain greater depth of early warning,” “integrating C4ISR systems to improve battlefield management,” “developing and procuring long-range precision suppression weapons to enhance suppression performance,” “integrating the logistics framework of bases to implement rapid regional logistics,” “strengthening base defense facilities and runway emergency repair capabilities,” “planning the next generation of fighters to strengthen overall capabilities and gaining air superiority,” and “establishing innovative/asymmetric capabilities.”
135
       Section 2  Joint Operations Effectiveness
The ROC Armed Forces continue to development joint warfighting capabilities. 
In addition to improving joint efficiency, other efforts including revolution in military affairs, organizational restructuring, and armaments upgrade are also implemented to build a joint force with command efficiency and agile logistic support.
I. Joint Operations Concepts
( I ) To ensure peace in the Taiwan Strait, the territorial integrity, and 
regional stability, the ROC Armed Forces follows the military strategic concept of “resolute defense and credible deterrence,” and utilizes robust joint operations mechanisms and modernized battlefield management in coordination with diverse measures to achieve credible deterrence, counter the enemy’s force projection and launch in-depth strikes at the enemy, destroying, limiting and depleting the enemy’s abilities to invade Taiwan.
( II ) To build a “Hard ROC” defense force, the joint operations concepts 
are focused on enhancing “long range precision engagement” and “synchronous joint operation” capabilities. Upon detecting enemy’s intent, or moves, to invade, troops and firepower of the Armed Forces will be deployed according to their effective range. Precision strikes, multilayered interceptions, anchorage and beachhead attacks, and asymmetrical operations will be simultaneously carried out to disable the enemy’s operational center of gravity, conduct joint interception and anchorage and beachhead attack, crumbling any enemy’s attempt to fight a quick battle and force a quick conclusion, and ensuring that defensive operations in Taiwan and Penghu are successfully achieved.
II. Joint Operations Command Mechanism
( I ) The joint operations command mechanism of the ROC Armed Forces 
136
       Part 3 National Defense Capabilities
Chapter 5 National Defense Forceis the core of operational decision-making and command. In order to 
establish mechanisms that are “consistent and accountable in peacetime and wartime” and are able to bring out the full effects of joint operations, the Joint Operation Command Center directly commands all levels of strategic execution, creating a closely knit joint command network that achieves simplified force deployment, flattened command hierarchy and rapid command. 
(II) In order to gain control over the battlefield situation, coordinate 
firepower, gain target intelligence, assess combat results, exercise command and control, and strengthen battlefield management functions, besides further enhancing command and control functions, the Armed Forces has effectively integrated C4ISR systems with weapon platforms, establishing common operation pictures that is provided to each level of command for synchronous control over the battlefield. This strengthens battlefield monitoring capabilities and effectively implements battlefield management, enhancing combat command and control functions and benefitting the successfully execution of joint operations.
III. Joint Operations Capability Buildup
With consideration to trends in the security environment, technological developments, and strategic requirements, the ROC Armed Forces is implementing force restructuring, promoting all-out defense, and strengthening joint operations performance. Furthermore, the ROC Armed Forces has adopted “technological leading, information and electronic superiority, joint interdiction, and homeland defense” as the guiding principles of force buildup, and has engaged in force restructuring plans to building credible deterrence capabilities. Related capability development includes joint C4ISR, joint information and electronic warfare, joint counter air, joint sea control, joint ground defense, asymmetrical warfare, reserve mobilization, joint logistics, and overall intangible combat capabilities.
137
       IV. Annual Exercises and Training Results
Based on the spirit that “all operations are joint operations and all training 
is joint training,” the ROC Armed Forces sequentially implements training in the stages - “joint operations basic training,” “armed service operations exercise” and “joint operations exercise,” so as to build joint planning and control capabilities. The ROC Armed Forces effectively integrates tri-service joint operation exercises with the annual “Han Kuang Exercise” at the core, and specifies training courses and foci in the Joint Mission Essential Task List (JMETL). Forces are put under the pressure of being in scenarios with an opposing force to strengthen the coordination between armed services, which build solid capabilities with highly concentrated forces that have combined their strengths. This allows unified joint operations to be carried out. The status of each exercise is described below:
( I ) Han Kuang Exercise
The annual “Han Kuang Exercise” validates comprehensive readiness for the defense of Taiwan and Penghu, and is implemented in two stages - field training exercises (FTX) and computer-aided command post exercises, during which major readiness issues, including contingency response and full operations stages, are analyzed.

Chapter 5 National Defense ForceIII. Refining Commercial Maintenance Operations to Secure 
Core Capabilities
Outsourcing maintenance of military equipment is implemented to consolidate 
defense industry base and drive industrial upgrade. The non-sensitive, low readiness-efficiency or non-essential maintenance capabilities were outsourced to the private sector to build domestic maintenance capacity, under the premise of retaining core capabilities and abiding by contracting and execution regulations. Invitations to tender were sent on 12 occasions for military aircraft, 1 occasion for a military ship, and on 60 occasions for land and utility equipment since 2003. Future commercial maintenance of military equipment will continue to be carried out with consideration to mission and training (exercise) requirements, equipment characteristics, maintenance manpower, and budget. Remaining maintenance capabilities of the Armed Forces will also be further strengthened for better performance.
IV. Implementing Lifecycle Management to Ensure 
Equipment Availability
In order to ensure equipment availability and training safety, the full life cycle perspective is adopted for specifying the cycle and depth of equipment maintenance. The “integrated logistics management team” mechanism gathers data on the demand, acquisition and consumption of supplies, calculates planned and non-planned demands, and carries out procurement operations. Furthermore, the availability of equipment is ensured via the establishment of evaluation standards, strict storage quality examinations, application of information system control, and careful risk management.
V. Integrating Item Repair Capabilities to Enhance 
Maintenance and Repair Effectiveness
The ROC Armed Forces implemented horizontal integration of equipment, technologies, facilities and manpower, and vertical integration of maintenance 
145
       capabilities of depot shops, combined maintenance facilities, maintenance 
companies, and intermediate maintenance shops, so as to achieve resource sharing. At the same time, material maintenance capabilities are effectively integrated through information system linking and function upgrading to support annual training requirements. Furthermore, for equipment that armed services are also capable of repairing, the tri-service repair system is given priority to carry out repairs, thus achieving resource sharing, streamlining manpower, and cutting down costs.
VI. Strengthening Energy Control and Implementing Energy 
Conservation
The MND announced the “Implementation Method for Merging Exercise and Training Missions for Energy Conservation” and “Regulations on Energy Conservation Control in the ROC Armed Forces” under the government’s energy conservation and carbon reduction policy.

Chapter 5 National Defense ForceSection 5  Reserve Capability Buildup
The fundamental policy of mobilization preparations is to streamline the regular 
force and extensively build the reserve force. During peacetime, the Armed Forces accumulate combat capabilities and strengthen military mobilization preparations, and during mobilization, reserve forces are rapidly assembled to achieve “timely mobilization and engagement” and effectively support defensive operations.
I. Military Mobilization Readines
( I ) Manpower Mobilization
Based on the principle that “regular forces conduct strikes and reserve forces defend the homeland,” Theaters of Operations are the core and ground reserve forces are the backbone. Draft age men who complete military training under the volunteer system are added to the reserve mobilization system, in which over 2.6 reservists are currently listed. In accordance with the principles “younger combatants and senior specialists” and “last retired from service first used,” persons separated from service within eight years are assembled into reserve units that radiate outward from their tactical positions. The reservist list is continuously updated and reservists are priority members of mobilization forces, ensuring that combat forces are young and strong, so that “swift force generation and rapid capability reconstitution” can be achieved during wartime.
( II ) Materials Mobilization
The ROC Armed Forces manages and inspects goods and materials under the guidance of the Outline for All-out Defense Mobilization Preparations and Military Mobilization Preparation Plan. Theaters of Operations file applications for materials based on operational requirements and complete supply-demand verification operations. Important military supplies in the annual requisition plan include 180 items under 8 categories, including minerals, basic metals, 
151
       machinery, fiber/leather/rubber/wool, chemicals, medical supplies, construction 
materials, transportation (telecommunications), and other. Furthermore, requisition plans included over 10 thousand fixed facilities, over 30 thousand vehicles, over 2 thousand heavy machinery , over 50 vessels, over 300 fishing boats, and over 60 aircraft that can be immediately mobilized during wartime to effectively support military operations.
II. Mobilization Readiness of the Military Supplies Industry
Conversion requirements of the military supplies industry are reviewed each year based on operational requirements of each armed service, and are included into the mobilization implementation plan of military supplies industries. Furthermore, based on the review of combat forces’ requirements during wartime, the annual mobilization plan has included 54 production systems of the military supplies industry that produces over a thousand items and involves over a hundred production plants, as well as 2 maintenance systems with 2 maintenance items and over 300 maintenance plants; the number of plants mobilized totals at over 400, and can immediately be converted for production (maintenance) during wartime to effectively support military operations.
III. Muster-Call Training Readiness
Reservists and selected military service troops are mustered every two years for training at a military base near their residence, so as to restore or maintain their basic combat (including disaster relief) skills. The training includes specialty retraining, firing training, combat training, combined training, and disaster prevention and relief, which are necessary for combat operations and disaster relief. Over 140 thousand persons received training in 622 batches, effectively building mobilization capabilities.In response to disaster relief requirements during the flood season, mustered reserve forces must take an additional 4 hours of disaster relief courses (1 hour for military service troops). Furthermore, 3 to 6 battalions of disaster relief 
152
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 3 National Defense Capabilities
Chapter 5 National Defense Forceforces are maintained at all times, so that when a disaster occurs, they can 
jointly carry out disaster relief missions with regular forces to protect homes, protect hometowns, and protect assets.
IV. Mobilization Exercise and Training Readiness
To validate muster-call training results of reserve forces, the Tung Hsin Exercise and Tzu Chiang Exercise are simultaneously conducted along with the Han Kuang Exercise. Under the command and control mechanisms of each Theater of Operations, manpower and materials mobilization is carried out “around the island, in separate districts, at the same time” when the mobilization order is issued. Reserve forces are assembled to validate their mission succession, pre-combat training, deep battle (beach, town, mountain strategic pass, and anti-airborne operations), and wartime disaster relief, strengthening the overall combat capabilities of reserve forces.
153
       Section 6  Intangible Combat Capability
The ROC Armed Forces belongs to the people and is neutral from individual, 
regional and party affiliations in accordance with Articles 138 and 139 of the Constitution of the ROC and Articles 5 and 6 of the National Defense Act. The ROC Armed Forces is “politically neutral” in accordance with the law and strictly abides by “nationalization of military,” and focuses on force buildup and readiness to defend the ROC’s constitutional democracy. The MND has continued to use the Jyu Guang televised program, the newspaper and three periodicals of Youth Daily News, and online promotion channels for producing educational programs and publishing special topics and news reports. Furthermore, the MND organized various promotional activities, convened the “anti-corruption work meeting,” and reinforced counterintelligence measures, so as to raise threat awareness, build national identification, and strengthen intangible combat capabilities.
I. Patriotism
Specific measures have been adopted to build servicemen’s patriotism. To strengthen servicemen’s determination to fight for the survival and development of the ROC and fight for the safety and welfare of the people, the MND announced the promotional data “the ROC Armed Forces implements nationalization of military to set an example of democracy” and “Defending sovereignty and dignity, and peacefully resolving disputes,” and produced 18 episodes on the Jyu Guang televised program, including “Strengthening fundamental beliefs of the ROC Armed Forces to fulfill its duty to protect the nation and its people.” Furthermore, 52 editorials on “upholding morals and principles and combat training to preserve the nation’s peace and stability,” 41 special columns, 156 news reports, and 32 expert opinions were published in the Youth Daily Newspaper. The illustrated book “Military Service, Great Love” was also published by the MND. Other measures include requiring graduates of military academies to complete “patriotic education” courses, organizing the 
154
       Part 3 National Defense Capabilities
Chapter 5 National Defense Force“Commendation Activity on Armed Forces Day and All-out Defense Education 
Day,” and holding the “Academic Conference on Servicemen’s Military Ethics and Moral Education,” during which over 300 experts and scholars were invited to provide improvement measures and their professional opinions.
II. Military Legacy
The servicemen follow to the traditional Whampoa army spirit and pass on the legacy through force operations, exercise and training, as well as major celebrations and battle commemorations. Activities organized in 2012 include the “Vivid Flying 101 - The Liuying Carousing Carnival,” “75
th Anniversary 
of the War of Resistance on July 7th,” “Feast of Sounds” concert, and the 
“46th Armed forces Golden Statues Awards for Literature and Arts.” Multiple

       calling, and inherit the honorable traditions of the ROC Armed Forces.
III. Anti-Corruption
( I )Under the government’s policy of “promoting integrity and anti-
corruption,” the Minister of National Defense convenes the monthly 
Anti-Corruption Work Meeting, which is then convened at each level under the service headquarters. Evaluation of agency risks is conducted through the meetings, and preliminary measures are implemented to eliminate corruption and prevent misconduct. Transparency International conducted an evaluation of clean practices of defense communities of 82 countries in 2012, in which the ROC was listed as a low-risk grade B country along with England, and the United States, trailing only behind Germany and New Zealand.
( II )The Ethics Office was established in 2013 in coordination with the 
government’s determination to prevent corruption and misconduct, as well as the Amendment to the Organization Act of the Ministry of National Defense. The Ethics Office will collaborate with the Inspector General’s Office in joint anti-corruption efforts based on the principles of “parallel, double supervision” and “coordination, mutual help, and function integration,” in hopes of maintaining military discipline and strengthening the ROC Armed Forces’ image of integrity.
IV. Security Protection
The ROC Armed Forces has worked with investigation and intelligence units in uncovering numerous communist spies in recent years, indicating that the PRC will continue to practice intimidation and bribery on servicemen to gather intelligence by all means possible. A few of the servicemen were not able to maintain their military virtues. Facing the threat of intelligence gathering and infiltration by the PRC, and to protect national secrets and eradicate potential risks, the MND is implementing diverse counterintelligence 
156
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 3 National Defense Capabilities
Chapter 5 National Defense Forceeducation to raise the awareness of servicemen and their families of the 
enemy threat. Furthermore, the MND has adopted a number of measures for counterintelligence and purging enemy spies, including law amendment, security deployment, security auditing, and security protection for defense information. Related measures are further described below:
( I ) Promoting the Justice Project
In the light of the growing cross-Strait exchanges, military personnel will have increasing opportunities to come in contact with residents of mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. To prevent military personnel from being used by the PRC, the MND enacted the “ROC Armed Forces Regulations on Implementation of the Justice Project,” so as to raise servicemen’s awareness of the enemy threat via law promotion and enforcing penalties. Servicemen are required to actively report any correspondence, communication and contact with people from mainland China. The MND further established a reporting channel to prevent any misconduct.
( II ) Reinforcing Military Base Security
To prevent criminals from infiltrating or damaging military bases, the MND implements numerous security measures in coordination with military base open days, major exercises, and celebrations, including requiring ID for entry and exit, response force deployment, potential risk analysis, scenario simulation, integrating intelligence capabilities, and limiting routes that can be accessed.
( III ) Expanding Security Education
The MND compiled examples of infiltration and intelligence by the PRC in recent years into the second volume of the security book series “Red Alert” to raise servicemen’s threat awareness. Other measures that were implemented include “security point man” commendation, security article invitation, poster design, and security action figures. The MND also produced special topic lectures and dramas on security education on the Jyu Guang televised program, 
157
       expanding education results from extensive security education measures.
(IV) Enhancing Secrecy Protection Skills
Security lectures are held for servicemen with confidential duties, their 
commanding officers (supervisor), military officials stationed overseas, and new recruits, and security courses are irregularly offered for classes according to the curriculum of the military academy. Furthermore, the MND has jointly studied operations for precise confidentiality labels together with the Ministry of Justice to prevent leakage of defense secrecy. This measure provides legal protection for core confidential processes and prevents the outflow of confidential defense information.
( V ) Thoroughly Investigating All Leads
With consideration to the diversity of intelligence measures of the PRC and to prevent military personnel from being used by the enemy, the MND has considered recent cases of communist spies and adopted an approach to thoroughly investigate military personnel that leave the country. Guidance is provided to all level security departments to screen any leads on the involvement of military personnel with mainland China, their financial situation, or any suspicious behavior, taking the initiative to prevent leakage of defense information and ensure the security of the ROC Armed Forces.
( VI ) Polygrash Testss
The MND established regulations on polygraph tests to support security investigations to step up evaluations of coordinators, military officials, procurement personnel, assembly personnel (aircraft, ships) stationed overseas, and military personnel who pursue further education or participate in think tanks overseas for 6 months or above, as well as personnel required to carry out confidential missions, thereby ensuring the purity of military personnel.

Chapter 5 National Defense Force( VII ) Investigating Potential Risks
To ensure the safety of sensitive and classified units, the MND instructed 
subordinates at each level to compile annual project and individual investigation reports on leads on enemy spies, preventing treason, and protecting classified information under the themes counterintelligence, counter-infiltration, and counter-sabotage. A total of 36 reports were completed, including “potential risks of veterans organizations’ activities in mainland China,” and were added to the risk database to strengthen counterintelligence capabilities.
V. Public Relations
Defense affairs being supervised by the people is the norm in democratic countries. Under the principles of secrecy protection, defense administration transparency and the people’s right to know, the MND has explained and communicated with the public through military news channels, so that the public may fully understand defense administration, build an “all-out defense” consensus, and gain public support and approval.
( I ) News Policy of the ROC Armed Forces
Public relations work is planned and carried out under four guidelines - “the premise of maintaining national security and defense interests,” “the demand on building all-out defense consensus and establishing good military-civilian relations,” “the principle of coordinating with government policy and defense administration” and “the objective of fulfilling the ROC Armed Forces’ duties and current stage military missions.” The MND builds a bridge with the public via good interactions and communication with media, so as to promote defense policies, let citizens gain a correct understanding of national defense, and further support force buildup and readiness work.
( II ) Flexible News Strategy
The ROC Armed Forces’ public relations measures should keep pace with 
159
       the times considering the current social environment and the public’s high 
expectations, and flexible and diverse approaches, such as “project proposals,” have been adopted to promote its image. The MND began working with the National Geographic Channel in 2011 on the documentary “National Highway Landing Secret Symplectic,” and successfully showed the world the ROC Armed Forces’ training results. In 2012, the MND and the National Geographic Channel again cooperated in the documentary “ROC Amphibious Surveillance & Reconnaissance Units.” Furthermore, the MND cooperated with the Discovery Channel in filming the series on “Elite Forces,” and cooperated with TVBS in filming the series “On the Front Line of Training,” successfully improving the ROC Armed Forces’ image through collaborations with domestic and international media.
( III ) Positive Image Building
The MND will flexibly use positive marketing strategies to attract media attention. Activities that include the Army’s heavy artillery maintenance and firing, the Navy’s “ageless warrior” military ship experience camp, the Air Force’s B-26 aircraft handover ceremony and “Liangdao man relic unearthed in Matsu” are all successful experiences of image campaign. Public relations of the ROC Armed Forces has shifted from the traditional concept that actions are louder than words to actively promoting its policies, and besides passing on correct information through diverse communication channels, such as social networks, the MND’s official website, press releases, press conferences, and large activities, the results of major administrative efforts are now being actively promoted, so as to inform the public of defense policies.
( IV ) Fully Utilizing the Internet for Promotion
The MND created the Facebook account “Spokesperson of the MND” on May 24
th, 2011, and the number of fans has surpassed 15,000, reaching over 
200 thousand person-times a week, which makes it an important channel for communication. For example, the activities “New Dawn Education and Nursing

6.List of specialty aspirations extended from 5 to 10.
7.Restrictions are lifted for inactive personnel to register for other armed 
services.
II. Enhancing Military Education
The purpose of military education is to edify and cultivate cadres at each level 
of the armed forces. Military education cultivates cadres with independent thinking, judgment and problem solving abilities by systematically passing on basic knowledge and skills. On the other hand, it fosters modern servicemen 
Education in military academies of the ROC Armed Forces maintains superior 
manpower that strengthens the ROC Armed Forces' capabilities.
165
       with military ethics and strong physique, who are loyal to the country, willing 
to take responsibility and value honor.
( I ) Enriching Basic Education
Contents of basic education for military officers comply with credit courses of the “University Act,” as well as service education, special-to-arm training, and formative education required for basic military officers. The MND hopes to cultivate modern officers that accomplish both civil and military affairs and possess both specialty and morality. Moreover, complete university courses integrated with holistic education will help them develop an interest in learning and equip them with the ability for further education.Basic education for non-commissioned officers (NCOs) mainly consists of service education, special-to-arm training, and formative education. NCOs that graduate from service school receive guidance for acquiring basic technician certificates, so as to help them develop healthy personalities and possess both civil and military specialties.
( II ) Expanding the Scope of Advanced Education
Advanced education for military officers mainly consists of strategy and staff education, as well as masters and doctoral programs of each college in the National Defense University, and is supported by masters and doctoral program at civilian universities. Staff education mainly includes staff competence and force management practices, and cultivates cadre members that are logical and have an overall perspective. Strategy education mainly includes national military strategy, joint operations between different armed services, and defense resource management, so as to cultivate cadre members who take initiative and have foresight.Advanced education for NGOs is mainly “master sergeant courses” organized by each armed service, and aims to cultivate leading and staff sergeants at the battalion and brigade level. This is supported by acquiring advanced technician certificates and pursuing further degrees. The “master sergeant courses” 
166
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 3 National Defense Capabilities
Chapter 6 National Defense Resourcesorganized by each armed service aims to cultivate leading and staff sergeants at 
the battalion and brigade level, strengthening basic-level cadres, and cultivating leadership skills of NCOs so that they possess management practice, staff operation, and specialty capabilities.In response to major disasters, disaster relief (prevention) courses are included in advanced education programs to strengthen cadre members’ understanding of staff operations and related laws on joint disaster relief, such courses include disaster relief force deployment, equipment readiness, command, coordination, emergency response, and disaster victim accommodation. Results are validated through war game at the end of the program, enhancing disaster relief (prevention) competencies of cadre members.
( III ) Planning Further Education Channels for Cadre Members
Specialized manpower, including teachers of military academies, defense technology development, and high level staff, are suitably recruited to enhance the ROC Armed Forces’ expertise in various fields. Personnel are allowed to pursue further education in domestic and foreign masters and doctoral programs full-time or when off duty, in hopes of cultivating specialized talents that possess international military and high-tech military expertise.In coordination with the actual demand after implementation of “voluntarism” and the talent cultivation strategy, the quota for pursuing further education full-time will be sequentially decreased each year, and units will be encouraged to increase the quota for pursuing further education off duty, so as to effectively utilize defense resources. Furthermore, in response to requirements of future high-tech warfare, the MND encourages branch officers to enroll in graduate programs of military academies to improve the quality of human resources.
( IV ) Expanding the Scope of Further Education off Duty
The MND encourages lifelong learning and pursuing an advanced degree, certification or specialty off duty to improve the quality of servicemen. Military officers mainly pursue a master’s degree, while NCOs and soldiers mainly 
167
       acquire certifications. The MND has completed revisions of the “Regulations 
on Military Personnel Pursuing Further Education off Duty,” and has provided subsidies, relaxed the definition of off duty hours, considered further education in personnel appointment, and implemented e-learning in coordination.The headquarters of each armed service reviews specialty training requirements of servicemen on offshore islands and remote areas, and offers related specialty training courses to provide them with learning opportunities that will enhance their competencies and gain basic language abilities, aiding the establishment of an environment for pursuing further education off duty.In response to the force organization and specialty training situation after force restructuring, servicemen are encouraged to take part in further education activities, so that they possess a degree or civil specialty before leaving the military, which will enhance their individual competitiveness.
III. Establishing an Evaluation System
( I )To maintain education results and levels in military academies, the MND 
continues to supervise military academies in receiving evaluations from the Ministry of Education, as well as passing certifications of civilian certification institutions, including the Institute of Engineering Education Taiwan, Taiwan Medical Accreditation Council and Taiwan Nursing Accreditation Council. The certifications validate the teaching, research, service and administrative support levels of military academies, and enhance the competencies of cadre members.
( II ) To improve the quality of military education, measures that have been 
adopted include strengthening curriculum design, cultivating excellent instructors, and using the ISO certification as a standard for education and administration quality of military academies, enhancing their administrative efficiency. Furthermore, military academies will enter into strategic alliances with civilian universities and research institutions 
168
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 3 National Defense Capabilities
Chapter 6 National Defense Resourcesbased on the concept of teaching resource sharing, thereby building an 
interactive platform to create a robust military education environment.
IV. Improving the NCO System
The five core objectives for improving the NCO system are to empower the NCOs, increase their responsibility, build their confidence, cultivate their expertise, and manage their career development. The current implementation status in coordination with a volunteer force is as follows:
( I ) Revising the ratio of NCOs
In coordination with the volunteer force policy and force restructuring of the “Jingtsui Program,” the ratio of commissioned officers, NCOs, and soldiers was adjusted from 1:1.88:1.95 in 2006 to 1:1.92:1.80. In the future, NCOs will become the core of the ROC Armed Forces.
( II )  Implementing international NCOs exchanges 
Command master chiefs are selected and sent abroad to exchange experiences and take part in seminars. Furthermore, in response to the increased demand on trainer instructors after adjusting the manpower structure of the NCO education system, the ratio of NCO’s sent abroad to all NCO’s that received training increased from 32% in 2011 and to 43% in 2012.
( III ) Adjusting the manpower structure of the NCO education system
All NCO courses were developed to increase NCOs’ accountability and achieve a parallel development system for commissioned officers and NCOs. Instructors, cadres, and umpire positions in schools of the NCO education system are gradually being taken over by NCOs, and education assessment personnel are being vitalized through a rotation mechanism, combining training with practices.
169
       (IV) Improving the performance of careering planning NCOs
Personnel allocation for “career planning sergeants” has been completed in 
coordination with requirements for implementing “voluntarism.” Outstanding NCOs are selected to receive training overseas, and return as seed instructors for “career planner courses,” improving the expertise of “career planning NCOs” to retain excellent talents.
( V ) Providing complete career development for NCOs
A career development system suitable for all NCOs was established based on the specialties, positions and mission characteristics of NCOs. Furthermore, regulations on command master chief and sergeant instructor candidates, transfer, and offshore island duty rotation were established in coordination with characteristics of each position, hoping that NCOs following the career development path will enhance their competencies, develop expertise, experience different positions, and strengthen force capabilities.
( VI )  Strengthening professional competencies of NCOs
Certification courses offered each year allow NCOs to acquire professional certificates, and quota was provided for military sponsored students of NCO two year programs, full-time study in master’s programs, and for NCO’s pursuing further education when off duty. These measures aim to improve the overall quality of NCOs and strengthen their expertise, combining civilian certifications and military specialties. As of 2012, 41.29% of all NCOs had obtained a junior college degree or above.
V. Reasonable Deployment and Employment of Civilian 
Defense Officials
The ROC has established a national defense system with civilian control over military and centralized leadership. In order to help civilian defense officials gain visionary, thorough decision-making ability with regards 
170
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 3 National Defense Capabilities
Chapter 6 National Defense Resourcesto national defense policies and resources, and to integrate military and 
civilian perspectives through communication and negotiation to enhance the effectiveness of military-civilian cooperation, the MND’s organization, cultivation, training, and system for civilian defense officials are as follows:
( I ) Organization of Civilian Defense Officials
The MND has a total of 819 positions for military and civilian defense officials, in which 1/3 are civilian positions in accordance with the “Organization Act of the Ministry of National Defense.” The number of positions for civilian defense officials was 203 in 2013, in which 161 positions (79.31%) were filled as of August 31
st, 2013. In terms of rank, there are 2 specially commissioned 
officials, 63 senior officials, 125 junior officials, and 13 elementary officials (see 
Appendix 2-5 ). Among the 4 departments and 7 offices of the MND, 
the Department of Strategic Planning, Department of Resources Planning, Department of Integrated Assessment, Defense Procurements Office, National Defense Mobilization Office, Personnel Office, Ethics Office, and Comptroller Office are currently headed by civilian officials, in which the Personnel Office, Ethics Office, and Comptroller Office consist entirely of civilian officials.
( II ) Civilian Defense Official Cultivation and Training
The MND formulated the “Guidelines for the Training, Advanced Education, and Lifelong Learning of Civilian Personnel in the Ministry of National Defense” to strengthen the expertise of civilian officials in defense affairs. Training for civilian officials was incorporated into core training courses, so that civilian officials who enter the MND will become more familiar with defense affairs, effectively enhancing their defense expertise.In accordance with the five core values of civil servants “integrity, loyalty, professionalism, performance, and compassion” ratified by the Executive Yuan, the same training will be implemented for both military and civilian personnel in the workplace, and thus increase their interaction and establish positive military-civilian relationships.
171
       Besides planning and implementing a civilian official training system 
that consists of several stages, which adapts to competency improvement requirements of civilian officials at each stage, the incorporation of strategic human resource management is being considered, and civilian official evaluation and promotion mechanisms will be integrated with the MND’s training system. The role of civilian officials will be enhanced in the field of defense policies through planned formative education and position transfers.

Chapter 6 National Defense ResourcesSection 2  National Defense Financial Resources
The defense budget is allocated based on enemy threat, force buildup concepts, 
progress of the force buildup program, and the government’s financial resources. A number of financial management measures, including “allocating defense financial resources,” “establishing a cost system,” “implementing internal control,” “strengthening fund management” and “applying statistical analysis,” are implemented to refine budget allocation and execution, and further achieve administrative goals by supporting force buildup and readiness.

       and the force buildup timetable. The defense budget over the past decade (2004-
2013) was between NT$ 252.5 to 334 billion, accounting for 16.07% to 19.51% of the central government’s total budget. This shows that the EY is still given proper priority to the force buildup timetable, despite financial constraints, and exerts every effort to satisfy the MND’s requirements. When new armaments are available for purchase, the EY is committed to make the funds available through using reserve funds or adopting other measures (e.g. defense budget increase or special budget) so that weapons procurement can be successfully carried out, see 
Figure 6-1 .
( II ) Defense Budget Allocation Principles
The MND must consider the stable implementation of defense programs within the budget it receives, and must first satisfy “legally obligated expenditures (e.g. implementation of voluntarism)” followed by “maintaining the availability of combat equipment and funding for long-term projects (e.g. acquiring and

MND allocates funds for “secondary or new projects (competitive requirement control is adopted based on approval status)” depending on the flexibility of the remaining budget. Proper planning of defense financial resources and mid-term to long-term financial resource forecast models are utilized to build effective financial resource forecast, gradually providing support for the procurement of new weapons and development of “innovative/asymmetric capabilities.” The defense budget allocation in the past decade is shown in 
Figure 6-2 .
( III ) Separation of Confidential and Non-confidential Budget
The MND draws a clear line between “non-confidential” and “confidential” budgets based on defense policies, missions, project properties and contents, so as to satisfy defense and security requirements and the public’s right to know. The confidential budget was only 5.67% of the overall defense budget in

Figure 6-3 ). This substantial 
improvement of defense budget transparency was recognized by the Legislative Yuan and auditing and control units on several occasions. The MND will continue to review the ratio of the confidential budget to further increase defense transparency.
( IV ) Budgeting and Key Defense Programs in 2013
The defense budget was NT$312.7 billion in 2013 and was allocated as follows:
1. Personnel Maintenance
NT$156.1 billion was allocated for personnel maintenance and mainly used to expand recruitment of volunteers and implement the 4 month military training for draft age men, so that “voluntarism” can be implemented as scheduled.
2. Operations Maintenance
NT$70.7 billion was allocated for operations maintenance and is mainly used for military administrative operations, daily operations, procuring parts and maintenance capabilities of combatants (fighters, armored vehicles, warships), and replenishing precision ammunitions.
3. Military Investment
NT$81.3 billion was allocated to enhance joint capabilities, implementing 23 new projects including the procurement of mine hunters (stage two), and continuing 59 existing projects including procuring new attack helicopters, showing the determination to build self-defense capabilities. Regarding the procurement of F-16C/D fighters and diesel submarines, 
176
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 3 National Defense Capabilities
Chapter 6 National Defense Resourcespractical and cost effective budgeting will be practiced to support 
minimum requirements for initial project operations while evaluating the progress of US decisions. If the U.S. agrees to the sales, proper budgeting procedures will be followed to acquire sufficient funding from the Executive Yuan.
4. Other
NT$4.6 billion was allocated and mainly used for “compensations for casualties and damages caused by military activities” and the National Security Bureau.
II. National Defense Financial Management
Defense affairs are complex and open-ended. To closely link limited resources to critical missions and implement defense programs as scheduled and expected, the MND has designed a defense financial resource management system and supporting financial schemes to provide immediate feedback of statistical analysis for decision-making at each level. At the current stage, the MND has further developed budget and cost accounting systems in hopes of fully utilizing its financial resources.
( I ) Allocating Financial Resources
Due to its limited resources, the MND uses a simple Keynes model as the basis for system design, and constructed a dynamic model for the defense financial system after considering the Executive Yuan’s mid-term budgetary estimates, the overall economy, and the government’s financial situation, debt, and administrative priorities. This system is used to estimate the amount of financial resources for national defense in mid- to long-terms, which is the basis of financial resource constraints when developing force buildup concepts, force restructuring, and five-year administration plans. Furthermore, funding requirements are estimated based on the spirit of zero base budget, and 
177
       allocation of resources for military investments will be planned towards key 
developments. Operation maintenance funding will first be used to sustain comat capabilities, including maintaining combat equipment availability, exercises and training, and logistics readiness, so that maximized effectiveness is obtained with limited financial resources.
( II ) Establishing a Cost System
The MND has continued to build the defense cost system based on the spirit of the “ROC Armed Forces planned budget system,” and has completed data on “military academy education and training cost” and “military training base maintenance unit maintenance costs.” Cost summaries and resource analysis of annual budget execution is completed through on-site visits and validation mechanisms, and accounting records and forms are compiled to provide cost records required for internal management functions, providing cost data required for projects at each stage. At present, surveys have been completed to verify the rationality and accuracy of operating procedures and costs of maintenance units in all training bases. Human resources, repair capabilities, cost control, and resource integration were further analyzed to provide important decision-making information for future military investment projects.
( III ) Implementing Internal Control
The “Design Principles of the Ministry of National Defense Internal Control System,” “Key Tasks of the Ministry of National Defense’s Robust Internal Control Implementation Plan” and “Ministry of National Defense Internal Control System” were enacted in accordance with internal control mechanisms implemented by the Executive Yuan. The MND requires all level units to carry out internal control training and policy promotion to its subordinates. It implements strict control and supervision over general and individual items to prevent fraudulent practices and reduce risk, thereby enhancing administrative performance, abiding by the law, ensuring asset safety and providing 
178
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 3 National Defense Capabilities
Chapter 6 National Defense Resourcesreliable information. Furthermore, comprehensive examination, project-
based examination and year-end tour examination are carried out to validate the internal control of each unit, discover potential risks and difficulties, suitably resolve issues, and establish efficient, effective and economic internal examination work.
( IV ) Strengthening Fund Management
Special funds under the MND are mainly used for renovating old military dependents’ villages and old military bases, strengthening materials production services, and elevating military and civilian technology development (industrial) levels, so as to support force buildup and readiness requirements. With consideration to the limited supply of defense resources, an important challenge to the MND’s management of special funds is to fully utilize resources to support administration. At the current stage, revision of the “Regulations on the Balance, Safekeeping and Use of the ROC Armed Forces Old Military Base Renovation Fund” was completed, and the “ROC Armed Forces Old Military Base Renovation Fund” was renamed the “ROC Armed Forces Military Base and Facility Renovation Fund,” expanding the scope of the fund’s income and expenditure and increasing income from land vitalization. Furthermore, the MND has continued to implement the “Defense Resource Integration Project” and “Improving Performance Evaluations of Fund Related Units,” placing emphasis on the linkage between output capacity of development units and force buildup requirements of armed services. The budget control system serves as a platform for combining managerial accounting tools with the ROC Armed Forces’ budget system. Furthermore, financial resources of regular funds and special funds are integrated for overall dispatching of special funds, and the five-year administration plan is dynamically adjusted to satisfy the MND’s administrative requirements, as well as prepare financial resources for subsequent fund operation directions.
179
       ( V ) Applying Statistical Analysis
The “National Defense Statistical Information Service Network” was 
constructed with consideration to the necessity, theme, direction, and innovation of defense administration, and carries out the gathering, management, compilation and application of statistical data, as well as special topic statistical analysis, official business statistics, annual reports of statistics, and statistical indexes. The MND hopes to provide accurate, targeted, logical, and the most recent quantified statistical information that is valuable to effectiveness evaluations and defense decision making. At the current stage, the MND has compiled 172 statistics under 14 categories, including personnel, intelligence, operations, logistics, projects, and political warfare, and strives to effectively support management decision-making by achieving “integration of statistical databases for application in decision-making,” “stepping up auditing of annual reports on statistics of defense affairs to increase its accuracy and value,” “expanding the scope of statistics gathered on official business to issue and apply statistics under different themes” and “utilizing the decision-making support function of special topic statistics in coordination with joint staff requirements.”

2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 3 National Defense Capabilities
Chapter 6 National Defense ResourcesSection 3  Armaments Readiness
The armaments management mechanism is combined with force buildup 
requirements, and satisfies operations requirements with the highest investment return. A number of measures have been implemented under the armaments “acquisition strategy, technology strategy and logistics strategy” to effectively carry out armaments affairs and support military operations. Such measures include military investment projects, R&D and production, project evaluation, construction management, and talent cultivation.
I. Acquisition Strategy Planning
( I ) Military Investment Projects
Based on the concept of “innovation/asymmetry” and operations requirements for short-, mid- and long-term joint capabilities, limited defense resources are utilized for military investment projects to maximize credible combat capabilities. A total of 33 military investment proposals for 2014 were completed in 2012. The proposals were reviewed in February 2013 based on the priority of capability requirements and financial resource forecast in 2014.
( II ) Research and Development
The MND established the “technology availability evaluation” mechanism under the force buildup guidance of “technological leadership, information and electronic superiority, joint interdiction, and homeland defense” based on the maturity of defense technologies in each category. Technological development is divided into seven different levels, namely; “basic research,” “applied research,” “key technology development,” “display verification,” “engineering development,” “research and development testing management and support” and “combat system development,” so as to reduce R&D risk and gradually increase autonomous defense technological capabilities.Funds are allocated each year for the development of defense technologies that are high-tech, classified, key, or cannot be obtained from other countries.
181
       Resources of the industrial, government, academic and research sectors are 
effectively integrated to ensure that weapons systems and equipment are successfully developed and cost effective. The MND has planned 43 weapons performance R&D projects to be implemented in 2014-2018, which focus on developing low cost, highly effective, easy to build, non-disputed “innovative/asymmetric” capabilities, and is actively importing high-tech key technologies and building technological capabilities for logistics maintenance via armaments procurements, as well as industrial technology transfer in major weapons performance enhancement projects, so that key defense technology capabilities could be enhanced.
( III ) Production and Manufacturing
Production and manufacturing are based on the guiding principles “core establishment, capacity integration, strategic alliances, and division of labor.” “Cooperative production, technology transfer, and outsourced production” are adopted so that military goods are produced and manufactured through division of labor with the private sector. This establishes key production capabilities, accelerates the production and deployment of armaments, and elevates the quality of military goods. Over 10 thousand items of weapon systems, equipment, missiles, artillery and ammunition were produced in 2012 with total output value worth over NT$6.1 billion, effectively enhancing overall combat capabilities.
( IV ) Armaments Acquisition
Armaments acquisition is carried out based on the principle of “prioritizing domestic production, and using foreign procurement for support,” and aims to enhance technological research and output capabilities. Project supervision and management is implemented in the acquisition process to effectively achieve project objectives and provide forces with suitable weapons systems and equipment.
182
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 3 National Defense Capabilities
Chapter 6 National Defense ResourcesUnder the premise of satisfying combat requirements and complying with 
policy guidance, the MND employs advanced management technologies and a robust acquisition management system for armaments acquisition, which includes production, development, modification, performance enhancement, collaboration and procurement, to gain the best results and satisfy readiness requirements using the most appropriate cost, lowest risk, and shortest time.
( V ) International Armaments Exchanges
For advanced weapons that cannot be domestically developed, armament exchange will be enhanced with advanced nations. Based on the principles of equality, mutually beneficial and resource sharing, weapons research and development capacities will be gradually developed through prioritization of technological cooperation and transfers, complemented by off-the-shelf procurement as a secondary option. For example, the US-Taiwan Defense Industry Conference was held in September 18
th - 20th, 2011 and September 
29th - October 4th, 2012 in Richmond, Virginia and Hershey, Pennsylvania, 
respectively. The conferences yielded concrete results in improving US-Taiwan relations and mutual trust, acquiring major procurements, and promoting defense policies.
II. Technology Strategy Planning
The defense technology development strategy aims to satisfy joint operations requirements, and includes “key technologies,” “sensitive technologies,” exclusive technologies, “technologies with export restrictions” and “system integration.” Domestic technological capabilities are first evaluated, and then armaments resources are integrated to elevate overall technological capabilities, so as to effectively achieve national defense self-sufficiency and support force buildup and readiness.
183
       ( I ) Development of Defense Technologies
Development of defense technologies is based on the “Ten-year Military 
Planning Concept” and “Five-year Force Programming Plan,” which specify force planning objectives and the sequence of force restructuring. Furthermore, defense technology research capabilities are systematically evaluated in coordination with major weapons systems investment projects, and then joint operations requirements are considered based on future trends of technological development. Existing R&D capabilities are then used as a basis for establishing advanced technology development strategies, so as to elevate basic technology and system R&D levels and lay out a visionary blueprint of short-, mid- and long-term defense technology development.
( II ) Development of Defense Industries
To establish a supply chain of parts and components for weapons systems and to avoid the issue of obsolete supply source, non-sensitive and non-essential equipment is outsourced to the private sector. The private sector’s participation in R&D, production and maintenance of military material, as well as the establishment of a sub-system, module, and parts and components supply chain system of systems accelerates the development of defense industries, and further drives industrial upgrade. As of August 2013, 440 satellite factories were established and provide 13,379 items of key components for armaments.Total amount of outsourcing was roughly NT$7.9 billion in 2012. This initiative improves the availability of military equipment and creates market opportunities for industries.
III. Logistics Strategy Planning
Under the guidance from the defense strategies and force buildup concepts, as well as the vision for logistics and future logistics reform plans, the full life cycle management was adopted as the framework supported by supply chain management and strategic alliances with industries for refining the logistics 
184
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 3 National Defense Capabilities
Chapter 6 National Defense Resourcesorganization and operating procedures, utilizing available defense resources, 
and maximizing investment returns. These measures aim to effectively satisfy requirements of future warfare and forces.
( I ) Total Life Cycle Management
A complete management system and process has been established with regards to the research, development, production, procurement and deployment stages of armaments, so as to strengthen modeled management. Planning, maintenance, and management mechanisms will be developed, and logistical support capacities will be established to enable effective management and cost control throughout the full life cycles of weapon systems, thereby maximizing the availability.
( II ) Supply Chain Management
An equipment model database is utilized to establish long-term supply and demand channels with suppliers in the form of agreements or contracts for military procurement, commercial procurement, and open-ended procurement of spare parts of assembly and accessories for weapons systems. General supplies and expendable materials will be jointly contracted or purchased in bulk to simplify contractual management personnel, reduce inventory, and improve maintenance and repair efficiency.
( III ) Strategic Alliances with Industries
Strategic alliances with industries aim to build a self-sufficient defense industry base, to establish an industrial collaboration and support network, to reduce life cycle cost, and to enhance the efficiency of logistic operations. Non-essential maintenance work, including logistic maintenance and support, is gradually outsourced to the private sector to lower weapons maintenance cost, increase weapons availability, and improve the private sector’s performance.
185
       IV. Procurement Management Planning
Military units are supervised to carry out procurements in accordance with 
the Government Procurement Act, to create an open and fair procurement environment and improve procurement performance. The MND continues to offer procurement specialty training courses to cultivate personnel with procurement specialties and improve their expertise. The implementation status of procurements is as follows:

Chapter 6 National Defense Resourcesplans are formulated for cadre members responsible for procurement at each 
level to receive Strategic Management, Commanding staff management and formal advanced courses. In 2012, three members completed strategic management, eight members received commanding staff management, and fifty members acquired formal advanced certifications on procurement-related courses.
V. Construction Management
( I ) Improving Living Facilities, Implementing Energy Conservation and 
Environmental Protection
To continue improving servicemen’s living quarters, the MND surveyed old military bases that urgently needed to be renovated (138 in total), and began reconstruction of 9 military bases that were approved for the first stage by the Executive Yuan in 2011. The bases will be completed in 2017. Subsequent projects will be implemented based on the financial situation of the Old Military Base and Facility Renovation Fund.Furthermore, defense financial resources will be used to construct job-specific dormitories with 400 units in Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung starting in 2015, and renovations of existing job-specific dormitories will continue to be carried out to reach objectives of voluntarism and improve care for servicemen. These dormitories will further improve the living quality of military dependents, provide them with thorough services and accommodations, build esprit de corps among servicemen and their dependents, and increase incentives for outstanding servicemen to remain in the military.Military investment construction projects of the MND are outsourced in accordance with the resource outsourcing policy. Moreover, the MND is actively promoting green buildings in military bases in coordination with the government’s environment protection and energy conservation policy, so as to reduce the impact on the environment and waste of resources. Under the government policy to improve construction quality, the “Ministry of National 
187
       Defense Construction Inspection Implementation Plan” was formulated 
based on construction characteristics and organization of the ROC Armed Forces, and the “MND construction inspection team” was assembled to carry out construction inspections in accordance with the law, thereby effectively supervising and improving the ROC construction quality management.
( II ) Continuing the Release of Military Bases, Vitalizing National Land 
Utilization
1. In coordination with the government’s major policies and national land 
planning, as well as tourism development requirements on Kinmen, Matzu and Penghu, transfer and release of land occupied by the ROC Armed Forces are carried out based on the principle of “merging small military bases into large ones, and Army, Navy and Air Force encamped in one military base” and in accordance with the “Regulations on Military Base Transfer and Release Inspections and Operations.” A total of 2,263 military bases with 3,071 ha of land were reviewed and transferred to the National Property Administration or other government agencies, contributing to the expansion of domestic demand and vitalization of economic development.
2. Considering the requirements of local development, environment 
protection parks and disaster relief missions, a total of 49 military bases with 69.15 ha of low utilization land was reviewed and provided for use by local governments. The land was fully utilized for greening, providing recreational facilities, and sheltering disaster victims.

2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 3 National Defense Capabilities
Chapter 6 National Defense ResourcesSection 4  National Defense and People’s 
Livelihood
Capabilities of the MND and industrial, academic and research sectors are 
utilized for defense technology development in accordance with Article 22 of the National Defense Act, as well as the Executive Yuan’s policy guidance to “revitalize the economy and expand domestic demand.” Other measures, such as acquiring key technologies of other countries through industrial collaboration mechanisms and transforming the Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology into an administrative legal person, will allow the private sector to gain defense technology and industrial capabilities, which will elevate domestic industrial technology levels and satisfy force buildup and readiness requirements. These measures will create a win-win situation for national defense and economic development, and achieve unity of national defense and people’s livelihood.
I. Resource Outsourcing
Outsourcing measures, including “government owned contractor operated (GOCO),” “build- operate-transfer (BOT),” “strategic commercial maintenance” and “domestic procurement of parts and components,” will channel defense resources into the private sector, elevate domestic technology levels, vitalize the economy, and increase employment opportunities.
( I ) Resource Outsourcing Approach
Based on the principle that “the Armed Forces will not build capabilities or make foreign purchases of products that can be supplied by domestic manufacturers,” the ROC Armed Forces outsources non-sensitive, low priority and non-essential capabilities to the private sector, to drive research, development, production and maintenance of military goods in the private sector. The target annual outsourcing amount is calculated from the defense budget deducted by “personnel maintenance cost,” “weapons, equipment 
189
       and maintenance requirements that must be procured externally” and “non-
transaction behavior,” and sequentially increases each year.
( II ) Implementation Results in 2012-2013
The target outsourcing amount was NT$92 billion in 2012 and actual amount was NT$77.9 billion. The target amount for 2013 is NT$90.6 billion. Major long-term outsourcing projects are as follows:
1. Large missile boat construction.
2. Small and medium tactical vehicle procurement and maintenance.
3. Eight-wheel armored vehicle production and maintenance.
4. IDF performance upgrade.
5. Oil and ammunition replenishment ship construction.
6. High performance combatant ship construction.
7. Night vision equipment procurement.
8. Strategic commercial maintenance of military aircraft, military ships, and 
land equipment.
9. GOCO military factories.
( III ) Future Development
1. Continued implementation of strategic commercial maintenance
The “ROC Armed Forces Guidelines on Strategic Commercial Maintenance of Equipment” was enacted, and serves as the basis for implementing strategic commercial maintenance of military aircraft, military ships and land equipment, and establishing long-term partnerships with domestic contractors, which will vitalize the domestic

Chapter 6 National Defense Resourceseconomy at the same time.
2. Prioritizing domestic procurement over foreign procurement and 
expanding outsourcing of military goods development, production and 
maintenance.
The MND has ordered that the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Armaments 
Bureau set maximum foreign procurement amounts and minimum domestic development, maintenance and procurement amounts to ensure domestic acquisition and maintenance of armaments, using this as a means to control and encourage domestic procurements among subordinate units.
II. Promoting Private Participation in Public Infrastructure
In response to future organizational functions and requirements of force buildup and readiness, the MND has reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of encouragement measures, reducing unnecessary consumption of human, material and financial resources for logistics, and vitalizing the utilization and maintenance of property and military bases via civilian emerging (specialized) technologies or management concepts, thereby enhancing overall public performance and mutually benefiting public and private sectors.
( I ) Policy Objectives
The MND follows regulations of the “Act for Promotion of Private Participation in Public Infrastructures” and allows private enterprises to operate listed items to reduce operating cost, drive economic development, and achieve win-win for both military and civilian.
( II ) Implementation Status and Results
1. Projects implemented in coordination with the Executive Yuan’s policy to 
promote private participation are divided into “medical and health care” 
191
       and “tourism and recreation.” There are currently 17 ongoing projects, 
including the “Tri-service General Hospital Chinese Medicine Pharmacy Outsourced Operation,” private investment amount accumulated to roughly NT$900 million.
2. Three contracted operation projects were added in 2012, additional 
investment amount was roughly NT$170 million.
3. The National Defense Medical Center Tri-service General Hospital took 
part in the Executive Yuan’s 10th Golden Thumb Awards, and the “Tri-
service General Hospital Shopping Street BOT” and “Tri-service General Hospital Parking Lot BOT” projects won excellence awards under “government agencies and teams.”
4. The 17 projects that have completed contract signing will continue to be 
implemented and controlled in 2013. Items that can be released to private enterprises will be planned in accordance with policy.
III. Comprehensive Planning and Utilization of Military 
Bases
Utilization of military bases gives consideration to the balanced development of “national defense security,” “local infrastructure,” “livelihood requirements” and “disaster response,” and is combined with capability buildup and force deployment. As long as basic requirements of readiness missions are not affected, idled military bases could be transferred to the National Property Administration or used for national economic infrastructure and local development in accordance with the “Regulations on Military Base Transfer and Release Inspections and Operations.” This measure aims to drive economic growth and achieve unity of national defense and people’s livelihood.
IV. Environmental Protection and Energy Conservation
In response to the increasing awareness of environmental protection issues

Chapter 7 All-out Defense
Section 1  National Defense Education
In an era of globalization, the scope of national security has expanded from 
traditional military security to comprehensive security trends, such as political, economic and social development, and environmental protection. The “All-out Defense Education Act” was promulgated on February 2
nd, 2005 
so that all citizens may understand the content of defense security and that “defense security is a matter that concerns everyone. Defense infrastructure is everyone’s responsibility.” A number of education and promotion channels are being actively used to increase citizens’ defense knowledge and awareness. Furthermore, diverse and entertaining activities that are also educational are organized to attract public attention to national defense and encourage citizens to participate in defense affairs, so that citizens will approve and support all-out defense.
I. All-out Defense Education
In order to achieve all-out defense concepts of the “Act of All-Out Defense Mobilization Preparation,” the Ministry of National Defense (MND), in the capacity of the central competent authority and under guidance from the Executive Yuan with full cooperation from governmental agencies and local governments, has continued to implement all-out defense education and dedicated active efforts to the planning and implementation of school education, on-the-job education for governmental agencies, social education, and defense relic preservation, promotion and education. The MND hopes to thus achieve comprehensive defense development and ensure national security.
( I ) Deepening Defense Concepts via School Education
The all-out defense education summer camp was held in 30 batches in 2012, and provided training for 3,290 of our youth so that all-out defense education may take root. Diverse activities, such as poster and children drawing selections, were organized, and support was provided to the live-fire experience activity 
199
       for high (vocational) school students. Furthermore, a series of “on-campus”  
campaign  was organized in coordination with student club events, utilizing exchanges between our youth, military academies, and forces to increase identification with and support for defense affairs, deepen the concept of all-out defense, and recruit high quality defense talent.
( II ) Improving On-job Education to Raise Defense Awareness
Excellent teachers are selected in coordination with requirements of each unit in all-out defense education, and provide on-the-job education courses for governmental agencies, special municipalities, local governments, and public schools. All applications were made online starting on December 1
st, 2012, 
and the application process for becoming an on-the-job education teacher was streamlined, improving the defense knowledge and perception of civil servants. Additionally, the “All-out Defense Education School” was established in coordination with the “e-learning network” and “e-learning center” of the Civil Service Development Institute, and provides all-out defense e-learning courses to civil servants, so as to improve on-the-job education results of civil servants.
( III ) Promoting Social Education to Inspire Patriotism
Under the premise that operational duties and mission execution are not affected, the MND organized the “Defense Journey of Discovery Military Base Opening,” community college courses, military base visits, and the Wan An Air Raid Drill during holidays and celebrations, so that the public may gain an extensive understanding of force buildup and defense preparation results of the Armed Forces. These activities effectively increased virtuous interactions with the public and aroused their sense of patriotism. (shown in

disaster relief” to support disaster relief of major complex disasters.Reserve forces that are mustered were included in disaster relief operations for the first time in 2012, validating the disaster relief capabilities of reserve forces while increasing manpower for disaster relief. Furthermore, the Air Force’s new EC-225 search and rescue helicopters joined in disaster relief operations to elevate the ROC Armed Forces’ rescue capabilities and form a complete disaster relief system. Missions carried out by the EC-225 search and rescue helicopter include disaster victim rescue, emergency MEDEVAC, supply drops in disaster areas, and supply, transport and rescue operations in high mountains and offshore islands. Over 19 thousand police, firefighters, civilian vigilance, medical, and military personnel participated in the comprehensive drills from 2012 to 2013, and over 33 hundred vehicles (equipment), 53 ships, and 41 sorties of aircraft  were mobilized, allowing the concept of “disaster avoidance is better than disaster prevention” to be rooted in communities, neighborhoods and individuals.
V. Stepping Up Reserve Force Training
The reserve force consists of over 2.6 million reservists to meet the requirements of military missions, and is organized into ground, services and political warfare reserve forces, navy  ship-borne and shore-borne reserve forces, military service force, and  replenishment echelons. The forces carry out over the shore defense, in-depth defense, mobile strike, defile defense, garrison defense, and service support based on the mission requirements of each theater of operations.To maintain the capabilities of reserve forces, muster-calls prioritizing reserve servicemen who have been discharged (graduated) for less than 8 years are made every other year. Over 140 thousand reserve servicemen are mustered each year for 5 to 7 days training, which focuses on operational missions,

Section 1  Disaster Prevention and Relief
The ROC Armed Forces has the responsibility to protect the nation and its 
people, and is thus actively preparing for disaster prevention and relief in the event of a complex disaster. war game and specialized disaster relief training is utilized to enhance disaster prevention and relief capabilities, so as to protect citizens’ lives, assets and homes. The ROC Armed Forces “prepares for disasters in advance, deploys troops with an eye to disaster preparedness, and ensures readiness for rescue operations” under the policy “disaster relief is akin to fighting a battle.” These measures strengthen the ROC Armed Forces’ capabilities to carry out disaster prevention and relief missions, and enable it to effectively aid central and local governments by rapidly engaging in relief operations. The ROC Armed Forces hopes to make the most out of limited resources, and thereby achieve “shortest amount of time, effective use of resources, and efficient personnel.”
I. Disaster Prevention and Preparedness
( I ) Disaster Potential Survey
The responsible units have gathered aerial and satellite images of over 700 topographic targets in 11 categories, namely traffic arteries, bridges, rivers, dammed lakes, debris flow, fault zones, and low lying areas announced by the Executive Yuan, as well as (nuclear) power plants, oil reservoirs, reservoirs, and coastal areas at risk of tsunami, which were added after Japan’s 311 complex disaster. The images were added to the topographic map database of the ROC 
Armed Forces.
( II ) Troop Deployment Preparedness
Military bases in each theater of operation (TO) pre-deploy troops in areas 
prone to mud slide and flooding 24 hours before a typhoon lands, when there is more flexibility for maneuvers, so as to buy more quick response time for disaster relief. The commander is required to directly contact heads of local 
211
       governments and notify them of the number of troops deployed, their location,

A total of 8 circular workshops on “Gatekeepers for Suicide and Self-inflicted Injuries” targeting 4,856 military personnel of bureaus, offices, and departments under the MND and Joint Staff Head Quarters have been conducted in year 2013 with an aim to making all service members to become suicide gatekeepers who cherish life and support fellow soldiers.
(  I I I  )  Improvement of Physical Examinations in Connection with 
Military Service
To simplify military conscripts’ medical screening procedures; eliminate wastefulness of medical resources; and reduce administrative red tape to streamline and expedite procedures of government services provided to the general public, the MND has stipulated and promulgated Reference Tables Comparing Criteria Listed both on “Grading of Mental or Physical Disabilities” and “Standard of Physical and Psychological Fitness Levels Defined as Being Exempt From Compulsive Military Service on Medical Ground for To-be Conscripts”. Any would-be conscripts already determined by social welfare institutions as having physical or psychological disabilities can now present their respective “Manual Certifying Status of Physical or Psychological Disability” for determining their fitness levels in lieu of normal procedures for medical screening. For conscripts already in military service who have sustained illnesses or injuries that may potentially prevent them from carrying on their military service for medical reasons, such conscripts may file applications for early retirement on ground of medical reasons and be discharged/separated

( IV )  Improving and Refining Healthcare Services Quality
(1) Armed forces hospitals have consistently strived for innovation and 
continued to improve healthcare services quality. Aside from passing various categories of hospital accreditations of their respective hospitals, armed forces hospitals have also won numerous prizes and recognitions bestowed by both government and professional institutions. Starting from year 2011, military hospitals have pushed forward programs and/or projects of integrating electronic medical records, enhancing convenience and efficiency for patients transferred among military hospitals, and ensuring continuity of care among different medical treatment facilities. Additionally, various measures aimed at improving services quality have also been launched, including multiple channels for outpatient appointment registration, express lanes/counters for service members and their dependents processing their medical bills, as well as expediting application procedures and shortening days of work required by hospital administrators to process for all kinds of medical documentations and certificates.
(2) In order to expand healthcare services density/coverage for both service 
members and veterans and to facilitate shared utilization of medical resources of military and veteran administration systems, the MND cooperated and collaborated with Commission of Veterans Affairs and institutionalized complement mechanisms that allow medical resources of the aforementioned two systems to be shared and integrated, based on 4 principles of resources sharing, equality and mutual benefit, academic exchanges, and joint effort in rendering medical support for disaster scenarios, to simultaneously bolster and enhance healthcare for service members and veterans. Furthermore, service members, dependents of fallen soldiers, veterans, and their dependents are entitled to preferential fare 
235
       rates for outpatient appointment registration in either military or veterans 
healthcare facilities. Additionally, the MND has signed a cooperation agreement with Commission of Veterans Affairs covering mutual support of healthcare providers, resources sharing, medical education and researches, and joint effort of disaster medical support. Such an agreement has significantly facilitated and improved healthcare service quality provided by both sides.
(3) In order to increase and improve accessibility to medical care for service 
members stationed in remote offshore islands in a timely manner; to enhance preventative health measures as well as to provide more specialist medical care for service members; and to reduce undue or unnecessary

proper, the MND has furthermore completed setting up of telemedicine connections among armed forces hospitals and offshore islands such as Kinmen and Matsu. Real-time telemedicine connections can be established between Specialist level physicians in armed force hospitals and medical doctors stationing in those remote islands to facilitate online telemedicine consultations to concurrently increase access to healthcare, ensure completeness of healthcare offered, and uphold service quality.
VI. Joint Effort to Maintain Public Order
The Military Police assists police departments with the defense of public security in accordance with “The Code of Criminal Procedure,” “Regulations on the Dispatch of Judiciary Police,” “Code of Court Martial Procedure” and “Military Police Support Protocol,” mainly focusing on military cases, as well as other judicial cases. Furthermore, the Military Police cooperates with the police system to establish “threat warning and intelligence gathering” capabilities, so as to consolidate the foundation for “counter-terrorism and emergency response.” A total of 1,962 criminal cases were handled in 2012, in which 5,105 persons were brought to justice, 97 deserters were captured and 140 firearms, 2,296 rounds of ammunition and 3,314.19 kg of drugs were confiscated.
VII. Landmine Removal on Offshore Islands
The Army assembled a demining group in 2007 to remove landmines in the announced minefields within the statutory time period. The group is responsible for managing self-executed and contracted landmine removal, so as to cut down on government expenditure and contribute to the development of offshore islands.The Army’s demining group planned landmine removal operations at two stages starting in 2007 in coordination with economic development on 
237
       offshore islands. As of late December 2012, demining operations in the 308 
minefields that were announced had been completed as scheduled. Landmines in minefields with a total area of 3,503,571 m
2 were cleared, and a total of 
109,476 landmines and ordnance were disposed of. After landmine removal was completed, the local governments in Kinmen and Matsu returned the land to its owners in accordance with the “Offshore Island Development Act” for revitalization, driving local economic development. Furthermore, to ensure the region’s safety, the group is currently surveying and removing unexploded ordnance scattered landmines outside of the announced minefields. As of July 31
st, 2013, the group cleared 53 minefields in Kinmen, 37 minefields in Matsu, 
and 5 minefields in Wuchiu. The specialized troops and equipment for demining will be distributed among the engineer corps of Kinmen and Matsu, and will continue to assist with probing operations in development sites in coordination with local economic development, as well as reports from civilians.
VIII. Joint Protecting of Fishing and Fishery Resources
To show its determination to defend our nation’s sovereignty and protect fishing and fishery resources, the ROC Armed Forces carries out joint fishing protection exercises together with Coast Guard patrol ships, and aims to achieve “where there are ROC fishing boats, Coast Guard cutters would be there for protection; where there are Coast Guard cutters, naval combatant vessels would be there for support.” In other words, fishing protection is effectively achieved via “Coast Guard protects fishermen, and the Navy supports Coast Guard.”
( I ) Strengthen sea power to protect fishing rights
Closely monitor sea areas where domestic fishing boats gather during the fishing season, flexibly adjust key points of fishing protection, support Coast Guard cutters, protect national sovereignty, and demonstrate law enforcement capabilities and jurisdiction of the ROC Armed Forces and Coast Guard Administration over the ROC’s exclusive economic zone.

The Reserve Command’s service center in each local consists of personnel from mobilization, logistics management and logistics service units. The service centers answer questions reservists have on military service and their administrative and legal rights, and recruit volunteer legal consultants to help reservists with litigation and legal issues, protecting reservists’ rights and providing them with simple consultation.
239
       ( II ) Joint Disaster Prevention and Relief
When disasters occur, the Central Emergency Response Center utilizes the 364 
consultation centers of townships and districts in the country for precautionary evacuation of residents and disaster relief supported by reserve forces.
( III ) Emergency Assistance and Referral
A comprehensive survey was conducted on agencies and organizations within jurisdiction that can provide emergency relief, so as to understand disaster relief standards and establish channels for referral of military reservists that encounter emergencies, illnesses and difficulties.
( IV ) Implementation of Services
Utilizing consulting organizations as an interface, the ROC Armed Forces implements continuous long-term services based on the spirit to provide “comprehensive, available to all, active and effective” services. The ROC Armed Forces aims to protect the rights of military reservists and unify them via regular services and care. Furthermore, social resources are utilized to provide mobile services, suitably providing referral services to expand the scope of services.
X. Appeals and Petitions
( I ) Appeals
The MND established an appeals mechanism to protect citizens’ rights and enhance administrative performance. Responsible units of various affairs are integrated into this mechanism for handling appeals, including administrative suggestions, legal inquiry, violation incidents report,  rights protection, as well as citizen convenient serving provision. When appeals are received, the responsible unit is immediately notified to protect the rights of the persons concerned, and thus encourage the military-civilian communication efforts. Furthermore, types of appeals, the amount of cases, issues involved, and their results are periodically reviewed and analyzed to propose improvement suggestions. The current status of 
240
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 4 All-out National Defense
Chapter 8 Citizen Servicesappeals by channel is described below:
1. Appeals in Person
When handling appeals in person, the MND assigns personnel along with 
responsible units to follow the procedures - “understand the situation on-site,” “meet with the person to explain matters,” “process the case” and “add the case to the control list and report results.” All appeals are properly handled accordingly, and a timetable is set for handling complex cases. A total of 235 appeals in person were received from 2011 to 2013, all of which were properly handled. (see 
Appendix 17 )
2. Appeals via Letters
Letters received each day are immediately processed as they arrive, and are controlled by “case” for the responsible unit to handle. A reply is sent within 30 days of receiving an appeal, and the status of cases is reviewed on a monthly basis. Patterns are analyzed to improve communication with citizens and effectively handle appeal cases. A total of 4,219 appeals were received from 2011 to 2013, all of which were properly handled. (see 
Appendix 17 )
3. Appeals via E-mail
When appeals and petitions concerning defense affairs are received, the MND assigns personnel carefully handle the cases and then transfer them to responsible units, which handle the case within the deadline and give a formal reply. This process provides better citizen services. A total of 3,663 appeals were received via e-mails from 2011 to 2013, all of which were properly handled. (see 
Appendix 17 )
( II ) Petitions
Article 16 of the Constitution of the ROC protects the people’s right to petition. Citizens have the right to petition any illegal or inappropriate administrative 
241
       penalties imposed by administrative agencies.
1. The MND enacted the “Regulations on the Establishment of the Ministry 
of National Defense Petitions and Appeals Committee” according 
to the “Administrative Appeal Act” and “Organization Regulations of Petitions and Appeals Committees of the Executive Yuan and its Subordinate Agencies,” and established the Petitions and Appeals Committee. In compliance with administration according to law and to protect servicemen and citizens’ rights, the MND Petitions and Appeals Committee handles petitions from citizens regarding illegal or improper administrative acts of the MND and its subordinate agencies (institutions), forces or schools that have damaged their rights, and makes a decision within 3 months of receiving a petition.
2. The MND Petitions and Appeals Committee consists of 15 members, 12 
of which are scholars and experts on the law recruited from outside of the MND, in which 5 are female members to make petition review more objective and fair, while meeting requirements on gender equality.
3. Between July 2011 and June 2013, the Petitions and Appeals Committee 
handled a total of 267 petitions (25 petitions were from the previous period), in which 255 were closed (228 petitions were decided on, 3 petitions were withdrawn, and 24 petitions were transferred) and 12 remain ongoing (see the table below for statistics). The MND was rated 1
st 
by the Executive Yuan in efficiency of deciding on petitions in 2011 and 2012.
4. The MND continues to release results of petition cases and information 
on related laws on its website for access by the public and related units. Common mistakes of agencies are surveyed every six months, a list of mistakes to be corrected is issued to agencies for making improvements (e.g. the administrative decision notice did not indicate a relief channel or provided wrong instructions), increasing the correctness of administrative penalties imposed by the MND’s subordinate agencies (schools). 
242
       MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC
2013NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT
Part 4 All-out National Defense
Chapter 8 Citizen ServicesFurthermore, the MND invites agencies that imposed the penalties of 
argumentative cases or where the applicable law is questionable to jointly resolve issues. The ratio of administrative penalties that was maintained for petition cases reach 94%, showing that the accuracy of administrative penalties has been effectively increased.
5 . To verify results of the ROC Armed Forces in implementing 
administration according to law, the Petitions and Appeals Committee visits and provides consultation to subordinate agencies (schools) of the MND on petition affairs on an annual basis, gaining an in-depth understanding of their implementation of petition affairs, and using the opportunity to propagate laws and examples, communicate concepts, and provide suggestions for correcting mistakes. The committee also organizes the “MND Petition Cases Review” to enhance the professional competencies of staffs and improve the quality and efficiency of case handling.
XI. State Compensation
( I ) Work Summary
1. In line with the “State Compensation Act’s” purpose to protect the 
rights of the people, the MND and headquarters of each armed service have respectively established a “Committee for the Disposition of State Compensation Claims.” The committee, formed by impartial persons, scholars and experts from the society and senior members of the unit, examines state compensation claims from its subordinate agencies (units) according to the “Precautionary Matters on the MND and Subordinate Agencies Handling State Compensation Claims.”
2. The MND and headquarters of each armed service received a total of 46 
state compensation claims in 2012, in which 16 cases are still ongoing and 30 cases were closed (zero of which were valid and no compensation was 
243
       offered for 14 cases, effectively saving NT$114,833,891 of government 
funds; 16 cases were closed because the petitioner withdrew the claim). All cases were handled in accordance with the law. (see 
Appendix 19 )
( II ) Future Directions
1. Utilize various legal education occasions to actively provide guidance to 
subordinates on regulations and examples of the “State Compensation Act,” and require that they abide by administration according to law to effectively reduce state compensation cases.
2. Bring lawsuits in accordance with the law to civil servants that made 
intentional or serious mistakes, and actively seek compensation.
3. Educate forces (units) at each level of the scope of compensation in 
accordance with the law, so as to prevent state compensation incidents from occurring.
XII. Compensation for Casualties and Damages Caused by 
Military Activities
The “Regulations of Compensation for Casualties and Damages Caused by Military Activities” was established by the ROC Armed Forces to show the government’s sincerity to the public in terms of compensating damages caused by military activities and to comfort people and family members who suffered from casualties and asset losses. The regulations were promulgated and took effect on December 1
st, 1999 and began accepting state compensation claims 
for a period of 2 years. To protect the rights of citizens that did not make state compensation claims in time, the amendment to the regulations on January 7
th, 
2004 extended the deadline to November 30th, 2007.
As of August 31st, 2013, the ROC Armed Forces had received 2,518 applications 
for compensation for casualties and damages caused by military activities, in which 1,823 cases have been considered and compensation totaled NT$1,475,250,000. Statistics of cases are shown in the table below.
244
       XIII. Military Control and Construction Restriction
In coordination with national development, military restricted areas are being 
merged to reduce the area of land that constructions are either limited or restricted, giving consideration to national defense, local development, and citizens’ rights at the same time.Under the premise of not affecting national security and not violating the law, military restricted areas are being reduced in coordination with local development. A total of 283.3 ha of land has been released from five military restricted areas since 2012, and military restricted areas will be further released in coordination with future developments.
XIV. Releasing the MND Information for Public Access
( I ) Online Information Access
The MND digitized existing files and completed the “online file browsing system” in accordance with the “Archives Act,” so that the value of information can be fully utilized. Citizens can rapidly search for information on the website and apply for access to the information. Once their application is approved, they can go online to browse and copy image files. This system significantly shortens application processing time and saves people from the fatigue of long journeys, truly improving citizen services.
( II ) Current Status of Information Release
The MND organized permanent files with historical and political value or can serve as legal evidence, which totaled to 38,561 volumes with roughly 1.20 million files, reclassified the files in accordance with the “The Freedom of Government Information Law,” “Administrative Procedure Act,” “Classified National Security Information Protection Act,” “Personal Information Protection Act” and “Archives Act,” created electronic catalogs for the information, and published catalogs of non-confidential historical and political 
245
       information on the MND’s website, where citizens may apply for access to the 
information.
( III ) Information Access Services
All applications for information access are approved, provided that they do not 
involve personal criminal data, information on personnel and salary, national security, or damage public interests or the rights of any third person, in which case disclosure is limited or restricted in accordance with Article 18 of the Freedom of Government Information Law, Article 18 of the Archives Act, and the “Personal Information Protection Act.” (see 
Appendix 21 )
( IV ) Future Prospects of Information Access
1.Archives worth permanent preservation (core volumes) are selected from 
each armed service headquarters by the “Archives Collection Five-year Implementation Plan,” and categorized under diverse themes for agencies of the ROC Armed Forces. These archives witnessed the history of military modernization, defense developments and administration after the nationalist government relocated in Taiwan. Military research, history and administration departments may also use the information to compile historic books on the ROC Armed Forces.
2. A “Defense Information Access Service Center” will be established in 
the future to improve the overall archival environment, and provide better centralized preservation and maintenance of information, so that future generations can learn from their contents. Subsequent efforts will be directed into establishing a display and browsing mechanism for the MND permanent files, as well as improving digital information management. The service center will provide online access services with full text images, and provide a convenient one-stop window for searching defense and military information and catalogs.
