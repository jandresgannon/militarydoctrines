The National Security Council was launched at the end of last year. Also,  Japan’s fi rst ever National Security Strategy (NSS) and, in accordance with the NSS, new National  Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG) and Medium Term Defense Program (MTDP) were approved.  Moreover, basic orientation for the development of seamless security legislation to ensure Japan’s sur vival and protect its people was approved as a Cabinet decision this July, in order to resolutely secure  the lives and peaceful livelihood of the Japanese people, and contribute even more proactively to the  peace and stability of the international community. On this milestone year of the 60th anniversary, the  Ministry will take the fi rst step to realizing a new form of defense forces.  The 60-year history of the Ministry and the SDF is precisely a chronicle of the path Japan has tak en as a peace-loving nation. Japan will maintain its own security, peace and stability in the region, and  the international community, adhering to the course it has taken to date as a peace-loving nation under  the policy of “Proactive Contribution to Peace” based on the principle of international cooperation.  The activities of the SDF for securing the lives and property of the Japanese people and the sover eignty of Japan’s territorial land, waters, and airspace are becoming ever more critical amid the increas ingly severe security environment surrounding Japan. Since taking offi ce as Minister of Defense, I have  made a point of visiting as many SDF camps and bases as possible from as far north as Hokkaido to as  far south as Okinawa. Furthermore, I visited the Philippines in December 2013 and made the fi rst visit",page,1,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

I offered  words of encouragement to our personnel  engaged in international disaster relief op erations, anti-piracy operations, and peace keeping operations. Our SDF personnel are  carrying out their duties sincerely in an or derly manner and with high morale even in  harsh environment.  The domestic and international environment surrounding the Ministry and the SDF has changed  dramatically over the last 60 years. However, some things still have not changed, one of them being that  the understanding of the people remains essential for national defense. Indeed, it was based on this be lief that in 1970 then-Director General of the Japan Defense Agency Yasuhiro Nakasone published the  inaugural issue of the Defense of Japan. The Defense of Japan has been published annually since 1976,  and this year’s marks the milestone 40th issue. Very few other countries explain their defense policies  through the annual publication of whitepapers. Due to Japan’s publication of the Defense of Japan over  many years, the transparency of Japan’s defense is praised internationally. Not content with the status  quo, we will continue to produce high quality defense whitepapers to further deepen the understanding  about Japan’s defense policy by the Japanese people and other countries.  This year’s edition of Defense of Japan includes a feature article at the beginning, which takes  a look back at the history of the whitepaper as well as of the Ministry and SDF. The “Dynamic Joint  Defense Force” to be developed as set out in the new NDPG is also explained in a clear manner. In  addition, this year’s publication includes new topics, such as the review of Japan’s security legislation.  Furthermore, efforts are made to further familiarize readers with the SDF. I hope that this issue will be  read by as many people as possible.

24508,"**On the Publication of the 40th** **Issue of the Defense of Japan**  Former Director General of the Defense Agency Former Prime Minister of Japan **Yasuhiro Nakasone**   I was the 26th Director General of the Defense Agency from January 1970 to July of the following  year. One of the projects I devoted much effort to during my tenure was the publication of the Defense  of Japan.  Although the possibility of publishing a whitepaper was considered at the Defense Agency  even before I became the Director General, it had not been realized. The Japanese people at that time  were wary about war and associated the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) with the former military. It was  a time when the antipathy towards the SDF was still very much strong. At the Agency, many people  had deep-rooted hesitations about publishing a whitepaper from fears that it would become a target  of questioning from opposition parties at the Diet and invite unnecessary suspicions from the public.  For the Directors General of the Defense Agency who preceded me, the whitepaper was in a sense  almost a taboo subject matter.",page,3,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24509,"What drove me to push for the publication of the whitepaper was my conviction that the under standing, proactive support, and cooperation of the public are, above all, essential for the defense of  Japan. For this reason, I aspired to bring the Defense Agency and the SDF to the “public sphere” and  encourage discussions about defense issues in people’s living rooms. Therefore, I spurred the officials  in charge to publish a whitepaper, and I myself took up a pen and made revisions to the manuscript.  On October 20, 1970, the first issue of Defense of Japan was finally distributed at the Cabinet meeting.  A series of Defense of Japan has been published, and now we are at the 40th issue. In the course  of the many years, the public perception of the SDF has also changed considerably. While it may be  hard to believe now, when the inaugural issue was published, people still had minimal understanding  and awareness about defense, to the point that SDF personnel were turned away from taking university  entrance exams and enrolling into universities. However, the people today see for themselves that the  SDF are at the front line of national security and working hard for national defense and disaster relief  work. Today, the SDF is an organization that has earned the deep trust of the people. Nothing can make  me happier than this as one of the members that started the Defense of Japan to promote understanding  of the SDF.  The 20th century was a century of war. The 21st century must not repeat this tragedy. At present,  the global situation is at a major turning point, and the security situation is in a state of chaos. Under  such circumstances, the need to discuss defense issues in the “public sphere” through the Defense of Ja pan is perhaps even greater now than when the whitepaper was launched. What defense policies should  Japan adopt to protect peace and prosperity in Japan and throughout the world? I hope that many people  will read the Defense of Japan, also in the sense of aspiring to secure and safeguard the people’s liveli hood and pursue the further development and prosperity of Japan and the rest of the world.",page,4,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

Even today, the Republic of Korea (ROK) and North Korea pit their ground forces of about 1.6 million against each other across the demilitarized zone (DMZ).  **Development of Weapons of Mass Destruction and Missiles**   N North Korea is deemed to be developing nuclear weapons as an indispensable deterrent for maintaining the existing regime.  N It is believed that North Korea is working to develop a nuclear weapon to mount on a ballistic missile as part of its nuclear weapons program. In general, miniaturizing a nuclear weapon small enough to be mounted on a ballistic missile requires a considerably high degree of technological capacity. However, considering the fact that the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France and China succeeded in acquiring such technology by as early as the 1960s and that North Korea conducted a nuclear test in February 2013, it is diffi cult to eliminate the possibility that North Korea has achieved the miniaturization of nuclear weapons and acquired nuclear warheads.  N North Korea’s nuclear weapons development, considered in conjunction with the enhancement of its ballistic missile capabilities, poses a grave threat to Japan’s security and signifi cantly impairs peace and stability in Northeast Asia and the international community. Therefore, they can never be tolerated.  N North Korea appears to give high priority to the development of ballistic missiles out of political and diplomatic considerations and from the viewpoint of earning foreign currency, in addition to enhancing its military capabilities.  N The details of the new missile KN08 which was showcased at the military parade in April 2012 and July 2013 are unknown. However, the missile is believed to be an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).

Therefore, Japan needs to pay utmost attention to such activities.  launched multiple ballistic missiles towards the Sea of Japan and conducted military provocations.  N The development of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and missiles by North Korea constitutes, coupled with provocative words and actions, including missile attacks against Japan, a serious and imminent threat to the security of Japan.

As a result of such reshuffl es, all of the three key military posts have come to be held by individuals selected by First Chairman Kim Jong-un.

24514,"**Japan**   ##### China  |Chapter|1| |---|---|   **Chapter** **1** **p. 32**   N China is strongly expected to recognize its responsibility in the international community, accept and comply with international norms, and play an active role in a more cooperative manner on regional and global issues.  N During the third plenary session of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in November 2013, the session adopted “The Decision on Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening Reforms” regarding reforms in a wide range of areas. Through the Decision, the Central Committee decided to establish a central leading team for comprehensively deepening reform, which is deemed responsible for the overall design of the reform. The team held its fi rst meeting in January 2014. How these reforms will take shape, including how China will deal with corruption problems within the party, will be a point to watch out for going forward.  N It is believed that China is enhancing its asymmetric military capabilities to deter military forces of other countries from approaching and advancing to China’s surrounding region, and to inhibit their military activities in the region (so-called “AntiAccess/Area Denial” [“A2/AD”] capabilities).  N China has been strengthening its military forces broadly and rapidly. Furthermore, China has been rapidly expanding and intensifying its activities in the seas and airspace, including the   East China Sea and South China Sea. China has adopted so-called assertive measures, including attempts to alter the status quo by coercive measures, especially for issues involving confl icting maritime interests. Japan has great concerns over such Chinese military activities, etc., together with the lack of transparency in its military affairs and security issues, and needs to pay utmost attention to them. These activities also raise security concerns for the region and the international community.  N China has not disclosed specifi c information on possession of weapons, procurement goals and past procurements, organization and locations of major units, records of main military operations and exercises, and a detailed breakdown of the national defense budget. It is hoped that China will increase transparency concerning its military affairs by such efforts as disclosing specifi c information pertaining to its defense policies and military capabilities.  N The Chinese national defense budget continues to increase at a rapid pace.

The United States, the Republic of Korea, Australia, and the European Union have expressed concern about China’s establishment of such zone.  N One of the objectives of China’s maritime activities is thought to be to weaken the control of other countries over the islands to which China claims territorial sovereignty, while strengthening the claim of its territorial sovereignty, through various surveillance activities and use of force in the seas and airspace surrounding the islands.   N Even after China put into commission the aircraft carrier “Liaoning” in September 2012, China seems to be continuing training of carrier-based aircraft pilots and research and development of necessary technologies including the development of a domestic carrier based fi ghter, J-15, such as its takeoff and landing tests on the “Liaoning.” In November 2013, the carrier sailed in the South China Sea for the fi rst time and conducted sea trials in this sea area. Some analysts point out that China may also be constructing its fi rst domestic aircraft carrier.  N China is developing the J-20 and J-31, which are pointed out to become next-generation fi ghters.  N The Chinese government announced that it established “the East China Sea Air Defense Identifi cation Zone (ADIZ)” including the Senkaku Islands which China described as if they were a part of China’s “territory,” that it obligated aircraft fl ying in the said zone to abide by the rules set forth by the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, and that the Chinese Armed Forces would take “defensive emergency measures” in the case where such aircraft does not follow the instructed procedures. Japan is deeply concerned about such measures, which are profoundly dangerous acts that unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea, escalating the situation, and that may cause unintended consequences in the East China Sea. Furthermore, the measures unduly infringe the freedom of overfl ight over the high seas, which is the general principle of international law.",page,10,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

N In March 2014, after Russia took effective control of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, a referendum was held, asking Crimean citizens if they wanted Crimea to be annexed by Russia. Following the referendum, Russia “annexed” Crimea. The United States, European countries, and Japan condemned the referendum as it violates the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and is in violation of international laws, and have refused to recognize the “annexation” of Crimea. Said countries have expressed the view that Russia’s changing of the status quo by force or coercion is a global issue that also impacts Asia and elsewhere.

The frequency of such situations and the duration of responses are both increasing.  N Japan needs to enhance its deterrence and response capability by conducting tailored activities swiftly and sustainably based on joint operations, as well as by developing defense capabilities adequate both in quality and quantity that underpin various activities to realize a more robust defense force.  N From a comprehensive perspective, the defense force should prioritize particularly important functions and capabilities through optimal resource allocation as a whole. The defense force also must be an effective one which enables conducting a diverse range of activities to be seamless as well as dynamic and adapting to situations as they demand.  N Japan will build a Dynamic Joint Defense Force, which emphasizes both soft and hard aspects of readiness, sustainability, resiliency and connectivity, reinforced by advanced technology and capability for C3I, with a consideration to establish a wide range of infrastructure to support the SDF’s operation.  **Japan’s Basic Defense Policy**   N Along the policy of “Proactive Contribution to Peace” based on the principle of international cooperation, the following three approaches will be promoted: (1) Japan’s own efforts; (2) Strengthening of the Japan-U.S. Alliance; and (3) Active promotion of security cooperation.  **The Role of the Defense Force**   N Effective deterrence of and response to various situations N Stabilization of the Asia-Pacifi c region and improvement of global security environments  N In order to effectively fulfi ll these roles, the defense force will be built up by prioritizing those functions and capabilities that should be prioritized from the perspective of joint operations. The SDF will prioritize the development of capacities to ensure maritime supremacy and air superiority. Furthermore, the SDF will emphasize the establishment of rapid deployment capabilities.   N Approximately half of the SDF’s divisions and brigades will be reorganized into rapid deployment divisions and rapid deployment brigades comprised of units, including rapidly rapid deployment regiments, furnished with advanced mobility and ISR capabilities to increase their rapid deployment capabilities.  N The GSDF will maintain rapidly deployable units sustaining specialized functions to effectively perform amphibious operations.   **Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF)**   N The number of destroyers will be increased. New destroyers (with additional multifunctional capability and compact-type hull) will be introduced. Two Aegis-equipped destroyers will be added, giving the fl eet eight destroyers.  N The MSDF will continue to increase the number of submarine units.  N The MSDF will maintain fi xed-wing patrol aircraft (P-1/P-3C) units by continuing to acquire the P-1 aircraft.   New destroyer (image)   **Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF)**   N By consolidating warning and control operations at air defense command centers, the ASDF will gradually change warning groups into warning squadrons. The ASDF will establish one new squadron in the air warning unit.  N The 13th squadron will be newly established, and one squadron of the Air Reconnaissance Unit will be abolished. Two squadrons will be added to the fi ghter aircraft units at Naha Air Base.  N One squadron will be added to the aerial refueling and transport units, increasing their number of F-35A fi ghter squadrons to two.  **Basic Foundation for the SDF**   N A broad range of areas that constitute the basic foundation for the SDF will be strengthened, including training and exercises, operational infrastructure, personnel and education, medical, defense production and technological bases, effi cient acquisition of equipment, research and development, collaboration with local communities, boosting communication capabilities,  Capping ceremony of nurses enhancing the intellectual base, and   International emergency relief activities in the Philippines",page,14,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

N The market for defense equipment is limited to the small amount of demand from the MOD, so manufacturing economies of scale cannot be expected. Furthermore, specialized, advanced technologies and skills are required in the development and manufacture of defense equipment, and it takes a great deal of effort to cultivate and maintain those technologies and skills.

Moreover, although factors such as the increasing performance of equipment have resulted in an increasing trend in research and development costs, in recent years, the ratio of defense-related expenditure accounted for by research and development has leveled off.  **Initiatives for Increasing the Effi ciency** **of Procurement and Improving its** **Fairness and Transparency** **Chapter** **1** **p.325**  N A PM/IPT system is under development in which a cross-organizational Integrated Project Team (IPT) headed by a Project Manager (PM) is established for major projects, so that the project can be managed, in terms of cost, performance and schedule, in a unifi ed way throughout the lifecycle of the equipment product.  **Three Principles on Transfer of Defense**  **Chapter** **1** **p.329**  **Equipment and Technology**  N In the “National Security Strategy” set out on December 17, 2013, from the perspective of Proactive Contribution to Peace based on the principle of international cooperation, a more proactive involvement in peace contribution and international cooperation is required through the use of defense equipment and other means, as well as participation in joint development and production of defense and other equipment.  N The Cabinet gave approval on April 1, 2014 for the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology. An appropriate degree of consideration was given to the basic philosophy of Japan as a peace-loving nation that conforms to the Charter of the United Nations and the course it has taken as a peace-loving nation, as well as the role already played by the Three Principles of Arms Export. Then, in learning from the mounting number of exceptional cases, it provides a comprehensive organization of these matters, clarifi es the concrete standards, procedures and brakes relating to the transfer of defense equipment to a greater extent than ever before and is stated clearly and with transparency both internally and externally",page,25,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

In addition, to avoid a rise in the unit price for mass production of equipment, the Technical Research and Development Institute and Equipment Procurement and Construction Offi ce will coordinate on cost estimates from the development stage as a part of the lifecycle management.  N International joint development of defense equipment is the primary means within the international community for responding to soaring costs, yet achieving higher performance. Similarly, the MOD is engaged in joint research and development with the U.S. Department of Defense, as well as collaborating with other nations, such as the United Kingdom, in the fi elds of equipment and technology. Moreover, as the move towards dual use between defense and lifestyle technology, as well as borderless systems, gains momentum, technological information exchange and  Institute and research institutions such as independent administrative  Mobile combat vehicle currently in development  agencies and universities, is being proactively implemented within Japan, in order to ensure that superior lifestyle technology is incorporated and effi cient research and development is conducted.  **Initiatives Aimed at Maintaining and Strengthening** **Defense Production and Technological Bases**  **Strategy for Defense Production and Technological Bases** **Chapter** **1** **p.336**  |Chapter|1| |---|---|   **Chapter** **1** **p.336**  **Strategy for Defense Production and Technological Bases**   N In view of the present situation of rising competition from overseas companies caused primarily by the recent severe fi nancial circumstances   and reorganization of the global defense industry, the MOD decided on the “Strategy for Defense Production and Technological Bases” on June 19, 2014 to replace the former domestic production policy, in order to maintain and strengthen defense production and technological bases, which are important and vital elements that support our defense capabilities.  N The Strategy not only identifi es the targets for and signifi cance of maintaining and strengthening defense production and technological bases, but also presents basic concepts regarding methods of defense equipment acquisition, such as domestic development, international joint development and production, and import; measures for maintaining and strengthening defense production and technological bases, such as improvement of contrast systems, measures relating to research and development, and defense equipment and technological cooperation; and the current situation and future direction of defense equipment sectors.  **Adapting Defense Equipment for Civilian Use**  N Japan is holding talks with India, which has been considering the acquisition of amphibian search and rescue aircraft, at the Joint Working",page,26,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

The various activities of the MOD and SDF are not possible without the understanding and cooperation of all people, as well as local governments and other parties. For this reason, mutual trust between local communities, the people, and the SDF need to be deepened even further.  **Recruitment and Employment of Personnel in the MOD and the SDF**  **Recruitment and Employment of Personnel in the MOD and the SDF**  N In Japan, due to the declining birthrate and increasing university enrollments, the recruitable population for SDF personnel has been decreasing in size. Under such circumstances, personnel with superior abilities and a strong desire to enlist are recruited nationwide according to various categories.  N Furthermore, systems such as the SDF Reserve Personnel System are established. In such systems, people remain engaged in their own jobs as civilians in peacetime, and become SDF personnel and carry out their missions when muster orders for defense are issued.

The use of weapons in the course of the following activities should be interpreted as not being restricted constitutionally. 1. To come to the aid of geographically distant unit or personnel that are engaged in the same U.N. PKO etc., and to use weapons, if necessary, to defend them, in the event that such a unit or personnel are attacked (“kaketsuke-keigo) 2. To remove obstructive attempts against its missions|❍ Even in the case of an infringement which cannot be judged whether it constitutes “an armed attack (an organized and planned use of force),” action to the minimum extent necessary by the SDF to repel such an infringement should be permitted under the Constitution.| |Legislative Policies etc.|❍ The Diet: Legal source is needed. The approval, either prior or ex post facto, of the Diet should be required. ❍ The Government: Discussion and approval by the National Security Council under the leadership of the Prime Minister and a Cabinet Decision should be required. (After a comprehensive assessment, a policy decision not to exercise the right of collective self- defense could be made.) ❍ In the case that Japan would pass through the territory of a third country, the consent of that third country should be obtained.|❍ The Diet: Legal source is needed. The approval, either prior or ex post facto, of the Diet should be required. ❍ The Government: Proactive contribution should be made. Decisions should be made carefully, based on comprehensive examination on the political significance etc.|❍ Requirements in the Rules of Engagements etc. should be amended in line with U.N. standards. ❍ The so-called Five Principles on Japan’s Participation in U.N. PKOs also need to be examined in view of its revision.|❍ It is necessary to enhance the legal system within a scope permitted under international law to enable a seamless response.| ||❍ Logistics support: The theory of so-called “ittaika” with the use of force should be discontinued. Instead it should be dealt with as a matter of policy appropriateness. Decisions on under what circumstances logistics support is to be provided should be carefully considered by the Cabinet.|||| ||The Panel strongly expects that the Government will consider this report earnestly and proceed to take necessary legislative measures.||||   ❍ When an armed attack against Japan has occurred, or when an armed attack against a foreign country that is in a close relationship with Japan occurs and as a result threatens Japan’s survival and poses a clear danger to fundamentally overturn people’s right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. ❍ When there is no appropriate means available to repel the attack and ensure Japan’s survival and protect its people. ❍ Use of force to the minimum extent necessary.",page,49,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

Training relocation costs under the Special Measures Agreement extend either into the cost sharing for the stationing of USFJ or the SACO-related costs and the realignment-related costs. 2. The SACO-related costs refer to the cost for implementing the contents of the SACO Final Report to reduce the impact on people in Okinawa, while the realignment-related costs refers to the cost relating to a step to contribute to reducing the impact on local communities as part of the realignment initiatives. Since the cost-sharing for the stationing of USFJ is Japan’s voluntary effort to bear some costs in light of the importance of ensuring the smooth and effective implementation of the Japan–U.S. Security Arrangements, its nature is different from the SACO-related costs and the realignment-related costs, and is categorized separately. 3. The costs related to the stationing of USFJ include the MOD-related budget, other ministry-related budgets (base subsidy, etc.: ¥38.4 billion, FY2013 Budget) and the estimated costs of government-owned land provided for use as USFJ facilities (¥166.0 billion, FY2013 Estimated Costs). 4.

The periods may become delayed due to such factors as the progress of the preparation for relocation in Okinawa by the Government of Japan and the U.S. Government’s efforts for relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps to outside Japan. Furthermore, the times and fiscal years in parentheses do not include the time necessary for relocation of the Marine Corps from Japan because, though the conditions for returning the areas include its relocation to outside of Japan, the plan for the relocation is yet to be decided. Consequently, the times of return of these areas may be changed depending on the progress of the relocation of the Marine Corps from Japan.  2.

Going forward, efforts will continue to be made to conduct research and development aimed at improving their capabilities, as well as to maintain and strengthen the existing bases| |Aircraft|❍ For the acquisition of F-35A aircraft, the participation of Japanese companies in construction will be strategically promoted, from the perspective of maintaining and optimizing the production and technological bases. In the future, efforts will be made to coordinate with other relevant countries, with a view to the establishment of regional maintenance and upgrading facilities in the Asia Pacifci region. In order to accumulate and improve the technology relating to fgihters in Japan, so that development of future aircraft can be considered as an option prior to the retirement of the F-2 (including the possibility of international joint development), strategic considerations will be pursued, including verifci ation research, and the necessary measures taken accordingly. ❍ Multifaceted use of the results of development (such as the possibility of adaptation for civilian use, and cooperation in defense equipment and technology) will be promoted. Keeping both the civilian and defense demand for rotary wing aircraft in mind, international joint development and production will be considered as an option, based on the technology cultivated through domestic research and the introduction of technology from abroad via licensed domestic production| |Explosives|❍ Balanced with efficient acquisition, the continuation of a certain scale of procurement from domestic companies will be made possible. When various contingencies arise, multiple procurement methods will be combined with this, and the bases maintained to ensure the necessary scale of explosives. Measures will also be considered to raise future predictability for both the Government and the public.| |Guided weapons|❍ In order to increase air defense performance, the replacement of the GSDF’s SAM and ASDF’s Patriot capabilities will be kept in mind, and technological considerations regarding future SAMs will be pursued to further strengthen the relevant technological foundations. A vision for research and development will be established, so that technological considerations regarding future guided weapons can be implemented, including steps to promote the fixed rocket motors and other technologies required to improve performance, such as increasing the launch range, thereby ensuring that they can be used effectively in response to new threats ❍ Increasingly, there are examples in this field of international joint development and production on a global scale. Depending on the circumstances, one of the options for participation in international joint development is to select an efficient acquisition method based on the view of increasing interoperability with allies and friendly nations. Joint development between Japan and the United States into the SM-3 Block IIA will be continued, and considering the maintenance and strengthening of the production and technological bases, consideration will be given to moving the project onto the production and deployment stages, after which the necessary steps will be taken.| |Communications electronics and command control systems|❍ Research and development into cutting-edge technology for the bases required for defense will be implemented with priority, involving the improvement of detection capacity by increasing the detection performance of fixed warning and control radar systems and the simultaneous, parallel use of multiple sonar systems, while at the same time, the technological foundations will be maintained and strengthened by pursuing the applicability of cutting-edge livelihood technology. ❍ Because the integration of systems to ensure smooth unified operation, strengthening of functions to support decision-making by commanders, and systems capable of responding to battles based around network data are necessary for future command control systems, livelihood technology foundations will be adopted which have shown remarkable expansion, such as data processing technology and integrated system construction technology, which will make it possible to exchange systems as and when required to reflect the latest technological level. ❍ The technology involved in bases required for defense, such as radar technology that uses high-output semiconductors and software wireless technology, comprises a field where Japan is particularly strong, and it is here that cooperation in defense production and technology will be advanced along with adaptation to civilian use, with the goal of strengthening the defense production and technological bases.| |Unmanned equipment|❍ At the present time, the Self-Defense Forces have few pieces of equipment in this area, but it is a field undergoing much research worldwide. Hence, due to the trend toward defense technology based around future battle conditions, smart technology and networking, the perspective of integrated operation will be taken into account. Then, in order to present a direction aimed at unmanned equipment like next-generation unmanned aircraft, a vision for research and development will be established, proactive research will be implemented and the technological foundations ❍ There are also a large number of research organizations in the private sector with advanced technology. Cooperation with research institutions will be encouraged with respect to robots that can be used for defense purposes and elemental technology associated with unmanned systems, and the standard of unmanned equipment raised ❍ Advanced research and technology and defense equipment are already being used in this sector, in other countries, so Japan will pursue defense equipment and technological cooperation in the form of joint research and development with these countries, and work to raise the level of its own technological foundations|   ❍ We aim to Together with policies relating to the use of space development and efforts to increase the capability of the Ministry of Defense to respond to  Cyber and space  cyber attacks. Meanwhile, from the perspective of the defense of Japan, the future outlook of our defense and technological bases, as they pertain to  systems  future necessity, will be considered",page,121,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

(A procedure for defense capabilities build-up will be established with an emphasis on assessment of defense capabilities based on joint operation (which to date has been regarded as inadequate); The foregoing will facilitate the elimination of defense capabilities build-up based on individual optimization along the vertical administrative structure of the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF, so that instead, defense capabilities improvement that is optimized across the board can be implemented). • Cross-functional Integrated Project Teams (IPTs), headed by Project Managers (PMs) will be expanded, and project management throughout the life cycle of equipment, etc., will be strengthened. (*)|• In order to implement life-cycle-spanning project management in a manner both methodical and appropriate, and to contribute to the total optimization of defense capabilities build-up, and the maintenance and strengthening of defense production and technological bases, the Internal Bureau, the various Staff Offices, the Technical Research & Development Institute and the departments involved in equipment acquisition in the Equipment Procurement Office will be integrated according to future considerations, and an organization reform implemented with the idea of extra-ministerial establishment kept in mind. In order for procurement to be carried out with even greater fairness ensured, the monitoring function will also be strengthened.|| |Strengthening integrated operational functions|• From the perspective of strengthening the joint operational functions, SDF personnel and civil officers will be mutually assigned to the Internal Bureau and Joint Staff respectively.|• In order to resolve the fact of an overlapping of duties between the Internal Bureau and Joint Staff in work associated with actual operations (which is attributable to external explanations, including dealing with the Diet), and to increase speed and efficiency, the work in question will be integrated into the Joint Staff office. Meanwhile, functions such as the planning and drafting of legislation are administrative and systematic in nature, and will therefore continue to fall under the jurisdiction of the Internal Bureau. A review will be made of the organization of the Bureau of Operational Policy, based on the above and from the perspective of strengthening measures to respond to cyber attacks, and so forth. • An efficient coordinating organization will be constructed under the Defense Council to respond to circumstances arising due to the executives involved.|| |Strengthening policymaking and public relations capability|• In order to strengthen discussion and dialogue with concerned countries, a new vice-Minister of Defense for International Affairs will be established to provide overall management of international relationship-related and other business. • In order to achieve a precise connection with the National Security Council, the strategy-planning function of the Bureau of Defense Policy will be strengthened according to the current situation regarding the activity of the council. (*) • A mechanism (Report Center (provisional title)) will be established, for the unified coordination of information gathering and public relations when conducting crisis management.|• In order that public relations are implemented strategically and effectively, the reporting system will undergo a review, so that the spokespersons of the Minister’s Secretariat and Joint Staff can function as central to the public relations process.|| |Additional efforts to the above|• It will be ensured that the overall management of information that should not be disclosed externally is conducted thoroughly (this will include a review of the essentials of management duties). Methods and systems for investigating leaks will also be established. (*) • The adjunct systems for government affairs, as centered on the Minister’s Secretariat, will be strengthened so that administration can be reported to quickly and appropriately at all times.|||",page,128,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

There are eight countries in the Arctic Region: Russia, the United States, Canada, Denmark and Norway that border the Arctic Ocean, and Finland, Sweden and Iceland that do not border it. In 1996, the Arctic Council was established, which aims to promote cooperation, coordination, and interaction among the Arctic states, with the involvement of the indigenous communities and other inhabitants on common Arctic issues (e.g., sustainable development and environmental protection). In recent years, the utility of the Northern Sea Route is increasing due to the abdomen natural resources, needs to short- en sea routes between Europe and Asia in accordance with the decrease of seawater, and to avoid the sea areas that are at risk of international confl icts and piracy. For these reasons, the Arctic states have been more proactively promoting efforts to acquire their interest in resource development and use of the sea route. On the other hand, each Arctic state has its own claims in terms of the demarcation of maritime boundaries based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and extension of continental shelf. It is considered that some of these coastal states including Russia are promoting efforts to provide new military capabilities for the purpose of securing their interest and defending their territories. Traditionally, the Arctic Region has been used for deployment of strategic nuclear forces and as a transit route for them. In addition, due to the decrease of sea ice, surface ships can now navigate for longer period of time and in wider areas than before, and it is considered that the region could be used for deploying maritime forces or maneuvering military forces by using maritime transport capabilities of armed forces in future. For these reasons, the strategic importance of the region is increasing. Russia shows its clear intention to place strategic importance on the Arctic Region in its various policy papers. At the same time, it has been showing the most active movement compared to other Arctic states, based on the following factors: Russia has the largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ) among the Arctic states, the abundance of potential resources in the EEZ, the utility of the Northern Sea Route along the coastlines of Russia and its infl uence to Russian mainland, and its military superiority among other Arctic states, with deployment of dominant military capabilities including the Northern Fleet.

24636,"|CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC oooooooooooooooooooooooo|Col2| |---|---| |||   **Trend of Expanding Development of** **Unmanned Vehicles**  In recent years, the demand for unmanned vehicles is rapidly increasing not only in the field of military use but also in disaster relief, industry and agriculture field. Factors behind this include the fact that unmanned vehicles can conduct missions that are not suitable for human beings called 3D (Dangerous, Dirty, Dull), such as dangerous missions conducted in the airspace of the area occupied by the enemy, missions in the area contaminated by chemical substances and radiation, and dull missions such as long hours monitoring and surveillance. In addition, they are more cost-effective than manned vehicles for the following reasons: space and equipment for crew such as cockpit is not required; there is no need to secure the safety of the pilot; and it is possible to reduce the size. One of the unmanned vehicles for military use is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which was initially used for aerial targets in training and reconnaissance purposes, and has been developed to a multi-purpose vehicle to conduct various missions and a vehicle for attack. Recently developed UAV include stealth type, carrier-based type, and ones equipped with supersonic fl ight capability. Other unmanned vehicles include Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), Unmanned Maritime Vehicle (UMV), Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV), and Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUV), whose usage has been expanding in land and maritime missions. These vehicles are developed and used for the same purpose as UAV. They are also developed and used in accordance with geographical features and usage, such as clearing land and naval mines, and responding to nuclear disaster[1]. Although previous types of unmanned vehicles were developed based on the platform for manned vehicles such as aircraft and cars, it is reported that in recent years more neo-futuristic platforms have been developed, including ones representing insects, walking with two legs like human beings, or walking with four legs like animals. With the progress of various technology including information and communication technology (ICT), it is expected that types of vehicles could shift from man-controlled type to fully autonomous type in future2. Such vehicle is called Lethal Autonomous Weapons System  (LAWS)3, which performs various tasks automatically ranging from target determination to attack. Analysts note that the  advancement of artifi cial intelligence may lead to the deployment of LAWS in actual combat in the near future. Amid the increasing demand for unmanned vehicles, the United Nations and the countries that use UAV have raised operational issues, such as violation of sovereignty caused by UAV flying over other countries, collateral damage caused by the attack by UAV, and mental fatigue of UAV pilots, and various measures have been discussed regarding these issues. On the other hand, due to their characteristics, the utility of unmanned vehicles are widely recognized in many countries and it is expected that development and introduction of unmanned vehicles will be further promoted, instead of manned vehicles.  1 During the aftermath of the nuclear disaster occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station on March 11, 2011, the U.S. Forces dispatched the unmanned reconnaissance aircraft Global Hawk to conduct intelligence operation.  2 The current unmanned vehicles are also able to perform a certain level of autonomous activities such as travelling.  3 In May 2014, systems for controlling robotic weapons were discussed for the fi rst time at an informal meeting of the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW).

The MOD sent me to the Cabinet Secretariat in May  2013 to draft the National Security Council Establishment Law, and I continue to work at the secretariat now.  The National Security Secretariat runs the National Security Council as part of its planning and coordination efforts to en-  sure that individual policies handled by ministries and agencies are suff ciently coordinated and to ensure that national security  policy is consistent. My primary role is to ascertain the current state of issues requiring attention while considering points of  contention in the National Security Council and the policies that should be put in place.  Making good policy requires sharing information among everyone involved and having earnest policy debates. The Min-  istry of Defense has extensive knowledge about defense and military matters, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is well  versed in areas such as regional affairs, international law, the economy, public relations, and culture. In fact, various ministries  and agencies provide the National Security Secretariat with a wealth of information, both in terms of quality and quantity. My  own work entails experiencing something new every day, whether its attending visits by Secretary General of the National  Security Secretariat, Mr. Yachi, to the U.S. and Europe or witnessing f rsthand the struggles made overseas by Japanese diplo-  mats. The knowledge I have acquired through working in the Ministry of Defense serves as a foundation for new information  and experiences that are creating new ideas.  At a time when international affairs are becoming increasingly strained and opaque, it is critical that our government comes  together and makes use of the depth and breadth of the wisdom of its ministries and agencies to fully protect the foundation that  support Japanese citizens’ well-being.

However, due to recent increasing and prolonged gray zone security situation trends – (the situation that is neither exactly peacetime nor confl ict), and the concern that such situations could escalate into a more serious situation, the security environment surrounding Japan is becoming more severe. For these reasons, the concept of the NDPG 2010 may no longer be adequate to maintain or build the required deterrence capabilities to respond to such situations. Based on this background, the new NDPG the new NDPG propose to prevent escalation of situations, demonstrating Japan’s resolution to protect the country and its high capabilities, through strategic implementation of training and exercise to adapt to changes in situations, and responsively reinforce defense posture through preposition of units to respond to security environment and rapid deployment. This shows a new concept of deterrence to replace with the concept of deterrence proposed in the NDPG 2010, mainly focusing the ISR activities, to deal with circumstances with higher intensity, responding to the increasingly severe security environment. The Statement by the Minister of Defense, which was released when NDPG 2010 was formulated, stated that, “not only ensuring the “quality” and “quantity” of equipment but the amount of the SDF activities will be the focus.” However, as the “Dynamic Defense Force” does not include the logic of defense force build up to develop both the “quality” and “quantity”, the focus was placed solely on an increase in the “amount of activities” of defense force. Therefore, it had to be said that ensuring the “quality” and “quantity” of defense force that supports the activities of the SDF, which increasingly require higher effectiveness than before, had not necessarily been suffi cient. In the light of such a situation, the concept of “Dynamic Joint Defense Force” presented by the new NDPG, for the fi rst time, implemented the capability assessment based on a joint operation regarding various anticipated circumstances, from the viewpoints that ensuring not only the amount of activities but also a suffi cient level of “quality” and “quantity” of defense force will be required in order to build an effective deterrence particularly in the present security environment. Based on this, the following points were determined: functions and capabilities that require particular emphasis will be drawn from a comprehensive perspective; assured ensuring of maritime supremacy and air superiority; ensuring “quality” and “quantity” of defense force by focusing on developing the mobile deployment capability; strengthening a wide range of logistical support foundations in order to perform a variety of activities in an effective manner.",page,133,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

H Also, strengthen the posture of the remote islands in the southwestern region defense by establishing area security units in the remote islands where no SDF units are deployed, in order to enable an immediate response in the case of various contingencies, including disasters.  [Rapid Deployment] H In order to be able to respond swiftly to and deal effectively and nimbly with various situations, the GSDF will transform two divisions and two brigades respectively into two rapid deployment divisions and two rapid deployment brigades that are furnished with advanced mobility and ISR capabilities. In doing so, the rapid deployment divisions and brigades shall introduce mobile combat vehicles (MCVs) suitable for transportation by aircraft and other means, as well as organize rapid deployment regiments that immediately respond to various situations.  [Recapturing] H In a bid to conduct suffi cient amphibious operations, which land, recapture and secure without delay any remote islands that might be invaded, an amphibious rapid deployment brigade (tentative name) of several regiment-scale units specializing in amphibious operations will be established. In order for the GSDF to implement a more effective, new defense posture in the southwestern region, it is essential to improve rapid deployment capability of the GSDF units and to be able to carry out swift and fl exible nation-wide operations. To achieve this, new equipment such as tilt-rotor aircraft, amphibious vehicles and MCVs will be installed, as well as organizing a new integrated headquarters (Ground Central Command (tentative name)) that controls the regional armies of the GSDF, as well as promote effi ciency and rationalizing command and control function of each regional army headquarters. At the same time, a “mobile ground defense force that responds rapidly” will be established to realize a Dynamic Joint Defense Force.  **Increasing the Number of Destroyers and Submarines**  The new National Defense Program Guidelines specify to ensure sea superiority in order to effectively conduct various operations, such as around-the-clock surveillance and anti-submarine warfare, and to secure the defense of the surrounding waters and the safety of maritime traffi c. For this reason, in terms of the MSDF squadron, the guidelines specify to increase the number of destroyers to 54, and the number of submarines from 16 to 22, following on from the 2010 Guidelines. In accordance with this increase, the total number of escort divisions and submarine divisions will be increased by one unit, respectively, from the current number of divisions, resulting in 14 destroyer units and 6 submarine divisions. In addition, in light of the increase in the number of destroyers, for the purpose of securing the necessary capabilities, “new destroyers” will be introduced while taking account of the cost situation. The new destroyers will be equipped with detachable facilities, as well as capabilities for anti-mine operations which were traditionally conducted by minesweeping vessels, in order to respond to various operations. Furthermore, the body of the destroyer will be made more compact compared to the existing general purpose destroyers, by carefully selecting equipment and functions. For example, they will be equipped with a towed array sonar system (TASS) instead of a sonar system on the body. The detail will be reviewed with the Ministry of Defense, aiming to start procurement in the second half of the period of the new Mid-Term Defense Program.",page,134,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

In addition, in order to keep up with the modernization of military air power of the surrounding countries and to ensure the ability to take adequate response in future, it is planned to modernize the current F-15 fi ghters and improve the capability of F-2 fi ghters, as well as continuingly introduce of F-35A fi ghters, which procurement started in FY2012. Furthermore, in light of the operational posture of the fi ghter units and the geographical characteristics of the southwestern region, it is planned to introduce new aerial refueling/transport aircraft required for the fi ghter units to conduct various operations in the airspace surrounding Japan. Moreover, the capability of surface-to air PATRIOT guided missile system will be further improved, and new interceptor missile with advanced capabilities (PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement [MSE]) will be introduced, which is capable of responding to cruise missile and aircrafts, as well as conducting ballistic missile defense (BMD). In addition to such efforts, considering the situation that military activities are becoming more active in other countries in the sea areas and airspace surrounding Japan, including the southwestern region, it is planned to develop an infrastructure to deploy a mobile air control and warning radar in the offshore islands in the southwestern region, and to improve the current E-767 airborne warning and control system (AWACS), in order to ensure a watertight surveillance posture in peacetime. Since the territory of Japan includes many offshore islands, the role of airborne early-warning groups that complement the fi xed warning and control radars is important for the surveillance of the airspace surrounding Japan. Considering this situation, a new squadron consisting of E-2C early warning aircrafts, the 603rd Squadron, was established at Naha Air Base in April 2014, for the purpose of further enhancing the surveillance posture in the southwestern region.

Therefore, in FY2014, to more effectively improve the SDF’s advanced tactical skills in order to prevent the relative decrease of Japan’s air defense capabilities and to ensure the maintenance of air superiority, the ASDF has announced it would reorganize the groups that provide trainings and exercises and that are under the direct control of the Air Defense Command, including the Tactical Fighter Training Group (Nyutabaru Air Base), the Air Defense Missile Training Group (Hamamatsu Air Base, Chitose Air Base) and the Base Defense Development & Training Squadron (Hyakuri Air Base), as well as groups related to electronic warfare, into the Air Tactics Development & Training Wing. Previously, investigation and research related to combat skills, tactics and trainings for the forces were provided by the training units that are organized by function in the ASDF. The formation of the Air Tactics Development & Training Wing will enable not only to operate units by function as before, but also to conduct systematic and continuous investigation and research of combat skills and tactics in which multiple functions are linked.

In light of this perspective, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have superior capabilities, as they can confi ne the danger and burden to the crew and conduct persistent ISR activities in a wide area. UAVs are essential for the Ministry of Defense and SDF to respond to various situations in the current security environment, since they can gather information in relatively remote areas from Japan’s territorial waters and airspace, which is diffi cult to do with the SDF’s current equipment, as well as conducting persistent ISR activities in the airspace when the situation turns into an emergency.

24643,"|CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC oooooooooooooooooooooooo|Col2| |---|---| |||   **Reemployment of SDF Pilots**  The reemployment system for SDF pilots is intended to prevent the outfl ow of young pilots to civil aviation companies in an unregulated manner, and for the employment of SDF pilots over a certain age by civil aviation companies. The SDF started this system in 1962 in order to ensure the appropriate age composition of SDF pilots and maintain the strength of the ASDF. So far, approximately 750 pilots of fighters and transport aircraft have worked at civil aviation companies and elsewhere. According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT), due to the expanding demand for air transportation in the Asia-Pacifi c Region, approximately 4.5 times more numbers of pilots will be necessary by 2030, and it is expected that there will be a shortage of 9,000 pilots per year. As there is a high demand for the trained SDF pilots among civil aviation companies, especially new ones, allowing transfer of SDF pilots over a certain age within a reasonable level that does not interfere with the missions of the SDF is meaningful from the viewpoint of development of Japan’s aviation industry. In view of the important roles the reemployment system has played to date, the Ministry of Defense announced it would re-start the system on 14 March 2014, taking the neutrality and fairness of offi cial duties into consideration. The Ministry will also promote the appointment of those pilots reemployed under the reemployment system as SDF Reserve Personnel to support the operations of the forces.   **Air Defense Identifi cation Zone (ADIZ)**  The Ministry of Defense defi nes the Air Defense Identifi cation Zone (ADIZ) in the area surrounding Japan in order to identify aircrafts fl ying around Japan by using radar and take effective countermeasures against intrusions into Japanese airspace. Generally, the ADIZ is set by each country as its own air defense measures; however, it does not mean that it defi nes the boundaries or areas of territorial airspace or land for the country. The ADIZ of Japan is used to identify the nationality of the aircraft fl ying around Japan and whether there is a danger of intrusion into Japanese airspace, and to judge whether scramble should be conducted. For example, if a fi ghter with uniden- tifi ed nationality is fl ying toward Japanese airspace through the ADIZ, ASDF fi ghters will scramble, regarding the situation as “a danger of intrusion.” On the other hand, an aircraft that merely passes through the ADIZ does not usually make it a target of scramble actions. As above, not all the aircraft fl ying across the ADIZ are regarded as the target of scramble actions in Japan. For ex- ample, in terms of civil aircraft, the fl ight plans are usually submitted to the aviation authorities in advance in accordance with international standards, and therefore, the aircraft of other countries fl ying across the ADIZ will not be regarded as a target of scramble actions, as long as they follow the planned courses and fl y under the control of the air traffi c controller. As such, Japan’s ADIZ does not infringe the principle of the freedom of overfl ight over the high seas recognized under international law.",page,138,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24644,"**International Maritime Rules**  **What kinds of international rules are there concerning** **ocean navigation?**  First, there is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which sets out that the high seas are open to all states. The law establishes the concept of “freedom of the high seas.” This concept includes the notion of free surface and air navigation, allowing all nations’ ships and aircraft to freely navigate oceans and the airspace above them in principle. As this right is recognized by international law, any violation of this right is impermissible. Furthermore, free surface and air navigation are recognized in exclusive economic zones (EEZs). On the matter of territorial water navigation, all nations’ vessels may in principle continuously and swiftly pass through other nations’ territorial waters in a manner that is not “prejudicial to the peace, good order or safety” of that coastal nation. This is referred to as the “right of innocent passage”. As a general rule, coastal nations are not allowed to interfere with other nations’ innocent right of passage. On the other hand, in the case of airspace, foreign aircraft is not subject to the right of innocent passage. As such, fl ight through territorial airspace requires the permission of that nation.  **What happens when a foreign country’s vessel passes through** **territory not subject to the “right of innocent passage”?**  The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea establishes that actions such as using force against a coastal nation, gathering military information or conducting military training, fi shing, and surveying are not con- sidered “innocent.” In order to prevent such non-innocent passage, coastal nations are able to take necessary measures in their own territorial waters. In such cases, if said foreign vessel is in violation of Japanese law, measures will be taken, such as stop- page of the vessel and on-the-spot inspection. For example, continued intentional loitering of a foreign vessel within Japan’s territorial waters violates the Act on Navigation of Foreign Ships through the Territorial Sea and Internal Waters and permits Japan to forcibly remove such vessels from its waters. However, under international law, warships or government vessels for non-commercial purposes belong- ing to a foreign nation are generally exempt from foreign jurisdiction, and coastal nations are not permitted to take measures such as on-the-spot inspections and seizures.",page,139,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

The frequency of meetings involving the Ministry of  Defense and SDF participation, training and other forms of operational coordination, and interaction among Defense Attachés  aimed at collecting military intelligence are clearly increasing.  The deepening of Japan-Australian relations became clear in the rescue efforts for Malaysia Airlines f ight 370. The  SDF dispatched two SDF P-3C patrol aircrafts to Perth in Western Australia. These joint rescue efforts with Australia, which  demonstrated the cooperative capability our countries nurtured through joint training,  and the f uidly-conducted maintenance and supply operations that took advantage of  the Japan-Australia Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement, showed the ability  of MSDF air units and Australian Air Force patrol units to work together in a prac-  tical capacity.

Based on the idea that relief efforts and medical assistance would be needed in the event of a disaster, this training was  conducted in host country Brunei as a joint effort between the Experts’ Working Group on Humanitarian Assistance and Di-  saster Relief [1] on HA/DR[2] and the Experts’ Working Group on Military Medicine (EWG on MM[3]). The training scenario has  a relief unit, including medical teams from various countries, gathering to provide relief, receiving a request from a nation hit  by a large typhoon. Fleet, aircraft, rotorcraft, and medical treatment teams from Japan participated in the exercise.  Due to the necessity for relief efforts to be tailored to the affected nation during a disaster, it is essential to have a mul-  tinational coordination center (MNCC[4]). For this exercise, I was the leader on the Japan side for the MNCC. My assignment  was to ensure effective relief efforts by integrating all avenues for receiving a variety of requests from the affected region into  the MNCC, coordinating with the leadership of each country’s military, and conducting appropriate and timely dispatch of  rescue forces. A standard operating procedure (SOP [5]) from the medical f eld proved very helpful in our activities. This SOP  was created mainly by Japan and Singapore as the co-chairs for the military medicine aspect of ADMM-Plus. The exercise had  each country treat and evacuate disaster victims according to the SOP and verify the effectiveness of the SOP. It was a major  achievement that these countries were able to go beyond differences in tradition and culture to create the SOP, which I believe  will play a major role in future international relief efforts.

We can see some examples of such cooperation from past earthquakes or f ooding in many countries, including the recent case  of the missing f ight MH 370 of Malaysia Airlines where many countries dispatched their ships and planes to aid in the search.  Such joint operation requires effective coordination. In Asian countries, especially, a kind of unoff cial coordination that  relies on personal networking is highly essential to success.  I had a chance to study at the National Defense Academy of Japan (BODAI) during 1975-1979 as the 23rd term student  and was one of the f rst Thai students there funded by the Thai government. Back then, there were other foreign students there  only coming from Singapore. By now, there are more than 150 Thai military graduates from BODAI working in all the three  services of the Royal Thai Armed Forces. Every year, at a class reunion in Bangkok, we can hear all the alumni gathered at  the reunion sing the school anthem “Boei Daigakko Gakuseika” altogether at the end of the event. It is a truly rare thing to  see outside BODAI.  In coordination both between countries and armies, the BODAI alumni networking is greatly helpful. Even if some alum-  ni don’t know each other personally, they can coordinate easily thanks to this connection.  At present, BODAI provides education for students from many ASEAN countries. From this, we can see the growth of  this network in ASEAN which will contribute to joint cooperation in the future.  All the foreign alumni have received education and training to make them good military off cers. If the Ministry of De-  fense of Japan gives them further opportunities to go back and study courses in Japan such as professional courses in each  f eld and senior courses, it will allow them to grow further in their government service career, and will strengthen this BODAI  alumni network.

CTF 151 is a multinational initiative led by the U.S. that seeks to address counter-piracy operations. Units from the  participating countries conduct surveillance (zone defense) for designated waters based on the laws of their country and in  coordination with CTF 151 headquarters.  When we received reports in January 2014 from a ship that had been attacked by pirates, aircraft was sent out from the  destroyer Samidare on a search. It found and began tracking a suspicious vessel. The operation was later handed over to a P-3C  patrol aircraft, a French naval vessel belonging to an EU unit. The suspicious vessel turned out to be of Indian registry and  had been boarded by pirates. The crew was safely released and the pirates arrested. Our success was the product of effective  information sharing and coordination among each country’s counter-piracy units, and was an achievement that demonstrated  the consummate professionalism on the part of each unit member towards the missions they were given.  That same month our convoy was visited by  the Commander of CTF 151, Commodore Aage  Buur Jensen of the Royal Danish Navy. The visit  proved to be a valuable opportunity to exchange  views concerning improving information sharing  and cooperation towards making counter-piracy  operations more effective.  Today, despite the unforgiving conditions we  face so far away from Japan with temperatures  above 50 degrees Celsius and humidity close  to 100% on many of the days, we continued to  engage in counter-piracy operations to maintain  maritime traff c safety, contribute to the stability  and development of Japan, and help ensure peace  CTF 151 Commander and Commodore in the Royal Danish Navy (front row center) and  and stability among the international community.

Working in those conditions  amid a tangle of confused information, I got a direct sense of the importance of not only accurately identifying medical needs  but also ensuring good coordination with different countries  from the outset.  The thorough Japanese medical care we provided to the  victims on site earned us their deep trust, and the great ac-  claim we received for our meticulous support so distinctive  to Japan was a great source of happiness and pride for me as  a member of the medical care team.

We have been working with submarines since 1957 and the Oyashio, the f rst  submarine Japan built after the war, in our efforts to provide high-quality products using manufacturing technologies devel-  oped through many years of experience and achievements.

Thus, the sensors and devices that actually collect the information are playing an increasingly important role. In particular, infrared sensors are useful for detecting a variety of targets as they detect heat and can therefore be used anytime day or night. The SDF employs them in a range of equipment including searching and tracking systems, monitoring systems, missile guidance systems, and fi re control systems. The number of pixels in an infrared sensor is being increased in order to achieve high-defi nition infrared images that can pick up even minute details. Initiatives are underway to improve sensors’ target extraction and discrimination capabilities by acquiring images at multiple infrared wave bands, which leads to gaining more information from the target objects. Dual band infrared sensors currently being researched at the Ministry of Defense are capable of taking infrared images at a 1024 x 1024 pixel resolution equivalent to HD at both mid- and far-infrared wave bands simultaneously. As for detector elements, by leveraging Japan’s vaunted semiconductor technologies, quantum dot infrared sensors, which can be produced indigenously, were selected and for the first time in the world, a large number of pixels density and high-definition dual wavelength infrared sensors were materialized. With dual wavelengths, we can anticipate improvements in acquiring images suited to a variety of environments as well as advanced target identifi cation and discrimination capabilities. Dual band infrared sensors will also be useful among general consumers as a dual-use technology for ensuring safety and security (disaster prevention, security, and monitoring) as well as collision avoidance (in cars and robots).  **Visibility of a small boat in images using two infrared wavelengths**  High-defi nition dual wavelength sensor (1024 x 1024 pixels)  Far-infrared image Mid-infrared image  Examples of images taken of a small boat navigating the sea, using two different wavelengths  The small boat becomes visible when the two images are combined",page,169,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

However, this in turn has allowed us  to care for each other. I put effort into making breakfast even on days that I have rigorous  training from the early morning, and my husband helps out with the housework. His “thank  you always” makes it all the worthwhile. I hope we can continue to be a couple that support  each other. I want to keep my family happy as a wife and at the same time steadily fulf ll Mami Nagae (in front), conducting wire communications  work during a company training  my national defense duties as an SDF personnel.  JMSDF Tateyama Air Base (Tateyama City, Chiba Prefecture) Petty Offi cer Third Class (MSDF) Yukiko Noda, the 211th Squadron, the 21st Air Unit  I am the f rst woman to be working as a f ight navigator in MSDF patrol helicopter. It  was my experience in helicopter operations during the Great East Japan Earthquake that  inspired me to become a f ight navigator. During disaster recovery, I maintained the heli-  copters’ electronic equipment. Many helicopters set out from Tateyama Air Base on search  and rescue missions for people gone missing. Seeing the many civilians helping out gave  me a strong desire to help as an aircrew member.  MSDF patrol helicopters are operated by two pilots and two f ight navigators who du-  ties include maritime patrol and rescue operations. Because of the small number of people  involved, success is only achievable if every person carries out their duties to the fullest  extent. This led to moments of frustration as instruction was sometimes harsh. However,  I will keep training and continue working hard so that I can be a navigator capable of han- Yukiko Noda, conducting prefl ight inspections  dling any task required of me.  JASDF Iruma Airbase (Sayama City, Saitama Prefecture) Staff Sergeant (ASDF) Kana Sakikawa, Air Defense Control Unit, Central Air Defense Control Corps, Central Airborne-Warning Control Group  I am currently a member of the Air Defense Control Unit at Iruma Airbase. The unit’s pri-  mary duties during peace time involve measures to prevent the encroachment of Japanese airspace, for which it conducts 24-hour surveillance operations using radar. The measures  I undertake to protect Japan’s airspace include scrambling interceptors when unidentif ed  aircraft are detected. Recent years have seen increased aircraft activity around Japan’s periph-  ery, and the number of scrambles has increased. As such, my workplace has been engulfed by  heightened tension on an increasing number of instances. At the same time, it is rewarding to  work in an environment where there is no difference between men and women.  I will continue to be proud of the work I do in my mission to protect this blue sky as a member of the Warning and Control Unit on the front line of national defense.

The necessary safety mats, baby bedding, and other necessities are provided. There are also programs that include those that give parents time off to help ensure a good work-childcare balance. One of these is leave to look after children’s health (including giving vaccinations and administering medical exams), which gives SDF personnel with children up to kindergarten age 5 days of leave a year if they have one child, and 10 days of leave for two or more. There are also personnel who arrive at work early and leave late, some of whom have kindergarten-age or younger children, send their elementary school-age children to afterschool activities, or look after a family member. These personnel are permitted to change their work start and end times without changing the number of hours they work in a day.",page,175,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

Every year for about a month, roughly 15,000 SDF personnel joined in var- ious activities such as building snow sculptures, performing maintenance, and transporting snow. The Northern Army has thus become indispensable to the snow festival, and will continue to collaborate in these efforts and Sculpting the Sultan Abdul Samad further strengthen relations with the local community. Building out of snow  Based in Okinawa, the MSDF Fleet Air Wing 5 makes the most of its positioning at the Hachinohe Air Base in Aomori Prefecture and works together with local SDF personnel using P-3C patrol aircraft to transport snow every year from Mt. Hakkoda to places in Okinawa such as elementary schools, foster care facilities, and children’s centers. As it rarely snows in Okinawa, this was the fi rst time for most of these children to see real snow. The children built snowman together with the SDF personnel, threw themselves down on the snow, and delighted in the feel Students of Ueno Elementary School in  Miyakojima, playing in snow from  of the snow. In return, sugarcane grown in Okinawa was delivered to children in Mt. Hakkoda Hachinohe, Aomori Prefecture so they could enjoy Okinawa fl avor. Through these efforts, the MSDF P-3C patrol aircraft serves as a bridge between Naha and Hachinohe City that makes children smile.  Two especially important tasks in Okinawa are building good relations with residents and local governments around the base, and gaining their under- standing and trust concerning defense-related matters. The ASDF Naha Air Base is therefore making efforts to foster goodwill and trust through diligent work at traditional Okinawan events such as the Naha Harii (traditional boat race) and Eisa Festival in Naha City as well as volunteer activities including  ASDF Personnel Participating in the Naha  cleaning efforts in places such as Mabuni Hills (Mabuni-no-Oka) in Itoman Harii (traditional boat race) City and Senagajima Island in Tomigusuku City.",page,177,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

24686,"**Chapter 1 Defense Policies of Countries**  **Section 1 The United States**  **1 Security and Defense Policies**  Despite its changing influence in relative terms, the United States remains the world's most  powerful nation, and it is believed to consistently play a significant role in ensuring peace and  stability throughout the world. In January 2012, the Obama administration released the new  Defense Strategic Guidance[1]. Based on the understanding that the United States is at an  inflection point due to factors both inside and outside the country, that is, the U.S. Forces’  withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan after a decade of war and the demand for deep cuts in  government spending including defense spending under the government’s serious fiscal  situation, the guidance was developed to review defense priorities and present a blueprint for the  Joint Force in 2020. In the new Defense Strategic Guidance, the Obama Administration  articulated a policy that would place the Asia-Pacific region at the focus of U.S. strategy,  including the security strategy (Rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific Region). Furthermore, in March  2014 the Administration published the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the second review  since President Obama took office. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense Strategic  Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it, including rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific  region, indicating that the Obama Administration continues to place an emphasis on the region.  Meanwhile, as the growing budget deficits of the U.S. government in recent years have called  for deep cuts in spending, in January 2012 the Department of Defense announced that the  reduction in defense spending will amount to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from  FY2012 to FY2021[2]. In addition, the government budget sequestration[3], including defense  spending, was initiated in March 2013, bringing various impacts on the U.S. Forces including  suspension of training, delayed deployment of aircraft carriers, and grounding of air squadrons.  Although the Bipartisan Budget Act of the Democratic and Republican parties mitigated the  sequestration spending cuts for FY2014 and FY2015, the QDR emphasizes that the risks to the  U.S. Forces would increase considerably if sequester-level cuts return in FY2016. Much  1 The formal title of the document is “Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense.” 2 According to the document published by the DoD concerning the FY2013 budget request that was submitted to Congress in February 2012, “the amount of reduction” here means the difference between the total DoD base budget for 10 years estimated at the time of the FY2012 budget request (submitted to Congress in February 2011) and the total DoD base budget for 10 years estimated at the time of the FY2013 budget request. 3 It has been pointed out that the mandatory cuts in defense expenditure resulting from the Budget Control Act will amount to about 500 billion dollars by the time of the budget for FY2021.",page,181,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24687,"attention will be paid to how the mandatory sequestration cuts in defense spending will impact  the U.S. defense strategies and security policies outlined in the QDR and other documents.  1 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR)  In March 2014, the Department of Defense released the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR).  The QDR outlines policies concerning U.S. Forces' capabilities and composition in anticipation  of the security environment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the  Secretary of Defense submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds  on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it.  (1) Understanding of Security  The 2014 QDR states that the future international security environment remains uncertain and  complicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between  states, non-state entities and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly  accelerating spread of information. In addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states  that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals,  and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces.  The QDR recognizes that the Asia-Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce,  politics and security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the  region continues to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their military and  security capabilities, bringing greater risk that tensions arising from long-standing sovereign  disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In  particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehensive scope of China’s military  modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding  both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its  long-range missile and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit  of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to  peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to  the United States.  As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of  trans-national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate  into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile states. The report states that Iran remains a  destabilizing actor that threatens security by defying international law and pursing capabilities  that would allow it to develop nuclear weapons. Even as Iran pledges not to pursue nuclear",page,182,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24688,"weapons, its other destabilizing activities including development of mid- and long-range  missiles and support to terrorists and insurgents, will continue to pose a threat to the security of  the Middle East and the U.S. allies and partners.  Furthermore, it states that as countries in the Middle East and Africa undergo political and social  change, terrorist groups seek to expand their influence, and internal strife in Syria has become a  magnet for global jihad, bringing ongoing spillover effects including an influx of foreign  fighters and a flood of refugees into neighboring countries. In Africa, it mentions that terrorists,  criminal organizations and pirates exploit ungoverned and under-governed territory, causing  potential for rapidly developing threats, particularly of terrorist attacks in fragile states, that  could pose acute challenges to U.S. interests.  The report says that Europe remains the principal partner in promoting global security,  particularly in addressing challenges such as persistent unrest and violence in the Middle East  and North Africa.  The QDR states that while the United States is willing to undertake security cooperation with  Russia, both in the bilateral context and in seeking solutions to regional challenges, Russia’s  multi-dimensional defense modernization and actions that violate the sovereignty of neighbors  present risks and thus the United States will engage Russia to increase transparency and reduce  the risk of military miscalculation.  Concerning the global trends, the report refers to the emergence of international partners with  the capacity to play security roles in their respective regions, as well as international  cooperation and shared norms of behavior at unprecedented levels of global interconnectedness.  At the same time it also states that the spread and proliferation of technology offers new tools  for state and non-state adversaries such as terrorists to pursue asymmetric approaches in the 21[st]  century operational environment. Furthermore, the report states that in coming years, countries  such as China will continues seeking to counter U.S. strengths using anti-access and area-denial  (A2/AD) approaches[4] and by employing other new cyber and space control technologies. It also  says that elements such as cyberspace, space, sophisticated technology, WMD, terrorism and  climate change poses additional challenges.  (2) Defense Strategy  The 2014 QDR emphasizes the following three pillars, which are interdependent and mutually  4 See Part I Overview, Section 2, footnote 4",page,183,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24689,"reinforcing, in order to embody priorities outlined in the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance  including rebalancing toward the Asia-Pacific region and strong commitment to stability in  Europe and the Middle East.  (1) Protect the Homeland: Maintain the capability to deter and defeat attacks on the United  States. Protection of the homeland includes assisting U.S. civil authorities in protecting U.S.  airspace, shores, and borders, and in responding effectively to domestic disasters.  (2) Build security globally: Continue a strong U.S. commitment to shaping world events in  order to deter and prevent conflict and to assure the allies and partners of the shared security.  (3) Project power and win decisively: the U.S. Forces deter acts of aggression in one or more  theaters by remaining capable of decisively defeating adversaries, while projecting power to  provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.  The QDR states that across the three pillars, the U.S. Forces are capable of simultaneously  implementing the following undertakings, and if deterrence fails at any given time, U.S. forces  could defeat a regional adversary in a large-scale multi-phased campaign, and deny the  objectives of—or imposing unacceptable costs on—another aggressor in another region[5].  1) Defending homeland  2) Conducting sustained, distributed counterterrorist operations  3) Deterring aggression and assuring allies through forward presence and engagement in  multiple regions.  Furthermore, in order to achieve the three pillars, the Department of Defense seeks innovative  approaches to how to fight, how to posture the force, and how to leverage the asymmetric  strengths and technological advantages. More specifically, the QDR mentions positioning  additional forward-deployed naval forces in critical areas, such as the Asia-Pacific region, and  deploying new combinations of ships, aviation assets, and crisis response forces.  (3) Rebalancing of the Joint Force  Given major changes in the U.S. security environment including geopolitical changes, changes  in modern warfare, and changes in the fiscal environment, the 2014 QDR states that the  5 The 2010 QDR stated that the U.S. Forces possess the capability of countering attacks by two countries while also being able to conduct a wide range of operations. The 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance states that the United States maintain forces that are able to fully deny a capable state’s aggressive objectives in one region while being capable of denying the objectives of – or imposing unacceptable costs on – an opportunistic aggressor in a second region.",page,184,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24690,"Department of Defense will rebalance the Joint Force for a broad spectrum of conflict,  rebalance and maintain the presence and posture abroad, and rebalance capability, capacity and  readiness. The QDR also says that while the force will become smaller, it will become more  modern as well, with readiness improving. Furthermore, it states that particularly in an era of  reduced budget and other resources, the Department will redouble its efforts to protect key  capability areas listed below, that are most closely aligned to the pillars of the defense strategy.  1) Missile defense: Increase the number of Ground-Based Interceptors and build depth into the  sensor network. Deploy a second radar in Japan that will improve early warning and tracking of  any missiles launched by North Korea. Increase defense interceptor reliability and effectiveness  to improve discrimination capabilities, and to establish a more robust sensor network. Study the  best location in the United States for an additional missile defense interceptor site.  2) Nuclear deterrence: Continue to invest in modernizing the essential nuclear delivery systems,  warheads, command and control, and nuclear weapon infrastructure.  3) Cyber: Develop the Cyber Mission Force that operates and defends the Department networks  and supports military operations worldwide by 2016. In addition, the Department migrates its  information systems to a common, Defense-wide network infrastructure known as the Joint  Information Environment.  4) Space: Diversify and expand the coverage of Space Situational Awareness (SSA)[6] through  international partnerships. In the near-term, investment in technology demonstrations and  capabilities required to evolve toward more resilient architectures. Additionally, accelerate  initiatives to counter adversary space capabilities including adversary intelligence, surveillance  and reconnaissance (ISR), and space-enabled precision strike.  _See_ -  Part I, Chapter 2, Section 4-1 (Outer Space and Security)  5) Air/sea: Invest in combat aircraft, including fighters and long-range strike, survivable  persistent surveillance, resilient architectures, and undersea warfare to increase the Joint Force's  ability to counter A2/AD challenges. Deepen collaboration with key allies and partners as they  develop future forces and capabilities to counter more sophisticated aggressors.  6) Precision strike: The Air Forces will procure air-to-surface missiles that allow both fighter  and bomber aircraft to engage a wide range of targets effectively, even when the enemy’s air  defense have not been fully suppressed. The Navy is developing a new, joint, long-range  anti-ship cruise missile, which will improve the Joint Force's ability to engage surface  combatants in defended airspace.  7) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR): Rebalance investments toward systems  6 The number of Special Operations Forces personnel as of March 2014 is 66,000.",page,185,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24691,"that will be effective in defended airspace and denied areas, in the wake of the drawdown of  forces from Iraq and Afghanistan and in light of growing challenges from state adversaries.  Make critical space based systems more resilient by expanding the access to commercial and  allied space ISR systems.  8) Counter Terrorism and Special Operations: Grow overall Special Operations Forces (SOF)  strength to 69,700. As forces are withdrawn from Afghanistan, more SOF will be available to  support Combatant Commanders’ efforts to counter a range of challenges across the globe.  9) Resilience: Improve the resilience of air, naval, ground, space and missile-defense  capabilities, even in the face of large-scale, coordinated attacks. Disperse land-based and naval  expeditionary forces to other bases and operating sites and provide ability to operate and  maintain front-line combat aircraft from austere bases while using only a small complement of  logistical and support personnel and equipment.  The QDR emphasizes that if sequester-level cuts return in FY2016, risks for the U.S. forces  posed by shifts in the security environment would grow significantly[7].  2 Rebalance toward the Asia-Pacific Region  As indicated by the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and the 2014 QDR, the United States  places emphasis on the Asia-Pacific region and is continuing a policy to enhance its presence in  the region. In November 2011, U.S. President Obama delivered a speech in the Australian  Parliament, clearly stating, for the first time, that he will give top priority to the U.S. presence  and mission in the Asia-Pacific region and indicating that the U.S. will maintain its strong  presence in Japan and the Korean Peninsula, while enhancing its presence in Southeast Asia.  Furthermore, the 2014 QDR states that the centerpiece of the Department of Defense  commitment to the rebalance toward the Asia-Pacific region is to modernize and enhance  security alliances with Australia, Japan, the ROK, the Philippines and Thailand.  Concrete examples of the enhancement of U.S. Forces’ presence in the Asia-Pacific region  include enhanced presence of the U.S. Forces in Australia. In November 2011, U.S. President  Obama and then Australian Prime Minister Gillard jointly announced U.S.-Australia force  posture initiatives, which include: (1) the rotational deployment of U.S. marines to Darwin and  Northern Australia for around six months at a time where they will conduct exercises and  training with the Australian Defence Force[8]; and (2) increased rotations of aircraft of the U.S.  7 Some of the implications anticipated in the case of the return of the sequester-level cuts include a reduction in end strength of active Army to 420,000, retirement of the USS George Washington aircraft carrier (10 aircraft carriers), a reduction in end strength of marine corps to 175,000, a further retirement of air force aircraft and a slowdown of purchases of F-35 aircraft. 8 The initial deployment would consist of a company of 250 U.S. marines and aims to eventually",page,186,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24692,"Air Force through northern Australia, which will offer greater opportunities for joint training  and exercises with the Royal Australian Air Force. The joint initiatives are described as part of  the efforts to embody the basic concept of the force posture of the U.S. Forces presence in the  Asia-Pacific region, which intends to pursue “a more geographically distributed, operationally  resilient, and politically sustainable military presence.” Other examples include the rotational  deployment of up to four Littoral Combat Ships (LCS)[9] to Singapore announced by then U.S.  Secretary of Defense Gates in June, 2011. In April 2013, LCS Freedom arrived at Singapore  and started the first rotation. Also, the United States repeatedly conducted joint military  exercises with and provided military technologies and assistance to Southeast Asian countries in  an effort to build up trusting relationships and strengthen the readiness of the countries.  Furthermore, the 2014 QDR states that 60 percent of U.S. Navy assets will be stationed in the  Pacific by 2020 including enhancements to its critical naval presence in Japan, and the Air  Force will move forces such as ISR assets to the region.  The United States has been expressing its stance to emphasize the Asia-Pacific region not only  to its allies and partners but also to China. The 2014 QDR states that the United States is  building a sustained and substantive dialogue with China to improve the ability to cooperate in  concrete, practical areas such as counter-piracy, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and  disaster relief. At the same time, the United States will manage the competitive aspects of  China-U.S. relations in ways that improve regional peace and stability consistent with  international norms and principles.  3 Nuclear Strategy  While U.S. President Obama aims to realize a world without nuclear weapons, he notes that this  will not be realized in the near future, and indicates the need to maintain a nuclear deterrent as  long as nuclear weapons exist.  The Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), which was released in April 2010, indicates that the  nuclear security environment is changing and nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation are an  imminent threat today. Furthermore, it points to the necessity of working on the issue of  ensuring strategic stability with existing nuclear powers, in particular Russia and China.  establish a rotational presence of up to a 2,500-person Marine Air-Ground Task Force including aircraft, ground vehicles, and artilleries over a few years. From April to October of 2013, about 200 U.S. Marine Corps personnel were deployed as the second rotation. 9 Fast and agile war vessels designed to defeat asymmetrical threats with A2 capability in near-shore environments",page,187,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24693,"The NPR presents five key objectives based on awareness of this security environment:  (1) preventing nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism; (2) reducing the role of U.S. nuclear  weapons; (3) maintaining strategic deterrence and stability at reduced nuclear force levels;  (4) strengthening regional deterrence and reassuring U.S. allies and partners; and (5) sustaining  a safe, secure, and effective nuclear arsenal.  In June 2013, U.S. President Obama delivered a speech on the reduction of nuclear weapons in  Berlin, which was then followed by the release of the Report on Nuclear Employment Strategy  by the Department of Defense on the same day. The report revealed U.S. intentions to negotiate  with Russia to pursue up to a one-third reduction in deployed strategic nuclear weapons.  _See_ -  Part I, Chapter 2, Section 2-1 (Nuclear Weapons)  4 FY2015 Budget  As the budget deficit of the U.S. Government is deepening in recent years, the Budget Control  Act enacted in August 2011 established a deep cut in government spending by FY2021. In  January 2012, the DoD announced that the reduction in defense spending in light of the act will  amount to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from FY2012 to FY2021 (about 259  billion dollars over the five years from FY2013 to FY2017). In March 2013, the mandatory  sequestration of government spending including defense spending started based on the  provisions of the Budget Control Act. The Bipartisan Budget Act by the Democratic and  Republican parties which passed in December 2013 mitigated the sequestration caps for  FY2014 and FY2015. The FY2015 budget request that was announced following the Act  includes 495.6 billion dollars[10] to fund base defense programs. For Overseas Contingency  Operations, the budget includes 58.6 billion dollars, an amount that is 20.9 billion dollars less  than the amount in the FY2014 budget request, reflecting the plan to withdraw troops from  Afghanistan. The key principles of the defense budget are as follows: (1) Seek a balanced force;  (2) Prepare for prolonged readiness challenges including uncertain fiscal outlook; (3) Continue  to focus on institutional reform; and (4) Pursue compensation changes. Major decisions include  a reduction of end strength of active Army from the current 520,000 down to 440,000-450,000  personnel, maintaining 11 aircraft carriers of the Navy, a commitment to the F-35 development  and procurement program, and retirement of all A-10 tactical fighters and U-2 reconnaissance  aircraft. In relation to these decisions, the 2014 QDR states that while the forces will become  smaller, it will become more modern as well, with readiness improving. However, unless the  Congress and the President agree to a new budget bill or other such measures are taken, the  10 A reduction of about 400 million dollars compared to the FY2014 budget under the Bipartisan Budget Act that mitigated the sequestration caps.

The 2014 QDR states that concerning the risks  for the U.S. Forces posed by shifts in the security environment, the Department can manage  these risks under the President’s FY2015 Budget plan, but the risks would grow significantly if  sequester-level cuts return in FY2016[11]. Attention will be paid to future trends in sequestration  of government spending including defense spending.  _See ▶ Fig. I-1-1-1 (The Impact of Mandatory Reduction of Government Expenditure on Defense Budget); Fig. I-1-1-2_  _(Shifts in the U.S. Defense Budget)_  **2 Military Posture**  1 General Situation  In regard to strategic offensive weapons including nuclear force, the U.S. is moving ahead with  its reduction based on a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty that came into force in February  2011. In April 2014, it announced that its deployed strategic warheads[12] stood at 1,585, while  its deployed delivery platforms stood at 778 [13]. The U.S. is studying the concept of a  Conventional Prompt Global Strike (CPGS), as an effort contributing to the nation’s new ability  to reduce reliance on nuclear weapons[14].  In regard to Missile Defense (MD), the U.S. announced the Ballistic Missile Defense Review  (BMDR) in February 2010. On homeland defense, the review noted that the U.S. would use  ground-based interceptors to respond to ICBMs from North Korea and Iran, and that in regard  to regional defense, the U.S. would expand investments in MD systems while taking a phased  adaptive approach (PAA) that is tailored to each region and improve the MD capabilities step by  step, working with partner countries and properly sharing the burden. However, in January 2012,  the U.S. announced that it will continue investments in MD programs in its homeland and  Europe while reducing the spending for deployable regional MD systems with a view to  increasing reliance on its allies and partners in the future. Further, in March 2013, the U.S.  announced that it will additionally deploy ground-based interceptors in the U.S. homeland and  mobile radars for BMD in Japan in order to bolster homeland security in response to North  Korea’s nuclear test and the advancement of its long-range ballistic missile development, while  restructuring the program of the standard missile (SM-3) Block IIB scheduled for deployment in  Europe.  11 See Part I, Chapter 1, Section 1, footnote 7 12 Warheads that have been equipped in deployed ICBMs and Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) and nuclear warheads equipped in heavy bombers.

24695,"The operation of the U.S. Forces is not controlled by the individual branches of the broader  armed forces, rather it is operated under the leadership of the Unified Combatant Commands,  comprising leaders from multiple branches of the armed forces. The Unified Combatant  Commands consist of three commands with functional responsibilities and six commands with  regional responsibilities.  The U.S. ground forces consist of about 520,000 soldiers, and about 190,000 marines, which are  forward-deployed in Germany, the ROK, and Japan, among other countries. As described in the  Defense Strategic Guidance, the Army continues its transition to a smaller yet capable force  fully prepared to conduct a full range of operations worldwide. The Marine Corps aims to  acquire forces capable to respond to any threat as a “middleweight force,” bridging the seam  between smaller special operations forces and larger heavy conventional forces. In January 2012,  the DoD announced that it will reduce the number of active Marine Corps personnel to 182,000  and in February 2014 the number of active Army personnel to 440,000 – 450,000, with further  reductions to both in the future.  The U.S. maritime forces consist of about 1,030 vessels (including about 70 submarines)  totaling about 6.10 million tons. The 6th Fleet is deployed in the East Atlantic Ocean, the  Mediterranean Sea and Africa; the 5th Fleet in the Persian Gulf, Red Sea and northwest Indian  Ocean; the 3rd Fleet in the eastern Pacific; the 4th Fleet in South America and the Caribbean  Sea; and the 7th Fleet in the western Pacific and Indian Ocean.  The U.S. air forces consist of roughly 3,500 combat aircraft across the Air Force, Navy, and  Marine Corps. In addition to carrier-based aircraft deployed at sea, part of the tactical air force  is forward-deployed in Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and the ROK.  Moreover, in addressing the increasing threats in cyberspace, the U.S. Cyber Command  (USCYBERCOM) was founded in order to oversee operations in cyberspace. The U.S. Cyber  Command attained Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in May 2010 and commended full  capability in November in the same year[15].  _See ▶ Fig. I-1-1-3 (Structure of the Unified Combatant Command)_  15 As cyber-related units, Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER), Fleet Cyber Command (FLTCYBERCOM), 24th Air Force/Air Force Cyber Command (AFCYBER), and Marine Corps Forces Cyber Command (MARFORCYBER) have been newly formed.",page,190,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24696,"2 Current Military Posture in the Asia-Pacific Region  The United States, which is a Pacific nation, continues to play an important role in ensuring the  peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region by deploying the Pacific Command, a joint  command consisting of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. The Pacific Command is  a command with regional responsibilities and is responsible for the largest geographical area.  The U.S. Forces stationed in the ROK and Japan fall under the control of the Pacific Command.  Furthermore, in order to broaden the perspective of the U.S. Forces and promote better  understanding of the U.S. Forces from allies, the Pacific Command headquarters accept  personnel from allies in the region. Under this scheme, personnel from Canada and Australia are  currently serving in the Pacific Command as deputy director level-officials.  The Pacific Command consists of the U.S. Army Pacific, U.S. Pacific Fleet, U.S. Marine Forces  Pacific, and U.S. Pacific Air Forces, which are all headquartered in Hawaii[16].  The U.S. Army Pacific (USARPAC) is composed of two divisions and deploys such forces as  the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii and the 2nd Infantry Division and 19th Sustainment  Command in the ROK, in addition to about 2,300 personnel in Japan, including the I Corps  (Forward) headquarters and the headquarters, U.S. Army Japan[17].  The U.S. Pacific Fleet consists of the Seventh Fleet, which is responsible for the western Pacific  and the Indian Ocean, and the Third Fleet, responsible for the East Pacific and Bering Sea. The  U.S. Pacific in total controls about 180 vessels. The Seventh Fleet is centered on a carrier strike  group with main stationing locations in Japan and Guam. Their mission is to defend territorial  lands, people and sea lines of communication and the critical national interests of the U.S. and  its allies. The fleet consists of aircraft carriers, amphibious ships and the Aegis combat system.  The U.S. Pacific Maritime Corps deploys one Marine Expeditionary Force each in the U.S.  mainland and Japan. Of this force, about 16,000 personnel are in the 3rd Marine Division and  the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, which are equipped with F/A-18 fighters and other aircraft and are  both deployed in Japan. In addition, maritime pre-positioning ships loaded with heavy  equipment and others are deployed in the Western Pacific.  16 In 2013, the U.S. Army Pacific upgraded the rank of its Commander from lieutenant general to general, and thus the commanders of the Army Pacific, Pacific Fleet, and Pacific Air Forces have all become four stars. 17 The figures of the U.S. Forces mentioned in this paragraph are the numbers of active personnel recorded in the published sources of the U.S. Department of Defense (as of December 31, 2013), and could change according to unit deployment.",page,191,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

In January 2012, the Obama administration released the new  Defense Strategic Guidance  . Based on the understanding that the United States is at an  inflection point due to factors both insid  e and outside the country, that is, the U.S. Forces’ withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan after a decade of war and the demand for deep cuts in  _government spending including defense spending under the government’s serious fiscal situation, the guidance was developed to review defense priorities and present a blueprint for the Joint Force in 2020. In the new Defense Strategic Guidance, the Obama Administration articulated a policy that would place the Asia-Pacific region at the focus of U.S. strategy, including the security strategy (Rebalancing to the Asia- Pacific Region). Furthermore, in March_ _2014 the Administration published the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the second review since President Obama took office. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense S_  trategic  **Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it, including rebalancing to the Asia-**  Pacific region, indicating that the Obama Administration continues to place an emphasis on the region.  Meanwhile, as the growing budget deficits of the U.S. government in recent years have called for deep cuts in spending, in January 2012 the Department of Defense announced that the reduction in defense spending will amount to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from FY2012 to FY2021ilitary. In addition, the government budget sequestration  realize this goal.

It has been pointed out that the mandatory cuts in defense expenditure resulting from the Budget Control Act will amoun  t to about 500 billion dollars by the time of the budget for FY2021. North Korea used to vow that it would open the door to a “powerful and prosperous nation (Kangseong Daeguk)” in 2012, which marked the 100th anniversary of the birth of the late President Kim Il-sung.

The QDR outli nes po licies conce rni ng U.S. F orces' capabilities and composition in anticipation of the secur ity environment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the Secretary of Defense subm its the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds  on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it.  (1) Understanding of Security  The 2014 QDR states that the future international secur ity environmen  t rem ains u nce rtain and  complicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between  states, non-state entities and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly [accelerating spread of information. In] addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states  that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals,  and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces.  The QDR recognizes t  hat the Asia  -  Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce, politics and security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the  region continues to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their milita  ry and  security cap abilitie s, b ringing gre ate r ri sk that te nsions ar isi ng from long  -  standing sovereign  disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In  particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehensive scope of China’s military  modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its long  -   range missile and weapons of  mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to [peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to ]the United States.  As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of  trans- national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile  states. The report states that Iran remains a destabilizing actor that threatens security by defying international law and pursing capabilities  that would allow it to develop nuclear weapons. Even as Iran pledges not to pursue nuclear 5 Four Military Guidelines were adopted at the fifth plenary meeting of the fourth Korean Workers’ Party’s Central Committee in 1962.",page,194,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24700,"weapons, its other d estabilizing activities including development of mid and long -range  missiles and support to terrorists and insurgents, will continue to pose a threat to the security of  the Middle East and the U.S. allies and partners. Furthermore, it states that as coun  tries in the Middle East and Africa undergo political and social change, terrorist groups seek to expand their influence, and internal strife in Syria has become a  magnet for global jihad, bringing ongoing spillover effects including an influx of foreign  f ighters and a flood of refugees into neighboring countries. In Africa, it mentions that terrorists,  criminal organizations and pirates exploit ungoverned and under -governed territory, causing  potential for rapidly developing threats, particularly of terrorist attacks in fragile states, that  could pose acut e challe nges to U.S. inte res ts.  The re port says that E urop e rem ains the pri nci pal partner in promoting global security,  particularly in addressing challenges such as persistent unrest and violence in the Middle East and North Africa.  The QDR states that while the United States is willing to undertake security cooperation with Russia, both in the bilateral context and in seeking solutions to regional challenges, Russia’s [multi] dimensional defense moderniza  tion and actions that violate the sovereignty of neighbors  present risks and thus the United States will engage Russia to increase transparency and reduce the risk of military miscalculation.  Concerning the global trends, the report refers to the emergenc e of i nternational partn ers with  the capacity to play security roles in their respective regions, as well as international  cooperation and shared norms of behavior at unprecedented levels of global interconnectedness. At the same time it also states that t  he spread and proliferation of technology offers new tools  for state and non -  state adversaries such as terrorists to pursue asymmetric approaches in the 21st century operational environment. Furthermore, the report states that in coming years, countries  su ch as China will continues seeking to counter U.S. strengths using anti- access and area denial (A2/AD) approaches25 attack aircraft are also included. North Korea has a large number of outdated  and by employing other new cyber and space control technologies.

(1) Protect the Homeland: Maintain the capability to deter and defeat attacks on the United  States. Protection of the homeland includes assisting U.S. civil authorities in protecting U.S. airspace, shores, and borders, and in responding effectively to domestic disasters.  (2) Build security globally: Continue a strong U.S. commitment to shaping world events in order to deter and prevent conflict and to assure the allies and partners of the shared security. (3) Project power and win decisively: the U.S. Forces deter acts of aggression in one or more theaters by remaining capable of decisively defeating adversaries, while proje  cting power to  provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.  The QDR states that across the three pillars, the U.S. Forces are capable of simultaneously implem enting th e following un dert akings, and if deterrence fails at any given time, U.S. forces  could defeat a regional adversary in a large scale mult i  -  phased campaign, and deny the  object ives of  — or imposing unacceptable costs on  —  another aggressor in another region upled with provocative  .  1) Defending homeland 2) Conducting sustained, distributed counterterrorist opera  tions  3) Deterring aggression and assuring allies through forward presence and engagement in  multiple regions.  Furthermore, in order to achieve the three pillars, the Department of Defense seeks innovative approaches to how to fight, how to posture the force, and how to leverage the asymmetric strengths and technological advantages. More specifically, the QDR mentions positioning additional forward -  deployed naval forces in critical areas, such as the Asia -   Pacific region, and deploying new combinations of s hips, aviation assets, and crisis response forces.  (3) Rebalancing of the Joint Force  Given major changes in the U.S. security environment including geopolitical changes, changes in modern warfare, and changes in the fiscal environment, the 2014 QDR state s that the ce cyber attack capabilities in recent years. Regarding North Korean cyber attacks against the The 2010 QDR stated that the U.S. Forces possess the capability of countering attacks by two countries  while also being able to conduct a wide range of operations.

The QDR also says that while the force will become smaller, it will become more  modern as well, with readiness improving. Furthermore, it states that particularly in an era of reduced budget and other resources, the Department will redouble its efforts to protect key capability areas listed below, that are  most c los ely al igne d to t he pillars of the defen se str ategy.  1) Missile defense: Increase the number of Ground -  Based Interceptors and build depth into the sensor network. Deploy a second radar in Japan that will improve early warning and tracking of  any m issiles launched by North Korea. Increase defense interceptor reliability and effectiveness  to improve discrimination capabilities, and to establish a more robust sensor network. Study the best location in the United States for an additional missile defense interceptor site.  2) Nuclear deterrence: Continue to invest in modernizing the essential nuclear delivery systems, warheads, command and control, and nuclear weapon infrastructure.  3) Cyber: Develop the Cyber Mission Force that operates and defends the Department networks and supports military operations worldwide by 2016. In addition, the Department migrates its  information systems to a common, Defense-wide network infrastructure known as the Joint Information Environment.  4) Space: Diversify and expand the coverage of Space Situational Awareness (SSA)a nuclear test through  international partnerships. In the near  -  term, investment in technology demonstrations and capabilities required to evolve toward more resilient architectures. Additionally, accelerate  init iatives to counter adversary space capabilities including adversary intelligence, surveillance and re connai ssance (ISR), and space-enable d precision strike.

However, as of June 2014 The number of Special Operations Forces personnel as of March 2014 is 66,000. 12 Given that North Korea announced on May 25, 2009, via the Korean Central News Agency, that it had successfully conducted an underground nuclear test, and in light of the fact that the Japan Meteorological Agency detected a seismic wave with a waveform that differed from usual, which could possibly have resulted from a North Korean nuclear test, the government believes that North Korea conducted a nuclear test on that day.",page,197,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

Other launches of Scud and Nodong missiles had more practical characteristics based on some indications, namely: the missiles were launched before dawn; a number of different types of ballistic missiles were launched in succession over a short period of time; launches were carried out using transporter-erector-launchers (TELs); and ballistic missiles with different ranges were landed within a certain area. This leads to the assumption that North Korea has improved the operational capability of ballistic missiles. 32 All of the seven ballistic missiles launched were assumed to have landed in the military target practice area, for which a navigation warning was issued by the Japan Coast Guard upon notification by North Korea on June 22, 2009.",page,202,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

The Pacific Command is  a command with regional responsibilities and is responsible for the largest geographical area. The U.S. Forces statione  d in the ROK and Japan fall under the control of the Pacific Command.  Furthermore, in order to broaden the perspective of the U.S. Forces and promote better understanding of the U.S. Forces from allies, the Pacific Command headquarters accept personnel from allies in the region. Under this scheme, personnel from Canada and Australia are  currently serving in the Pacific Command as deputy director level-officials. The Pacific Command consists of the U.S. Army Pacific, U.S. Pacific Fleet, U.S. Marine Forces  P  acific, and U. S. Pac ific Air Forces, w hich are all head qua rtere d i n Hawaii  Taepodong.

The U.S. Pacific Fleet consists of the Seventh Fleet, which is responsible for the western Pacific and th  e Indian Ocean, and the Third Fleet, responsible for the East Pacific and Bering Sea. The U.S. Pacific in total controls about 180 vessels. The Seventh Fleet is centered on a carrier strike group with main stationing locations in Japan and Guam. Their mission is to defend territorial  lands, people and sea lines of communication and the critical national interests of the U.S. and  its alli es. The fleet consists of aircraft carriers, amphibious ships and the Aegis combat system. The U.S. Pacific Maritime Corps deploys one Marine Expeditionary Force each in the U.S. mainland and Japan. Of this force, about 16,000 personnel are in the 3rd Marine Division and th e 1st Ma rine Airc raf t Wi ng, which are equipped with F/A  -  18 fighters and other aircraft and are both deployed in Japan.

In the statement for the House Armed Services Committee in March 2009, General Sharp, then Commander of the U.S. Forces Korea, stated that preparations are currently under way in North Korea to field a new intermediate range ballistic missile capable of striking Okinawa, Guam, and Alaska. Furthermore, the ROK’s Defense White Paper 2012 notes that, “In 2007, [North Korea] fielded the Musudan missile (range of over 3,000km). Following these deployments, North Korea has gained direct strike capabilities against South Korea, Japan, Guam, and other surrounding countries.”",page,203,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

It is estimated that the missile crossed over Japan,  and flew more than 3,000 km before falling in the Pacific Ocean. In April 2012, North Korea  conducted a launch believed to be using a Taepodong-2 or its variant from the Tongch’ang-ri  district on the northwestern coast of North Korea, which it called a “Satellite.” The missile flew  over a minute and then fell into the Yellow Sea by breaking into several pieces. The launch is  believed to have been a failure[35].  In December of the same year, North Korea again conducted a launch using a Taepodong-2  variant, which it called a “Satellite” launch, from the Tongch’ang-ri district. In this launch, all  falling objects are estimated to have fallen in the danger areas which were set beforehand by  North Korea, while an object including the possible third stage propelling device is estimated to  have continued flight while changing its trajectory and put an object into orbit around the earth[36].  The launch showed that North Korea has developed technologies to extend the range such as  those to separate multi-stage propulsion devices and technologies to improve the accuracy of  ballistic missiles such as those to control posture and guidance. It is thus believed that North  Korea’s ballistic missile development has entered a new phase. As for the technology to extend  34 According to the U.S. Department of Defense’s “Military and Security Developments Involving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” of March 2014, North Korea possesses a maximum of 100 TELs in total for Toksas and Scuds, a maximum of 50 TELs for Nodongs, and a maximum of 50 TELs for IRBMs (understood as referring to Musudans). Furthermore, according to “IHS Jane’s Sentinel Country Risk Assessments China and Northeast Asia (2012),” North Korea possesses approximately 600 Scuds, approximately 200 Nodongs, and approximately 50 to 150 other intermediate- and long-range missiles. 35 After the launch, North Korea announced that “the earth observation satellite failed to enter its preset orbit,” admitting the failure of the launch. 36 It is not confirmed that the object put into orbit around the earth is performing communication or transmitting/receiving any signal to/from the ground. Therefore, it is not assessed that the object actually functions as an artificial satellite.",page,204,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24710,"the range, in particular, it is believed that significant advancements have been made assuming  from the technologies verified through the launches this time and in the past that if North Korea  develops long-range ballistic missiles, they may potentially reach the central, western and other  areas of the U.S. mainland, while some details regarding a few of the related technologies are  still unclear.  g. KN08  The details of the new missile KN08 which was showcased at the military parade in April 2012  and July 2013 are unknown. However, the missile is believed to be an intercontinental ballistic  missile (ICBM)[37]. Whereas the Taepodong-2 is launched from a fixed launch pad, the KN08 is  carried by a TEL, making it difficult to detect signs of its launch in advance, and is likely  intended to increase survivability.  h. Trends in and outlook of ballistic missile development  An underlying factor that allowed for North Korea’s rapid strides in the development of its  ballistic missiles with only a few test launches is believed to be North Korea’s imports of  various materials and technologies from outside of the country. It is also pointed out that North  Korea transfers and proliferates ballistic missile airframes and related technologies, and that it  promotes the further development of missiles using funds procured by such transfer and  proliferation [38]. It is further pointed out that North Korea is conducting tests at transfer  destinations and using the results. Moreover, because a test launch of a long-range ballistic  missile would contribute to extending the range of other shorter-range missiles, increasing the  warhead weight and improving the circular error probability (CEP), the launch of long-range  ballistic missiles such as Taepodong-2, including the launch in December 2012, may lead to the  improvement of the performance of Nodong and other ballistic missiles possessed by North  Korea.  37 The “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of the United States Director of National Intelligence of January 2014 assessed that, “North Korea has publicly displayed its KN08 road-mobile ICBM twice. We assess that North Korea has already taken initial steps towards fielding this system, although it remains untested.” 38 For example, because Nodong is similar in shape to Shahab-3 of Iran and Gauri of Pakistan, analysts point out that Nodong airframes or related technologies may have been transferred. In addition, concerning the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles by North Korea, the “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of the United States Director of National Intelligence of January 2014 pointed out that “North Korea’s export of ballistic missiles and associated materials to several countries, including Iran and Syria, and its assistance to Syria’s construction of a nuclear reactor, destroyed in 2007, illustrate the reach of the its proliferation activities.” Moreover, in the report entitled “Military and Security Developments Involving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” which was published by the U.S. Department of Defense in May 2013, it was pointed out that North Korea uses various techniques to circumvent measures taken by each country on the basis of United Nations Security Council Resolutions, including sending cargo through multiple front companies and intermediaries.",page,205,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24711,"North Korea continues to claim that it will continue to conduct “satellite launches” and will  develop and launch more capable satellite launch vehicles. It is highly possible that North Korea  will further develop its long-range ballistic missiles by continuing to repeat similar launches  under the name of “satellite” launches to carry out further technical tests towards bringing its  long-range ballistic missiles to the stage of practical use[39]. Should North Korea make further  progress in its longer-range ballistic missile capability and simultaneously achieve the  miniaturization of nuclear weapons and acquired nuclear warheads, North Korea may come to  have a one-sided understanding that it secured strategic deterrence against the United States.  Should North Korea have a false sense of confidence and recognition regarding its deterrence,  this could lead to increases in and the escalation of military provocations by North Korea in the  region and could create situations that are deeply worrying also for Japan.  In this light, coupled with its nuclear issue, North Korea’s ballistic missile issue has become  more realistic and imminent for Northeast Asia and the international community from the  perspective of both the improvement of the capability and transfer and proliferation, and such  developments are profoundly worrisome.  _See ▶ Fig. I-1-2-2 (Launch of a Missile, which North Korea Called a “Satellite” on December 12, 2012); I-1-2-3_  _(Range of North Korean Ballistic Missiles)_  4 Domestic Affairs  (1) Developments concerning the Kim Jong-un Regime  After the death in 2011 of Kim Jong-il, Chairman of the National Defense Commission, Kim  Jong-un became the de facto head of the military, party and the “state” by assuming the position  of Supreme Commander of the Korean People’s Army, First Secretary of the Korea Workers’  Party and First Chairman of the National Defense Commission by April 2012. The framework  of the Kim Jong-un regime was laid out in a short period of time. Since the transition to the new  regime, there have been a number of announcements of party-related meetings and decisions.  Some analysts point out the “state” is run under the leadership of the party. Meanwhile, Kim  Jong-un, First Chairman of the National Defense Commission, underscores the importance of  military strength and makes frequent visits to military organizations. On such bases, it is  anticipated that the First Chairman will continue to attach importance to military strength.  39 Going forward, it is possible that North Korea will seek out increased reliability of long-range ballistic missiles as well as such technologies as those for protecting a payload from high temperature when it reenters into the atmosphere from higher altitude with high velocity, those for precision guidance, and those for building underground launch sites and silos, which enhance survivability of missiles.",page,206,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24712,"The post-transition years have seen many changes in personnel, especially at high levels of the  military and the cabinet, reportedly aimed at strengthening the power base of First Chairman  Kim Jong-un. Following on from 2012, many personnel reshuffles were carried out from 2013  to June 2014 with the three key military posts, namely, the Director of General Political  Department being replaced once, the Chief of the General Staff being replaced twice, and the  Minister of the People’s Armed Forces being replaced twice. As a result of such reshuffles, all of  the three key military posts have come to be held by individuals selected by First Chairman Kim  Jong-un.  In December 2013, Jang Song-thaek, Vice-Chairman of the National Defense Commission and  First Chairman Kim Jong-un’s uncle, was executed for “plotting to overthrow the state.” It is  believed that by executing Vice-Chairman Jang Song-thaek who was considered to be the  guardian of First Chairman Kim Jong-un, the First Chairman endeavored to strengthen and  consolidate his regime as its sole leader[40].  To date, no disruptions have been caused by such personnel changes, and various “national”  events and Field Guidance by First Chairman Kim Jong-un have been carried out in an orderly  manner. The regime thus appears to be on track to a certain degree. However, the intensification  of competition for loyalty in the wake of the execution of Vice-Chairman Jang Song-thaek,  among other factors, could propel North Korea to turn to military provocative actions without  careful consideration, and uncertainty may have risen. Some also point to the concern over  social control such as the increasing inequality between the rich and the poor and the inflow of  information from abroad – a concern which needs to be monitored from the perspective of  regime stability.  (2) Economic Conditions  In terms of the economy, North Korea has been facing chronic stagnation and energy and food  shortages in recent years due to the vulnerability of its socialist planned economy and shrunken  economic cooperation with the former Soviet Union and East European countries following the  end of the Cold War. In particular, it is deemed that North Korea is still forced to rely on food  assistance from foreign countries[41].  40 The North Korean media repeatedly calls for the strengthening of the “monolithic leadership system” and “single-hearted unity.” For example, an editorial in the Rodong Shinmun dated January 10, 2014 urged the people to stay “cautious even of trivial phenomena and elements which erode our single-hearted unity.” 41 In November 2013, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) forecasted North Korea’s production of principal foods to be 5.98 million tons between November 2013 and October 2014, and estimated the necessary imported",page,207,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24713,"To tackle a host of economic difficulties, North Korea has attempted limited improvement  measures and some changes to its economic management systems [42], and seems to be  implementing economic cooperation projects with other countries, including China. First  Chairman Kim Jong-un continues to frequently emphasize the need to improve the economic  situation and announced the establishment of economic development zones[43]. In addition,  according to reports, a new economic policy is under way to enlarge the discretion of plants and  other entities over production and sales plans. These all suggest North Korea is placing  importance on the rebuilding of the economy. Nonetheless, it is seen unlikely that North Korea  would carry out any structural reforms that could lead to the destabilization of its current  governance system, and thus various challenges confront the fundamental improvement of its  current economic situation.  5 Relations with Other Countries  (1) Relations with the United States  The United States has indicated it would work to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear  program in close cooperation with other countries, aiming to resolve the issue through the  Six-Party Talks. The United States consistently makes its position clear that it is necessary for  North Korea to comply with the 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks and take specific  measures to improve North-South relations before resuming the Six-Party Talks.  In response, North Korea has been criticizing the United States, claiming that its “hostile  policy” towards North Korea and lack of trust between them stand in the way of the peace and  denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and argues that the conclusion of a U.S.-North Korea  peace agreement is necessary to build a relationship of trust[44]. As such, a significant gap has  been observed between the two parties’ stances. Since the U.N. Security Council’s adoption of  Resolution 2087 in January 2013, North Korea, claiming that the “hostile policy” of the United  amount of grains to be approximately 0.34 million tons. 42 For example, North Korea conducted a so-called redenomination (decreasing the denomination of its currency) at the end of 2009. The redenomination is said to have led to economic disorder, such as price escalation due to shortfall of supply, etc., which in turn increased social unrest. 43 During the plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Korea Workers’ Party on March 31, 2013, First Chairman Kim Jong-un instructed the establishment of economic development zones in each province. Pursuant to these instructions, the Economic Development Zone Law was enacted in May of that year. In November 2013, the establishment of 1 special economic zone and 13 economic development zones was announced. 44 For example, during the 20th Ministerial Meeting of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Regional Forum (ARF) held on July 2, 2013, Pak Ui-chun, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, delivered an address, stating, “The U.S. drop of its hostile policy should start from the conclusion of a peace treaty between the U.S. and the DPRK on the basis of the respect for the latter’s sovereignty and halt to all sanctions and military provocations against it.”",page,208,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24714,"States has entered a dangerous state, contends that there can be no denuclearization of the  Korean Peninsula before the denuclearization of the world, and therefore, there will be no more  talks for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while leaving room for dialogue for  ensuring peace and security in the region. The divide between the two parties’ positions has still  not been bridged. In June 2013, North Korea, in the form of an important statement by the  spokesperson of the National Defense Commission, proposed to hold U.S.-North Korea  senior-level talks. However, the United States remained firm on its stance that North Korea must  first take concrete steps to show it is headed towards denuclearization, and the talks have yet to  materialize.  North Korea, further still, reacted sharply to the U.S.-ROK combined exercise, alleging that  such activities were a manifestation of the U.S. “hostile policy” towards North Korea. On the  occasion of the U.S.-ROK combined exercise carried out from March to April 2013, North  Korea launched several ballistic missiles and multiple launch rockets, while criticizing the  United States. Furthermore, North Korea reiterated that it would continue to launch missiles and  strengthen its nuclear deterrent as a right of self-defense.  (2) Relations with the Republic of Korea  Relations between the Republic of Korea (ROK) and North Korea worsened under the  administration of President Lee Myung-bak, spurred by the outbreak of incidents that  heightened North-South military tensions, including the sinking of an ROK patrol vessel in  March 2010[45] and the shelling incident of Yeonpyeong Island in November of the same year[46].  Even after the administration of President Park Geun-hye was inaugurated in February 2013,  North Korea lodged protests against the adoption of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2087 in  January 2013 and U.N. Security Council Resolution 2094 in March 2013, as well as to the  U.S.-ROK combined exercise conducted in March to April. North Korea adopted a hardline  rhetoric, abrogating all agreements on North-South non-aggression[47]. Following the U.S.-ROK  45 On March 26, 2010, the ROK’s naval patrol ship “Cheonan” sank near the Northern Limit Line in the Yellow Sea. In May 2010, a joint military-civilian survey group comprising experts from the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom and Sweden released survey results indicating that the ROK naval ship had split and sank as a result of a shock wave and bubble effect created by the underwater blast of a torpedo fired by a small North Korean submarine. 46 On November 23, 2010, North Korea bombarded Yeonpyeong Island as the ROK military engaged in firing exercises off the coast of the island facing the Yellow Sea, causing deaths and injuries on the ROK side including civilians. 47 In January 2013, North Korea’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea issued a statement saying that if the South “takes direct part in the U.N. ‘sanctions,’ the DPRK will take strong physical counter-measures against it.” Furthermore, in February of the same year, the Rodong Shinmun published an editorial saying, “(if ROK tightens sanctions as a countermeasure against the nuclear test, it) will not be able to avoid deadly retaliation.”",page,209,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

By August, North Korea agreed to  the resumption of the Kaesong Industrial Complex [48] which had de facto suspended its  operations. In addition, North Korea has held dialogues with the ROK, including the  North-South separated family reunion meeting which was held for the first time in three years  and four months in February 2014. However, when the U.S.-ROK combined exercise  commenced at the end of February 2014, North Korea engaged in military provocations,  including intrusion into the ROK’s airspace using small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)[49] and  a large-scale maritime live-fire drill in an area near the northwest islands of the ROK covering  Baengnyeong Island and Yeonpyeong Island[50].  Meanwhile, there have been developments in recent years towards ROK-China cooperation not  only in the economic realm but also in the political and diplomatic realms. Under such  circumstances, Japan needs to pay attention to what policies are adopted for the ROK by North  Korea, which has heretofore repeated dialogue and provocations.  (3) Relations with China  The China-North Korea Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, which was  concluded in 1961, is still in force[51]. Currently, China is North Korea’s biggest trade partner,  and the bilateral trade volume set a record again in 2013. In 2013, trade with China accounted  for approximately 80% of North Korea’s total trade, and observers point out North Korea’s  increasing dependence on China. Furthermore, it appears the two countries are undertaking port  and commercial facility construction projects, as demonstrated by the promotion of joint  48 In April 2013, North Korea prohibited ROK nationals from entering the Kaesong Industrial Complex (located in the city of Kaesong in southwest North Korea, close to the military demarcation line with the ROK; many ROK companies operate businesses by employing North Korean workers), which commenced operations in 2004 as a North-South economic cooperation project; subsequently, North Korea withdrew all North Korean workers and announced the temporary suspension of the project. In May 2013, all personnel from the ROK also withdrew from the Complex. 49 On March 24, March 31, and April 6, 2014, crashed UAVs were discovered in Paju, Baengnyeong Island, and Samcheok, respectively. In May of the same year, the ROK Ministry of National Defense announced that a scientific study confirmed that the UAVs originated from North Korea and that the flights were clear military provocations in violation of the ceasefire agreement and North-South non-aggression agreement. North Korea criticized the ROK for fabricating the incidents, and asserts that the facts should be uncovered through a ROK-North Korea joint study. 50 According to an announcement by the ROK Ministry of National Defense, on March 31, 2014, North Korea fired roughly 500 rounds using its multiple launch rockets and artillery pieces, of which about 100 landed in the ROK’s sea area south of the Northern Limit Line (NLL). The ROK government issued an evacuation order to people living near Baengnyeong Island and other areas, and returned fire with about 300 rounds. No damages in the ROK were reported. 51 It includes a provision that if either of the signatories (China and North Korea) is attacked and enters into a state of war, the other would make every effort to immediately provide military and other assistance.",page,210,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24716,"development and joint management projects in the Rason Economic and Trade Zone and the  Hwanggumphyong-Wihwado Economic Zone since June 2011.  With regard to the situation in North Korea and its nuclear issue, China has expressed support  for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and early resumption of the Six-Party Talks. In  addition, China endorsed U.N. Security Council Resolutions 2087 and 2094. Following the  adoption of the two resolutions, China issued notices in February and April 2013, stating that  China would thoroughly enforce the embargo of items set forth in both resolutions. In  September 2013, China released a list of supplies and technologies banned for export to North  Korea that could be diverted to WMD programs. Through such measures, China has  demonstrated commitment to executing the sanctions resolutions against North Korea.  Meanwhile, China seems intent on maintaining friendly and cooperative relations with North  Korea, holding a China-North Korea strategic dialogue among diplomatic authorities in June  2013 and dispatching Li Yuanchao, Vice President, to a North Korean event commemorating the  60th anniversary of the Korean War armistice.  China is a vital political and economic partner for North Korea and maintains a degree of  influence on North Korea. On the other hand, North Korea does not necessarily adopt actions  which are in line with the position of China over nuclear and ballistic missile issues.  Furthermore, Jang Song-thaek, Vice-Chairman of the National Defense Commission, who  played a key role in economic cooperation with China was executed. Given such circumstances,  North Korea-China relations and China’s influence on North Korea must continue to be  monitored.  (4) Relations with Russia  While North Korea and Russia became estranged with the end of the Cold War, they signed the  Russia-North Korea Treaty on Neighborly Friendship and Cooperation in 2000[52]. In August  2011, Kim Jong-il, then Chairman of the National Defense Commission, visited Russia. A  Russia-North Korea summit was held for the first time in nine years, and the two sides agreed to  cooperate on a gas-pipeline project, among other matters. In September 2012, after the transition  to the Kim Jong-un regime, the two countries signed an agreement that writes off 90% of the  debt owed to Russia by North Korea, and in such ways, friendly relations have been maintained  52 The previous treaty (Soviet-North Korea Friendship and Mutual Assistance Treaty) had contained the provision that if either of the signatories (Russia and North Korea) is attacked, the other would immediately provide military and other assistance by any means available. This provision, however, was dropped from the new treaty.",page,211,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

Furthermore, in September 2013, a railway opened for service  connecting Khasan, a coastal area in the Russian Far East, and Rajin Port in northeastern North  Korea.  Concerning North Korea’s nuclear issue, Russia, along with China, has expressed support for  the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and early resumption of the Six-Party Talks. After  the nuclear test conducted by North Korea in February 2013, Russia issued a statement that  condemned the test but expressed that it was against sanctions that could influence normal trade  and economic relations with North Korea.  (5) Relations with the Other Countries  Since 1999, North Korea has made efforts to establish relations with a series of West European  countries and others, including the establishment of diplomatic relations with European  countries[53] and participation in the ARF (ASEAN Regional Forum) ministerial meetings.  Meanwhile, it has been reported that North Korea has cooperative relationships with countries  such as Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Myanmar and Cuba in military affairs including arms trade and  military technology transfer. In April 2013, North Korea’s attempt to export gas masks and other  items to Syria was intercepted by Turkish authorities. In July of the same year, the North Korean  vessel Chong Chon Gang sailing from Cuba to North Korea was seized by Panamanian  authorities near the Panama Canal. As a result, contents of cargo that violated U.N. sanctions  resolutions were confiscated, including MiG-21 fighters and a surface-to-air missile system.  **2 The Republic of Korea and the U.S. Forces in the ROK**  1 General Situation  In the ROK, the administration of Park Geun-hye was inaugurated in February 2013. The Park  administration maintains that forging trust through dialogue is most critical for improving the  North-South relations. With regard to the nuclear issue, the administration sets out that North  Korea’s nuclear development can never be tolerated and that the ROK will address this issue in  concert with the international community. In August 2013, the ROK unveiled a policy called the  “Trust-Building Process on the Korean Peninsula,” which aims to realize denuclearization by  building trust through efforts, including humanitarian initiatives and North-South exchanges.  The ROK states that it would make a decisive response to military provocations by North Korea  and emphasizes the importance of building a solid posture to deter and address the threat of  North Korea.  53 For example, the United Kingdom and Germany established diplomatic relations with North Korea in 2000 and 2001, respectively.",page,212,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24718,"U.S. forces, mainly the Army, have been stationed in the ROK since the ceasefire of the Korean  War. The ROK has established very close security arrangements with the United States  primarily based on the U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty. The U.S. forces stationed in the ROK  have been playing a vital role in deterring the outbreak of large-scale armed conflicts on the  Korean Peninsula. The two countries are now making a shift to a new joint defense system of  “the ROK forces leading and the U.S. forces supporting” through the transition of the wartime  operational control (OPCON) to the ROK[54]. The way in which this system will be developed  based on the present-day situation in the Korean Peninsula will need to be monitored.  2 Defense Policies and Defense Reform of the ROK  The ROK has a defensive weakness, namely, its capital Seoul, where a quarter of the country’s  population is concentrated, is situated close to the DMZ. The ROK has set the National Defense  Objective as follows: “to protect the country from external military threats and invasions, to  support peaceful unification, and to contribute to regional stability and world peace.” As one of  the “external military threats,” the ROK, in its Defense White Paper, used to designate North  Korea as the “main enemy.” However, the ROK presently uses the expression, “the North  Korean regime and its armed forces…are our enemies”[55].  In 2005, the ROK Ministry of National Defense announced the “National Defense Reform  Basic Plan 2006-2020” for “the restructuring of the military from its current quantitative,  conventional form centered on troops to a qualitative, high-tech military force structure that is  information and technology-intensive[56].” In 2009, in light of the changes in the situation, such  as the missile launches and nuclear test by North Korea, the Defense Reform Basic Plan  2009-2020 was announced. The Basic Plan identified, among other measures, the scaling down  of the initially planned reduction in the force strength and the possibility of preemptive strikes  54 The United States and the ROK have been operating the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces Command since 1978 in order to run the U.S.-ROK combined defense system to deter wars on the Korean Peninsula and to perform effective combined operations in the case of emergency. Under the U.S.-ROK combined defense system, the operational control authority over the ROK forces is to be exercised by Chairman of the Korea Joint Chiefs of Staff in peacetime and by Commander of the U.S. Forces Korea, who also serves as Commander of the Combined Forces Command, in wartime. 55 The ROK Defense White Paper 2012 described North Korea as follows: “North Korea poses a serious threat to our security by developing and increasing its large scale conventional military power, its nuclear program, missiles, and other weapons of mass destruction, and by continually perpetrating acts of armed provocation such as the attack on the ROK Ship Cheonan and the shelling of Yeonpyeongdo (island). As long as these threats persist, the North Korean regime and its armed forces, which are the entities who pose these threats, are our enemies.” 56 An act on national defense passed in 2006 obliges revision and supplementation of the National Defense Reform Basic Plan based on an analysis and assessment of the changes in conditions and the performance of national defense reform.",page,213,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24719,"against North Korean nuclear and missile facilities. Meanwhile, in response to the sinking of the  ROK patrol ship and the artillery shelling on Yeonpyeong Island in 2010, in August 2012, the  ROK Ministry of National Defense released the Defense Reform Basic Plan 2012-2030,  incorporating the enhancement of deterrence against North Korea and further streamlining of  the military[57]. In March 2014, the Park Geun-hye administration unveiled the Defense Reform  Basic Plan 2014-2030, which envisions long-term defense force enhancements for dealing with  potential threats following the unification of the Korean Peninsula, while maintaining a  readiness posture against North Korean threats[58].  3 Military Posture of the ROK  The ROK’s military capacity is as follows. The ground forces consist of 22 army divisions and  two marine divisions, totaling 550,000 personnel; the naval forces consist of about 190 vessels  with a total displacement of approximately 195,000 tons; and the air forces (Air Force and Navy  combined) consist of approximately 620 combat aircraft.  In recent years, the ROK has been focused on modernizing its Navy and Air Force in particular  in order to establish a system of omnidirectional military posture to deal with all types of threats,  not least threats from North Korea. The Navy has been introducing submarines, large transport  ships and domestically built destroyers. In February 2010, the first mobile force in the ROK was  created[59]. In April 2012, the Air Force completed the introduction of F-15K fighters which had  been implemented since 2002. The Air Force is currently promoting a program for the  installation of the F-35 as a next-generation fighter with stealth capabilities.  In October 2012, the ROK government announced a revision of its missile guidelines stipulating  the range of ballistic missiles it possesses; the revision includes the extension of their maximum  range from 300km to 800km to enhance the deterrence against military provocation by North  Korea. In addition, in response to North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats, the ROK intends to  57 In order to reorganize the ROK armed forces into a structure tailored to the operational environment of the Korean Peninsula, the ROK Ministry of National Defense intends to greatly enhance its operational capability in the northwestern offshore island region, reorganize the upper command structure in preparation for the transition of the wartime OPCON, gradually promote troop reduction and reorganization, and greatly expand capabilities to handle missile and cyber warfare. Moreover, in order to build a highly efficient and advanced defense structure, it will promote streamlining, reorganize the human resource management system, and improve the military’s welfare and service environment. 58 In order to secure capabilities for responding to existing and potential threats, the ROK Ministry of National Defense plans to install three additional Aegis vessels, enhance the military power of next-generation destroyers and submarines, and install mid- and high-altitude unmanned reconnaissance aircraft and multi-functional satellites. 59 The primary missions of the Seventh Mobile Corps, which is the first mobile force established in the ROK, are described as the protection of sea lanes, deterrence against North Korea and support for the government’s external policies.",page,214,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24720,"work on expansion of its missile capabilities[60], construction of systems to execute its missile  capabilities[61], promotion of the development of a missile-defense system[62], etc.  In recent years, the ROK is actively promoting equipment export, which reached 3.4 billion  dollars in 2013. It is reported that export items have become diverse to include communication  electronics and naval vessels.  The FY2014 defense budget (main budget) amounts to approximately 35.7057 trillion won, an  increase of approximately 3.5% over the previous fiscal year, marking the 15th consecutive rise  since FY2000.  _See ▶ Fig. I-1-2-4 (Change in the ROK’s Defense Budget)_  4 U.S.-ROK Alliance/U.S. Forces in the ROK  The United States and the ROK have implemented various efforts to deepen the U.S.-ROK  alliance in recent years. At the U.S.-ROK Summit Meeting in June 2009, an agreement was  reached on the “Joint Vision for the Alliance of the United States of America and the Republic  of Korea” that includes an evolution into “a comprehensive strategic alliance” to expand the  scope of the alliance globally beyond the Korean Peninsula and widen the partnership of the two  countries to non-military areas. Furthermore, the 42nd ROK-U.S. Security Consultative  Meeting (SCM) in October 2010 announced a joint communiqué incorporating the Guidelines  for U.S.-ROK Defense Cooperation to embody the future vision of the U.S.-ROK Alliance,  which shows a further strengthening of the bilateral relationship. In March 2013, the two  countries signed the ROK-U.S. Counter-Provocation Plan for dealing with North Korea’s  60 In April 2012, the ROK Ministry of National Defense announced that the country has developed and already fielded missiles that include cruise missiles able to strike throughout North Korea. In February 2013, the ministry indicated that it would accelerate the development of 800km-range ballistic missiles, possession of which was made possible by the revision of the missile guidelines in October 2012, and announced that it has fielded cruise missiles to be launched from vessels or submarines and capable of attacking the entire area of North Korea. Also in October, during an event commemorating the 65th anniversary of the founding of the armed forces, the ROK armed forces displayed to the public for the first time the Hyeonmu 2 ballistic missile, which is said to have a 300km range, and the Hyeonmu 3 surface-to-surface cruise missile, which is said to have a 1,000km range. In April 2014, the ROK conducted a successful test launch of a new ballistic missile with a range of 500km. 61 The ROK Ministry of National Defense calls the system “Kill Chain” and explains that the system is capable of detecting and identifying signs of missile launch, determining attack, and actual attacking instantaneously. 62 In December 2006, the ROK indicated promotion of its own missile defense system (Korea Air and Missile Defense: KAMD). It is reported that the ROK is advancing the construction of the system to be completed by around 2015. Meanwhile, the ROK Ministry of National Defense denies the participation in the U.S. missile defense system and stresses that it would build its own system, reportedly because the United States and the ROK understand threats differently.",page,215,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24721,"provocations[63]. Furthermore, at the U.S.-ROK Summit Meeting in May 2013, a joint declaration  was released to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the conclusion of the United  States-Republic of Korea Mutual Defense Treaty, in which the two countries affirmed that they  would continue to strengthen their alliance in order to deal with 21st century security challenges.  At the 45th SCM in October of the same year, both countries approved the Tailored Deterrence  Strategy, a strategy designed to enhance deterrence against North Korean nuclear and other  WMD threats[64].  In addition, the two countries have been working to solve issues such as realignment of the U.S.  forces stationed in the ROK and transition of wartime OPCON to the ROK. However, as for the  realignment of the U.S. forces in the ROK, although the relocation of U.S. forces Camp  Yongsan located in the center of Seoul to the Pyongtek area, south of Seoul, and the relocation  of U.S. forces stationed in the northern side of Han Gang to the southern side of the river had  been agreed upon in 2003, there seems to be delays in the relocation to the Pyongtek area[65]. For  the transition of the wartime OPCON to the ROK[66] scheduled on December 1, 2015, the  U.S.-ROK Strategic Alliance 2015, which provides the framework for the transition of the  wartime OPCON, was signed in October 2010. Nevertheless, given the increasing seriousness  of North Korean nuclear and missile threats, among other factors, the two sides have decided to  continue talks on the conditions and timing of the transition. After the completion of the  realignment of the U.S. forces in the ROK and the transition of the wartime OPCON, defense of  the ROK will change from “the U.S.-ROK joint defense system” to the new joint defense  system of “the ROK forces leading and the U.S. forces supporting,” which could have a  significant impact on the nature of the U.S. forces in the ROK. As such, these developments will  need to be followed.  63 The ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff has announced that the plan contains consultative procedures as well as robust and thorough response methodologies for the United States and the ROK to take joint responses in the event of a North Korean provocation. However, the details of the plan have not been made public. 64 According to the Joint Communiqué of the 45th ROK-U.S. SCM, this strategy establishes a strategic framework for tailoring deterrence against key North Korean threat scenarios across armistice and wartime, and strengthens the partnership between the United States and the ROK. However, the details have not been made public. 65 The United States is proceeding with the realignment of its forces stationed in the ROK in line with the June 2003 agreement to relocate its forces to the southern side of Han Gang in two stages and the October 2004 agreement to cut the number of its forces stationed in the ROK by 12,500 from approximately 37,500. However, the two countries agreed at the summit meeting in April 2008 to maintain the current strength of 28,500 as the appropriate level. 66 In 2007, the United States and the ROK agreed to dismantle the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces Command and complete the transition of the wartime OPCON in April 2012. Later in June 2010, however, agreement was reached to postpone the transition to December 1, 2015 for various reasons, including the increasing military threat posed by North Korea.",page,216,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24722,"5 Relations with Other Countries  (1) Relations with China  China and the ROK have been working to strengthen their relations. At the May 2008  China-ROK Summit Meeting, the two countries agreed to upgrade the China-ROK relationship  from a “full-scale cooperative partnership” to a “strategic cooperative partnership.” Following  the inauguration of the Park Geun-hye government, in June 2013, President Park held a summit  meeting with President Xi Jinping during her visit to China, and the two sides announced the  Joint Statement on the Korea-China Future Vision. At the working-level, also in June, the  Chairman of the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff visited China for the first time in six years. Further,  in December 2013, the first China-ROK Dialogue on Diplomacy and Security was held between  the directors-general of the foreign and defense ministries of the two countries, and the two  sides agreed to hold the dialogue regularly. In July 2014, President Xi Jinping paid a state visit  to the ROK and released a joint statement in which agreement was reached on items, including  promoting bilateral dialogue in the areas of politics and security and realizing the  denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  Meanwhile, the “East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone” (ADIZ) issued by China in  November 2013 overlapped in some areas with the ROK’s ADIZ, and furthermore, included the  airspace above the sea areas surrounding the reef, Ieodo (Chinese name: Suyan Rock), regarding  which China and the ROK have conflicting claims to the jurisdictional authority over the  exclusive economic zone. Against this backdrop, the ROK government announced the  expansion of its own ADIZ in December 2013 and enforced it from the same month.  (2) Relations with Russia  Military exchanges have been under way between the ROK and Russia in recent years,  including exchanges among high-ranking military officials. The two countries have also agreed  on cooperation in the areas of military technology, defense industry and military supplies. At the  ROK-Russia Summit in September 2008, they agreed to upgrade the bilateral relations to a  “strategic cooperative partnership.” In March 2012, the two countries held the first ROK-Russia  defense strategic dialogue and agreed to regularize the dialogue. In November 2013, President  Vladimir Putin visited the ROK, and a joint statement was issued in which the two sides agreed  to strengthen dialogue in the areas of politics and security.  (3) Overseas Activities  Since its dispatch of an engineering unit to Somalia in 1993, the ROK has participated in a  number of U.N. peacekeeping operations (PKO).

In July 2010, the ROK created the “International Peace Support Force,” a special unit  for overseas dispatch. Since March 2013, the ROK has dispatched troops composed primarily of  engineering units to the United Nations Mission in the Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS).  The ROK has sent troops to Afghanistan for the purpose of protecting Korean members of the  Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT). Further, the ROK has dispatched naval vessels to off the  coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden where they have been engaged in the protection of  ROK-registered ships and maritime security operations (MSO) of the Combined Maritime  Forces (CMF). Since January 2011, the ROK has dis- patched a ROK special forces unit for the  purpose of supporting the training of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) special forces units, joint  exercises, and protecting ROK citizens in emergency situations. Additionally, in December 2013,  the ROK dispatched a disaster recovery support unit consisting of approximately 500 personnel,  including engineering unit and medical personnel, to the Philippines in the wake of its typhoon  disaster.  67 The ROK intends to further improve the legal and institutional foundations for the ROK armed forces to expand their participation in PKO activities.

24730,"(approximately 88.1 billion yuan)[11] compared to the initial budget amount for the previous  fiscal year. This shows that the Chinese national defense budget continues to increase at a rapid  pace [12] . The nominal size of China’s announced national defense budget has grown  approximately 40-fold over the past 26 years and almost quadrupled in size over the past ten  years. China positions the buildup of defense capabilities as important a task as economic  development, and it is believed that China is continuing to invest resources in the improvement  of its defense capabilities in tandem with its economic development.  the 2014 QDR states  In addition, it must be noted that the amount of the defense budget announced by China is  considered to be only a part of its actual military expenditures[13]. For example, it is believed that  the announced defense budget does not include all the equipment procurement costs and  research and development expenses.  The United States has been expressing its stance to emphasize the Asia- Pacific region not only to its allies and partners but also to China. The 2014 QDR states that the United States is  buildin  g a sustained and substantive dialogue with China to improve the ability to cooperate in concrete, practical areas such as counter  -   piracy, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. At the same time, the United States will manage the compet itive aspects of China  -  U.S. relations in ways that improve regional peace and stability consistent with international norms and principles.  3 Nuclear Strategy While U.S. President Obama aims to realize a world without nuclear weapons, he notes that this w ill not be realized in the near future, and indicates the need to maintain a nuclear deterrent as long as nuclear weapons exist.  The Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), which was released in April 2010, indicates that the nuclear security environment is changin g and nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation are an imminent threat today. Furthermore, it points to the necessity of working on the issue of ensuring strategic stability with existing nuclear powers, in particular Russia and China. establish a rotational presence of up to a 2,500-person Marine Air -   Ground Task Force including aircraft, ground vehicles, and artilleries over a few years.

China’s National Defense in 2002 explains, “Under the command of military organs, the militia in wartime helps the standing army in its military operations, conducts independent operations and provides combat support and manpower replenishment for the standing army. In peacetime, it undertakes the tasks of performing combat readiness support, taking part in disaster relief efforts, and maintaining social order.” According to Jiefangjun Bao, the official daily publication of the PLA, dated October 9, 2012, “China now has 6 million primary militia members” as of 2010. 16 Formally, there are two Central Military Commissions—one for the CCP and another for the state.

With regard  to its activity in the sea areas and airspace surrounding Japan, Chinese naval vessels[29] and navy  and air force aircraft have been observed conducting training exercises of some kind, such as  carrier-based helicopter flights and fleet formation and maneuver exercises, as well as  information gathering activities. A large number of Chinese government ships and aircraft  belonging to maritime law-enforcement agencies [30] have also been observed, which were  engaged in monitoring activities for the protection of its maritime rights and interests[31]. Such  activities by China include those that involve incursion into Japan’s territorial waters, violation  of Japan’s airspace, and dangerous acts that could cause unintended consequences, including a  Chinese vessel’s direction of a fire control radar at a JMSDF destroyer, the flight of fighters  abnormally close to JSDF aircraft, and activities that could infringe upon the freedom of  overflight over the high seas, such as the establishment of the “East China Sea Air Defense  Identification Zone,” and are extremely regrettable. China is urged to accept and comply with  international norms.  (2) Situation of Activities in Japan’s Surrounding Sea Areas  Regarding the activities of naval forces, the number of Chinese naval surface vessels advancing  to the Pacific Ocean has increased in recent years, and such advancements are currently  conducted routinely. Every year since 2008, Chinese naval fleets have been passing the sea area  between the main island of Okinawa and Miyako Island. However, in April 2012, a naval fleet  passed the Osumi Strait eastward for the first time, and in October of the same year, they  29 Examples of the activities of Chinese naval vessels are: a submerged Chinese nuclear-powered submarine navigated in Japan’s territorial waters, breaching international law in November 2004; it was confirmed that a total of five Chinese naval vessels, including one Sovremenny-class destroyer, were sailing near the Kashi gas field (Tianwaitian in Chinese) in the East China Sea and some of them circled around said gas field in September 2005; a Chinese Song-class submarine surfaced in the vicinity of the U.S. aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk in international waters reportedly near Okinawa in October 2006. The foreign submarine’s approach to a U.S. aircraft carrier is a noteworthy military incident. 30 Surveillance and other activities in the seas used to be conducted by “Haijing” of the Ministry of Public Security, “Haijian” of the State Oceanic Administration of the Ministry of Land and Resources, “Yuzheng” of the Bureau of Fisheries of the Ministry of Agriculture, “Haixun” of the Maritime Safety Administration of the Ministry of Transport, and the maritime anti-smuggling force of the General Administration of Customs, all of which were under the State Council. In March 2013, China decided to reorganize the four agencies, excluding “Haixun,” into the new State Oceanic Administration and that the new organization would carry out surveillance and other activities under the name of “China Coast Guard” under the guidance of the Ministry of Public Security. In July of that year, the China Coast Guard was formally launched. It is believed that the State Committee of Border and Coastal Defense, under the guidance of the State Council and the Central Military Commission, is coordinating maritime activities by these maritime law-enforcement agencies and the Navy. In January 2013, it was reported that China plans to build 36 maritime law enforcement ships within the next five years. 31 Concerning the PLA, there is a view that by turning exception into normality through uniform peacetime and wartime force deployment and exceeding traditional activity spaces, China intends to desensitize the alertness of others and make the international community tolerate and accept changes in the situation.

24737,"navigated the sea area between Yonakuni Island and Nakanokami Island near Iriomote Island  northward for the first time. In July 2013, Chinese naval fleets passed the Soya Strait eastward  for the first time. As such, the Chinese naval fleets’ advancement and homing routes between  the East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean continue to become diverse by incorporating the areas  north of Japan, and it is understood that China seeks to improve its deployment capabilities to  the open ocean. Furthermore, in October 2013, China reportedly conducted “Maneuver 5,” the  first joint exercise by its three naval fleets in the western Pacific Ocean.  In addition, Chinese naval vessels appear to routinely conduct operations in the East China Sea[32].  After referring to its own position regarding the Senkaku Islands, China alleges that patrols by  Chinese naval vessels in the sea areas under its jurisdiction are completely justifiable and lawful.  In January 2013, a Chinese naval vessel directed fire-control radar at a JMSDF destroyer and is  suspected to have directed fire-control radar at a helicopter based on the JMSDF destroyer.  With regard to the activities of Chinese government vessels, in December 2008, “Haijian”  vessels belonging to the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) of the Ministry of Land and  Resources of China hovered and drifted inside Japan’s territorial waters near the Senkaku  Islands – operations which are not permitted under international law. Subsequently, in August  2011 as well as in March and July 2012, “Haijian” vessels and “Yuzheng” vessels belonging to  (then) Bureau of Fisheries of the Ministry of Agriculture of China intruded into Japan’s  aforementioned territorial waters[33]. As these examples demonstrate, “Haijian” and “Yuzheng”  vessels have gradually intensified their activities in Japan’s territorial waters in recent years.  Such activities intensified considerably and Chinese government vessels began to intrude into  the aforementioned territorial waters intermittently after September 2012, when the Japanese  government acquired property rights to and ownership of three of the Senkaku Islands (Uotsuri  Island, Kitakojima Island, and Minamikojima Island). In April and September 2013, eight  Chinese government vessels intruded into the aforementioned territorial waters simultaneously.  In September 2010, Japan Coast Guard patrol vessels and a Chinese fishing trawler collided in  Japan’s territorial sea surrounding the Senkaku Islands.  In October 2012, vessels of the East Sea Fleet of the Chinese Navy and “Haijian” and  32 For example, a PLA Daily article dated February 19, 2014 reported that in recent years, the average number of days in a year that a unit in the East Sea Fleet of the Chinese Navy conducted operations exceeded 190 days. 33 In February 2012, a survey vessel of the Japan Coast Guard conducting a marine survey in Japan’s exclusive economic zone was demanded to stop the activity by two “Haijian” ships that belong to the SOA. Similar incidents occurred in May and September 2010.",page,232,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24738,"“Yuzheng” vessels conducted a joint exercise with a focus on maintaining and defending  China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime interests. Furthermore, the Navy is believed to be  supporting maritime law enforcement agencies both in terms of operation and equipment,  including handing over retired Navy vessels to the China Coast Guard[34] that was formally  launched in July 2013.  _See Fig. I-1-3-4 (Recent Chinese Activities in Waters near Japan)_  (3) Situation of Activities in Japan’s Surrounding Airspace  In recent years, activities by Chinese naval and air force aircraft, which appear to be activities  for gathering information about Japan of some form, have been observed frequently. The  number of scrambles by the JASDF against Chinese aircraft is also increasing dramatically.  With regard to the activities of air forces in the airspace above the East China Sea, Chinese  aircraft have been diversifying their flight patterns. In September 2007, multiple H-6 bombers  flew into Japan’s Air Defense Identification Zone above the East China Sea and advanced near  the Japan-China median line. Similarly, in March 2010, a Y-8 early warning aircraft advanced  near the Japan-China median line. In March 2011, a Y-8 patrol aircraft and Y-8 intelligence  gathering aircraft crossed the Japan-China median line and approached within approximately  50km of Japan’s airspace near the Senkaku Islands. In 2012, China intensified the activities of  its aircraft, including fighters. In January 2013, the Chinese Ministry of National Defense made  public the fact that Chinese military aircraft regularly conducted warning and surveillance  activities and that Chinese fighters conducted activities believed to be Combat Air Patrols  (CAP) in the East China Sea. In addition, in the most recent Chinese defense white paper, the  phrase “air vigilance and patrols at sea” was added for the first time ever.  On November 16 and 17, 2013, a Tu-154 intelligence gathering aircraft flew over the East  China Sea on two consecutive days. On November 23, the Chinese government announced that  it established “the East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ)” including the  Senkaku Islands which China described as if they were a part of China’s “territory,” that it  obligated aircraft flying in the said zone to abide by the rules set forth by the Chinese Ministry  of National Defense, and that the Chinese Armed Forces would take “defensive emergency  measures” in the case where such aircraft does not follow the instructed procedures. Japan is  deeply concerned about such measures, which are profoundly dangerous acts that unilaterally  change the status quo in the East China Sea, escalating the situation, and that may cause  unintended consequences in the East China Sea. Furthermore, the measures unduly infringe the  34 See Part I, Chapter 1, Section 3, footnote 28",page,233,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24739,"freedom of overflight over the high seas, which is the general principle of international law.  Japan is demanding China to revoke any measures that could infringe upon the freedom of  overflight over the high seas. The United States, the Republic of Korea, Australia, and the  European Union (EU) have expressed concern about China’s establishment of such zone.  On the very day that China announced the establishment of the East China Sea ADIZ, a Tu-154  intelligence gathering aircraft and a Y-8 intelligence gathering aircraft flew over the East China  Sea, respectively. On the same day, the Chinese Air Force announced that it conducted its first  patrol flight since the establishment of the ADIZ. Subsequently, the Chinese Armed Forces  announced on November 28 that its KJ-2000 Airborne Early Warning and Control system and  Su-30 and J-11 fighters conducted patrol flights in the ADIZ, and announced on the following  day that its Su-30 and J-11 fighters scrambled. On December 26, 2013, the Chinese Armed  Forces announced that in the one month that passed since the establishment of the ADIZ, a total  of 87 reconnaissance aircraft, early warning aircraft and fighters were mobilized to the relevant  airspace.  In March and April 2011 and in April 2012, Chinese helicopters, etc. that appeared to belong to  the SOA flew close to JMSDF destroyers which were engaged in monitoring and surveillance in  the East China Sea[35]. Further still, in May and June 2014, two Su-27 fighters of China flew  abnormally close to the aircraft of JMSDF and JASDF that were conducting routine monitoring  and surveillance activities in the East China Sea. The Chinese Ministry of National Defense  announced that JSDF aircraft conducted dangerous acts against Chinese aircraft. However, the  operations of JSDF aircraft were legitimate activities in compliance with the international law.  There is no truth to the Chinese assertion that JSDF aircraft carried out dangerous acts.  With respect to air forces’ advancement into the Pacific Ocean, it was confirmed for the first  time by the JASDF’s scrambling fighters that a Y-8 early warning aircraft and a H-6 bomber  flew through the airspace between the main island of Okinawa and Miyako Island and advanced  to the Pacific Ocean in July and September 2013, respectively. Similar flights were conducted  by two Y-8 early warning aircraft and two H-6 bombers (total: four aircrafts) on three  35 On March 7 of the same year, 2011, a Chinese Z-9 helicopter believed to belong to the SOA flew as close as approximately 70m and as low as approximately 40m above the water around the Japanese destroyer Samidare, which was patrolling the waters in the central area of the East China Sea. On March 26, a Z-9 helicopter flew again as close as approximately 90m and as low as approximately 60m above the water around the destroyer Isoyuki. Furthermore, on April 1, a Y-12 aircraft which was believed to belong to the SOA flew as close as approximately 90m and as low as approximately 60m above the water around Isoyuki. On April 12, 2012, a Y-12 aircraft, which was believed to belong to the SOA, flew as close as approximately 50m and as low as approximately 50m above the water around the destroyer Asayuki.",page,234,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

As such activities demonstrate, China  has been further intensifying the activities of its aircraft, including fighters.  Regarding Japan’s airspace over and around the Senkaku Islands, in December 2012, a  fixed-wing aircraft belonging to the SOA violated the territorial airspace first as a Chinese  aircraft. Since then, fixed-wing aircraft belonging to the SOA have been frequently observed  flying near the airspace.  _See_ -  Fig. I-1-3-5 (Recent Chinese Activities in Airspace near Japan); I-1-3-6 (Change in the Number of Scrambles  _against Chinese Aircraft_  (4) Situation of Activities in the South China Sea and Indian Ocean  China has also been intensifying its activities in the South China Sea, including waters around  the Spratly Islands and the Parcel Islands, over which territorial disputes exist with neighbors,  including some ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member states. In March  2009, Chinese ships, including a naval vessel, a maritime research ship of the SOA, a Bureau of  Maritime Fisheries’ patrol ship, and trawlers, approached a U.S. Navy acoustic research ship  operating in the South China Sea to obstruct its operations. In addition, in December 2013, a  Chinese naval vessel cut across the bow of a U.S. Navy cruiser operating in the South China Sea  at point blank range. It is also reported that Chinese naval vessels fired warning shots at fishing  boats of neighboring countries. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been growing friction  between China and its neighboring countries over the South China Sea, as illustrated by protests  by Vietnam and the Philippines against China’s activities in these waters.  _See_ -  Part I, Chapter 1, Section 5 (Southeast Asia)  Additionally, Chinese naval vessels have advanced into the Indian Ocean. Since December 2008,  Chinese naval vessels have been navigating in the Indian Ocean and advanced into the coast of  Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden to take part in international anti-piracy efforts. In 2010 and  2013, a Chinese Navy’s hospital ship carried out “Mission Harmony,” a medical service mission,  to assist countries, including countries off the coast of the Indian Ocean. Furthermore, from the  end of 2013 to the beginning of 2014, a Chinese naval nuclear submarine reportedly advanced  into the Indian Ocean and conducted operations off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.  In the same year, a Chinese naval vessel is said to have advanced into the Indian Ocean from the  Sunda Strait and conducted trainings. As such examples demonstrate, the Chinese Navy has  improved its capacity to execute operations in more distant waters, including the Indian Ocean.",page,235,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24741,"(5) Objectives of Maritime Activities  Taking into consideration such factors as the situation of the development of Chinese naval and  air forces, situation of activities in sea areas and airspace, statements in defense white papers,  China’s geographical location and economic globalization, the maritime activities of the  Chinese Navy, Air Force and other organizations are considered to have the following  objectives.  The first one is to intercept operations by enemies in waters and airspace as far as possible from  China in order to defend its territory, territorial waters and territorial airspace. Behind this  objective is an increase in effectiveness of long-range attacks due to recent progress in science  and technology.  The second one is to develop military capabilities to deter and prevent Taiwan’s independence.  For example, China maintains that it will not allow any foreign intervention in solving the  Taiwan issue and realizing the unification of China. In order for China to try to prevent foreign  intervention into Taiwan surrounded by the sea in all directions through China’s use of force, it  needs to enhance its military operational capabilities at sea and airspace.  The third one is to weaken the control of other countries over the islands to which China claims  territorial sovereignty, while strengthening the claim of its territorial sovereignty, through  various surveillance activities and use of force in the seas and air space surrounding the islands.  The fourth one is to acquire, maintain, and protect its maritime rights and interests. China is  engaged in oil and gas drilling as well as building facilities and surveying for the drilling in the  East China Sea and South China Sea[36].  The fifth one is to defend its sea lanes of communications. In the background is the fact that its  sea lanes of communications, including its crude oil transportation routes from the Middle East,  are extremely important for the globalizing Chinese economy. The question of which parts of its  sea lanes of communication the Chinese Navy deems it should defend depends on such factors  as the international situation at the time. However, given the recent strengthening of the Chinese  Navy and Air Force, it is believed that the Chinese Navy and Air Force will develop a capacity  36 With regard to resource development in the East China Sea, in September 2010, China unilaterally announced postponement of the negotiation to conclude an international agreement with Japan for implementing the June 2008 agreement. While the negotiation has not been resumed yet, it is pointed out that China is highly likely carrying out gas production in the Kashi gas field (Tianwaitian in Chinese) and elsewhere. Meanwhile, China’s State Oceanic Administration announced that the “Haiyangshiyou 981,” an oil-drilling rig, succeeded in its first drilling in the South China Sea in May 2012.",page,236,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24742,"to defend areas going beyond the waters near China.  Given these objectives and recent trends in China’s activities in sea areas and airspace, it is  believed that China plans to further expand the sphere of its maritime activities, and further  intensify its operations in waters surrounding Japan, including the East China Sea and the  Pacific Ocean, as well as the South China Sea and the airspaces over these seas areas. Therefore,  more attention needs to be paid to activities such as operations of naval vessels as well as Navy  and Air Force aircraft, various surveillance operations near Japan, developments of facilities that  serve as bases for these activities[37], and evolution of China’s interpretation regarding the legal  status of coastal areas in China’s exclusive economic zones[38].  6 International Military Activities  In recent years, the PLA has begun emphasizing non-traditional security missions such as  peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and anti-piracy. In order to carry out  these missions, it has been actively dispatching its units overseas. It is believed that in the  background of the PLA’s stance on international military activities is the expansion of China’s  national interests beyond its national borders, which in turn increased its necessity to protect and  promote its national interests overseas, as well as China’s intent to raise its stature by  demonstrating its will to fulfill its responsibilities to the international community.  China states that it consistently supports and actively participates in the U.N. PKO. According  to “The Diversified Employment of China’s Armed Forces,” among other sources, it has sent  more than 22,000 military personnel to the U.N. PKO. According to the United Nations, as of  the end of April 2014, China had deployed a total of 2,180 personnel, civilian police officers,  and military observers to U.N. PKO, including the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated  Stabilization Missions in Mali (MINUSMA). Thus, China shows a certain presence in the U.N.  PKO. In the background of China’s proactive attitude to the U.N. PKO is deemed to be its intent  to strengthen its relations with the regions where the PKO is conducted, particularly with  African nations.  37 It is reported that China is constructing a large-scale naval base that has underground tunnels for nuclear-powered submarines in the city of Sanya located in the southern tip of Hainan island. Experts point out that the base is in a strategically important location that secures access to the South China Sea, as well as the western Pacific, and that China is advancing construction work in order for the base to play a role as a major hub of the South Sea Fleet, including for the deployment of aircraft carriers. 38 It is pointed out that, in recent years, China aims to limit military activities of other countries in coastal areas of China’s exclusive economic zones by employing its own interpretations of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). For instance, the Chinese government announced in a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on November 26, 2010 that it is opposed to unsanctioned military activities by any country in coastal areas of China’s exclusive economic zones.",page,237,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24743,"Furthermore, as its first mission in distant waters, the Chinese Navy has dispatched vessels to  the coast of Somalia and the Gulf of Aden since December 2008 in order to escort Chinese and  other ships. The Chinese Navy is hence improving its capacity to execute naval operations in  more distant waters, demonstrating that China is placing a greater emphasis on protecting its sea  lanes of transportation.  In view of the deteriorating situation in Libya, China carried out an evacuation operation of  Chinese nationals from the country from February through March 2011. In this operation, China  dispatched a naval frigate and transportation aircraft of the Air Force to Libya in addition to  private chartered aircraft. This is the first participation of the military in an evacuation operation  of Chinese nationals living overseas. In addition, from November to December 2013, China  dispatched a hospital ship to conduct medical relief activities in the Philippines. It has been  pointed out that through such activities, China is trying to build a pacifist and humanitarian  image of its military forces and to demonstrate, both domestically and internationally, its intent  to place priority on military operations other than war, as well as its desire to prove the ability to  project its military power to distant locations.  7 Education and Training  In recent years, the PLA has been conducting practical exercises including such large-scale  exercises as cooperative exercises of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and landing exercises in  order to strengthen its operational capabilities. The goal of “being able to fight and winning  battles” was repeatedly mentioned in statements addressed to the military by General Secretary  Xi Jinping as well as in the military training instructions given by the general staff. This is  considered as evidence that the military is promoting implementation of more practical  exercises. The whole PLA military training conference in 2006 emphasized promotion of a shift  from military training under the conditions of mechanization to military training under the  conditions of informatization. The new Outline of Military Training and Evaluation, in effect  since 2009, highlights training for military operations other than war (MOOTW), education in  knowledge and expertise required for informatization, simulated training of high-tech weapons  and equipment, network training, and training in complex electromagnetic environments where  electronic interference occurs, in addition to joint exercises by different services.  In the education spectrum, the PLA aims to develop military personnel versed in science and  technology. In 2003, it launched a human resource strategy project to develop human resources  capable of directing joint operations/informatized operations and of building informatized",page,238,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24744,"armed forces. The project has a goal of achieving a big leap in the development of military  personnel to 2020. In recent years, the PLA appears to be increasing its wage standards. It is  believed that its objective is to secure highly capable human resources. Moreover, in 2000, in  order to recruit highly capable and highly educated people, the military started a system where it  provides scholarships for civilian college students and then allows them to enter the military as  commissioned officers after graduation. On the other hand, in recent years, it is pointed out that  there is an issue concerning treatment of veterans.  China has been developing a mobilization system with a view to effective use of civilian  resources in the case of war and other emergencies. In February 2010, China enacted the  National Defense Mobilization Law, which is the basic law for wartime mobilization, and in  July the same year, put the law into effect.  8 National Defense Industry Sector  While China imports highly sophisticated military equipment and parts that it cannot produce  domestically from other countries such as Russia, China is believed to place emphasis on their  indigenous production. The country manufactures much of its military equipment domestically  and is actively carrying out research and development of new equipment. China’s national  defense industry sector appears to be developing due to improvement of private industry  infrastructures accompanying economic growth, use of dual technologies, and the absorption of  foreign technologies, as well as its own efforts. The sector is serving the role of supporting the  strengthening of Chinese military forces[39].  Growth in the Chinese defense industry was once hindered by inefficiency caused by excessive  secrecy and other factors. However, in recent years, reform of the defense industry has  progressed. In particular, emphasis has been placed on two-way technological exchanges where  military technologies are utilized for developing the national economy, and, in turn, civilian  technologies are absorbed for a buildup of national defense. Specifically, the technologies of the  defense industry have contributed to the development of civilian space exploration, the aviation  industry, and the shipbuilding industry.  39 The U.S. Department of Defense’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (August 2011) explains with regard to China’s defense industry that the shipbuilding and defense electronics sectors have witnessed the greatest progress, coupled with technological development in the sectors of missile and space systems. In contrast, the sectors of guidance and control systems and engines and advanced applications and software have experienced slower progress, and China still heavily depends on foreign enterprises for technologies in these sectors.",page,239,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24745,"Furthermore, China encourages and supports international cooperation and competition in  dual-use industries, thus appearing to have an interest in absorbing foreign technologies through  dual-use industries.  **3 Relations with Other Countries**  1 General Situation  On the one hand, China has adopted so-called assertive measures, including attempts to alter the  status quo by coercive measures, especially for issues involving conflicting maritime interests.  On the other hand, China recognizes that a peaceful and stable international environment is  necessary for maintaining sustainable economic development and enhancing China’s overall  national power. Based on such recognition, in its relationships with other countries, China  proactively carries out military exchanges including reciprocal visits by senior military officials  and joint military exercises. In recent years, China has been engaged in vigorous military  exchanges not only with major powers such as the United States and Russia and with its  neighboring countries including Southeast Asian countries, but also with countries in Africa and  Latin America. China is believed to consider military exchanges as a strategic means to  safeguard its national interests, and as such to position military exchanges as an element in  China’s overall diplomatic strategy. The objectives of China’s promotion of military exchanges  include alleviating other countries’ concerns regarding China by strengthening its relations with  these countries, creating a favorable security environment for China, enhancing China’s  influence in the international community, securing stable supplies of natural resources and  energy, and building foreign bases.  2 Relations with Taiwan  China upholds the principle that Taiwan is a part of China, and that the Taiwan issue is therefore  a domestic issue. The country maintains that the “one-China” principle is the underlying  premise and foundation for discussions between China and Taiwan. China also claims that it  would never abandon its efforts for peaceful unification, and expresses that it will take up  policies and measures to solve issues of Taiwanese people’s interest and to protect their due  authority. Meanwhile, China is strongly opposed to any foreign intervention in the unification of  China as well as any move towards the independence of Taiwan, and on this basis, has  repeatedly stated that it has not renounced the use of force. The Anti-Secession Law, enacted in  March 2005, clearly lays out the non-renunciation of the use of military force by China[40].  40 The law stipulates, “In the event that the ‘Taiwan independence’ secessionist forces should act under any name or by any means to cause the fact of Taiwan’s secession from China, or that major incidents entailing Taiwan’s secession from China should occur, or that possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted, the state shall employ non-peaceful means and other necessary measures",page,240,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24746,"Ma Ying-jeou (Kuomintang), re-elected in the presidential election in January 2012, continues  to advocate, in his second term, a policy of pursuing Taiwanese economic development by  expanding economic exchanges with China and the status quo rather than independence. As  exemplified by the entry into force of the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement  (ECFA), the bilateral relationship is deepening primarily along the economic realm. In February  2014, the Minister of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of China and the Minister  of the Mainland Affairs Council of Taiwan held the first ministerial meeting between China and  Taiwan. On the security front, while China urged that the two countries make contact and hold  exchanges over military issues at an appropriate time in order to explore the creation of  mechanisms for building mutual trust over military security, Taiwan has shown a cautious  stance, stating that the conditions are not yet met[41]. Regarding the Senkaku Islands, China and  Taiwan have their own assertions[42], and Taiwan has expressed reluctance to work with China.  Attention will be paid to trends in the future relations between China and Taiwan including  trends of political dialogues on military affairs.  3 Relations with the United States  There are various outstanding issues between the United States and China, such as human rights  in China, the Taiwan issue, and trade issues. However, since a stable U.S.-China relationship is  essential for China to develop its economy, it is believed that China will continue to aspire to  maintain stable relations with the United States.  The United States expresses that it welcomes a China that takes on a responsible leadership role  with the international community on such global issues as the recovery of the world economy,  climate change, and proliferation of WMDs. The United States proclaims that it will monitor the  strengthening of Chinese military capabilities, recognizes that the two nations do not agree on  every issue, and makes it clear that the United States will be candid on human rights and other  issues. It also states that disagreement between the two countries should not prevent cooperation  on issues of mutual interest[43].  to protect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.” 41 For China’s stance, see the remarks made by (then) Chinese President Hu Jintao at the discussion on December 31, 2008, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the announcement of the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan. For Taiwan’s stance, see the “Quadrennial Defense Review” released by the Ministry of National Defense of Taiwan on March 13, 2013. 42 The Taiwanese authority’s vessels intruded into Japan’s territorial waters around the Senkaku Islands three times in 2012. 43 The U.S. National Security Strategy (May 2010). In addition, the Defense Strategic Guidance of January 2012 states, “China’s emergence as a regional power will have the potential to affect the U.S. economy and our security in a variety of ways” and “our two countries have a strong stake in peace and",page,241,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24747,"China hopes to forge a kind of U.S.-China relationship it calls “a new model of major country  relationship” based on mutual respect and “win-win” cooperation. However, consensus has not  necessarily been reached between the United States and China regarding the specifics of the  relationship.  Regarding the Senkaku Islands, the United States has reiterated that the Japan-U.S. Security  Treaty applies to the islands. China protested, stating that it would never accept any word or  deed that includes the islands within the scope of the treaty (statement by a spokesperson of  China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2010).  China and the United Nations have deepened military exchanges and conducted various policy  dialogues. China has dispatched observers to U.S. military exercises, and joint drills have been  conducted between the Chinese and U.S. navies on mutual port visits. A military hotline  between the defense departments of the two countries was set up in April 2008. In November  2013, the U.S. and Chinese armies conducted a humanitarian assistance and disaster relief  exercise. In addition, from June 2014, Chinese navy vessels participated in the Rim of the  Pacific Exercise (RIMPAC) for the first time. However, while China wishes to develop relations  between the Chinese and U.S. militaries, it asserts that there are a number of issues that must be  resolved in order to realize the sound development of the relations. The issues include U.S. arms  sales to Taiwan, activities of U.S. military vessels and aircraft within China’s exclusive  economic zones, legal hurdles in mutual military exchanges, and a lack of strategic trust in  China on the part of the United States[44]. In addition, some unstable facets have been observed in  military exchanges of the two countries. For example, China notified suspensions of the major  military exchanges with the United States when the U.S. Department of Defense notified  Congress of possible arms sales to Taiwan in October 2008 and January 2010. On the other hand,  the United States maintains that China’s military development, lack of transparency of the  decision-making process, and other issues raise questions about its future conduct and intentions.  It asserts that U.S.-China relations must be undergirded by a process of enhancing confidence  and reducing misunderstanding. For this reason, with regard to military exchanges, it is believed  stability in East Asia and an interest in building a cooperative bilateral relationship.” 44 Remarks by (then) Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) Xu Caihou in a meeting with (then) U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates (October 2009). Then Deputy Chief of the PLA General Staff Department Ma Xiaotian stated at the 11th round of the U.S.-China Defense Consultative Talks held in December 2010 that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, U.S. laws that impose restrictions on contacts between the military forces of the two countries, and the frequent military reconnaissance operations conducted by U.S. naval vessels and aircraft in coastal areas of China’s exclusive economic zones constituted key obstacles to developing stable military-to-military ties.",page,242,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24748,"that the aim of the United States is to improve the current situation, wherein such exchanges are  frequently suspended once problems arise, and to build relations that are capable of maintaining  more stable channels of decision-making for mutual understanding. In recent years, for instance,  Strategic Security Dialogues have been established in 2011 in the U.S.-China Strategic and  Economic Dialogues, and these dialogues have been held annually.  4 Relations with Russia  Since the China-Soviet confrontation ended in 1989, both countries have placed importance on  their bilateral relationship. The deepening of the “strategic partnership” between China and  Russia, which was established in the mid-1990s, has been emphasized. In 2001, the  China-Russia Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation [45] was concluded.  Subsequently, in 2004, the long-standing issue of border demarcation between the two countries  came to a settlement. The two countries share an idea that they will promote multipolarization  of the world and establishment of a new international order. In addition, economic motives  including natural resource and energy supply have been driving the good relationship between  them in recent years.  On the military front, since the 1990s, China has purchased modern weapons from Russia,  including fighter aircraft, destroyers, and submarines. Russia is currently the largest supplier of  weapons to China. However, some point out that their trade amounts have been on the decline in  recent years due to the advancement of indigenous weapon production in China. It is also  pointed out that Russia, which shares a land border with China, has a policy of not supplying  sophisticated weapons to China that would cause a threat to Russia and that Russia has a  concern about competition with China in arms exports.  China-Russia military exchanges include regular visits by high-ranking army officials. In  addition, joint military exercises are conducted, such as the large-scale joint naval exercise,  “Naval Interaction,” in the Yellow Sea, the Sea of Japan off the coast of Vladivostok, and  northern East China Sea in April 2012, July 2013, and May 2014, respectively[46]. It is believed  45 Regarding the military field, this treaty mentions military confidence building or strengthening of mutual troop reductions in border areas, military cooperation such as military technical cooperation, and holding discussions in the event that there is awareness of any threat to peace. 46 China and Russia conducted their first large-scale joint exercise in the Shandong Peninsula and other areas in China in August 2005. In August 2007, July 2009, September 2010, June 2012, and July to August 2013, member states of the SCO conducted joint anti-terrorism exercises. The purpose of SCO is to promote cooperation in areas where the member states have common interests, such as maintenance of peace and stability in the region, joint actions against terrorism, and politics, trade, and economy. In addition to the anti-terrorism exercise “Peace Mission,” the SCO is making efforts for the stabilization of Central Asia, including Afghanistan, through such decisions as approving Afghanistan to be a SCO",page,243,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24749,"that through these exchanges the two countries can deepen mutual understanding and build  confidence between their military forces and show their presence as a pole in the  multipolarizing world, and China can learn operational methods of Russian weapons and  military operational doctrines.  5 Relations with the Other Countries  (1) Relations with Southeast Asian Countries  As for its relations with countries in Southeast Asia, China has been continuously developing  bilateral relations with the countries through active mutual top-level visits and other means. For  example, China has had good relations with Myanmar and has assisted in developing  Myanmar’s infrastructure such as pipelines for petroleum or natural gas, ports, and railroads. It  also has supplied key military equipment. Some pundits point out that this close relationship is  associated with Myanmar’s location which provides China the shortest access to the Indian  Ocean[47].  China is also actively involved in multilateral frameworks such as ASEAN Plus One (China),  ASEAN Plus Three (Japan, China and the ROK), and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF). In  October 2013, President Xi Jinping visited Indonesia and Malaysia, and Premier Li Keqiang  visited Brunei, Thailand and Vietnam. While China has been deepening its economic and  cultural cooperation with ASEAN member states through diplomatic forums, more recently, it  has been proactively advancing cooperation in the area of national security by enhancing  exchanges of military personnel such as mutual visits of their high-ranking military officers and  exchanges and cooperation between military departments.  (2) Relations with Central Asian Countries  The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, located in the western part of China, is situated next  to Central Asia. It shares borders with the three countries of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and  Tajikistan, and has ethnic minorities settled in the areas straddling borders. Naturally, the region  hosts lively exchanges between the people of those countries. Therefore, China is greatly  concerned about the political stability and security situations in Central Asian states such as  terrorism by Islamic extremists. Chinese engagement in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization  (SCO), which was established in June 2001, is viewed as an indication of China’s concerns in  such areas. Moreover, China is also strongly interested in the wealth of energy and natural  resources of Central Asia with a view to diversification of its supply source and procurement  observer country at the SCO summit meeting held in June 2012. 47 Some observers also believe that Myanmar is attempting to end its excessive dependence on China in terms of diplomacy.",page,244,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24750,"methods of these resources and is promoting cooperation in the energy field with Central Asian  countries, such as the construction of oil and natural gas pipelines between China and Central  Asian nations.  (3) Relations with South Asian Countries  China has traditionally maintained an extremely close relationship with Pakistan, and mutual  visits by their leaders take place frequently. It is believed that, as illustrated by the joint  development of the JF-17 fighter, their cooperation in the military sector, including exporting  weapons and military technology transfer, is also deepening. As the importance of sea lanes  increases for the globalizing Chinese economy, it is believed that the importance of Pakistan is  rising for China. This is partly because of the geopolitical features of Pakistan, namely it faces  the Indian Ocean.  China and India have an unsettled border, and it is deemed that “problems” over this area have  arisen between the two countries even in recent years[48]. On the other hand, in recent years,  China has been committed to improving its relationship with India while also paying  consideration to maintaining balance with Pakistan. Identifying China’s relationship with India  as a strategic partnership, China actively conducts mutual visits by top leaders. It is believed  that the deepening of bilateral relations is attributed to the importance China places on the  economic growth of both countries as well as China’s response to strengthening U.S.-India  relations.  Regarding military exchanges, China has conducted a variety of joint exercises with Pakistan  and India since 2003, including joint naval search and rescue exercises.  (4) Relations with EU Countries  For China, the European Union (EU) countries are now as important a partner as Japan and the  United States, especially in the economic field. China, through diplomatic opportunities,  strongly requests EU countries to lift their arms embargoes against China which have been  imposed since the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989[49].  Regarding information technology, avionics, and air-independent propulsion systems for  48 According to a press conference by the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense of China in August 2013. 49 For example, in November 2010, (then) Chinese President Hu Jintao visited France, and on this occasion, China and France announced a joint statement that included text supporting the lifting of the arms embargoes against China. It is deemed that some EU countries have positive opinions about the lifting of their arms embargoes against China.",page,245,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24751,"submarines and other areas, EU member countries possess more advanced technologies than  China or Russia which exports weapons to China. Therefore, if the EU arms embargo on China  were lifted, it is possible that the weapons and military technologies of EU countries would  transfer to China, and that they would be utilized as a bargaining chip to gain the edge in  weapons transactions with Russia. For this reason, Japan has consistently expressed to the EU  its objection to lifting the arms embargo on China, as well as requested EU member states to  carry out more rigorous management of the exports of arms, dual-use goods, and their  technologies to China. Continuous attention will need to be paid to future discussions within the  EU.  (5) Relations with Middle East, African Countries, Pacific Islands, and Central and South  American Countries  China has been enhancing its relations with Middle Eastern and African nations in the economic  realm, including active assistance towards their infrastructure development and investment in  their resource and energy development, and has been further expanding its influence in the  region. In recent years, not only interactions among top levels of states and high-ranking  military officials but also arms exports and exchanges between military forces are actively  conducted. Behind these moves, some see China’s intention to ensure stable supply of energy  and natural resources and also to secure its overseas hubs in the future.  China has also been boosting its relations with the Pacific islands. It has been developing oil,  natural gas, and cobalt mines in Papua New Guinea and has signed an agreement on military  cooperation with the country. Proactive and continual economic assistance has also been  implemented to other islands. Furthermore, military exchanges are being promoted with Fiji and  Tonga.  Chinese military officials visit countries including Argentina and Brazil on a regular basis to  enhance its relations with Central and South American countries. China has been working to  improve its relations with these countries through such activities as the medical services  missions by a hospital ship of the Chinese Navy.  6 International Transfer of Weapons  China is expanding provision of weapons such as small arms, tanks, and aircraft to developing  countries in Asia, Africa, and other areas. It is reported that the main recipients are Pakistan,  Iran, and Bangladesh, while weapons are also being exported to African countries such as  Namibia, Egypt, Algeria, and Sudan as well as Central and South American countries including",page,246,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24752,"Venezuela and Bolivia. Some experts claim that China transfers weapons in order to strengthen  its strategic relationships with the allies, enhance its influence in the international community,  and secure energy and natural resources. Some observers point out that China supplies weapons  to countries that struggle with democracy or have human rights problems. Attention will be on  whether China will increase the transparency of international weapons transfer in response to  the concerns of the international community.  **4 Military Capabilities of Taiwan**  Taiwan, under the guidance of building the “hard rock” defense advocated by President Ma Jeou  Ying, identifies prevention of war, homeland defense, response to contingencies, deterrence of  conflict, and regional stability as the strategic objectives, and takes the military strategy of  “resolute defense and credible deterrence.”  Taiwan, for improved expertise of its military personnel and other purposes, aims to transform  its armed forces currently consisting of drafted personnel and volunteers into all-volunteer  forces, while reducing the total forces from 275,000 to 215,000 personnel by the end of 2014.  However, the Ministry of National Defense reportedly stated that the transformation into  all-volunteer forces would not be feasible until 2016. At the same time, the Taiwanese armed  forces attribute importance to the introduction of advanced technologies and improvement of  joint operational capabilities. Additionally, in light of the serious damage that occurred from the  typhoon in August 2009, the Taiwanese armed forces identify disaster prevention and relief as  one of their major missions.  With regard to Taiwan’s military power, at present, ground forces, including the Navy Marine  Corps, have a total of approximately 215,000 personnel. In addition, it is believed that  approximately 1.65 million reserve personnel of the air, naval, and ground forces would be  available in case of war. Regarding naval capabilities, in addition to Kidd-class destroyers  which were imported from the United States, Taiwan possesses relatively modern frigates and  other vessels. Regarding air capabilities, Taiwan possesses F-16 A/B fighters, Mirage 2000  fighters, Jing Guo fighters, etc.  In view of the fact that the PLA is enhancing its missile, naval, and air forces, the Taiwanese  military believes it still needs to modernize its equipment. The U.S. Department of Defense has  notified Congress of possible arms sales to Taiwan based on the Taiwan Relations Act[50], but  50 Recently, the Department of Defense notified Congress of possible sales to Taiwan of Patriot PAC-3 surface-to-air missiles and AH-64D attack helicopters in October 2008, possible sales of PAC-3 missiles,",page,247,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24753,"Taiwan also wishes to purchase the F-16C/D fighter aircraft and other arms from the United  States. The issue is to be observed. Taiwan is also promoting the independent development of  military equipment. The Tien Kung II surface-to-air missiles and Hsiung Feng II anti-ship  missiles are deployed and it is believed that the Hsiung Feng IIE cruise missiles are being  developed in order to acquire long-range attack capabilities, while the Tien Kung III  surface-to-air missiles are being developed in order to ensure the capabilities to deal with  ballistic missiles.  The military capabilities of China and Taiwan are generally characterized as follows:  1) Regarding ground forces, China possesses an overwhelming number of troops; however, their  capability of landing on and invading the island of Taiwan is limited. Nevertheless, China is  making efforts to improve its landing and invasion capabilities in recent years, such as building  large landing ships.  2) Regarding naval and air forces, China, which overwhelms Taiwan in terms of quantity, has  also been steadily strengthening its naval and air forces in recent years in terms of quality,  where Taiwan had superiority over China.  3) Regarding missile attack capabilities, China possesses numerous short-range ballistic missiles,  etc. with a range that covers Taiwan, and Taiwan seems to have few effective countermeasures.  In addition to the sizes of forces and performance and quantity of military equipment, a  comparison of military capabilities should take into account various factors such as the  objectives and characteristics of envisioned military operations, the operational posture,  proficiency in military personnel, and logistics. Nevertheless, as China is rapidly strengthening  its military power, the overall military balance between China and Taiwan is shifting in favor of  China. Attention should be paid to the strengthening of both the Chinese and Taiwanese military  capabilities and U.S. weapon sales to Taiwan.  _See_ -  Fig. I-1-3-7 (Changes in Taiwan’s Defense Budget); I-1-3-8 (Changes in Modern Fighter Aircraft of China  _and Taiwan)_  UH-60 helicopters, Osprey-class mine hunters, and others in January 2010, and possible arms sales including equipment necessary to upgrade F-16A/B fighter aircraft in September 2011.",page,248,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24754,"**Chapter 1 Defense Policies of Countries**  1 Security and Defense Policies  Despite its changing influence in relative terms, the United States remains the world's most powerful nation, and it is believed to consistently play a significant role in ensuring peace and stability throughout the world. In January 2012, the Obama administration released the new Defense Strategic Guidance  Russia recognizes that it must undertake a number of sweeping modernizations, including  . Based on the unde rstanding tha t the United States is at an inflection point due to factors both inside and outs ide the c ountry, that is, the U.S. Forces’  withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan after a decade of war and the demand for deep cuts in government spending including defense spending under the government’s serious fiscal situation, the guidance was  developed to review defense priorities and present a blueprint for the  Joint Force in 2020. In the new Defense Strategic Guidance, the Obama Administration articulated a policy that would place the Asia  -   Pacific region at the focus of U.S. strategy, includ  ing the securi ty strateg y (Rebalanc ing to the Asi a  -  Pacific Region). Furthermore, in March 20 14 the Adm ini str ation pu blishe d th e Quadr ennial Defense Review (QDR), the second review since President Obama took office. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense S  trategic  Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it, including rebalancing to the Asia Pacific  **region, indicating that the Obama Administration continues to place an emphasis on the region.**  Meanwhile, as the growing budget deficits of the U.S. government in recent years have called  for deep cuts in spending, in January 2012 the Department of Defense announced that the reduction in defense spending will amount to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from FY2012 to FY2021  potential challenges and threats toward Russia’s security[. In addition, the g]overnment budget sequestration  , including defense  spending, was initiated in March 2013, bringing various impacts on the U.S. Forces including  suspension of training, delayed deployment of aircraft carriers, and grounding of air squadrons. Although the Bi partisan Budget Act of the Democratic and Republican parties mitigated the  sequestration spending cuts for FY2014 and FY2015, the QDR emphasizes that the risks to the  U.S. Forces would increase considerably if sequester  -   level cuts return in FY2016. Much  The formal title of the document is “Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense.”  According to the document pu blished by the DoD concerning the FY2013 budget request that was submitted to Congress in February 2012, “the amount of reduction” here means the difference between  the total DoD base budget for 10 years estimated at the time of the FY2012 budget request ( submitted to Congress in February 2011) and the total DoD base budget for 10 years estimated at the time of the FY2013 budget request.  e class should play a leading role in society.

The QDR outlines policies concerning U.S. Forces' capabilities and composition in anticipation of the security environment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the Secretary of Defen  se submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it.  (1) Understandi ng o f Security  The 2014 QDR states that the future international security environment remains uncertain and complicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between  stat es, non  -  state entities and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly  accelerating spread of information. In  addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals, and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces.  The QDR recognizes t  hat the Asia  -   Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce, politics and security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the  region continues to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their milita  ry and security capabilities, bringing greater risk that tensions arising from long  -   standing sovereign disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehe  nsive scope of China’s military modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its  long -   range missile and weapons of  mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit  of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to th e United States.  As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of trans- national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile  states. The report states that Iran remains a destabilizing actor that threatens security by defying international law and pursing capabilities that would allow it to develop nuclear weapons. Even as Iran pledges not to pursue nuclear tiered structure of military district–army–division–regiment, to a three-tiered structure of military district– operational command–brigade.

24756,"weapons, its other d  estabilizing activities including development of mid  -   and long -   range  missiles and support to terrorists and insurgents, will continue to pose a threat to the security of  the Middle East and the U.S. allies and partners. Furthermore, it states that as coun tries in the Middle East and Africa undergo political and social change, terrorist groups seek to expand their influence, and internal strife in Syria has become a  magnet for global jihad, bringing ongoing spillover effects including an influx of foreign  f  ighters and a flood of refugees into neighboring countries. In Africa, it mentions that terrorists, criminal organizations and pirates exploit ungoverned and under  -   gov ern ed terri tory, causing pote ntial for rapi dly de veloping thr eats, pa rtic ularly of ter ror  ist attacks in fragile states, that  could pose acute challenges to U.S. interests.  The report says that Europe remains the principal partner in promoting global security, particularly in addressing challenges such as persistent unrest and violence in the Middle East and North Africa. The QDR states that while the United States is willing to undertake security cooperation with Russia, both in the bilateral context and in seeking solutions to regional challenges, Russia’s multi- _dimensional defense modernization and actions that violate the sovereignty of neighbors_  present risks and thus the United States will engage Russia to increase transparency and reduce  **the risk of military miscalculation.** **Concerning the global trends, the report refers to the emergenc**  e of international partners with the capacity to play security roles in their respective regions, as well as international cooperation and shared norms of behavior at unprecedented levels of global interconnectedness. At the same time it also states that t he spread and proliferation of technology offers new tools for state and non- state adversaries such as terrorists to pursue asymmetric approaches in the 21st century operational environment. Furthermore, the report states that in coming years, countries su  ch as China will continues seeking to counter U.S. strengths using anti- access and area -  denial  (A2/AD) approaches and by employing other new cyber and space control technologies. It also says that elements such as cyberspace, space, sophisticated technolo  gy, WMD, terrorism and climate change poses additional challenges.  (2) Defense Strategy The 2014 QDR emphasizes the following three pillars, which are interdependent and mutually  suitable for military service and the shortening of the conscription period (from January 2008, the See Part I Overview, Section 2, footnote 4  Board in December 2013, Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu stated that personnel adequacy was 82% and the contracted soldiers were about 220,000.",page,251,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24757,"reinforcing, in order to embody priorities outlined in the 2012 Defense Stra  tegic Guidance including rebalancing toward the Asia  -   Pacific region and s tron g commit ment to sta bility in  Europe and the Middle East. (1) Protect the Homeland: Maintain the capability to deter and defeat attacks on the United  States. Protection of the hom[eland includes assisting U.S. civil authorities in protecting U.S. ]airspace, shores, and borders, and in responding effectively to domestic disasters. (2) Build security globally: Continue a strong U.S. commitment to shaping world events in order to deter  _and prevent conflict and to assure the allies and partners of the shared security._ _(3) Project power and win decisively: the U.S. Forces deter acts of aggression in one or more theaters by remaining capable of decisively defeating adversaries, while projecting power to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. The QDR states that across the three pillars, the U.S. Forces are capable of simultaneously implementing the following undertakings, and if deterrence fails at any given time, U.S. forces_  could defeat a regional adversary in a large  -  scale multi  -  phased campaign, and deny the  objectives of  —  or imposing unacceptable costs on—  another aggressor in another region  Russia still possesses intercon.  1) Defending homeland 2) Conducting sustained, distributed counterterrorist opera  tions  3) Deterring aggression and assuring allies through forward presence and engagement in  multipl e r egions.  Furthermore, in order to achieve the three pillars, the Department of Defense seeks innovative approaches to how to fight, how to posture the fo rce, and how to leverage the asymmetric strengths and technological advantages. More specifically, the QDR mentions positioning  additional forward -  deployed naval forces in critical areas, such as the Asia  -  Pacific region, and deploying new combinations of s hips, aviation assets, and crisis response forces.   (3) Rebalancing of the Joint Force Given major changes in the U.S. security environment including geopolitical changes, changes in modern warfare, and changes in the fiscal environment, the 2014 QDR states that the side is obligated to reduce deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 and their deployed delivery platforms to  The 2010 QDR stated that the U.S. Forces possess the capability of countering attacks by two countries while also being able to conduct a wi de range of operations.

24758,"Department of Defense will rebalance the Joint Force for a broad spectrum of conflict,  rebalance and maintain the presence and posture abroad, and rebalance capability, capacity and  readiness. The QDR also says that while the force will become smaller, it will become more modern as well, with readiness improving. Furthermore, it states that particularly in an era of reduced bud  get and other resources, the Department will redouble its efforts to protect key  capability areas listed below, that are  mos t cl osely aligned to the pillars of the defense strategy. 1) Missile defense: Increase the number of Ground- Based Interceptors and build depth into the sensor network. Deploy a second radar in Japan that will improve early warning and tracking of any m  issiles launched by North Korea. Increase defense interceptor reliability and effectiveness to improve discrimination capabilities, and to establish a more robust sensor network. Study the best location in the United States for an additional missile defense interceptor site.  2) Nuclear deterrence: Continue to invest in modernizing the essential nuclear delivery systems, warheads, command and control, and nuclear weapon infrastructure.  3) Cyber: Develop the Cyber Mission Force that operates and defends the Department networks and supports military operations worldwide by 2016. In addition, the Department migrates its  information systems to a common, Defense  -  wide network infrastructure known as the Joint  Information Environment.  4) Space: Diversify and expand the coverage of Space Situational Awareness (SSA)- through international partnerships. In the near-term, investment in technology demonstrations and  capabilities required to evolve toward more resilient architectures. Additionally, accelerate initiatives t o counter adversary space capabilities including adversary intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), and space - enabled precision strike. See ▶  Part I, Chapter 2, Section 4  -  1 (Outer Space and Security)  5) Air/sea: Invest in combat aircraft, including fighters and long - range strike, survivable  persistent surveillance, resilient architectures, and undersea warfare to increase the Joint Force's ab ility to counter A2/AD challenges. Deepen collaboration with key allies and partners as they develop future forces and capabilities to counter more sophisticated aggressors.  6) Precision strike: The Air Forces will procure air -to  -  surface missiles that allo  w both fighter and bomber aircraft to engage a wide range of targets effectively, even when the enemy’s air defense have not been fully suppressed. The Navy is developing a new, joint, long -  range  anti -ship cruise missile, which will improve the Joint Force's ability to engage surface combatants in defended airspace.  7) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR): Rebalance investments toward systems The number of Special Operations Forces personnel as of March 2014 is 66,000. 2011, and the launching ceremony of the first ship, Vladivostok, was held in October 2013 in a French shipyard.

[Make critical space based systems more resilient by expanding the access to commercial and ]allied space ISR systems.  8) Counter Terrorism and Special Operations: Grow overa  ll Special Operations Forces (SOF) strength to 69,700. As forces are withdrawn from Afghanistan, more SOF will be available to support Combatant Commanders’ efforts to counter a range of challenges across the globe. 9) Resilience: Improve the resilience of  air, naval, ground, space and missile- defense capabilities, even in the face of large  -  scale, coordinated attacks. Disperse land based and naval expeditionary forces to other bases and operating sites and provide ability to operate and maintain front- line combat aircraft from austere bases while using only a small complement of  logistical and support personnel and equipment.  The QDR emphasizes that if sequester-level cuts return in FY2016, risks for the U.S. forces  posed by shifts in the security environmen  t would grow significantly  their area of operations..  2 Rebalance toward the Asia  -  Pacific Region  **As indicated by the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and the 2014 QDR, the United States places emphasis on the Asia** **-**  Pacific region and is continuing a policy to enhance its presence in  the region. In November 2011, U.S. President Obama delivered a speech in the Australian  Parliament, clearly stating, for the first time, that he will give top priority to the U.S. presence [and mission in the Asia] Pacific region and indicating that the U. S. will maintain its strong presence in Japan and the Korean Peninsula, while enhancing its presence in Southeast Asia.  Furthermore, the 2014 QDR states that the centerpiece of the Department of Defense commitment to the rebalance toward the Asia - Pacific region is to modernize and enhance security alliances with Australia, Japan, the ROK, the Philippines and Thailand.  -2010” conducted in the former Far Eastern Military District and the former Siberian Military  Some of the implications anticipated in the case of the return of the sequester  -  level cuts include a reducti  on in end strength of active Army to 420,000, retirement of the USS George Washington aircraft carrier (10 aircraft carriers), a reduction in end strength of marine corps to 175,000, a further retirement of air force aircraft and a slowdown of purchases of F-35 aircraft.  and The initial deployment would consist of a company of 250 U.S. marines and aims to eventually  18 Surprise inspections were conducted in February 2013 in the Central Military District and Southern Military District; in March 2014 in the Southern Military District; in May 2014 in the Western Military District; in July 2014 in the Eastern and Central Military Districts; in October there was a surprise inspection of the strategic nuclear units; and between February and March 2014 unannounced inspections were conducted in the Western and Central Military Districts.

The United States has been expressing its stance to emphasize the Asia  -   Pacific region not only to its allies and partners but also to China.  The 2014 QDR states that the United States is  buildin g a sustained and substantive dialogue with China to improve the ability to cooperate in  concrete, practical areas such as counter  -   piracy, pe ace keeping, humanitarian assistance and disas ter relief . At the same tim e, th e U nited St ates will manag e the co mpet  itive aspects of China- U.S. relations in ways that improve regional peace and stability consistent with international norms and principles.  3 Nuclear Strategy  While U.S. President Obama aims to realize a world without nuclear weapons, he notes that this w  ill not be realized in the near future, and indicates the need to maintain a nuclear deterrent as  long as nuclear weapons exist.  The Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), which was released in April 2010, indicates that the nucl ear securi ty environment is changin  g and nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation are an imminent threat today. Furthermore, it points to the necessity of working on the issue of ensuring strategic stability with existing nuclear powers, in particular Russia and China. establish a rotational presence of up to a 2,500- person Marine Air  -  Ground Task Force including aircraft, ground vehicles, and artilleries over a few years.

24761,"The NPR presents  five key objectives based on awareness of this security environment: (1)  preventing nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism; (2) reducing the role of U.S. nuclear weapons; (3) maintaining strategic deterrence and stability at reduced nuclear force lev  els;  (4)  strengthening regional deterrence and reassuring U.S. allies and partners; and (5) sustaining a safe, secure, and effective nuclear arsenal. In June 2013, U.S. President Obama delivered a speech on the reduction of nuclear weapons in Berlin, whi  ch was then followed by the release of the Report on Nuclear Employment Strategy  by the Department of Defense on the same day. The report revealed U.S. intentions to negotiate with Russia to pursue up to a one  -   third reduction in deployed strategic nuclear weapons.  See  -  Part I, Chapter 2, Section 2 -1 (Nuclear Weapons)  4 FY2015 Budget  As the budget deficit of the U.S. Government is deepening in recent years, the Budget Control  Act enacted in August 2011 established a deep cut in g[overnment spending by FY2021. In ]January  2012, the DoD announced that the reduction in defense spending in light of the act will  amount to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from FY2012 to FY2021 (about 259  billion dollars over the five years from FY2013 to FY2017). The Bipartisan Budget Act by the Democratic and Republican parties which passed in December 2013 mitigated the sequestration caps for FY2014 and FY2015. The FY2015 budget request that was announced following the Act includes 495.6 billion dollars to fund base defense programs. For Overseas Contingency Operations, the budget includes 58.6 billion dollars, an amount that is 20.9 billion dollars less  than the amount in the FY2014 budget request, reflecting the plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. The key principles of the defense budget are as follows: (1) Seek a balanced force;  (2) Prepare for prolonged readiness challenges including uncertain fiscal outlook; (3) Continue to focus on institutional reform; and (4) Pursue compensation changes. Major decisions include a reduction of end strength of active Army from the current 520,000 down to 440,000450,000 personnel, maintaini ng 11 aircraft carriers of the Navy, a commitment to the F   35 development and procurement program, and retirement of all A- 10 tactical fighters and U  -  2 reconnaissance aircraft. In relation to these decisions, the 2014 QDR states that while the forces will become smaller, it will become more modern as well, with readiness improving. However, unless the Congress and the President agree to a new budget bill or other such measures are taken, the rritories",page,256,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

The 2014 QDR states t  hat concerning the risks  for the U.S. Forces posed by shifts in the security environment, the Department can manage these risks under the President’s FY2015 Budget plan, but the risks would grow significantly if sequester  -   level cuts return in FY2016  .

The U.S. is studying the concept of a  Conventional Prompt Global Strike (CPGS), as an effort contributing to the nation’s new ability  to reduce reliance on nuclear weaponshowever, some activities seem to be on the rise again..  In regard to Missile Defense (MD), the U.S. announced the Ballistic Missile Defense Review (BMDR) in February 2010. On homeland defense, the review noted that the U.S. would use ground -  based interceptors to respond to ICBMs f rom North Korea and Iran, and that in regard to regional defense, the U.S. would expand investments in MD systems while taking a phased adaptive approach (PAA) that is tailored to each region and improve the MD capabilities step by step, working with partner countries and properly sharing the burden. However, in January 2012, the U.S. announced that it will continue investments in MD programs in its homeland and Europe while reducing the spending for deployable regional MD systems with a view to increasing reliance on its allies and partners in the future. Further, in March 2013, the U.S. announced that it will additionally deploy ground -  based interceptors in the U.S. homeland and mobile radars for BMD in Japan in order to bolster homeland security in response to North Korea’s nuclear test and the advancement of its long-range ballistic missile development, while restructuring the program of the standard missile (SM3) Block IIB scheduled for deployment in Europe.

Stating that its vital interests are concentrated in the  territories of the CIS[44], Russia has been making efforts to maintain its military influence[45], such  as by dispatching troops to be stationed in Ukraine (Crimea), Moldova (Transdniester[46]),  41 See Part I, Chapter 1, Section 3-3 for the relationship with China 42 President Putin made an official visit to Vietnam and ROK in November 2013. 43 Russia has participated in regional frameworks, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), and the East Asia Summit (EAS since 2011.) 44 After the conflict with Georgia in August 2008, then President Medvedev indicated that Russia recognized as one of its five principles of diplomacy the area of privileged interests for Russia. 45 While some CIS countries continue to prioritize their relations with Russia, such as Belarus and Kazakhstan, others are attempting to maintain a distance from Russia. Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova have been taking mostly pro-Western policies to reduce their security and economic dependence on Russia. In September 2012, Kyrgyzstan and Russia agreed on a 15-year extension of the period of use of Russian military bases in Kyrgyzstan, which otherwise would end in 2017. In October 2012, Tajikistan and Russia agreed to extend the lease of the base of Russia’s 201st Motor Rifle Division in Tajikistan until 2042. In December 2013, Su-27 fighters of the Russian naval force were deployed in Belarus for the first time. 46 In Transnistria, located on the eastern side of the Dniester River, ethnic Russian residents declared separation and independence from Moldova in 1990, but was never recognized as such by the international community.

Furthermore, in June 2009, a permanent  joint rapid reaction force was established to strengthen the functions of the CIS Collective  Rapid Deployment Force[49].  In addition, out of concern that the worsening security in Afghanistan could lead to the  destabilization of Central Asia, Russia and Central Asian countries are supporting Afghanistan  while considering measures to strengthen the security of borders with Afghanistan[50].

A Russian unit of about 1,500 troops is currently stationed in Transnistria. 47 After the conflict with Russia in August 2008, Georgia withdrew from the CIS in August 2009, but Russia unilaterally recognized the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in the Georgian territory and continues to have troops stationed in the regions. In the parliamentary election in October 2012 “Georgian Dream,” an opposition alliance with a campaign promise of improving Georgia-Russia relations, defeated the ruling “United National Movement” that adopts an anti-Russian policy. In the presidential election of October 2013, Giorgi Margvelashvili, backed by “Georgian Dream,” was elected and became president in November of the same year. In his inauguration speech, President Margvelashvili stated that he was ready to deepen the dialogue with Russia, expressing his intention to continue with pro-Euro, pro-U.S. lines while pursuing improvement of the relationship with Russia. 48 In May 1992, leaders of six countries (Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan) signed the Collective Security Treaty (CST) in Toshkent, Uzbekistan. In 1993, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Belarus joined the treaty, which came into effect in April 1994. However, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Uzbekistan withdrew from the treaty in 1999 without renewing it. In May 2002, CST was reorganized into the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). Uzbekistan returned to CST in August 2006 but gave notice of suspension of participation in CSTO in June 2012, effectively withdrawing from the organization. 49 Learning from the fact that CSTO could not sufficiently respond to the request by Kyrgyzstan for peace keeping at the time of the ethnic conflict in the southern part of Kyrgyzstan in June 2010, CSTO has been discussing improvement in the efficiency of its crisis response system. The CSTO summit meeting in December 2011 warned against foreign forces’ stationing in a member state by requiring the consent of all member states when any member state builds a base of a third country. CSTO joint exercises, ""Vzaimodeistvie"" (cooperative operation), were implemented in Kazakhstan in October 2009 and October 2010, in Armenia in September 2012, and in Belarus in September 2013. 50 During the December 2013 Russian the expanded meeting of the Defence Ministry Board, President Putin said that the withdrawal of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) from Afghanistan in 2014 would be a destabilizing element to not only Afghanistan but also the wider Central Asia and could also pose a threat to the national interests and security of Russia.",page,261,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

The  military forces also took control of arterial roads to the airport and the rest of Ukraine as well as  some major Ukrainian military forces facilities. In March 2014 after Russia took effective  control of Crimea, a referendum was held, asking Crimean citizens if they wanted Crimea to be  “annexed” by the Russian Federation. Following the referendum, Russia “annexed” Crimea. In  March, 2014 President Putin criticized western nations in a speech, pledging to protect the  interests of ethnic Russian citizens of Ukraine. The United States, European countries and Japan  condemned the referendum as it violates the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and  is in violation of international laws including the Charter of the United Nations, and have  refused to recognize the “annexation” of Crimea[51]. Said countries have expressed the view that  Russia’s changing of the status quo by force or coercion is a global issue that impacts the entire  international community, including Asia. In April 2014, forces believed to be ethnic Russian  citizens increased the intensity of their protests and attacks against the interim Ukrainian  government in eastern and southern Ukraine. During this period, buildings including the  Council of Ministers Building were seized. In response, the interim Ukrainian government  accused Russia of involvement and made attempts to expel the occupying forces by flinging the  military, etc. However, this has not led to the resolution of the situation. On the other hand,  Russia is believed to have deployed military forces consisting of as many as 40,000 personnel  near the Ukraine-Russia border. In May 2014, a presidential election was held in Ukraine,  except in Crimea and some parts of Eastern Ukraine, in a free, fair, and peaceful manner.  Candidate Mr. Petro Poroshenko was elected by winning a majority of the votes and assumed  the office of President in June of the same year. There have been indications that a diplomatic  solution is being sought over the Ukrainian situation, but the situation is in a state of flux and  the outlook remains extremely volatile and uncertain.  4 Relations with the United States  51 Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hong Lei stated during a March 2, 2014 press conference that ""China maintains the principle of non-intervention in domestic affairs of other countries and respects the independence, sovereignty and the protection of territories of Ukraine."" During a March 7, 2014 press conference, Hong Lei said, ""China has always opposed the rushed implementation of sanctions during a period of deteriorating international relations and the use of sanctions as a means of intimidation. China hopes that all relevant nations seek to avoid a further deterioration of the situation and seek political resolution of the crisis."" Hong Lei avoided directly answering the question as to whether he believes that the referendum in Crimea was in violation of international law, saying ""China urges all forces in Ukraine to resolve the issue peacefully through dialog and negotiation under a legal and well-ordered framework. China also urges all forces in Ukraine to protect the interests of Ukrainians, promptly restore order and maintain the peace and stability of the region.""

24768,"With the inauguration of the Obama administration in January 2009, the U.S.-Russia  relationship, which had been stalled due to the Russo-Georgian War, went through a period in  which both sides took the stance of improving relations, but the gap between them has not yet  been filled.  In August 2013, the U.S. expressed strong disapproval over Russia's decision to grant temporary  asylum to Snowden, a former U.S. intelligence agency employee[52]. Consequently, the U.S.  notified Russia of its intention to postpone the U.S.-Russia Summit scheduled to take place in  September the same year[53]. In relation to Syrian affairs, Russia expressed strong disapproval  over President Obama's announcement to take military action against Syria on the grounds that  the Syrian Government used chemical weapons. Russia successfully encouraged the al-Assad  regime of Syria to abandon all chemical weapons.  Russia strongly opposed the deployment plan of the MD system in Europe by the United States,  stating that it would have a negative impact on Russia’s nuclear deterrent capabilities. But in  September 2009, the United States announced that it was reviewing the proposed deployment of  the MD system in Europe[54], which was cautiously welcomed by Russia.  However, Russia’s understanding is that the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START)  effective from February 2011 would be invalidated if the United States developed, both  quantitatively and qualitatively, its MD capabilities and threatened Russia’s potential strategic  nuclear strength[55]. Russia also indicates that it would withdraw from the new START in  response to the United States’ recent advancement of its MD plan in Europe[56].  It is believed that Russia intends to establish a certain level of cooperative relationship in  military exchanges with the U.S. as exemplified by Russian naval vessels’ first participation in  RIMPAC conducted in the seas around Hawaii in July 2012. However, in light of Russia’s  52 Former U.S. intelligence agency employee Edward Snowden was charged with espionage for revealing domestic and international intelligence gathering practices by the U.S. Edward Snowden later sought asylum in Russia. 53 The U.S.-Russia Defense Ministers and Foreign Ministers meeting (Two-Plus-Two meeting) was held in Washington in August 2013 as scheduled. This was the first meeting of its kind since the Moscow meeting in March 2008 five-and-a-half years ago. 54 Refer to Part I, Chapter 1, Section 1 - 2 for the U.S. deployment plan of the MD system in Europe. 55 Statement by the Russian Federation concerning missile defense (April 8, 2010) 56 Russia has demanded a legal guarantee that the MD plan of the United States is not targeted at Russia, and claimed that the United States is not considering Russia’s concerns. Russia issued a Presidential statement in November 2011, mentioning countermeasures such as fielding of early-warning radars and the possibility of its withdrawal from the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. In addition, in November 2013, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that if the Geneva agreement on Iran’s nuclear issues was implemented, a U.S. MD system for Europe would not be needed.",page,263,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

Furthermore, the U.S. exhibited actions to  restrain Russia by dispatching a missile destroyer to the Black Sea as well as F-16 fighter jets to  Poland.  5 Relations with Europe and NATO  While the relationship between Russia and NATO temporarily deteriorated due to factors such  as the Russo-Georgian War, through the framework of the NATO-Russia Council (NRC), Russia  now participates to a certain extent in NATO decision-making and acts as an equal partner in  areas of mutual interest.  At the NRC summit held in Lisbon in November 2010, Russia and NATO stated that both sides  would work toward building a true and modernized strategic partnership. They are now  searching for possibilities of dialogue and cooperation in fields such as missile defense (MD),  Afghanistan, cooperation to fight terrorism, and anti-piracy measures. With regard to MD  cooperation, there has been no progress in the cooperation of Russia and NATO. For example,  the talks at the meeting of NRC defense ministers held in June 2011 highlighted the difference  in position between NATO advocating MD cooperation in which only information and data  would be exchanged under the two independent systems of NATO and Russia, and the position  of Russia aiming at “sector MD” in which both sides operate integrally by setting zones for each  country’s responsibility under a unified MD system of NATO and Russia.  Meanwhile, there remains the unsolved problem between Russia and NATO about the  Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) agreement[58]. In addition, NATO and European  countries decided in April 2014 to cease practical support including military aspects, excluding  the ambassador-level meetings of NRC, in response to Russia’s “annexation” of Crimea[59].  57 Following the occupation of the Crimean Peninsula by Russia, U.S. Department of Defense spokesperson Kirby announced in March 2014 that the U.S. will cease all military exchange with Russia including joint exercises with Russian forces, consultations, and port calls. 58 At the 1999 Istanbul summit of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), an agreement was reached on changing the troop ceilings set formerly by blocks to those set by country and territory and on complying with the current CFE Treaty until the adapted CFE Treaty comes into effect. Dissatisfied with NATO members having refused to ratify the adopted CFE Treaty due to Russian forces not withdrawing from Georgia and Moldova, although Russia had ratified it, in December 2007 Russia suspended the implementation of the CFE Treaty and halted inspections based on this treaty. At the time of writing, only four countries had ratified the adapted CFE Treaty—Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine—and it has not yet come into effect. Besides this, Russia has proposed dissolving the existing security framework that has NATO at its center and creating a new European security treaty that would provide new fundamental principles for security in Europe and the Atlantic region. 59 NATO issued a statement of condemnation over the Ukraine situation.

The country’s export value has been increasing in recent years[60]. In January 2007, the Russian  government granted the exclusive right to export arms to the Rosoboron Export State  Corporation as part of its ongoing initiatives to improve its export system. In addition, Russia  regards its military industry as an integral part of the nation’s military organization and is  committed to improving and further developing the military industry by such measures as  promoting the integration of aircraft companies such as Sukhoi, MiG, and Tupolev.  Russia has exported its fighter jets and warships to countries including India, ASEAN member  countries, China, Algeria, and Venezuela[61].  toward Russia. In addition to the cessation of military cooperation with Russia, the UK also announced halting of military equipment exports and the deployment of fighter jets for enhanced patrolling of the Baltic region’s airspace. Germany also expressed intentions to halt military equipment exports to Russia. 60 According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Russian arms exports between 2009 and 2013 increased by 28% compared to the period between 2004 and 2008. 61 Russia concluded sales contracts with Indonesia for the Su-27 and Su-30 fighters in 2003 and 2007, and with Malaysia and Vietnam for the Su-30 fighters in 2003, and has delivered the fighters to these countries. There are also reports of a sales contract with Vietnam in 2009 for the Su-30 fighters and Kilo-class submarines. In January 2014, the first of the Kilo-class submarines, “Hanoi,” arrived in Vietnam. With regard to India, aircraft carrier “Admiral Gorshkov,” which had been refurbished in Severodvinsk, was delivered to India, renamed as INS Vikramaditya, which arrived in India in January 2014.Moreover, in 2006, Russia concluded sales contracts with Algeria and Venezuela for arms, including Su-30 fighters, and has delivered some of these arms. Russia’s exports to China have included Su-27 and Su-30 fighters, Sovremenny-class destroyers, and Kilo-class submarines. However, against the backdrop of the advancement of indigenous weapon production in China, while some point out that the value of its exports to China has been declining, exports such as aircraft engines for repair purposes continue.",page,265,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

In the new Defense Strategic Guidance, the Obama Administration articulated a policy that would place the Asia  -  Pacific region at the focus of U.S. strategy, includ ing the security strategy (Rebalancing to the Asia Pacific Region). Furthermore, in March 2014 the Administration published the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the second review  _since President Obama took office. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense S trategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it, including rebalancing to the Asia -_ _Pacific region, indicating that the Obama Administration continues to place an emphasis on the region.

The QDR outlines policies concerning U.S. Forces' capabilities and composition in anticipation of the security environment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the Secretary of Defense submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it.  (1) Understanding of Security  she 2014 QDR states that the future international security environmen t remains uncertain and  _complicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between_ states, non- state entities and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly accelerating spread of information. In _addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals, and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces._  _The QDR recognizes t_ _hat the Asia_  -   Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce, politics and security.

In particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehe nsive scope of China’s military modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its longL range missile and weapons of  mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to th e United States.  As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of trans -  national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile states.

The report says that Europe remains the principal partner in promoting global security,  particularly in addressing challenges such as persistent unrest and violence in the  Middle East  and North Africa. The QDR states that while the United States is willing to undertake security cooperation with  Russia, both in the bilateral context and in seeking solutions to regional challenges, Russia’s  multi  -  dimensional defense modernization and actions that violate the sovereignty of neighbors present risks and thus the United States will engage Russia to increase transparency and reduce  the risk of military miscalculation.

In the meantime, activities in the South China Sea by the related countries aimed at territorial  claims are increasing. China enacted the Act on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone of  the Republic of China in 1992, in which it made clear claims to the territorial rights of the  Spratly Islands and the Paracel Islands. It attached the so-called “nine-dotted line” map in a  verbal note addressed to the United Nations in 2009, in which it made claims to the parts of the  South China Sea that purportedly came under China’s sovereignty, sovereign rights, and  jurisdiction. There were objections to the ambiguity behind the justifications to this “nine-dash  line” under international law, giving rise to territorial conflicts over the South China Sea  between Southeast Asian countries.  In recent years, Chinese naval vessels and public vessels affiliated to maritime law enforcement  agencies have been operating around the Scarborough Shoal and the Second Thomas Shoal,  close to the Philippines, as well as the James Shoal and the South Luconia Shoal areas close to  Malaysia. Furthermore, in June 2012, China announced the establishment of Sansha City in  Hainan Province, which it claims to have jurisdiction over the Spratly Islands, Paracel Islands,  the Macclesfield Bank, and their surrounding waters. In November 2013, Hainan Province  amended its regulations on the implementation of China’s fishing law to stipulate that foreign  fishing vessels that wish to carry out fishing activities in waters under the jurisdiction of Hainan  Province are required to obtain permission from the relevant departments under China’s State  Council.  From April to June 2012, Chinese law enforcement vessels and Philippines vessels, including a  Philippine Navy vessel faced off against each other in the sea area surrounding the Scarborough  Shoal. In June 2012, Vietnam adopted its Maritime Law (effective January 2013), which asserts  its sovereignty over the Spratly and the Paracel Islands. In March 2013, there were reports that  Chinese vessels had fired at Vietnamese fishing vessels.

Most recently, in January 2014, Chinese public vessels fired water cannons at  Philippines fishing vessels and chased these vessels out of the waters they were in the sea area  surrounding the Scarborough Shoal. In response, the government of the Philippines lodged a  protest with the Chinese government.  On top of that, in January 2013, the Philippines filed an arbitration procedure based on the  United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, concerning China’s claims and activities in  the South China Sea, but China notified the Philippines that it would not accept the Philippines’  request for arbitration and proposed bilateral negotiations instead[29].  In addition, in November 2013, a spokesman from the Ministry of National Defense of the  People’s Republic of China declared that China would be setting up other air identification  zones in the future, in addition to the East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone that it had  already established. In relation to this, in December of the same year, U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry stated that China should refrain from taking unilateral measures, including the  establishment of air defense identification zones in Asia and particularly in the airspace above  the South China Sea.  Peaceful solutions to the South China Sea disputes have been discussed at the various ASEAN  meetings. However, with the ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting held in July 2012 failing to  adopt a joint statement, some lack of consensus among the member states was observed.  However, there were also instances in which ASEAN adopted a unified response. For example,  ASEAN expressed “serious concerns” over the confrontations between Chinese and Vietnamese  vessels in the South China Sea at the ASEAN Summit and Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in May  2014.  The issue of territorial disputes in the South China Sea is a common matter of concern for the  whole international community, and is directly related to the peace and stability of the  Asia-Pacific region.

(1) Understanding of Security The 2014 QDR states that the future international security environmen  t remains un certain and com plicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between sta tes, non  -  state entities and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly accelerating spread of information. In addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals, and leverage s t he techn olog ical a nd huma n capital strengths of the U.S. Forces.  The QDR recognizes t  hat the Asia Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce, politics and security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the  region continues to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their milita  ry and  security capabilities, bringing greater risk that tensions arising from long- standing sovereign  disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In particul  ar, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehe  _nsive scope of China’s military_ modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its long _-_ _range missile and weapons of_  mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit   of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to th e United States.  As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of trans national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile states.

The QDR states that while the United States is willing to undertake security cooperation with  Russia, both in the bilateral context and in seeking solutions to regional challenges, Russia’s multi dimensional defense moderniza tion and actions that violate the sovereignty of neighbors  present risks and thus the United States will engage Russia to increase transparency and reduce the risk of military miscalculation.

Meanwhile, as the growing budget deficits of the U.S. government in recent years have called for deep cuts in spending, in January 2012 the Department of Defense announced that the  reduction in defense spending will amount to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from FY2012 to FY2021 —.

The QDR outlines policies concerning U.S. Forces' capabilities and composition in anticipation  of the security environment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the Secretary of Defen  se submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds  on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it.  (1) Un ders tandin g of Secur ity  The 2014 QDR states that the future international security environment remains uncertain and complicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between  states, non-state entities and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly accelerating spread of information. In addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states  that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals, and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces.  The QDR rec ognizes t hat t he Asia  -  Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce, po litic s a nd security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the  region c ontin ues to rise an d c ountries within t he region cont inue t o enhance their milita  ry and securi ty capabi lities, bringing greater risk that tensions arising from long[-]standing sovereign disputes or clai ms to natu ral resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In  particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehe[nsive scope of China’s military ]modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its  long -  rang e mi ssile and weap ons of  mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to  peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to [th]e United States.  As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of trans - national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate  into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile states. The report states that Iran remains a destabilizing actor that threatens security by defying international law and pursing capabilities that would allow it to develop nuclear weapons. Even as Iran pledges not to pursue nuclear -related responsibilities of NATO. The document has so far been formulated seven times (1949, 1952, 1957, 1968, 1991, 1999, and 2010). 5 At present, the contribution of the United States accounts for 70% of the total defense budget of all NATO member states. In the deployment of military forces in Libya led by the EU in 2011, it became clear that EU countries lack operation execution capabilities, in particular, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, for which they had to depend on the United States. 6 At the NATO summit meeting held in Lisbon in November 2010, the allies committed to focus their investment on 11 prioritized areas, including missile defense, cyber defense, medical assistance, and intelligence activities. 7 It indicates that every member state does not necessarily need to possess all defense capabilities, but each nation specializes in areas where it has strength, and shares it among the Allied nations. As an example already in practice, the Baltic states depend on air policing operations by NATO allies and make certain contributions to the ISAF mission in Afghanistan, instead of abandoning the investment in procurement and maintenance of expensive aircraft. 8 Although the details are not fully known, it seems to indicate that NATO acquired limited capability against missiles by installing command and control functions that link interceptors and radars. 9 NATO has continuously been developing its unique Theater Missile Defense system since 2005, called",page,296,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

Furthermore, it states that as coun tries in the Middle East and Africa undergo political and social  change, terrorist groups seek to expand their influence, and internal strife in Syria has become a  magnet for global jihad, bringing ongoing spillover effects including an influx of foreign f  ighters and a flood of refugees into neighboring countries.

The report sa ys that Europe remains the principal partner in promoting global security, particularly in addressing challenges such as persistent unrest and violence in the Middl e Eas t  and North Af ric a.  The QDR states that while the United States is willing to undertake security cooperation with  Russia, both in the bilateral context and in seeking solutions to regional challenges, Russia’s  multi  -  dimensional defense modernization and actions that violate the sovereignty of neighbors present risks and thus the United States will engage Russia to increase transparency and reduce  the risk of mil itar y mi scalc ulation.  Concerning the global trends, the report refers to the emergence of international partners with the capacity to play secur ity roles in t heir r espective r egio ns, as well as international  cooperation and shared norms of behavior at unprecedented levels of global interconnectedness. At the same time it also states that t  he spread and proliferation of technology offers new tools for state and nonstate adversaries such as terrorists to pursue asymmetric approaches in the 21st century operational environment. Furthermore, the report states that in coming years, countries such as China will continues seeking to counter U.S. strengths using anti -  access and area  -  denial (A2/AD) approacheswise manner, towards establishing a wide and by employing other new cyber and space control technologies. It also  says that elements such as cyberspace, space, sophisticated technology, WMD, terrorism and climate change poses additional challenges. (2) Defense Strategy The 2014 QDR emphasizes the following three pillars, which are interdependent and mutually See Part I Overview, Section 2, footnote 4 11 The EU, although it has a property of non-binding multilateral cooperation, introduced the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), which covers all areas of foreign and security policy, based on the Treaty of Maastricht, which took effect in 1993. In June 1999, the European Council decided to implement the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) to offer peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance activities in conflict areas, as a part of the CFSP framework. The Treaty of Lisbon, made effective in 2009, renamed the ESDP the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and clearly positioned it as an integral part of the CFSP. 12 The European Defence Agency, an organization established to improve the EU’s defense capabilities, reports that the military operations in Libya and elsewhere revealed the EU’s lack of air-to-air refueling capability and precision-guided weapons, and its dependency on the United States.",page,297,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

The United States Code mandates that the Secretary of Defen se submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds  on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it.  (1) Understanding of Security  The 2014 QDR states that the future international security environmen t rema ins unce rtai n and  compli cat ed due to the shifting internationa l bal ance of powe r; the gr eate r interaction between sta tes, non  -   state ent ities and priva te c itizens; th e p roliferati on o f technology; a nd the rapid ly  accelerating spread o f info rmation . I n  addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals, and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces.  The QDR recognizes t  hat the Asia -   oacific region is increasingly central to global commerce, politics and security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the region continues to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their military and  _security capabilities, bringing greater risk that tensions arising from long -standing sovereign disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehensive scope of China’s military modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its long-_ _range missile and weapons of_  mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit  of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to  th e United States. As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of  trans  -  national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile states.

Out of these PKOs, there are 12 PKOs in the Middle East and Africa. Ten PKOs are granted robust authorization by Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter. (See Fig. I-2-4-1) 4 “A New Partnership Agenda Charting a New Horizon For U.N. Peacekeeping” was published in July 2009 to evaluate major policy and strategic dilemmas faced by U.N.

In Africa, it mentions that terrorists, criminal organizations and pirates exploit ungoverned and under[-]governed territory, causing potential for rapidly developing threats, particularly of terror  ist attacks in fragile states, that  could pos e acute c hall enges to U.S. inter ests.  The report says that Europe remains the principal partner in promoting global security,  particularly in addressing challenges such as persistent unrest and violence in the Middle East  and North Africa.  The QDR states that while the United States is willing to undertake security cooperation with [Russia, both in the bilateral context and in seeking solutions to regional challenges, Russia’s ]multi dimensional defense moderniza  tio n an d act ions th at viola te the sov ere ignty of neig hbors  present risks and thus the United States will engage Russia to increase transparency and reduce  the risk of m ilitary mi scal culat ion.  Concerning th e glo bal tr ends, the report refers to the emergence of intern atio nal partners wi th  the capacity to play security roles in their respective regions, as well as international  cooperation and shared norms of behavior at unprecedented levels of global interconnectedness.  At the same time it also states that t  he spread and proliferation of technology offers new tools for state and non - state adversaries such as terrorists to pursue asymmetric approaches in the 21  st  century operational environment. Furthermore, the report states that in coming years, countries su ch as China will continues seeking to counter U.S. strengths using anti -  access and area  -denial (A2/AD) approaches hanistan” (November 2013) by   and by employing other new cyber and space control technologies.

The QDR also says that while the force will become s  malle r, it will become more modern as well, with rea din es s improvin g. F urthermore, it states that particularly in an era of  reduced budget and other resources, the Department will redouble its efforts to protect key  capability areas listed below, that are  most closely aligned to the pillars of the defense strategy.  1) Mi ssile defense: Increase the number of Ground Based Interceptors and build depth into the  sensor network.

In November 2011, U.S. President Obama delivered a speech in the Australian  Parliament, clearly stating, for the first time, that he will give top priority to the U.S. presence and mission in the Asia Pacific region and indicating that the U.S. will maintain its strong presence in Japan and the Korean Peninsula, while enhancing its presence in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, the 2014 QDR states that the centerpiece of the Department of Defense commitment to the rebalance toward the Asia-Pacific r egion is to modernize and enhance security alliances with Australia, Japan, the ROK, the Philippines and Thailand.   18 Some of the implications anticipated in the case of the return of the sequester level cuts include a reduction in end strength of active Army to 420,000, retirement of the USS George Washington aircra  ft carrier (10 aircraft carriers), a reduction in end strength of marine corps to 175,000, a further retirement of",page,308,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

This resolution also  requested the authority of the “Mission for the consolidation of peace in Central African  Republic” (MICOPAX), a mission implemented in the country by the leadership of the ECCAS,  to be transferred to the MISCA, and suggested that the MISCA could eventually develop into a  U.N.

The QDR outlines policies concerning U.S. Forces' capabilities and composition in anticipation [of the security environment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the ]Secretary of Defen se submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it.  (1) Underst anding of Secur ity Th e 2 014 QDR st ates that the future international security environment remains uncertain and  complicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between  states, non  -  sta te entit ies and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly  accelerati ng spr ead of in formation . In  addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals,  and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces.  The QDR recognizes that the Asia Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce,  politics and security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the region continues to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their milita  ry and  security capabilities, bringing greater risk that tensions arising from long-standing sovereign [disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In ]particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehe nsive scope of China’s military  modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its  long  -   range missile and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to  th  e United States. As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of trans -  national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile  states. The report states that Iran remains a destabilizing actor that threatens security by defying international law and pursing capabilities that would allow it to develop nuclear weapons. Even as Iran pledges not to pursue nuclear The treaty stipulates that both countries are to reduce the number of deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 and the number of deployed delivery vehicles to 700 by seven years following the treaty’s enactment. In April 2014, the U.S. reported that the country had deployed 1,585 strategic nuclear warheads and 778 transportation units, while Russia reported that it had deployed 1,512 strategic nuclear warheads and 498 transportation units. These numbers show data as of March 1, 2013. 8 Nuclear forensics aims to provide evidence for prosecution of perpetrators of illicit trade or malicious use through identification of the source of detected nuclear materials and other radioactive substances 9 Regarding this proposal, Russia explained its position by saying that it needs to consider all elements impacting strategic stability including missile defense, space weapons and non-nuclear strategic weapons and that negotiations concerning the further reduction of nuclear weapons require a multilateral framework involving all countries that have nuclear weapons.",page,317,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

In Africa, it mentions that terrorists,  criminal organizations and pirates exploit ungoverned and under governed territory, causing potential for rapidly developing threats, particularly of terrorist attacks in fragile states, that could pose acute challenges to U.S. interests. The report says that Europe remains the principal partner in promoting global security,  part icularly in ad dressing challenges such as persistent unrest and violence in the [Middle East ]and North Africa.  The QDR states that while the United States is willing to undertake security cooperation with Russia, both in the bilateral context and in seeking solutions to regional challenges, Russia’s multi -  dimensional defense modernization and actions that violate the sovereignty of neighbors present risks and thus the United States will engage Russia to increase transparency and reduce  the risk of military miscalculation.  Concerning the global trends, the report refers to the emergence of international partners with  the capa city to p lay se curity roles in t heir respe cti ve r egions, as wel l as int ernat ional  cooperation and shared norms of behavior at unprecedented levels of global interconnectedness.

It also  says that elements such as cyberspace, space, sophisticated technolo gy, WMD, terrorism and climate change poses additional challenges.

The QDR outlines policies concerning U.S. Forces' capabilities and composition in anticipation  of the security environment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the [Secretary of Defen]se submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it.

In addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals,  and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces.  The QDR recognizes that the Asia  _-_ `Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce, politics and security.

The QDR outlines policies concerning U.S. Forces' capabilities and composition in anticipation  **of the security environment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the Secretary of Defen** **se submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds**  on the 2012 Defense Strate gic Gu idance a nd em bodies the prior ities ou tlin ed in it.  (1) Understanding of Security The 2014 QDR states that the future international security environment remains uncertain and  complicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between  state s, non  -  state e ntit ies and p rivate cit izens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly  accelerat ing spr ead of informa tion. In ad dressi ng this chal len gin g environment, the QDR states  that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals, [and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces.]  The QDR recognizes that the Asia  -  Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce, po liti cs and se cu rity. A t the same ti me, the r eport po in ts out that defense expenditure in the  region continues to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their milita  ry and security capabilities, bringing greater risk that tensions arising from long[-]standing sovereign  disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In  particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehensive scope of China’s military modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its longrange missile and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to th e United States.  As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of trans - national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile  states. The report states that Iran remains a  destabilizing actor that threatens security by defying international law and pursing capabilities that would allow it to develop nuclear weapons. Even as Iran pledges not to pursue nuclear People's Republic of China” in May 2013, stating that part of the cyber attacks targeting the U.S. Government in 2012 are considered to be directly attributable to the Chinese Government and armed forces. In June 2013, U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel made a statement at the Asia Security Summit (Shangri-La Dialogue) that a part of cyber attacks are related to the Chinese Government and armed forces. 4 In a report at the 18th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, then President Hu Jintao remarked that China would pay serious consideration to maritime, outer space and cyber space security. 5 An annual report released in 2009 by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission stated that the PLA was hiring personnel with expert skills concerning computers from among private companies and the academic circles, established an information warfare militia, and was conducting exercises using cyberspace. The report also pointed out the possibility that the PLA was hiring personnel from the hacker community. 6 “APT 1: Exposing One of China's Cyber Espionage Units,” released in February 2013 by Mandiant, a U.S. information security company, concluded that the most active cyber attack group targeting the United States and other countries was Unit 61398 under the PLA General Staff Department Third Department.",page,337,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

The repo rt says tha t Europe r emains the pr incipal pa rtne r in promo ting global sec urity,  particularl y in addre ssing challen ges s uch as pe rsistent unrest and viol enc e in t he  Middle East and North Africa.  The QDR states that while the United States is willing to undertake security cooperation with Russia, both in the bilateral context and in seeking solutions to regional challenges, Russia’s multi -  dimensional defense modernization and actions that violate the sovereignty of neighbors present risks and thus the United States will engage Russia to increase transparency and reduce the risk of military miscalculation.  Concerning the global trends, the report refers to the emergenc e of international partners with the capacity to play security roles in their respective regions, as well as international cooperation and shared norms of behavior at unprecedented levels of global interconnectedness. At the same time it also states that the spread and proliferation of technology offers new tools  for state and non- state adversaries such as terrorists to pursue asymmetric approaches in the 21 st  century operational environment. Furthermore, the report states that in coming years, countries su ch as China will continues seeking to counter U.S. strengths using anti  -access and area denial (A2/AD) approaches  Department of Defense that appeared to be originating in Russia. News agency Reuters reported in June and by employing other new cyber and space control technologies.

MSIP is a central government agency overseeing administration related to science and technology policies and Information and Communication Technology (ICT). This agency was established in March 2013 by transferring science and technology tasks handled by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, and part of the tasks handled by the Korea Communications Commission and the Ministry of Knowledge Economy. 12 For example, a North Korean defector association in the Republic of Korea, “NK Intellectual",page,338,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

(1) Protect the Homeland: Maintain the capability to deter and defeat attacks on the United  States. Protection of the hom eland includes assisting U.S. civil authorities in protecting U.S. airspace, shores, and borders, and in responding effectively to domestic disasters.  (2) Build security globally: Continue a strong U.S. commitment to shaping world events in  order to deter and prevent conflict and to assure the allies and partners of the shared security.  (3) Project pow er and win d eci sively: the U.S. Forces de ter ac ts of aggression in one or more theat ers by remaining capable of decisively defeating adversaries, while proje  cting power to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.  The QDR states that across the three pillars, the U.S. Forces are capable of simultaneously  implementing the following undertakings, and if deterrence fails at any given time, U.S. forces  could defeat a regional adversary in a large  -  scale multi  phased campaign, and deny the  **objectives of—** **or imposing unacceptable costs on**  —  another aggressor in another region 2011, and pr.  1) Defending homeland  2) Conducting sustained, distributed counterterrorist opera tions 3) Deterring aggression and assuring allies through forward presence and engagement in multiple regions.  Furthermore, in order to achieve the three pillars, the Department of Defense seeks innovative  approaches to how to fight, how to posture the force, and how to leverage the asymmetric strengths and technological advantages. More specifically, the QDR mentions positioning additional forward -  deployed naval forces in critical areas, such as the Asia -   Pacific region, and deploying new combinations of ships, aviation assets, and crisis response forces.

The QDR also says that while the force will become smaller, it will become more  modern as well, with readiness improving. Furthermore, it states that particularly in an era of  reduced budget and other resources, the Department will redouble its efforts to protect key capability areas listed below, that are most closely aligned to the pillars of the defense strategy.  1) Missile def ense: Increase the number of Ground  Based Interceptors and build depth into the  sensor network. Deploy a second radar in Japan that will improve early warning and tracking of [any m]issiles launched by North Korea. Increase defense interceptor reliability and effectiveness to improve discrimination capabilities, and to establish a more robust sensor network.

The Japanese people desire lasting peace,  and the principle of pacifism is enshrined in the Constitution, of which Article 9 prescribes the  renunciation of war, the possession of war potential, and the right of belligerency by the state.  Of course, since Japan is an independent nation, these provisions do not deny Japan’s inherent  right of self-defense as a sovereign state. Since the right of self-defense is not denied, the  Japanese Government interprets this to mean that the Constitution allows Japan to possess the  minimum level of armed force needed to exercise that right. Therefore, Japan, under the  Constitution, maintains the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) as an armed organization, holding its  exclusively national defense-oriented policy as its basic strategy of defense, and continues to  keep it equipped and ready for operations.  1 Security and Defense Policies  Despite its changing influence in relative terms, the United States remains the world's most  powerf ul n ation, and it is bel iev ed to cons ist ently pl ay a sign  ificant role in ensuring peace and  stability throughout the world.

In  addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals, and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces.  The QDR recogn izes t  hat the Asia  -  Pacific regi on is increasi ng ly centr al to global commerce, politics and security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the  region continu es to rise and countr ies within the re gio n continue to enhanc e th eir m ili ta  ry and  security capabilities, bringing greater risk that tensions arising from long standing sovereign disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehe  nsive scope o f China’s military modernization cont inues, combi ned w ith a relative lac k of transpar  ency and openness regarding both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its  long  -  range missile and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to  th e United States.  As for the Middle Eas t, t he re port suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of tran s  -   national divisio n, while compe tition for resource s will worsen tensions and could esc alate  into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile  states. The report states that Iran remains a  destabilizing actor that threatens security by defying international law and pursing capabilities that would allow it to develop nuclear weapons. Even as Iran pledges not to pursue nuclear .  **2 Japan’s Basic Defense Policy**  1 The ability to maintain organizational functions in the event of an enemy attack on bases or facilities.",page,383,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

Furthermore, it states that as coun trie s in the Midd le East a nd Africa un  dergo political and social  change, terrorist groups seek to expand their influence, and internal strife in Syria has become a magnet for global jihad, bringing ongoing spillover effects including an influx of foreign f  ighters and a flood of refugees into neighboring countries. In Africa, it mentions that terrorists,  criminal organizations and pirates exploit ungoverned and under  -   governed territory, causing potential for rapidly developing threats, particularly of terror  ist attacks in fragile states, that  could pose acute challenges to U.S. interests.  The report says that Europe remains the principal partner in promoting global security, particularly in addressing challenges such as persistent unrest and violence in the  Middle East and North Africa.  The QDR states that while the United States is willing to undertake security cooperation with Russia, both in the bilateral context and in seeking solutions to regional challenges, Russia’s multi  -  dimensional defense moderniza tion and actions that violate the sovereignty of neighbors",page,384,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

(1) Protect the Homeland: Maintain the capability to deter and defeat attacks on the United States. Protection of the hom  eland includes assisting U.S. civil authorities in protecting U.S.  airspace, shores, and borders, and in responding effectively to domestic disasters. (2) Build security globally: Continue a strong U.S. commitment to shaping world events in order to deter  and prevent conflict and to assure the allies and partners of the shared security.  (3) Project power and win decisively: the U.S. Forces deter acts of aggression in one or more  theaters by remaining capable of decisively defeating adversaries, while proje  cting power to  provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.  The QDR states that across the three pillars, the U.S. Forces are capable of simultaneously implementing the following undertakings, and if deterrence fails at any given time, U.S. forces  could defeat a regional adversary in a large-scale multi -  phased campaign, and deny the  objectives of  — or imposing unacceptable costs on—another aggressor in another regionBuilding of a Dynamic Joint Defense.  1) D efen ding homeland 2) C ondu cting sus tained, di str ibuted co  unterterrorist opera  tions  3) Deterrin g aggres sion a nd assuring allies through forward presence and engagement in multiple regions.

The QDR also says that while the force will become s maller, it w ill beco me mor e  modern as well, with readiness improving. Furthermore, it states that particularly in an era of  reduced budget and other resources, the Department will redouble its efforts to protect key capability areas listed below, that are most closely aligned to the pillars of the defense strategy.  1) Missile defense: Increase the number of Ground  -   Based Interceptors and build depth into the sensor network. Deploy a second radar in Japan that will improve early warning and tracking of any m issiles launched by North Korea. Increase defense interceptor reliability and effectiveness to improve discrimination capabilities, and to establish a more robust sensor network. Study the best location in the United States for an additional missile defens  e interceptor site.  2) Nuclear deterrence: Continue to invest in modernizing the essential nuclear delivery systems,  warheads, command and control, and nuclear weapon infrastructure. 3) Cyber: Develop the Cyber Mission Force that operates and defends the Department networks  and su pport s milit ary operations worl dwide by 20 16.

In November 2011, U.S. President Obama delivered a speech in the Australian Parliament, clearly stating, for the first time, that he will give top priority to the U.S. presence and mission in the Asia-Pacific region and indicating that the U.  S. will maintain its strong  presence in Japan and the Korean Peninsula, while enhancing its presence in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, the 2014 QDR states that the centerpiece of the Department of Defense  commitment to the rebalance toward the Asia  -   Pacific r egion is to modernize and enhance security alliances with Australia, Japan, the ROK, the Philippines and Thailand.

The Pacific Command is a command with regional responsibilities and is responsible for the largest geographical area. The U. S. Force s station e d in the ROK and Japan fall under the control of the Pacific Command.  Furthermore, in order to broaden the perspective of the U.S. Forces and promote better understanding of the U.S. Forces from allies, the Pacific Command headquarters accept personnel from allies in the region.

Therefore, the GSDF will maintain rapidly  deployable basic operational units (rapid deployment divisions, rapid deployment brigades, and  an armored division) furnished with advanced mobility and ISR capabilities. In addition, the  GSDF will maintain mobile operating units sustaining specialized functions in order to  effectively perform amphibious and other operations. The GSDF will maintain half of these  units in Hokkaido, given its excellent training environment there.  The GSDF will review the organization and equipment with a particular focus on  tanks/howitzers and rockets. Following thorough rationalization and streamlining, these units  will be deployed appropriately, according to geographical characteristics.  The number of GSDF personnel will be maintained at around 159,000, which was the same  level as at the end of FY2013, in order to ensure sufficient personnel available to respond to  major disasters or other situations.

It will also maintain the augmented submarine fleet as well as patrol  aircraft units in order to patrol surrounding waters[6] and carry out defense operations effectively.  (3) Air Self-Defense Forces (ASDF)  The ASDF will maintain air warning and control units in order to provide persistent ISR in most  air space over Japan and the surrounding areas. By consolidating warning and control  operations at air defense command centers, the ASDF will gradually change warning groups  into warning squadrons as well as establish one new squadron in the air warning unit[7].  As for Fighter Aircraft Units, the 13[th] squadron will be newly established, and Air  Reconnaissance Unit will be abolished. In addition, one squadron will be added to the Aerial  Refueling/Transport Unit, making it a two-squadron architecture.

In order to strengthen the integrated operations structure, the SDF will  enhance education and training, and, through secondments to the Joint Staff and relevant  ministries and agencies, retain personnel who can respond flexibly and rapidly to various  situations.  In light of the deterioration of the recruiting environment, the SDF will promote a diverse range  of recruitment measures to spread the perception that the SDF is an attractive job option.  Furthermore, as it is the responsibility of the Government of Japan to secure the livelihoods of  the SDF personnel, who are compelled to retire at a younger age than ordinary civil servants, the  SDF will promote support for re-employment by strengthening collaboration with local  governments and relevant organizations. Furthermore, in order to support sustainable operation  of units, the SDF will promote utilization of reserve personnel in broad areas, including those  with professional skills, and take measures to improve the sufficiency of reserve personnel.  4 Medical  The SDF will establish an efficient and high-quality medical care structure, through endeavors  including upgrading of SDF hospitals into hubs with enhanced functions, and improvements in  the management of the National Defense Medical College Hospital.

Based on the understanding that the United States is at an inflection point due to factors both insid  e and outside the country, that is, the U.S. Forces’ withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan after a decade of war and the demand for deep cuts in  government spending including defense spending under the government’s serious fiscal  situation, the guidance was  developed to review defense priorities and present a blueprint for the Joint Force in 2020. In the new Defense Strategic Guidance, the Obama Administration  **articulated a policy that would place the Asia**  **-Pacific region at the focus of U.S. strategy, includ** **ing the security strategy (Rebalancing to the Asia**  -   Pacific Region). Furthermore, in March 2014 the Administration published the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the second review since President Obama took office. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it, including rebalancing to the Asia  -   Paci fic  region, indicating that the Obama Administration continues to place an emphasis on the region.  Meanwhile, as the growing budget deficits of the U.S. government in recent years have called for deep cuts in spending, in January 2012 the Department of Defense announced that the  reduction in defense spending will amount to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from  FY2012 to FY2021  and following deliberat. In addition, the g  overnment budget sequestration Cabinet on December 17, 2013., including defense  spending, was initiated in March 2013, bringing various impacts on the U.S. Forces including  **suspension of training, delayed deployment of aircraft carriers, and grounding of air squadrons. Although the Bi**  partisan Budget Act of the Democratic and Republican parties mitigated the sequestration spending cuts for FY2014 and FY2015, the QDR emphasizes that the risks to the U.S. Forces would increase considerably if sequester  -   level cuts ret urn i n FY2016.

The QDR outlines policies concerning U.S. Forces' capabilities and composition in anticipation of the security environment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the  Secretary of Defen  **se submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it.**  (1) Understanding of Security  The 2014 QDR states that the future international security environment remains uncertain and  complicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between states, non  -   state entities and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly accelerating spread of information. In  addressing this ch allenging env ironment, th e QDR states that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals, and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces.

(1) Protect the Homeland: Maintain the capability to deter and defeat attacks on the United  _States. Protection of the hom eland includes assisting U.S. civil authorities in protecting U.S. airspace, shores, and borders, and in responding effectively to domestic disasters._ _(2) Build security globally: Continue a strong U.S. commitment to shaping world events in order to deter and prevent conflict and to assure the allies and partners of the shared security. (3) Project power and win decisively: the U.S. Forces deter acts of aggression in one or more theaters by remai ning capable of decisively de feating adversaries, while projecting power to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. The QDR states that across the three pillars, the U.S. Forces are capable of simultaneously implementing the following undertakings, and if deterrence fails at any given time, U.S. forces_  _could defeat a regional adversary in a large_  -   scale multi -phased campaign, and deny the objectives of  — or imposing unacceptable costs on  —  another aggressor in another region-.  1) Defendin g homeland 2) Conduc ting sustai ned, d istr ibute d counterterrorist opera  tions  3) Deterring aggression and assuring allies through forward presence and engagement in  multiple regions.

The QDR also says that while the force will become s  maller, it will become mor e modern as well, with readiness improving. Furthermore, it states that particularly in an era of  reduced budget and other resources, the Department will redouble its efforts to protect key capability areas listed below, that are  most closely aligned to the pillars of the defense strategy.  1) Missile defense: Increase the number of Ground Based Interceptors and build depth into the  sensor network. Deploy a second radar in Japan that will improve early warning and tracking of any m issiles launched by North Korea. Increase defense interceptor reliability and effectiveness  to improve discrimination capabilities, and to establish a more robust sensor network. Study the  best location in the United States for an additional missile defense interceptor site.  2) Nuclear deterrence: Continue to invest in modernizing the essential nuclear delivery systems,  warheads, command and control, and nuclear weapon infrastructure.  3) Cyber: Develop the Cyber Mission Force that operates and defends the D  epartment networks and supports military operations worldwide by 2016. In addition, the Department migrates its  information systems to a common, Defense -wide network infrastructure known as the Joint Information Environment.  4) Space: Diversify and expand the coverage of Space Situational Awareness (SSA)  Secure capabilities for swift and large throug h internation al partnerships. In the near  -  term, investment in technology demonstrations and  _capabilities required to evolve toward more resilient architectures. Additionally, accelerate initiatives to counter adversary space capabilities including adversary intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), and space-enabled precision strike.

In November 2011, U.S. President Obama delivered a speech in the Australian  oarliament, clearly stating, for the first time, that he will give top priority to the U.S. presence and mission in the Asia  -   Pacific region and indicating that the U.S. will maintain its strong presence in Japan and the Korean Peninsula, while enhancing its presence in Southeast Asia.

At the same time, the United States will manage the compet itive aspects of China- U.S. relations in ways that improve regional peace and stability consistent with int erna tional norms and principles.  3 Nu clea r Str ategy  While U.S. President Obama aims to realize a world without nuclear weapons, he notes that this w ill not be realized in the near future, and indicates the need to maintain a nuclear deterrent as  long as nuclear weapons exist.  The Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), which was released in April 2010, indicates that the nuclear security environment is changing and nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation are an imminent threat today. Furthermore, it points to the necessity of working on the issue of  _ensuring strategic stability with existing nuclear powers, in particular Russia and China._ _estab lish a rotational presence of up to a 2,500-person Marine Air-Ground Task Force including aircraft, ground vehicles, and artilleries over a few years.

In addition, the government will conduct various simulation exercise and  comprehensive training and exercises regarding various situations on a regular basis in a  tailored manner.  (2) Operations Infrastructure  The SDF will enhance the resiliency of military camps and bases, and in particular, strengthen  its capabilities to immediately rebuild various camp and base support functions such as the  maintenance of runways and information-communication infrastructure.

See ▶  Part I, Chapter 2, Section 2-1 (Nuclear Weapons)  4 FY 2015 Budg et  As the budget deficit of the U.S. Government is deepening in recent years, the Budget Control Act enacted in August 2011 established a deep cut in government spending by FY2021. In  January 2012, the DoD announced that the reduction in defense spending in light of the act will amount to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from FY2012 to FY2021 (about 259 billion dollars over the five years from FY2013 to FY2017).  The Bipartisan Budget Act by the Democratic and Republican parties which passed in December 2013 mitigated the sequestration  caps for  FY2014 and FY2015. The FY2015 budget request that was announced following the Act  includes 495.6 billion dollars  their mi  to fund bas e defen se p rograms. Fo r Overseas Contingen cy  Operations, the budget includes 58.6 billion dollars, an amount that is 20.9  billion dollars less  than the amount in the FY2014 budget request, reflecting the plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. The key principles of the defense budget are as follows: (1) Seek a balanced force; (2) Prepare for prolonged readiness challenges including uncertain fiscal outlook; (3) Continue to focus on institutional reform; and (4) Pursue compensation changes. Major decisions include a reduction of end strength of active Army from the current 520,000 down to 440,000  -  450,000  personnel, maintaini  ng 1 1 aircraft carr iers of th e Nav y, a comm itment to t he F  -  35 development and procurement program, and retirement of all A  -   10 tactical f ighte rs a nd U -   2 re connaissan ce aircraft.

The QDR outlines policies concerning U.S. Forces' capabilities and composition in anticipation of the security environment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the Se cretary of Def en_ _se submits the QDR to the Congress every four years.

(1) Understanding of Security The 2014 QDR states that the future international security environment remains uncertain and_  _complicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between states, non_  **-**  state enti ties and private cit izens; th e pr oliferation of tec hnology; a nd th e r apidly  accelerating spread of information. In  addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states  that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals,  and leve rages the technol ogi cal a nd human cap ital strengths of the U. S. Forces.  `The QDR recognizes that the Asia -` _Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce, politics and security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the_  _region continues to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their military and_  security capabilities, bringing greater risk that tensions arising from long  -  standing sovereign  disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehe nsive scope of China’s military modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its  long- range missile and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit  of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to th e United States.  As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of trans -  national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile  states.

Furthermore, in order to secure capabilities for swift and large-scale transportation and  deployment of units, initiatives are underway to enhance the maneuver deployment capabilities,  through the improvement of transport vessels and introduction of tilt-rotor aircraft.  In order to land, recapture and secure without delay any remote islands that might be invaded,  the GSDF will possess amphibious vehicles, and would introduce amphibious rapid deployment  brigades (provisional name) with sufficient amphibious operational capabilities. As well as  increasing the capacity to direct precision-guided bombs and improving surface-to-surface  missiles, the GSDF will advance its initiatives in development to increase the capabilities of  surface-to-ship missiles, in areas such as increasing their range.  In addition, in the southwest and other regions, the SDF conducts various training and exercises  with the objective of improving the joint operation capabilities of the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF,  and of deterring and dealing with attacks aimed at the island region, and is also actively  involved in field training exercises with U.S. Forces aimed at developing the capability to  efficiently execute operations and establishing mutual coordination procedures. The GSDF  began implementing this in 2006. In February 2014, in California, the GSDF and US Marines  conducted a field training exercise (Iron Fist) and have been working to improve amphibious  operational capability. From May through June 2013, the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF participated  for the first time in a joint exercise that has been held for some time on the western coast of the  United States, called “Dawn Blitz.” As a part of the first joint U.S.-Japan training overseas",page,425,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

In June 2013, U.S. President Obama delivered a speech on the reduction of nuclear weapons in  Berlin, which was then followed by the release of the Report on Nuclear Employment Strategy by the Department of Defense on the same day.

The key principles of the defense budget are as follows: (1) Seek a balanced force; (2) Prepare for prolonged readiness challenges including uncertain fiscal outlook; (3) Continue to focus on institutional reform; and (4) Pursue compensation changes. Major decisions include a reduction of end strength of active Army from the current 520,000 down to 440,000-_ _450,000_  personnel, maintaini  ng 11 aircraft carriers of the Navy, a commitment to the F 35 development and procurement program, and retirement of all A  J 10 tactical fighters and U 2 reconnaissance aircraft.

On homeland defense, the review noted that the U.S. would use ground-based interceptors to respond to ICBMs from North Korea and Iran, and that in regard to regional defense, the U.S. would expand investments in MD systems while taking a phased adaptive approach (PAA) that is tailored to each region and improve the MD capabilities step by step, working with partner countries and properly sharing the burden. However, in January 2012, the U.S. announced that it will continue investments in MD programs in its homeland and Europe while reducing the spending for deployable regional MD systems with a view to increasing reliance on its allies and partners in the future. Further, in March 2013, the U.S. announced that it will additionally deploy ground_  -   based interceptors in the U.S. homeland and mobile radars for BMD in Japan in order to bolster homeland security in response to North  Korea’s nuclear test and the advancement of its long -   ran ge ba llistic mi ssile dev elo pment, while [restructuring the program of the standard missile (SM] 3) Block IIB scheduled for depl oy ment in Europ e.

The Pacific Command is a command with regional responsibilities and is responsible for the largest geographical area. The U.S. Forces statione  d in the ROK and Japan fall under the control of the Pacific Command. Furthermore, in order to broaden the perspective of the U.S. Forces and promote better  _understanding of the U.S. Forces from allies, the Pacific Command headquarters accept_ `personnel from allies in the region. Under this scheme, personnel from Canada and Australia are currently serving in the Pacific Command as deputy director level-officials.` _The Pacific Command consists of the U.S. Army Pacific, U.S. Pacific Fleet, U.S. Marine Forces P_ _acific, and U.S. Pacific Air Forces, which are all headquartered in Hawaii_  .  The U.S. A rmy Pa cific (USARPAC) is composed of two divisions and deploys such forces as the 2 5th Infantr y Division in Hawaii and the 2nd Infantry Division and 19th Sustainment bo mmand in t he ROK, in addition to about 2,300 personnel in Japan, including the I Corps  (Forward) headquarters and the headquarters, U.S. Army Japan[13]. The U.S. Pacific Fleet consists of the Seventh Fleet, which is responsible for the western Pacific  and th e Indian Ocean, and the Third Fleet, responsible for the East Pacific and Bering Sea. The U.S. Pacific in total controls about 180 vessels. The Seventh Fleet is centered on a carrier strike group with main stationing locations in Japan and Guam. Their mission is to defend territorial lands, people and sea lines of communication and the critical national interests of the U.S. and its allies. The fleet consists of aircraft carriers, amphibious ships and the Aegis combat system. The U.S. Pacific Maritime Corps deploys one Marine Expeditionary Force each in the U.S. mainland and Japan. Of this force, about 16,000 personnel are in the 3rd Marine Division and the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, which are equipped with F/A-18 fighters and other aircraft and are both dep  loyed in Japan. In addition, maritime pre  -  positioning ships loaded with heavy equip ment and o thers are deployed in the Western Pacific.  following on from the previous year, a special BMD exercise was held between the MSDF and  In 2013, the U.S. Army Pacific upgraded the rank of its Commander from lieutenant general to general, and thus the commanders of the Army Pacific, Pacific Fleet, and Pacific Air Forces have all become four stars.  3 Missile Defense of the United States and Japan The fi gures of the U.S. Forces mentioned in this paragraph are the numbers of active personnel  recorded in the published sources of the U.S. Department of Defense (as of December 31, 2013), and could change according to unit deployment.  -tier missile defense system consisting of mutually  complementary defense systems suited for each of (1) the boost phase, (2) the mid-course phase,  and (3) the terminal phase of the ballistic missile flight path.  Japan and the United States have developed close coordination concerning ballistic missile  defense, and a part of the missile defense system of the United States has been deployed in our  country in a step-by-step manner.  Specifically, a TPY-2 radar (so-called “X-band radar”) for BMD has been deployed at the U.S.  Shariki Communication Site[14]. Also, BMD-capable Aegis ships have been forward deployed in  13 This is information conveyed by the United States to the SDF after the U.S. Forces analyze data relating to ballistic missiles launched in the direction of Japan; the analysis takes place within a short period immediately after the launch and the information provided to the SDF includes the area where the launch took place, the time of the launch, the area where debris is expected to fall and the anticipated time when it is likely to fall. Under the security arrangements between Japan and the United States, the SDF has exchanged various kinds of information with the U.S. Forces, and the SEW is one example of such information (since in April 1996). It cannot be denied that there are limits to the accuracy of this kind of information due to its nature, but it is valuable enough as an “initial report” of any ballistic missile launches in the direction of Japan. 14 The radar was installed at the ASDF “Shariki” Sub Base, but was later transferred to the U.S. Shariki",page,429,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

The purpose of the Japan-U.S. cooperative research project was to improve future interceptor  missile capability, and it conducted design, prototype production and necessary testing for four  main components[16].  In December 2005, the Security Council and the Cabinet decided to start Japan-U.S. cooperative  development of an advanced ballistic missile interceptor by using the results of the project as a  technical basis, because the results showed good prospects for resolving initial technical  challenges. The joint development started in June 2006 with a view to expanding the coverage  of protection and dealing with future threats posed by increasingly advanced and diverse  ballistic missiles and is planned to be completed by around 2017.  _See_ `▶ Fig. III-1-1-11 (Outline of the Japan-U.S. Cooperative Development of advanced ballistic missile interceptor)`  (3) Relationship to the Three Principles on Arms Exports  With regard to the Japan-U.S. cooperative development, which is aimed at improved future  BMD capability, it is necessary to export BMD related arms from Japan to the United States as  part of development. In accordance with the Chief Cabinet Secretary’s statement issued in  December 2004, it was determined that the Three Principles on Arms Exports would not apply  to the BMD system and related matters under the condition that strict controls are maintained.  Based on these circumstances, third party transfer was discussed, and it was decided that  transfer of the SM-3 Block IIA could be approved in advance in accordance with the Exchange  of Notes concerning transfer of arms and military technologies to the United States, in the case  Communication Site. 15 One of the information processing systems for ballistic missiles. 16 The four components are the nose cone, second-stage rocket motor, kinetic warhead, and infrared seeker.",page,430,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

This decision was formally announced in the Joint Statement of the  U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee (2+2) on June 21, 2011.  Based on the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology (Three  Principles), which received Cabinet approval on April 1, 2014, with regard to exceptional  measures instigated before the Three Principles were decided upon, overseas transfers will  continue to be organized in the guidelines for the principles (decided upon by the National  Security Council on the same day) as allowable under the Three Principles.  _See_ `▶ Part IV, Chapter 1,Section 3 (Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology);`  _See_ `▶ Reference 62 (The Three Principles on Arms Export, etc.); Reference 63(Three Principles on Transfer of`  _defense Eqipment and technology(April 1,2014))_  4 Response to North Korea’s Missile Launch  On March 12, 2009, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) informed member countries  that it had received warning in advance from North Korea of an intended test launch of an  “experimental communication satellite.” In response to this, based on Article 82 Section 2 of the  SDF Act (currently Article 82 Section 3), the Minister of Defense issued the “Order for  destruction measures against ballistic missiles.” The SDF organized the Joint Task Force BMD  and deployed two Aegis Destroyers equipped with SM-3 to the central area of the Sea of Japan  as well as Patriot PAC-3 units to SDF bases in the Tohoku region and the Tokyo metropolitan  area. On April 5, one missile was launched from North Korea toward the east, and the MOD and  the SDF swiftly transmitted information to the Prime Minister’s Office and other agencies,  collected from Shared Early Warning (SEW) and the various SDF radar Units[17]. Further, aerial  reconnaissance was carried out to confirm whether any harm was caused in the Tohoku region.  On April 6, the Minister of Defense issued an order to terminate the destruction measures  against ballistic missiles.  On March 19, 2012, a notification was sent from the IMO that it had received warning in  advance from North Korea concerning a launch of an “earth observation satellite.” In response  to this notification, on March 27, in accordance with an order for preparations for destruction  measures against ballistic missiles (preparation order), the MOD and the SDF started  preparations. Moreover, on March 30, the Minister of Defense issued an order for the  17 On the day before the actual launch, false information related to the launch was distributed due to mishandling of information by the MOD and the SDF.

Also in case of missiles  falling, the requisite GSDF units were dispatched to the Southwestern Islands to protect  Japanese territory. Around 07:40 on April 13, the MOD (the SDF) confirmed receiving  information from SEW concerning a launch of a flying object from the west coast of North  Korea. Since the missile flew for over a minute and then broke up into several pieces which fell  into the Yellow Sea, the same evening, the Minister of Defense issued an order to terminate the  destruction measures against ballistic missiles (termination order).  Furthermore, on December 1, 2012, North Korea announced it would launch a “satellite” during  the period between December 10 and 22 (later extended to December 29). In light of these  circumstances, the Minister of Defense issued a preparation order on December 1, and the MOD  and the SDF deployed Aegis destroyers equipped with SM-3 missiles in the Sea of Japan and  the East China Sea, and Patriot PAC-3 units to Okinawa Prefecture and within the Tokyo  metropolitan area. Additionally, in case of missiles falling in Japan’s territory, GSDF units were  dispatched to the Southwestern Islands. On December 7, the Minister of Defense issued an  implementation order. At 9:49 am on the same day, a so-called “satellite” was launched from the  west coast of North Korea, and it passed through the airspace of Okinawa Prefecture toward the  Pacific. Upon this occurrence, the Minister of Defense issued a termination order in the evening  of the same day.  Similarly, in the first half of 2013, North Korea repeatedly engaged in a variety of provocative  acts, including the implication of missile launch toward Japan, while on March 3 and 26, and  June 29, 2014, it launched ballistic missiles. Due to this stance, the MOD and the SDF took  every necessary measure including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance activities, to  protect the lives and properties of Japanese people in any potential situation, closely cooperating  with related agencies and the U.S.  _See_ `▶ Part I, Chapter 1,Section 2-1 (North Korea)`  **4 Responses in Airspace**  As Japan maintains an exclusively defense-oriented policy, it is extremely important to use outer  space, which does not belong to any nation’s territories and which is not constrained by  conditions such as surface topography, in order to strengthen information gathering to detect any",page,432,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24938,"indications of various situations in advance, and enforce warning and surveillance functions in  Japan’s surrounding sea areas and airspace, as well as ensuring means of communication in  activities such as the international peace cooperation activities of the SDF.  In July 2012, the Space Strategy Office was established by the Cabinet Office, to engage in the  planning, drafting, coordination and other policy matters relating to the use of space  development. Furthermore, the Basic Plan for Space Policy for the five years from the current  year, was decided upon in the Strategic Headquarters for Space Development established by the  Cabinet based on the Basic Space Law in January 2013. One of the important challenges it  addresses is “national security and disaster management.”  The new National Defense Program Guidelines have determined that Japan will strengthen  intelligence gathering capacity, command, control, and information communication capacity,  and increase the resilience of satellites, as well as ensure the effective and stable use of outer  space. On this basis, in FY2014, initiatives will be made in (1) investigation into successors for  the currently-used x-band communications satellites, (2) increase x-band satellite  communication functions, (3) research into countermeasures to the jamming of satellite  communications systems, (4) dispatch of personnel to U.S. Air Force foundation courses on  space, (5) investigation into the introduction of surveillance systems for the situation in outer  space, (6) research into the best format of satellite protection, and other such operations.  **5 Response to Cyber Attacks**  1 Whole-of-Government Approach  Information and communications technology has developed and been widely adopted at great  speed and, as a result, it is now an essential infrastructure for socioeconomic activity. On the  other hand, there is a possibility that people’s lives and economic activities will be severely  affected if the computer systems or networks fail.  This is the same for both the MOD and the SDF. If the critical functions of the SDF are  intercepted by a cyber attack, then it is possible that problems may arise at the core of Japan’s  defense.  In Japan, various initiatives have been undertaken by public and private sector entities, with the  National Information Security Center (NISC) playing the leading role.",page,433,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24939,"In June 2013, at the Information Security Policy Council[18], decisions were made on the “Cyber  Security Strategy” to focus on the period until 2015, and the plan for the subsequent year  “Cyber Security 2013” which was based on the above strategy. The strategy and plan  incorporate many initiatives concerning the security of Japan, including the advancement of  information security measures by businesses and other bodies which deal with important  national information, implementation of exercises for the purpose of an initial response at the  government level, and new assignment of a “Cyber Defense Group” in the SDF to defend  cyberspace, and other such measures. In addition, because it is vital to press ahead with  initiatives in the international community in order to ensure the stable use of cyberspace, which  continues to grow on a global scale, in October 2013, the “International Strategy on  Cybersecurity Cooperation –j-initiative for Cybersecurity” was formulated at the Information  Security Policy Council. Clearly specified within the “j-initiative” were important efforts  including proactive participation in the development of international standards, strengthened  cooperation with other relevant nations, such as Japan’s ally, the United States, and support in  building the capabilities of developing countries.  Along with the National Police Agency, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications,  the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the MOD is  designated as one of the five government agencies which must cooperate particularly closely  with the NISC. Therefore, the Ministry contributes to the cross-sector initiatives led by the  NISC by providing it with the knowledge and skills of the MOD and the SDF. For example, the  Ministry participates in cyber attack response training and personnel exchanges, and provides  information about cyber attacks, etc. In light of such incidents as the cyber attacks on defense  industry companies reported in 2011, the NISC established the Cyber Incident Mobile Assistant  Team (CYMAT) to provide agile support, forming cross-cutting partnerships among ministries  and agencies. The MOD sends personnel to CYMAT, thereby actively contributing to improving  the security of the government as a whole.  2 Initiatives of the MOD and the SDF  Based on this situation and government initiatives, the MOD and the SDF are engaged in the  following efforts in order to deal with cyber attacks.  (1) Basic Concept  18 Established in May 2005, under the chairmanship of the Chief Cabinet Secretary, this serves as a parent body for deciding on matters associated with the fundamental problems faced in information security in Japan.",page,434,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24940,"For the MOD and the SDF to execute missions, it is necessary to maximize its opportunities for  the use of cyberspace while limiting any risks. For that purpose, the MOD and the SDF must  secure the stable use of cyberspace as their “infrastructure” and strengthen the capabilities to  better operate in cyberspace as a new “domain” that is equivalent to land, sea, airspace and outer  space. In such initiatives, the MOD and the SDF will accomplish necessary programs based on  the following policy directions:  (1) Enhancement of capabilities and systems of the MOD and the SDF.  (2) Contribution to nationwide initiatives including the private sector.  (3) Cooperation with the international community, including allied nations.  (2) Specific Initiatives  As for response to cyber attacks, the SDF C4 (Command, Control, Communication &  Computers) Systems Command is continuously monitoring SDF communications networks.  Along with introduction of intrusion prevention systems in order to increase the safety of  information and communications systems, and development of defense systems such as the  security and analysis device for cyber defense, the MOD and the SDF are engaged in holistic  measures including enactment of regulations [19], stipulating postures and procedures for  responding to cyber attacks, and improving the human resources and technological bases, as  well as conducting research on cutting-edge technology.  _See_ `▶ Fig. III-1-1-12 (MOD/SDF Comprehensive Measures to Deal with Cyber Attacks)`  The Cyber Policy Committee, chaired by the Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Defense, was  established in February 2013. The committee is conducting integrated deliberations regarding  cooperation with other countries and relevant organizations, the programs to train and acquire  personnel capable of responding to cyber attacks, cooperation with the defense industry and  response to supply chain risks[20].  In March 2014, a “Cyber Defense Group” was established under the SDF C4 (Command,  Control, Communication & Computers) Systems Command, in order to appropriately deal with  the threat posed by cyber attacks which are growing increasingly sophisticated and complicated,  and the relevant systems were enhanced and strengthened. In addition, going forward, efforts  will also be made to enhance and strengthen the operation platform, through the early detection  of cyber attacks signals, improvement in the cyber information gathering equipment that aids in  19 There are directives relating to information assurance of the MOD (MOD Directive No. 160, 2007). 20 Supply chain risks refers to the risks that malicious software, including computer viruses, may be inserted in the components of equipment during the design, manufacturing, procuring or installation of equipment.",page,435,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24941,"the prevention of attacks before they occur, and development of a practical training environment  so that it can verify the capacity to deal with such attacks.  _See_ `▶ Fig. III-1-1-13 (Conceptual Image of a Cyber Defense Group)`  The MOD and the SDF also continue to implement initiatives for the development of human  resources with sophisticated knowledge, including establishing education and research in the  field of network security at the National Defense Academy, and dispatching officials to study at  graduate schools in Japan and abroad.  At the same time, it is difficult for the MOD and the SDF alone to achieve the stable use of  cyberspace. In particular, since comprehensive defense cooperation between Japan and its ally  the United States, including joint response, is vital, in October 2013, under the direction of  Minister of Defense Onodera and Secretary of Defense Hagel, the “Cyber Defense Policy  Working Group” (CDPWG) was set up with the objective of deepening comprehensive  cooperation between the defense authorities of the U.S. and Japan in terms of security. They aim  under this framework are (1) promotion of policy discussions, (2) closer sharing of information,  (3) promotion of joint exercises incorporating response to cyber attacks, and (4) discussion  about matters such as cooperation for training and maintaining experts; in February 2014, the  first working group meeting was held in the Ministry of Defense. Going forward, there will be  efforts toward further defense cooperation between the U.S. and Japan in the field of cyber  activity. In addition, through participation in the “Japan-U.S. Cyber Dialog,” which is a  whole-of-government approach by both nations, and the “Japan-U.S. IT Forum,” which is a  framework between the defense authorities that has been discussed repeatedly since 2002,  Japan’s cooperation with the United States will be strengthened further still. Furthermore, the IT  Forum will also be implemented with the defense authorities of Singapore, Vietnam and  Indonesia, while cyber conferences are being held between the authorities of the U.K., NATO,  Republic of Korea and others, in order to exchange views on threat awareness and each of the  relevant initiatives.  In addition, a framework for discussion with each country on entire policies, and the dispatch of  employees to meetings by government experts relating to international standards in the U.N. are  being proactively implemented, and going forward, collaboration and cooperation with the  international community will be further advanced.  In July 2013 as well, the “Cyber Defense Council” (CDC) was set up, having around ten  companies in the defense industry with a strong interest in cyber security as its core members.",page,436,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24942,"Efforts are being made to improve the capacity to counter cyber attacks by both the MOD and  the SDF and the defense industry.  **6 Response to Various Disasters**  When disasters such as natural disasters occur in any part of the country, the SDF works in  collaboration with municipal governments, engaging in the search for and rescue of disaster  victims or missing ships or aircraft, controlling floods, offering medical treatment, preventing  epidemics, supplying water, and transporting personnel and goods. In particular, over 100,000  SDF personnel were dispatched at a peak time for relief operations for the large-scale  earthquake and nuclear disaster experienced during the Great East Japan Earthquake in March  2011.  1 Outline of Disaster Relief Dispatches  (1) Types and Frameworks of Disaster Relief Dispatches  In principle, disaster dispatch is carried out at the request of prefectural governors and other  officials when there has been a freak weather incident or other natural disaster; in cases where it  is deemed necessary to protect the lives or property of citizens, or where a request has been  made to the Minister of Defense or other designated officer, who then determines that the  situation warrants such action[21]. This is because prefectural governors and other officials grasp  the overall conditions of the disaster, and it is considered most appropriate for dispatches to be  made upon their request in consideration of disaster relief capabilities within the prefecture or  municipality including police and firefighting.  Municipal mayors can ask prefectural governors to request a disaster relief dispatch by the SDF.  In the event that mayors are unable to make such a request, they can inform the Minister of  Defense. After receiving such requests from governors, the Minister of Defense or other  personnel designated by the Minister can immediately dispatch units as necessary according to  the disaster situation.  When a freak weather incident or other disaster occurs, under circumstances of particular  urgency when there is no time to wait for a request, the Minister of Defense or those designated  21 The Director General of the Japan Coast Guard, the Director General of the Regional Maritime Safety Headquarters, and the Director of Airport Administrative Office may request disaster dispatch.With regard to disaster dispatch, earthquake prevention dispatch, nuclear disaster relief dispatches, (1) SDF personnel requested dispatch may exercise authority based on the SDF Act; (2) SDF Reserve Personnel and SDF Ready Reserve Personnel may be called up for service in the event of disaster dispatch, and SDF Ready Personnel in the event of earthquake prevention dispatch or nuclear disaster dispatch; and (3) special units may be temporarily formed as necessary.",page,437,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

Based on the lessons learned after the incident of criticality which occurred at a uranium  processing plant in Tokaimura, Ibaraki Prefecture, the Act on Special Measures Concerning  Nuclear Emergency Preparedness was enacted, according to which, the SDF Law was amended  and nuclear disaster dispatch established. the Minister of Defense is authorized to order a  nuclear disaster dispatch upon request of the Director of the Nuclear Disaster Countermeasures  Headquarters (the Prime Minister).  (2) Initial Response to Disasters  The SDF has put in place arrangements for an initial response, as shown in Fig. III-1-1-15, to  ensure that disaster relief operations are conducted promptly. This is called “FAST-Force.”  _See_ `▶ Fig. III-1-1-15 (State of Readiness for Disaster Dispatches (Standard))`  2 Response to Disasters  (1) Transportation of Emergency Patients  The SDF uses its aircraft to transport emergency patients from isolated islands and remote areas  with insufficient medical facilities (transportation of emergency patients). In FY2013, out of a  total of 555 cases of disaster relief operations, 401 cases involved the transportation of  emergency patients, with dispatches to the Southwestern Islands (Okinawa and Kagoshima  Prefectures), the Goto Islands (Nagasaki Prefecture), the Izu Islands, and the Ogasawara Islands  representing the majority of such cases.  Furthermore, in addition to aiding in the transport of emergency patients from vessels  navigating areas of ocean far from the mainland where the aircraft of other organizations are  unable to respond, due to reasons including a short flight range, in the event that urgent action is  22 The Prime Minister issues an earthquake alert with the endorsement of the Cabinet in the event that an earthquake has been predicted and when it is deemed necessary to urgently implement emergency earthquake disaster prevention measures.",page,438,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24944,"required due to incidents such as fire, flooding or capsizing, the SDF carries out sea rescues  when requested to do so by the Japan Coast Guard.  Furthermore, it conducts wide-ranging medical transport operations, using the Mobile Medical  Unit to move serious-case patients by C-130H transport aircraft.  (2) Firefighting Support  In FY2013, there were 93 dispatches of firefighting support, the second largest number of  dispatches after transportation of emergency patients. Within this category, responses to fires in  areas near SDF facilities were the largest in number, with 85 cases in FY2013. Furthermore,  upon the request of prefectural governors for disaster relief dispatches, the SDF also conducts  aerial firefighting activities in locations where mountain and forest firefighting conditions are  difficult, such as mountain and forest areas.  _See_ `▶ Fig. III-1-1-16 (Performance in disaster dispatch (2013); Reference 23 (Performance in disaster dispatch`  _(past five years)_  (3) Response to Natural Disasters  From the rainy season through summer of 2013, weather conditions were unstable due to the  fact that the seasonal rain front was stationary, leading to a succession of record-breaking  downpours of heavy rain in all regions. Due to the unprecedented rain in Yamaguchi and  Shimane Prefectures from July 26 until August 2, the SDF received requests for disaster  dispatch from the governors of both prefectures on July 28, and conducted searches for people  whose whereabouts were unknown and rescues of individuals who became isolated. Then on the  29th, a request was received from the Governor of Ishikawa Prefecture, to which the SDF  responded by implementing activities to prevent flooding caused by the increase in river levels.  The large-scale dispatch involved in these activities amounted to a total of around 600 personnel,  180 vehicles and four aircraft. Furthermore, in August 9 of the same year, record-breaking  heavy rain focused in Akita and Iwate Prefectures resulted in mudslides in locations such as  Semboku City in Akita. The SDF received a request for disaster dispatch from the governors of  these two prefectures on the 9th of the month, and responded with rescue and various other  operations in Shizukuishi-cho in Iwate Prefecture and Semboku City in Akita Prefecture. The  scale of this dispatch operation amounted to a total of around 900 personnel, 280 vehicles and 7  aircraft.  Furthermore, as the large, powerful Typhoon No. 26 drew close on October 16, 2013, a  large-scale landslide occurred on Oshima-machi, Tokyo (Izu Oshima). On the same day, the",page,439,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24945,"SDF received a request for disaster dispatch from the Governor of Tokyo, and started disaster  relief activities. Then on the 20[th] of the month, a joint task force composed of units from all  three SDF, commanded by the Headquarters of the Eastern Army, was organized, which carried  out activities such as searching for lost individuals on the island, air transportation of patients  and support for the transport of personnel and goods until November 8 of that year. The scale of  this disaster dispatch operation amounted to a total of 64,000 personnel, 5,120 vehicles, 50 ships  and 340 aircraft.  Due to the heavy snow in February 2014, roads were seriously damaged from the Kanto-Koshin  through Tohoku regions, and there were regions where families became isolated. Requests were  therefore received from the governors of the stricken prefectures, to which the GSDF and the  ASDF responded by rescuing individuals, transporting goods, airlifting patients, checking safety  and removing snow to help in relief initiatives for the period from February 15 to 23 of that year.  The scale of this disaster dispatch operation amounted to a total of around 12,000 personnel,  1,300 vehicles and 220 aircraft.  (4) Response to the Great East Japan Earthquake and other Disasters  The Great East Japan Earthquake, which occurred on March 11, 2011, caused destructive  damage, mainly in coastal areas in the Tohoku region. Since immediately after the earthquake,  the MOD and the SDF have done their utmost to rescue disaster victims. The SDF’s disaster  relief activity ended on December 26, 2011, when the dispatch for nuclear disaster relief expired.  During the period, a total of around 10,660,000 SDF personnel engaged in such activities as  supporting disaster victims’ everyday life, searching for missing people and dealing with the  accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. The MOD and the SDF worked  together in responding to this unprecedented emergency.  Furthermore, based on the lessons learned in response to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster  which occurred on March 11, 2011, the Act for Establishment of the Nuclear Regulation  Authority was enacted, and the Nuclear Regulation Authority was established, while the Act on  Special Measures Concerning Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and other matters were  amended. The MOD and the SDF assigned two GSDF regular personnel to the Nuclear  Regulation Authority in September 2012, in addition to which, after a review of the related  plans and participation in nuclear disaster prevention exercises, they have engaged in support  for transportation, resident evacuation, radiation measurement (monitoring) and other measures,  and are working to increase efficiency by considering the format of collaboration with the  relevant organizations, and so forth.",page,440,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24946,"Furthermore, initiatives are being made to improve capabilities for responding to nuclear,  biological and chemical (NBC) weapons in order to deal not only with nuclear disasters, but  also with other special disasters[23].  (5) Other  On April 12, 2014, there was an outbreak of highly pathogenic avail influenza at a chicken meat  farm in Kumamoto Prefecture, which resulted in the culling and disposal (by burial) of birds by  the local government. On the 14th of the month, after a request for disaster relief was made by  the Governor of Kumamoto Prefecture, the Self-Defense Forces commenced activities such as  the transportation of hydrated lime (to prevent dispersal of the virus) and culling of birds on the  farm, which it continued until the 16th. The scale of the disaster relief effort was approximately  880 personnel, and a total of around 180 vehicles.  3 Initiatives for Preparation for Disaster Relief in Peacetime  (1) SDF Plans for Responding to Various Disasters and Operational Plans  The SDF has formulated various contingency plans for responses to large-scale earthquakes,  which are under consideration at the Central Disaster Management Council.  In May 2013, the Central Disaster Management Council Working Group to Examine  Countermeasures against Nankai Trough Mega Earthquakes compiled its final report on  countermeasures to a mega earthquake in the Nankai Trough[24]. Then in December, the Central  Disaster Management Council Working Group to Examine Countermeasures against Nankai  Trough Mega Earthquakes compiles its final report on countermeasurs to earthquakes directly  below the capital.Based on these, the MOD and the SDF established the “Self-Defense Forces  Plan for Countermeasures against Nankai Trough Earthquakes” in December of that year.  _See_ `▶ Fig. III-1-1-17 (Outline of Self-Defense Forces Plan for Countermeasures against Nankai Trough`  _Earthquakes)_  (2) Exercises Involving SDF  In order to respond to various disasters large-scale earthquakes – with speed and accuracy, the  23 Special-type disasters may be caused by terrorist or armed attacks using weapons of mass destruction. 24 This is an ocean-trench mega quake expected to occur in the Nankai Trough formed at the border between the Philippine Sea Plate in a Pacific Ocean area off a region extending from the Bay of Suruga to Kyushu and the Eurasia Plate on the Japanese Archipelago side. Once the plates are strained to the breaking point due to the Philippine Sea Plate sliding under the Eurasia Plate and causing the edge of the continental plate to be dragged, they will return to their original positions. Such movement will cause an ocean-trench mega quake.",page,441,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24947,"SDF carries out various disaster prevention drills including joint exercises for rescue in  peacetime, in addition to formulating disaster relief plans. The SDF also actively participates in  local government disaster prevention drills and is seeking to ensure cooperation with various  ministries and agencies, and local governments.  In FY2013, the SDF organized and participated in various emergency drills with the objective of  maintaining and improving the ability to carry out disaster relief missions swiftly and accurately  in times of disaster, such as major earthquakes, and many of the issues relating to the response  in the event of a disaster that arose due to the Great East Japan Earthquake were actively  incorporated into disaster prevention exercises.  _See_ `▶ Reference25 (Implementation and participation record of major drills concerning disaster dispatch (FY2013))`  In July 2013 and June 2014, with the assistance of concerned organizations, “SDF joint  disaster-prevention exercises” were implemented which envisioned Nankai Trough earthquakes,  to verify the response at command posts and operation of the MOD Disaster Operations  Headquarters.  On August 31, 2013, the SDF participated in wide-ranging medical transport exercises  organized by the Cabinet Office, and tested a wide-range of transport using SDF aircraft, bases  and so forth. In addition, the GSDF’s Field Medical Surgery System was installed in the MSDF  transport vessel “Shimokita” which participated in drills for verifying the installation of medical  bases on the ocean. On “Disaster Drill Day,” September 1 of that year, as well as participating in  operational exercises by the Government’s Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters, the  operational exercises were also implemented for the MOD Disaster Operations Headquarters.  As the first comprehensive Government nuclear disaster prevention exercise after the  Fukushima Nuclear Disaster, in October of that year, a field exercise was implemented which  envisioned an incident at the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant in Kagoshima Prefecture. The MOD  and the SDF practiced coordinating initiatives from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Nuclear  Regulation Authority and offsite centers. They also implemented a response through the  transport of Nuclear Regulation Authority personnel to the site by aircraft, resident evacuation  support in areas surrounding the nuclear facility and so forth, and verified the system for  responding to nuclear disasters, while working to improve efficiency overall. In addition to all  this, the SDF have been holding a range of training exercises and participating in various  exercises such as drills by local governments and striving to ensure the efficiency of disaster  countermeasure capacity.",page,442,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24948,"ASDF Personnel and Firefighters conducting transporting an emergency patient at Disaster  Prevention Exercise in Omitama City, Ibaraki Prefecture  (3) Coordination with Local Governments  It is also important for the SDF to strengthen coordination with local governments in peacetime  in order to conduct disaster relief operations smoothly.  For this reason, the SDF participates in a number of disaster prevention drills and is proceeding  with the strengthening of cooperation with local governments including enhancing information  liaison systems and consistency with disaster control plans.  Specifically, (1) the post of Liaison and Coordination Officer for Civil Protection and Disaster  Relief Operation Countermeasures was created at the SDF Provincial Cooperation Headquarters  to work at ensuring coordination with local governments in peacetime.  When personnel were dispatched in the event of the disaster resulting from heavy snow from the  Tohoku through Tokai regions in February 2014, coordination with the relevant prefectural  offices was.  Also, (2) in addition to assigning an SDF officer to the department in charge of disaster  prevention for Tokyo, mutual exchange is being carried out between administrative officials of  both the GSDF Middle Army Headquarters and Hyogo Prefectural Government. Furthermore,  (3) in response to requests from local governments, retired SDF personnel with knowledge in  disaster prevention are being sought. As of the end of April 2014, the total number of retired  SDF personnel working in disaster prevention in local governments was 304 individuals in 46  prefectures and 196 municipalities throughout the country. Personnel-related cooperation with  local governments and the MOD and the SDF is a very effective method of improving  cooperation with those governments, and its efficacy was confirmed during the Great East Japan  Earthquake.  _See_ `▶ Reference 26 (Retired SDF Personnel Working at Disaster Prevention-Related Departments of Local`  _Governments (As of April 30,)_  At the same time, the MOD and the SDF believe that carrying out initiatives such as the  following are important in order to carry out operations more effectively during disaster  dispatch in local governments as well.",page,443,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

Furthermore, they have concluded agreements relating to collaboration at times of disaster with  private-sector organizations such as various power companies, and are striving for smooth  mutual cooperation when various disaster dispatch is implemented, through disaster prevention  drills.  **7 Response to Attacks by Guerillas, Special Operations Forces and Others**  In the urbanized Japan, even small-scale infiltrations and attacks in the form of covert action by  guerrillas or special forces and illegal acts by armed agents which have infiltrated the country[25]  can pose a serious threat to peace and security.  1 Responses to Attacks by Guerillas and Special Operations Forces  (1) Basic Concept  In the event of an armed attack on Japan by guerilla or special forces, such as destruction of  critical private infrastructure and other facilities, attacks on people and assassinations, Japan  will respond under a defense operations order.  _See_ `▶ Reference 21 (Main Operations of the Self-Defense Forces); Reference 22(Statutory Provisions about the Use`  _of Armed Force and Weapons by SDF Personnel)_  (2) Operations to Respond to Attacks by Guerillas and Special Operations Forces  25 Refers to persons engaging in illegal acts such as subversive activities in Japan while possessing weapons with significant killing power, those cooperating with such persons, etc.",page,444,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24950,"In operations, an intelligence gathering posture is established to detect the attacks at the earliest  possible time and to respond in a swift and flexible manner. Particular importance is given to  warning and surveillance to prevent invasion in coastal areas, safeguarding of key facilities, and  search and defeat of invading units. It is important at this time to quickly gain control of the  situation to minimize damage.  a. Warning and Surveillance  Initiatives toward early detection will be made through surveillance in surrounding waters by  escort ships or aircraft, and warning and surveillance by GSDF reconnaissance units in coastal  areas. When the possibility of infiltration into Japanese territory by guerillas and special  operations forces is suspected, GSDF patrol units will engage in warning and surveillance  activities in coastal areas.  b. Protection of Significant Facilities  Furthermore, as required, a guarding posture will be established for the prompt deployment of  guarding units to secure key facilities, such as a nuclear power plant.  c. Search and Destruction of Guerrillas and Special Operations Forces  In the event of an infiltration of our territorial land by guerrillas or special operations forces,  they will be searched for and found by reconnaissance units, aviation units or others.  In case of detecting guerillas or special operation forces, combat units will rapidly deploy,  develop and defeat.  _See_ `▶ Fig. III-1-1-18 (Example of Operations against the Attacks by Guerillas and Special Forces)`  2 Response to Armed Agents  (1) Basic Concept  While the police assume primary responsibility for responding to illegal activities of armed  agents, the SDF will respond in accordance with situational developments.  (2) Measures for Strengthening Cooperation with the Police Organizations, etc.  For the SDF to deal with armed agents it is important to cooperate with the police agency.  Accordingly, in 2000, the Basic Agreement concluded in 1954 between the JDA and the  National Public Safety Commission with regard to cooperation procedures in the case of public",page,445,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24951,"security operations was revised to enable its application to illegal activities by armed agents[26].  In addition, local agreements were concluded in 2002 regarding public security operations  between GSDF divisions/brigades and prefectural police forces.  Furthermore, guidelines were jointly formulated with the National Police Agency in 2004 for  dealing jointly with public security dispatches in the event of armed agent concerns.  Also the GSDF continues to implement combined field exercises at each area nationwide with  the police of each prefecture, and intends to strengthen collaboration. It conducted exercises at  the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant (Ehime Prefecture) in 2012, at the Tomari Nuclear Power Plant  (Hokkaido) and the Mihama Nuclear Power Plant (Fukui Prefecture) in 2013, and at the site of  the Shimane Nuclear Power Plant (Shimane Prefecture) in 2014. Furthermore, combined  exercises in dealing with unidentified vessels continued to be implemented between the MSDF  and the Japan Coast Guard.  3 Response to Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Weapons  In recent years, there has been strong recognition of the danger of nuclear, biological, and  chemical (NBC) weapons proliferation and the means for transporting such weapons, as well as  related equipment and materials, to terrorists and scattered rogue states. In the event that such  weapons of mass destruction are used, it is likely there will be indiscriminate mass casualties  and contamination of an extensive area. The sarin gas attack[27] on the Tokyo subway in 1995  and the incidents of mail in the United States containing anthrax[28] in 2001 are evidence of the  fact that these weapons have already been used.  (1) Basic Concept  In the event of the use of NBC weapons in Japan in a way that corresponds to an armed attack,  the SDF will conduct defense operations to abate the armed attack and rescue victims.  Furthermore, in the event of the use of NBC weapons in a way that does not correspond to an  armed attack but against which the general police alone cannot maintain public security, the  SDF will conduct public security operations to suppress the armed attack and assist victims in  26 The Agreement on the Maintenance of Public Order in the Event of Public Security Operations which was concluded between the former Defense Agency and the National Public Safety Commission. 27 An incident in which members of Aum Shinrikyo spread extremely poisonous sarin gas in subway trains crowded with commuters, claiming the lives of 12 people (the number refers to the number of deaths indicated in the judgment rendered to Chizuo Matsumoto (commonly known as Shoko Asahara, a guru of Aum Shinrikyo). The SDF conducted decontamination operations on the trains and stations as well as supported police forensics. 28 Since September 2001, postal mail containing anthrax was delivered to individuals including members of the U.S. Senate and those related to the mass media.",page,446,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24952,"cooperation with related agencies. Furthermore, when the incident does not fall under the  category of defense operations or public security operations, the chemical protection units of the  GSDF and medical units of the ASDF, GSDF and MSDF will cooperate with relative  organizations in intelligence gathering concerning the extent of the damage, decontamination  activities, transport of the sick and injured, and medical activities through disaster relief  dispatches and civilian protection dispatches.  (2) Initiatives of the MOD and the SDF in Response to NBC Weapons  The MOD and the SDF have improved the capability for responding to NBC weapon attacks.  Specifically, the Central NBC Weapon Defense Unit, GSDF and NBC protection units or NBC  counter medical units in each division or brigade were formed under the Central Readiness  Force, and each division and brigade has. In addition, there has been an increase of chemical  protection unit personnel, improvement of NBC reconnaissance vehicles, chemical surveillance  devices, decontamination vehicles, personnel protection equipment, portable automatic  biological sensors, chemical protection clothing, and research and development for  decontamination kits is ongoing. Also, the GSDF has designated personnel to take initial action  in the event of special-type disasters in order to allow operations to begin within approximately  one hour. The MSDF and the ASDF have also acquired protective equipment and materials to be  used on vessels and at bases. Furthermore the SDF is working to strengthen collaboration for  NBC weapon attacks, including through establishing partnerships with relevant external  institutions, such as local authorities, the police, and fire departments through combined  exercises.  **8 Security of the Oceans**  Consisting of a multitude of islands, numbering more than 6,800, Japan is a maritime nation  whose territorial waters and EEZ covers, in total, approximately 4.47 million km[2] about 12  times its 380,000 km[2] land area, which places it sixth in the world in terms of the oceanic area  that it controls. As is stipulated in the Basic Act on Ocean Policy, the Government promotes  policies concerning the oceans intensively and comprehensively based on the view that it is  critical for Japan to establish itself anew as a maritime nation that achieves a balance between  peaceful and proactive development and use of the ocean, and the preservation of the marine  environment.  Based on changes in the situation regarding the ocean, the new Basic Plan on Ocean Policy  given Cabinet approval on April 26, 2013 specified the following targets for Japan as an  Oceanic State: (1) international cooperation and contribution to the international community, (2)",page,447,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24953,"wealth and prosperity through ocean development and use, (3) shift from a country protected by  the ocean to a country that protects the ocean, and (4) challenge unexplored frontiers, and has  set out initiatives to pursue intensively in the next 5 years or so. Among these initiatives are the  following for ensuring the safety at sea: reinforcement of the wide-range routine system of  surveillance, systematic improvement of warships, aircraft and other vehicles, strengthening of  the system of collaboration between the SDF and Japan Coast Guard, and development of a  system of collaboration to ensure order and safety on the coasts and isolated islands.  In addition, the Basic Plan on Ocean Policy states that in order to contribute to the creation and  development of order on the ocean, it will ensure international collaboration and promote  international cooperation and will make use of fora such as multilateral and bilateral ocean  conferences to contribute to international rules and consensus-building. As a result, the SDF is  making initiatives to cooperate for the purpose of ocean security within the framework of the  ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM) Plus regional security dialog known as the  Inter-Sessional Meeting on Maritime Security (ISM-MS).  Moreover, within the framework of the Western Pacific Naval Symposium (WPNS), the SDF  has been engaged in initiatives such as cooperation in the establishment of the Code for  Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES) which was adopted at the 14[th] meeting in April 2014[29].  _See_ `▶ Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1-2 (“Initiatives under the Multilateral Security Framework and through`  _Dialogue”)_  **9 Transport of Japanese Nationals Overseas, etc.**  In the event of disasters, insurgencies, and other emergencies overseas, the Minister of Defense  is authorized to transport Japanese nationals and other people overseas upon request from the  Minister for Foreign Affairs and subsequent consultations with the Foreign Minister, on the  basis of Article 84 (3) of the SDF Law (transport of Japanese nationals overseas, etc.). In such  cases, the SDF will protect the Japanese nationals or other parties in the country in question, and  safely guide them to transport by aircraft, ships and vehicles. To this end, the SDF maintains  operational readiness, with the GSDF designating helicopter unit and leading transport unit[30]  29 This specifies the procedures for ensuring safety, communications methods and other factors when there is an unexpected encounter at sea by the naval vessels and aircraft of the participating nations in the Western Pacific Naval Symposium (WPNS). (It is not legal binding force, and does not supersede international aviation rules, international treaties and so forth.) 30 Units temporarily organized and dispatched together with transport units (SDF aircraft or ships) in",page,448,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24954,"personnel, the MSDF designating vessels such as transport ships (including boarded aircraft),  and the ASDF designating airlift units and personnel.  The revision of the SDF Law in November 1994, positioned the transport of Japanese nationals  overseas as the duty of the SDF. At the time of the Terrorist Incident involving Japanese  Nationals in Algeria in January 2013, a dedicated Government aircraft from the Special Airlift  Group (belonging to Chitose Air Base) was dispatched to Algeria, from where it transported  seven Japanese nationals and the bodies of nine deceased Japanese nationals back to Japan.  Based on the lessons learned from this incident, a reform bill for the SDF Act was approved by  the Diet on November 15 of that year, containing matters such as the addition of vehicles as a  means of ground transport; this was put into force on the 22nd of the month. As a result, it was  decided that transport protection vehicles with superior performance against Improvised  Explosive Devices (IEDs) would be introduced from the perspective of further enhancing the  protective capabilities against unforeseen contingencies when engaging in ground transport, and  expanding the range of incidents with which the SDF can cope.  _See_ `▶ Fig.III-1-1-19 (Ordering Procedure and Image Regarding Transport of Japanese Nationals Overseas, etc.),`  _Fig.III-1-1-20(Main Details of Revision of the SDF Act)_  _See_ `▶ Reference 21 (Main Operations of the Self-Defense Forces), Reference 22(Statutory Provisions about the Use`  _of Armed Force and Weapons by SDF Personnel)_  Since the transport of Japanese nationals overseas requires close coordination among the GSDF,  MSDF, and ASDF, collaborated exercises are carried out in peacetime. The MOD participates in  the exercise for the transport of Japanese nationals overseas in the annual multinational joint  exercise “Cobra Gold” in Thailand in cooperation with the Japanese Embassy in Thailand, with  local Japanese Embassy staff, and their family members. C-130H transport aircraft was  dispatched from the ASDF for the first time. Such exercises improve our coordination  procedures with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and SDF’s skills in operations overseas.  **10 Readiness against Invasions**  The new National Defense Program Guidelines indicate the recognition that the potential for a  large-scale conflict between major nations, of the kind that was feared during the Cold War era,  remains low. It also details that only the necessary level of readiness against land invasions  involving the mobilization of large ground forces (as was expected primarily during the Cold  War) will be retained to maintain and pass on the minimum specialist knowledge and skill  required to respond to uncertain future changes in the situation.  order to guide and protect Japanese nationals and other people onsite.",page,449,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24955,"In case Japan faces a full-scale invasion, the SDF will respond to the situation in an aligned and  systematic manner based on their integrated operations. Their operations are categorized into (1)  air defense operations, (2) defense operations protecting waters around Japan, (3) operations  protecting the land, and (4) operations ensuring security in maritime communication, based on  the characteristic of their purposes. In executing these operations, the U.S. Forces will assist the  operations implemented by the SDF and deploy operations to complement the capabilities of the  SDF, including the use of striking power, in line with the Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense  Cooperation.  The following explains how the SDF will typically implement operations.  _See_ `▶ Chapter 2, Section 1( Frameworks for Responses to Armed Attack Situations)`  _See_ `▶ Reference 21 (Main Operations of the Self-Defense Forces); Reference 22 (Statutory Provisions about the Use`  _of Armed Force and Weapons by SDF Personnel)_  1 Air Defense Operations  Based on the geographic features of Japan in that it is surrounded by the sea and the features of  modern wars[31], it is expected that Japan will be hit by repeated rapid aerial attacks by aircraft  and missiles in the case where a full-scale invasion against Japan occurs.  Operations for aerial defense are characterized by the importance of initial response influencing  the whole operations. Thus, Japan needs to maintain its readiness for quick initial response on  an ongoing basis in peacetime, regularly collect information, and rapidly and comprehensively  exert combat capabilities from the onset of operations.  Operations for aerial defense can be categorized into comprehensive aerial defense mainly  conducted by the ASDF and individual aerial defense conducted by the GSDF, MSDF or ASDF  for their bases or troops. Comprehensive aerial defense aims to deal with enemy aerial attacks at  the farthest point from our territory, prohibiting enemies from gaining air superiority.  _See_ `▶ Fig. III-1-1-21 (Example of Air Defense Operations)`  2 Defense Operations Protecting Waters Surrounding Japan  As the islands of Japan are attacked with arms, aerial attacks are expected to be combined with  attacks against our ships and territory by enemy destroyers. In addition, transport vessels could  31 Aerial attacks are important elements influencing the results of modern wars.

24956,"be deployed to enable massive enemy ground forces to invade our territory.  Our defense operations protecting the waters surrounding Japan are composed of measures at  sea, measures in waters around our coasts, measures in major straits, and aerial defense above  waters around Japan. We need to protect the waters around our country by combining the results  of these multiple operations, blocking the invasion of our enemies, and attacking and depleting  their combat capabilities.  _See_ `▶ Fig. III-1-1-22 (Example of the Strategy for Defending Sea Areas Surrounding Japan)`  3 Operations Protecting the Land  As enemies try to invade the islands of Japan, they are expected to obtain sea and air superiority  by attacking our country head on, following the move by landing ground troops from the sea  and airborne troops from the air.  Invading ground and airborne troops find it difficult to exert systematic combat capabilities  while they are moving on their vessels or aircraft or right before or after they land in our  territory. As we protect our land, we need to take note of this weakness to deal with our enemies  between coastal and sea areas or at landing points as much as possible and attack them at an  early stage.  _See_ `▶ Fig. III-1-1-23 (Example of Operations for Coping with the Landing of Invading Forces)`  4 Operations Ensuring Security in Maritime Transportation  Japan depends upon other countries for the supply of much of its resources and food, making  maritime transportation routes the lifeblood for securing the existence of our country and the  foundation of our prosperity. Furthermore, in case our country comes under armed attacked,  maritime transportation routes set the foundation to maintain continuous warfare capabilities  and enable the U.S. Forces to come and assist in the defense of Japan. As such, operations to  ensure the safety of our maritime transportation are important.  Our operations ensuring security in maritime transportation can be done in waters several  hundred nautical miles around Japan or in sea lanes[32].  In the case where we implement operations in several hundred nautical mile waters around our  32 Relatively safe marine areas defined to enable the transportation of ships.

In the case where we implement our operations based on sea lanes, we define them in waters  covering around 1,000 nautical miles, periodically patrol the defined areas, detect and address  attacks by emery vessels or submarines at an early stage, and directly defend Japanese ships as  required. Escort vessels engage in aerial defense for Japanese ships on maritime transportation  routes (anti-air warfare), with support provided by fighter jets and other aircraft as required.  **11 Response to Other Events**  1 Improvement in Guard Postures for SDF Facilities  (1) Operations for Guarding SDF Facilities  When there is a danger of a terrorist attack within Japan on facilities and areas of the SDF and  the U.S. Forces in Japan and in the event that it is deemed particularly necessary to prevent  damage, the Prime Minister may order SDF units to conduct operations to guard facilities and  areas (guarding operations).  Part of the authority given to police officials under the Act Concerning Execution of Duties of  Police Officials is applied correspondingly to SDF personnel dispatched for guarding  operations[34]. Further, the amended Self-Defense Forces Law provides that SDF personnel have  authority to use weapons beyond the limitations of Article 7 of this Act.  _See_ `▶ Reference 21 (Main Operations of the Self-Defense Forces), Reference 22(Statutory Provisions about the Use`  _of Armed Force and Weapons by SDF Personnel)_  The MOD and the SDF conducted exchanges of views concerning guarding operations with the  police and Japan Coast Guard in order to ensure the effectiveness of such operations, in addition  to conducting exercises for guarding operations throughout Japan at the facilities and areas of  the U.S. Forces in Japan since 2003.

In doing so, the MOD and the SDF will strengthen their information-collecting capabilities from  a diverse range of sources, ensuring the advanced application of geospatial information by  means such as the fusion of various information and its visualization.  In addition to the strengthening of human intelligence collection capabilities, including the new  posting of Defense Attachés, they will enhance comprehensive information collection and  analysis-capabilities, through such efforts as the recruitment of intelligence analysts and  integration of the curriculum for them, so that the intelligence sides can respond to complex and  diverse needs in a timely and accurate manner.  Some examples of intelligence collection activities include  (1) collecting, processing and analyzing signals detected from military communications and  electronic weapons, up in the air over Japanese territory; (2) collecting and analyzing high  resolution commercial satellite imagery data; (3) warning and surveillance activities by ships  and aircraft and so on; (4) collecting and organizing a variety of open source information; (5)  applicable facilities in the event that it is considered that the use of such weapons is required to execute duties or to protect themselves or others. Weapons must not be used to cause harm to other people except in cases of self-defense or acts of emergency evacuation. 36 In order to enhance Japan’s capabilities for gathering image intelligence, four intelligence-gathering satellites are currently operated at the Cabinet Satellite Intelligence Center.

In the new Defense Strategic Guidance, the Obama Administration_ `articulated a policy that would place the Asia- Pacific region at the focus of U.S. strategy, including the security strategy (Rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific Region). Furthermore, in March 2014 the Administration published the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the second review since President Obama took office. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it, including rebalancing to the Asia-` _Pacific region, indicating that the Obama Administration continues to place an emphasis on the region._  **Meanwhile, as the growing budget deficits of the U.S. go**  vernment in recent years have called for deep cuts in spending, in January 2012 the Department of Defense announced that the  redu ction in defense spending will amount to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from FY2012 to FY2021 Situation Response Act specifies items that should be stipulated as basic  .

The QDR outlines policies concerning U.S. Forces' capabilities and composition in anticipation  of the securit y env ironment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the Se cre tary o f Defen  se submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds  on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it.  she 2014 QDR states that the future international security environment remains uncertain and complicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between  states, non -   state entities and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly accelerating spread of information. In  addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals,  and l everages th e t echnol ogical and human ca pita l strengths of the U.S . Forces.   (1) Understanding of Security   The QDR recognizes t hat the Asia  _-_ `Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce, politics and security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the region continues to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their military and security capabilities, bringing greater risk that tensions arising from long-standing sovereign disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehensive scope of China’s military modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding both mili tar y c apabilities and intentions . In relation t o North Korea, the review`  _says that its_ _long-_  range missile and weapons of  mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to  peac e and stability o n t he K orean Pen insu la and Northeast A sia and is a g rowi ng, di rect threat to  th e United States.  `As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of trans -` _national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile states.

In Africa, it mentions that terrorists,  criminal organizations and pirates exploit ungoverned and under -   governed territory, causing potential for rapidly developing threats, particularly of terror  ist at tacks in fra gil e states, that could pose acute challenges to U.S. interests.  The report says that Europe remains the principal partner in promoting global security,  particularly in addressing challenges such as persistent unrest and violence in the Middle East  and North Africa.  The QDR states that while the United States is willing to undertake security cooperation with  Russia, both in the bilateral context and in seeking solutions to regional challenges, Russia’s  multi  -  dimens ional def ense moderniza  tion and actions that violate the sovereignty of neighbors present risks and thus the United States will engage Russia to increase transparency and reduce  _the risk of military miscalculation._ _Concerning the global trends, the report refers to the emergence of international partners with the capacity to play security roles in their respective regions, as well as international cooperation and shared norms of behavior at unprecedented levels of global interconnectedness. At the same time it also states that the spread and proliferation of technology offers new tools for state and non-state adversaries such as terrorists to pursue asymmetric approaches in the 21_  _st_  century operational environment.

In January 2012, the Obama administration released the new Defense Strategic Guidancelevel and ministerial level, and have . Based on the understanding that the United States is at an inflection point due to factors both insid e and outside the country, that is, the U.S. Forces’  withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan after a decade of war and the demand for deep cuts in government spending including defense spending under the government’s serious fiscal  situation, the guidance was developed to review defense priorities and present a blueprint for the Joint Force in 2020. In the new Defense Strategic Guidance, the Obama Administration  articulated a policy that would place the Asia  **-** **Pacific region at the focus of U.S. strategy,**  includ ing the security strategy (Rebalancing to the Asia Pacifi c Regio n).

In addition, the government budget sequestration-, including defense spending, was initiated in March 2013, bringing various impacts on the U.S. Forces including suspension of training, delayed deployment of aircraft carriers, and grounding of air squadrons. Although the Bi  ``` partisan Budget Act of the Democratic and Republican parties mitigated the  sequestration spending cuts for FY2014 and FY2015, the QDR emphasizes that the risks to the U.S. Forces would increase considerably if sequester leve l cuts return in FY2016.

The QDR outlines policies concerning U.S. Forces' capabilities and composition in anticipation  of the security environment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the Secretary of Defense submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds  on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it. (1) Understanding of Security  The 2014 QDR states th at the future interna tional security environment remai ns uncerta in a nd  complicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between  states, non  -  state entities and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly accelerating spread of information. In addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals, and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces. The QDR recognizes t  hat the Asia  -  Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce, politics and security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the  region continues to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their military and security capabilities, bringing greater risk that tensions arising from long- standing sovereign disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehensive scope of China’s military modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its long  -  range missile and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to  peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to  th e United States.  As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of ``` trans- national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile  ``` states. The report states that Iran remains a destabilizing actor that threatens security by defying international law and pursing capabilities that would allow it to develop nuclear weapons. Even as Iran pledges not to pursue nuclear the stable and effective utilization of facilities  and areas in Japan by the U.S. Forces. The United States will maintain a nuclear deterrent  capability, and the forward deployments of combat-ready forces and other forces capable of  reinforcing them. ``` ○ In order to be able to take coordinated joint action smoothly in the event of an armed attack  ``` against Japan, Japan and the United States will endeavor to achieve a posture for cooperation  between the SDF and the U.S. Forces in such areas as operations, intelligence and logistics.  b. Actions in Response to an Armed Attack against Japan  1) When an armed attack against Japan is imminent: ``` ○ As deemed necessary, a coordination center will be established between the SDF and the  ``` U.S. Forces. ``` ○ The SDF and U.S. Forces will establish in advance a common standard as regards  ``` preparations which will be respectively conducted by the two forces so that the two nations may  select coordinated common readiness stages, and ensure that effective preparations for  operations can be cooperatively undertaken by the SDF and the U.S. Forces respectively.

24973,"weapons, its other destabilizing activities including development of mid and long - range missiles and support to terrorists and insurgents, will continue to pose a threat to the security of  the Middle East and the U.S. allies and partners.  Furthermore, it states that as coun  `tries in the Middle East and Africa undergo political and social` change, terrorist groups seek to expand their influence, and internal strife in Syria has become a magn et f or gl obal jihad, bringi ng ongoing spillover eff ects incl uding an i nflu x of foreign  f ighters and a flood of refugees into neighboring countries. In Africa, it mentions that terrorists, criminal organizations and pirates exploit ungoverned and under governed territory, causing potential for rapidly developing threats, particularly of terrorist attacks in fragile states, that  could pose acute challenges to U.S. interests.  The report says that Europe remains the principal partner in promoting global security, particularly in addressing challenges such as persistent unrest and violence in the Middle East  and North Africa.  `The QDR states that while the United States is willing to undertake security cooperation with Russia, both in the bilateral context and in seeking solutions to regional challenges, Russia’s multi` -   dimensional defense moderniza tion and actions that violate the sovereignty of neighbors present risks and thus the United States will engage Russia to increase transparency and reduce  the risk of military miscalculation.  Concerning the global trends, the report refers to the emergenc e of international partners with the capacity to play security roles in their respective regions, as well as international coope ration an d shared nor ms of behavior at unprecedented levels of global interconnectedness.  At the same time it also states that t  he spread and proliferation of technology offers new tools for state and non  -   state adversaries such as terrorists to pursue asymmetric approaches in the 21st  century operational environment. Furthermore, the report states that in coming years, countries su  ch as China will continues seeking to counter U.S. strengths using anti- access and area- denial (A2/AD) approaches  of peace and stability in this region assumed greater importance for the security of Japan. and  and by em plo ying o ther new cyber an d sp ace con trol techno logi es.

(2) Defense Strategy  The 2014 QDR emphasizes the following three pillars, which are interdependent and mutually See Part I Overview, Section 2, footnote 4 ents, and the  Japan-U.S. SCC (“2+2” Meeting) approved the current Guidelines in 1997. The current  Guidelines extend the scope of Japan-U.S. cooperation to cover situations in areas surrounding  Japan. The outline of the current Guidelines is shown below:  _See ▶ Reference 29 (Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation (September 23, 1997))_  a.

The QDR states that across the three pillars, the U.S. Forces are capable of simultaneously implementing the following undertakings, and if deterrence fails at any given time, U.S. forces  could de feat a region al a dver sary in a large -scale multi  phased campaign, and deny the objectives of  — or imposing unacceptable costs on  — ``` another aggressor in another region .  ``` 1) Defen ding homela nd  2) Conducting sustained, distributed counterterrorist opera  _tions_ _3) Deterring aggression and assuring allies through forward presence and engagement in multiple regions._  Furthermore, in order to achieve the three pillars, the Department of Defense seeks innovative  approaches to how to fight, how to posture the force, and how to leverage the asymmetric strengths and technological advantages. More specifically, the QDR mentions positioning  additional forward -deployed naval forces in critical areas, such as the Asia  -   Pacific region, and deploying new combinations of s  hips, aviation assets, and crisis response forces.

24978,"The NPR presents  five key objectives based on awareness of this security environment: (1)  preventing nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism; (2) reducing the role of U.S. nuclear  weapons; (3) maintaining strategic deterrence and stability at reduced nuclear force lev  els; (4)  strengtheni ng regional det errence and rea ssuring U.S. allie s and partners ; and (5) sustaining  a sa fe, se cure, an d effec tive nu clear arsenal.  In June 2013, U.S. President Obama delivered a speech on the reduction of nuclear weapons in Berlin, whi  ch was then followed by the release of the Report on Nuclear Employment Strategy by the Department of Defense on the same day. The report revealed U.S. intentions to negotiate  with Russia to pursue up to a one-third reduction in deployed strategic nuclear  weapons.  See  -  Part I, Chapter 2, Section 2-1 (Nuclear Weapons)  4 FY2015 Budget  As the budget deficit of the U.S. Government is deepening in recent years, the Budget Control Act enacted in August 2011 established a deep cut in government spending by FY2021. In Janua ry 2012, the DoD announced that the reduction in defense spending in light of the act will amoun t t o ab out 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from FY2012 to FY2021 (about 259  billion dollars over the five years from FY2013 to FY2017). ”The Bipartisan Budget Act by the Democratic and Republican parties which passed in December 2013 mitigated the sequestration caps for  FY2014 and FY2015. The FY2015 budget request that was announced following the Act includes 495.6 billion dollars  Asia to fund base defense programs. For Overseas Contingency  Operations, the budget includes 58.6 billion dollars, an amount that is 20.9 billion dollars less than the amount in the FY2014 budget request, reflecting the plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. The key principles of the defense budget are as follows: (1) Seek a balanced force; (2) Prepare for prolonged readiness challenges including uncertain fiscal outlook; (3) Continue  to focus on institut ional reform ; a nd ( 4) P ursue compe nsatio n c hang es.

In relation to these decisions, the 2014 QDR states that while the forces will become  smalle r, it will become more modern as well, with readiness improving. However, unless the Congress and the President agree to a new budget bill or other such measures are taken, the A reduction of about 400 million dollars compared to the FY2014 budget under the Bipartisan Budget Act th at mitig  ated the sequestration caps. A reduction of about 31 billion dollars compared to the FY2014 government budget request, and the review is to be completed by the end  of 2014. Based on this, the MOD in October 2013 established a study preparatory committee  regarding the revision of the Guidelines within the Ministry.  B. The Direction of the Review  The Joint Statement of the “2+2” Meeting identified the following seven objectives of the  review of the Guidelines:  1) Ensuring the Alliance’s capacity to respond to an armed attack against Japan, as a core aspect  of Japan-U.S. defense cooperation;  2) Expanding the scope of cooperation, to reflect the global nature of the Japan-U.S. Alliance,",page,473,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

The 2014 QDR states that concerning the risks for the U.S. Forces posed by shifts in the security environment, the Department can manage these risks under the President’s FY2015 Budget plan, but the risks would grow significantly if sequester-level cuts return in FY2016,  .

The Pacific Command is a command wi th r egional responsibili ties and is r esponsible for the largest geographical area.  The U.S. Forces statione d in the ROK and Japan fall under the control of the Pacific Command.  _Furthermore, in order to broaden the perspective of the U.S. Forces and promote better understanding of the U.S. Forces from allies, the Pacific Command headquarters accept personnel from allies in the region.

The U.S. Army Pacific (USARPAC) is composed of two divisions and deploys such forces as  the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii and the 2nd Infantry Division and 19th Sustainment  Co mmand in the ROK, in addition to about 2,300 personnel in Japan, including the I Corps (Forward) headquarters and the headquarters, U.S. Army Japan  they had developed..  The U.S. Pacific Fleet consists of the Seventh Fleet, which is responsible for the western Pacific and th  e Indian Ocean, and the Third Fleet, responsible for the East Pacific and Bering Sea. The U.S. Pacific in total controls about 180 vessels. The Seventh Fleet is centered on a carrier strike group with main stationing locations in Japan and Guam. Their miss ion is to defend territorial  lands, people and sea lines of communication and the critical national interests of the U.S. and its allies.

The main factors behind the success of the joint Japan-U.S. response to the Great East Japan  Earthquake were the cooperation between the two countries that has been taking place even in  peacetime, the swift and thorough implementation of coordination between them, and the  presence of the U.S. Forces in Japan. In addition, the success of these endeavors was also due  not only to the ongoing policy discussions and bilateral exercises carried out between the two  countries in peacetime, but also to the fact that the stationing of the U.S. Forces in Japan means  that their troops here are well-acquainted with the geography and culture of the country.

It also contributed to peace and stability  Following the end of the Cold War, the leaders of Japan and the United States announced the  Japan–U.S. Joint Declaration on Security in 1996, reaffirming the importance of the Japan–U.S.  Alliance in light of the state of affairs in the Asia-Pacific region following the Cold War. Upon  the Declaration, the final report was compiled at the Special Action Committee on Okinawa  (SACO) at the end of that year, and as part of the promotion of cooperative relations presented  in the Declaration, at the Japan-U.S. SCC (“2+2” Meeting) held the following year (1997),  current Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation (Guidelines) were approved, revising  the previous Guidelines.  Afterwards, in light of further changes to the security environment due to the 9/11 terrorist  attacks in 2001 and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, following the “2+2”  Meeting in December 2002, Japan and the United States held working-level and other  consultations as part of bilateral strategic dialogue on security from the perspective of how to  make the Japan-U.S. Alliance’s capacity more effective to adapt to changing times. As a result  of a number of these Japan-U.S. consultations, the direction of the Japan-U.S. Alliance was  arranged in three stages. These stages are: confirmation of common strategic objectives to both  countries, including enhancing peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region (first stage) in  February 2005; the announcement of the results of the examination of the roles, missions, and  capabilities of Japan and the United States for accomplishing the common strategic objectives  (second stage) in October 2005; and the formulation of the United States-Japan Roadmap for  Realignment Implementation, a program for implementing specific measures for the  realignment of the U.S. Forces in Japan, in May 2006.  _See_ `▶ Reference 33 (United States – Japan Roadmap for Realignment Implementation)`",page,477,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24983,"Furthermore, Japan and the United States at the “2+2” Meeting in May 2007 reconfirmed and  updated their common strategic objectives and reaffirmed their resolve to steadily implement  the realignment plan set forth in the Roadmap. In February 2009, the two countries signed the  Agreement between the Government of Japan and the Government of the United States of  America concerning the Implementation of the Relocation of III Marine Expeditionary Force  personnel and their dependents from Okinawa to Guam (the Guam International Agreement),  which entered into force in May 2009.  In 2010, Japan and the United States marked the 50th anniversary of the signing of the  Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, and in the Joint Statement of the “2+2” Meeting in January 2010,  they reaffirmed their commitment to ensuring that the Japan-U.S. Alliance continues to be  effective in meeting the challenges of the twenty-first century.  In the Joint Statement of the “2+2” Meeting in June 2011, the two countries revalidated and  updated their common strategic objectives set forth in the Joint Statements of the previous  “2+2” Meetings, including maintenance of maritime security domain by defending the principle  of freedom of navigation and maintenance of bilateral cooperation with respect to protection of  and access to space, and cyberspace, and covered a diverse range of areas regarding the  strengthening of alliance security and defense cooperation, including an expansion of  information sharing and joint intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) activities.  In the Joint Statement of the “2+2” Meeting in April 2012, Japan and the United States  announced that they decided to adjust the plans outlined in the United States-Japan Roadmap for  Realignment Implementation (Realignment Roadmap) of May 2006, considering significant  progress on the realignment of the U.S. Forces stationed in Japan since the Joint Statement of  the “2+2” Meeting in June 2011 as well as the security environment in the Asia-Pacific region.  _See_ `▶ Fig. III-2-2-5 (Major Milestones in Security Cooperation Between Japan and the United States); Fig. III-2-2-6`  _(Overview of Japan–U.S. Consultations)_  _See_ `▶ Reference 34 (Joint Statement of the Security Consultative Committee)`  In parallel with such bilateral political discussions, the two countries enhanced their cooperative  relations in various aspects, including operations, and services in response to specific issues. For  instance, as part of the cooperation in peacetime stipulated in the aforementioned Guidelines, in  addition to Japan- U.S. Bilateral Training and Exercises, Japan also participates in trilateral  training exercises with the armed forces of the U.S. and Australia, and in multinational exercises",page,478,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24984,"such as Cobra Gold. As a result, the cooperative arrangements between Japan and the U.S. have  made significant progress in a variety of fields. In recent years the U.S. Forces stationed in  Japan have also participated in emergency training organized by local governments, thereby  deepening cooperation with relevant institutions and local governments.  Regarding the response to ballistic missiles, bilateral response capabilities have improved, such  as operational information sharing and establishing the guidelines for responding to an attack.  Accordingly, Japan and the U.S closely cooperated and coordinated in responding to the missile  launches carried out by North Korea respectively in April 2009, and April and December 2012,  which were purported to be a “satellite.” Also, in the systems and technology field, the  cooperative development of a new ballistic missile defense (BMD) interceptor with enhanced  capabilities (SM-3 Block IIA) is steadily in progress.  Concerning initiatives to improve the global security environment, through activities pursuant to  the former Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Act, international disaster relief activities and  international peace-keeping operations in the Philippines and Haiti, and anti-piracy operations  in the Gulf of Aden, Japan is conducting activities in close cooperation with the U.S. Moreover,  Japan-U.S. cooperation is also being steadily promoted through logistical support based on the  Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) signed in 1996, as a result of increased  opportunities for cooperation between the two countries.  **3 “2+2” Meeting (October 3, 2013)**  On October 3, 2013, Japan and the United States held the “2+2” Meeting in Tokyo. This “2+2”  Meeting was the historic meeting where all the four Ministers in charge of foreign affairs and  defense of Japan and the United States got together in Tokyo for the first time and demonstrated  the direction of strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance at home and overseas. At the meeting,  while sharing anew the perception of the changing security environment in the Asia-Pacific  region, Japan and the United States, with shared values, set forth a strategic vision from the  medium- to long-term perspectives in order to achieve a more robust Japan-U.S. Alliance.  The major achievement in the Joint Statement of the latest “2+2” Meeting includes (1) the  agreement to complete the review of the current Guidelines by the end of 2014; (2) the  agreement to further enhance and deepen bilateral security and defense cooperation, including  in such areas as cyberspace and space, and to strengthen regional cooperation, including  trilateral cooperation with Australia and the Republic of Korea; and (3) regarding the  realignment of the U.S. Forces stationed in Japan, the underscoring of the strong determination",page,479,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

24988,"_See_ `▶ Part III, Chapter 3,Section2-2 (Achievements of the “2+2” Meeting (October 3, 2013))`  _See_ `▶ Reference 35 (Joint Statement of the Security Consultative Committee(October 3, 2013))`  **4 Direction of Strengthening the Alliance**  As described in the previous section, the Joint Statement of the “2+2” Meeting in October 2013  covered joint intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) activities, joint training and  exercises, joint/shared use of facilities, cooperation in cyberspace, etc. as the contents of  bilateral security and defense cooperation in order to ensure the Alliance’s credibility into the  future. The new National Defense Program Guidelines also incorporated many items of bilateral  security and defense cooperation set forth in the Joint Statement as part of the strengthening of  the Japan-U.S. Alliance’s deterrence and response capabilities as well as cooperating in a broad  range of areas. It is important to strengthen the Japan-U.S. Alliance through these initiatives not  only for ensuring Japan’s security but also for the peace and stability of the international  community, including the Asia-Pacific region.  1 Strengthening of the Japan-U.S. Alliance’s Deterrence and Response Capabilities  The new National Defense Program Guidelines state that in order to strengthen the deterrence  and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance, Japan will build seamless cooperation with  the United States ranging from situations in peacetime to various situations, including  cooperation in responding to “gray-zone” situations, while increasing the presence of Japan and  the United States in the western Pacific region. To that end, as part of specific cooperation  measures in peacetime, Japan and the United States continue to promote joint training and  exercises, and joint ISR activities, as well as joint/shared use of facilities and areas of the two  countries as a basis for these activities. The synergy effects of these three elements of  cooperative initiatives can further strengthen and improve the operational efficiency of the SDF  and the U.S. Forces, including efficiency, interoperability, readiness, mobility, and  sustainability.  _See_ `▶ Fig. III-2-2-7 (The Enhancement of Joint/Shared Use, Joint Training/Exercises, and Joint Intelligence,`  _Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Activities (conceptual image))_  Joint training and exercises have been expanded not only within Japan but also to the United  States by dispatching SDF units, and continuous initiatives are being made to improve  interoperability and bilateral response capabilities at the military service and unit levels,  including participation in exercises including the Japan-U.S. Bilateral Regional Army command  post exercises, special anti-submarine exercises, and Japan-U.S. Bilateral Fighter combat  training. Expanding joint training and exercises increases cooperative activities in peacetime,",page,483,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24989,"thereby improving the readiness and operational capability of units as well as interoperability  between the SDF and U.S. Forces. Moreover, conducting joint training and exercises at an  effective time, venue, and scale demonstrates common intentions and unified capabilities  between Japan and the U.S., and thereby serves as a deterrent.  In June 2013, the SDF sent participants from all three of the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF to the  U.S. Forces’ joint exercise “Dawn Blitz 2013” (field training) in the United States. In the field  training with U.S. Marine Corps, “Forest Light,” conducted in Japan in October 2013, the joint  heliborne training was carried out using MV-22 Osprey to improve the interoperability of the  SDF and the U.S. Forces. Further, in February 2014, the GSDF and U.S. Marine Corps  conducted the field training “Iron Fist 2014” in an effort to enhance the amphibian operation  function.  With regard to joint ISR activities, from the perspective that it is important to implement ISR  activities in a broad Asia-Pacific region in cooperation between Japan and the U.S. to enhance  the efficiency and effectiveness of the activities between both countries, the two countries set up  the Defense ISR Working Group in February 2013 consisting of director-level defense officials  from Japan and the U.S., which is further deepening the cooperation between the two countries  as well as expanding bilateral exercises and training.  Expanding such joint ISR activities not only ensures that the two countries gain information  superiority over other countries but also functions as a deterrent.  Expanding joint/shared use of facilities and areas increases bases for the SDF’s activities such  as maneuver areas, ports, and airfields, which in turn enhances the diversity and efficiency of  Japan-U.S. bilateral training and expands the scope and raises the frequency of such activities as  ISR. The SDF have only a limited number of facilities in Okinawa, including Naha Air Base,  and most of them are located in urban areas, which results in operational limitations. The  joint/shared use of USFJ facilities and areas in Okinawa will greatly improve the SDF’s training  environment in Okinawa, and facilitate training and interoperability between the SDF and the  U.S. Forces. It will become possible to improve readiness and contribute to maintaining the  safety of local people at a time of disaster. While taking enhancing of defense posture in the  regions including Southwestern Islands into account, Japan and the U.S. are proactively  engaged in deliberations. Furthermore, specific initiatives are steadily progressing. For example,  GSDF has been using Camp Hansen since March 2008.",page,484,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24990,"The relocation of the ASDF Air Defense Command to Yokota in April 2012 and the relocation  of the GSDF Central Readiness Force Headquarters to Zama in March 2013were carried out. In  addition, in December 2013, the MSDF conducted the training on the ocean and training  utilizing facilities in Guam and the surrounding area in cooperation with the U.S. Navy and the  development of training ranges as facilities for shared use by the SDF and the U.S. Forces in  Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands (Tinian Island, Pagan Island, etc.) is under  consideration.  In other areas, Japan will also tighten the Japan-U.S. operational cooperation and policy  coordination, including ballistic missile defense (BMD), bilateral planning and Extended  Deterrence Dialogue.  2 Strengthening and Expanding Cooperation in a Broad Range of Fields  The new National Defense Program Guidelines seek to strengthen cooperation in anti-piracy  initiatives, capacity building assistance, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, peacekeeping  and counterterrorism as well as in maritime affairs, outer space and cyberspace, and Japan will  also constantly strengthen and expand the Japan-U.S. cooperative relationship over a broad  range of fields, including disaster response, intelligence cooperation and information security,  and cooperation in the field of defense equipment and technology.  One of the latest examples of these initiatives is bilateral cooperation in cyberspace. In October  2013, under the instructions of Minister of Defense Onodera and U.S. Secretary of Defense  Hagel, the Cyber Defense Policy Working Group (CDPWG) was established as a framework  between Japanese and U.S. defense officials to discuss a broad range of issues, including the  sharing of information at the policy level and human resources development and technical  cooperation.  In the field of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, Japan and the United States closely  coordinated their responses to the relief of the damage caused by a major typhoon in the  Philippines in November 2013, with the two countries jointly undertaking coordination at a  local multilateral coordination office. In addition, contingency plans to respond to the Nankai  Trough Mega quake, etc. developed in January 2014 incorporated Japan-U.S. joint response  procedures, and the SDF and the U.S. Forces in February 2014 conducted the joint integrated  disaster drill assuming damage from the Nankai Trough Mega quake in Kochi Prefecture. As  seen in these examples, Japan and the United States are striving to further strengthen  cooperation between the SDF and the U.S. Forces in disaster responses at home and abroad.",page,485,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
24991,"**5 Recent Japan-U.S. Meetings**  Regarding bilateral defense policy and defense cooperation, Minister Onodera and Secretary  Hagel agreed to strengthen deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance by  closely collaborating on bilateral efforts based on the new National Defense Program Guidelines  of Japan and the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) of the United States released in March  2014 and steadily make progress in bilateral defense cooperation, including the revision of the  Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation, by the end of 2014 as described in the Joint  Statement of the “2+2” Meeting held in October 2013. In addition, Secretary Hagel stated that  the United States continues its rebalance policy which is an Asia-Pacific region oriented policy,  as shown in the QDR, and as part of that policy, the United States plans to deploy two additional  BMD-equipped Aegis ships to Japan by 2017. Minister Onodera explained the gist of the “Three  Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology,” and Secretary Hagel welcomed  Japan’s effort in this area. Minister Onodera and Secretary Hagel agreed to continue to deepen  bilateral equipment and technology cooperation.  1 Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting (May 31, 2014)  Following the Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting on April 6, 2014, Minister of Defense  Onodera and U.S. Secretary of Defense Hagel held another Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial  Meeting on May 31, 2014, on the margins of the IISS (International Institute for Strategic  Studies) Asia Security Summit (Shangri-La Dialogue) held in Singapore June 1-3.  (1) Regional Situation  Minister of Defense Onodera and U.S. Secretary of Defense Hagel exchanged views on the  security environment in the Asia-Pacific region. Minister of Defense Onodera stated that  Chinese fighters made unusual approaches to SDF aircrafts in May and that such dangerous acts  are extremely regrettable as they could lead to unexpected accidents. The Minister and the  Secretary agreed that they would oppose any attempt to alter the status quo by force in any  region, including the East China Sea. They also confirmed that Japan and the United States will  continue close cooperation for regional peace and stability. In this regard, Minister of Defense  Onodera welcomed the temporary deployment of U.S. Air Force’s Global Hawk to Misawa Air  Base which began in May and the additional deployment of a second AN/TPY-2 radar system to  Japan as they contribute to Japan’s security as well as to regional peace and stability.

Regarding the relocation of MCAS Futenma, Prime Minister Abe said: (1) Japan will  start construction for the relocation of MCAS Futenma in a prompt and steady manner with a  strong will; (2) since the Japanese Government’s position is to do anything it can to the requests  from the Governor of Okinawa, including termination of use of MCAS Futenma within five  years, Japan will examine such requests through thorough l communication with the United  States; and (3) the Japanese Government is making efforts to increase MV-22 Osprey training  exercises in areas outside of Okinawa, and U.S. cooperation is essential in progressing such  efforts. In addition, on the Agreement to Supplement the Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement  on Environmental Stewardship, Prime Minister said it is necessary to have an agreement with  sufficient content suited for a mature Alliance and sought U.S. cooperation to that end. In  response, President Obama said the United States will continue its efforts to mitigate the impact  on Okinawa while ensuring the smooth operation of the U.S. Forces in Japan.  On the situation of the Asia-Pacific region, the Prime Minister and the President agreed that it is  important to maintain a free and open Asia-Pacific region in cooperation with other countries  concerned, with Japan and the United States at its core, and also to get China involved in the  process. To that end, they confirmed that it is important to fully demonstrate the strengthening  of the Japan-U.S. Alliance and the continuation of the U.S. rebalance policy. Regarding North  Korea, Prime Minister Abe mentioned to continue the pressure on North Korea to stop them  from developing nuclear weapons, and the Prime Minister and the President confirmed that  Japan, the United States and the ROK will maintain close cooperation. On Japan-ROK relations,  Prime Minister Abe stated that amicable Japan-ROK relations are essential for peace and  stability in the Asia-Pacific region and Japan will seek to communication with the ROK at  various levels from a broader perspective and strive to build a future-oriented bilateral  cooperative relations.

24995,"**Chapter 1 Defense Policies of Countries**  t1 Security and Defense Policies  Despite its changing influence in relative terms, the United States remains the world's most powerful nation, and it is believed to consistently play a significant role in ensuring peace and stability throughout the world. In January 2012, the Obama administration released the new Defense Strategic Guidanceon local communities, such as those in Okinawa, while maintaining the  . Based on the understanding that the United States is at an inflection point due to factors both inside and outside the country, that is, the U.S. Forces’ withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan after a decade of war and the demand for deep cuts in government spending including defense spending under the government’s serious fiscal situation, the guidance was  developed to review defense priorities and present a blueprint for the Joint Force in 2020. In the new Defense Strategic Guidance, the Obama Administration articulated a policy that would place the Asia  -  Pacific region at the focus of U.S. strategy,  including the security strategy (Rebalancing to the Asia  -   **Pacific Region). Furthermore, in March 2014 the Administration published the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the second review since President Obama took office. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense S**  trat egic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it, including rebalancing to the Asia Pacific region, indicating that the Obama Administration continues to place an emphasis on the region.  Meanwhile, as the growing budget deficits of the U.S. government in recent years have called for deep cuts in spending, in January 2012 the Department of Defense announced that the  red uction i n de fense spendi ng will amount to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from FY2012 to FY2021U.S. Security Arrangements . I n addition, the government budget sequestration to ensure the  , including defense spending, was initiated in March 2013, bringing various impacts on the U.S. Forces including  suspension of training, delayed deployment of aircraft carriers, and grounding of air squadrons.  Although the Bipartisan Budget Act of the Democratic and Republican parties mitigated the sequestration spending cuts for FY2014 and FY2015, the QDR emphasizes that the risks to the U.S. Forces would increase considerably if sequester- level cuts return in FY2016. Much the Status of Forces Agreement  The formal title of the document is “Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense.” According to the document published by the DoD concerning the FY2013 budget request that was submitted to Congress in February 2012, “the amount of reduction” here means the difference between  the total DoD base budget for 10 years estimated at the time of the FY2012 budget request (submitted to Congress in February 2011) and the total DoD base budget for 10 years estimated at the time of the FY2013 budget request.

The QDR o utlines policies concerni ng U.S. Forc es' capabili ties and composition in a nticipation  of the security environment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the Secretary of Defen se submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds  on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it.  (1) Understanding of Security The 2014 QDR states that the future international security environment remains uncertain and  comp licat ed due to th e s hiftin g in ternat ional bal ance of power; the gr eater intera ction between  states, non -   state entities and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly  accelerating spread of information. In  addr essi ng this c hall enging envi ron ment, the QDR st ate s  that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals, and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces.  The QDR recognizes that the Asia Paci fic re gio n is incre asing ly central to global comm erce,  politics and security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the region continues to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their military an d  security capabilities, bringing greater risk that tensions arising from long-standing sovereign disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In  particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehe  nsive scope of China’s military modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding  both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its  long  -  range missile and weapons of  mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit  of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to th e United States.  As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of trans  -  national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate  into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile  states. The report states that Iran remains a destabilizing actor that threatens security by defying international law and pursing capabilities that would allow it to develop nuclear weapons.

24997,"weapons, its other d estabilizing activities including development of mid - and long range  missiles and support to terrorists and insurgents, will continue to pose a threat to the security of the Middle East and the U.S. allies and partners. Furthermore, it states that as countries in the Middle East and Africa undergo political and social change, terrorist groups seek to expand their influence, and internal strife in Syria has become a magnet for global jihad, bringing ongoing spillover effects including an influx of foreign f ighters and a flood of refugees into neighboring countries. In Africa, it mentions that terrorists,  criminal organizations and pirates exploit ungoverned and under- governed territory, causing potential for rapidly developing threats, particularly of terrorist attack s in fragile states, that could pose acute challenges to U.S. interests.  The report says that Europe remains the principal partner in promoting global security,  particularly in addressing challenges such as persistent unrest and violence in the  Middle East and North Africa. The QDR states that while the United States is willing to undertake security cooperation with Russia, both in the bilateral context and in seeking solutions to regional challenges, Russia’s  multi -dimensional defense modernization and actions that violate the sovereignty of neighbors present risks and thus the United States will engage Russia to increase transparency and reduce the risk of military miscalculation. Concerning the global trends, the report refers to the emergenc  e of international partners with the capacity to play security roles in their respective regions, as well as international  cooperation and shared norms of behavior at unprecedented levels of global interconnectedness.  At the same time it also states that t  he spread and proliferation of technology offers new tools for state and non- state adversaries such as terrorists to pursue asymmetric approaches in the 21st  century operational environment. Furthermore, the report states that in coming years, countries su  ch as China will continues seeking to counter U.S. strengths using anti-access and area-denial  (A2/AD) approaches  and by employing other new cyber and space control technologies. It also says that elements such as cyberspace, space, sophisticated technology, WMD, terrorism and  climate change poses additional challenges.

(1) Protect the Homeland: Maintain the capability to deter and defeat attacks on the United  States. Protection of the hom eland includes assisting U.S. civil authorities in protecting U.S. airspace, shores, and borders, and in responding effectively to domestic disasters.  (2) B uild se cur ity gl obally: Continue a strong U.S. commitment to shaping world events in ord er to dete r  and preven t c onflict and to assure the al lies and partner s of the shared security. (3) Project power and win decisively: the U.S. Forces deter acts of aggression in one or more the ater s by re maining capable of decisively defeating adversaries, while proje  cting pow er to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.  The QDR states that across the three pillars, the U.S. Forces are capable of simultaneously implementing the following undertakings, and if deterrence fails at any given time, U.S. forces could defeat a regional adversary in a large  scale multi  _phased campaign, and deny the_ `objectives of—or imposing unacceptable costs on—` _another aggressor in another region3._  _1) Defending homeland 2) Conducting sustained, distributed counterterrorist opera_  _tions_ `3) Deterring aggression and assuring allies through forward presence and engagement in multiple regions.` _Furthermore, in order to achieve the three pillars, the Department of Defense seeks innovative approaches to how to fight, how to posture the force, and how to leverage the asymmetric strengths and technological advantages. More specifically, the QDR mentions positioning additional forward_ _-deployed naval forces in critical areas, such as the Asia-_  Pacific region, and  **deploying new combinations of ships, aviation assets, and crisis response forces.** **(3) Rebalancing of the Joint Force**  Given major changes in the U.S. security environment including geopolitical changes, changes in modern warfare, and changes in the fiscal environment, the 2014 QDR states that the  States The 20 10 QDR s tate d that the U.S. Forces possess the capability of countering attacks by two countries while also being able to conduct a wi de range of operations. The 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance states that the United States maintain forces that are able to fully deny a capable state’s aggressive objectives in one region while being capable of denying the objectives of –  or imposing unacceptable costs on – an opportunistic aggressor in a second region.  _See_ `▶ Fig. III-2-3-2 (Progress of the Realignment of Force Structure of USFJ and the SDF Described in “Japan-U.S.`  _Roadmap for Realignment Implementation)_  1.

Following these discussions, the Governments of Japan and the U.S. decided to conduct  full-scale bilateral discussions concerning the plan for USFJ realignment, in view of factors  including the following: 1) The necessity of implementing measures to promptly and steadily  enable visible mitigation of impact on Okinawa; 2) The necessity of coordinating the  realignment package and strategic rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region, which was set out in the  U.S. Defense Strategic Guidance released in January 2012; and 3) The fact that a reduction in  the cost associated with the relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps to Guam has been demanded by  the U.S. Congress. The discussions led to the release of the “2+2” Joint Statement on April 27,  2012.  As described above, this “2+2” Joint Statement on April 27, 2012, stated that, in light of  important progress made in regard to the plan for USFJ realignment since the “2+2” Joint  Statement in June 2011, it had been decided to adjust the plans outlined in the 2006 Roadmap.  above will be added to the current level of FIP funding.",page,493,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

The Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), which was released in April 2010, indicates that the nuclear security environment is changing and nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation are an imminent threat today.

25007,"In conjunction with the realignment of the U.S. Marine Corps in the Asia-Pacific region, the  “2+2” Meeting in June 2011 and other agreements prescribe that approximately 8,000 personnel  of the III MEF and approximately 9,000 dependents, will be relocated from Okinawa to Guam  at the earliest possible date after 2014.  Regarding the costs of the relocation, the two sides reached an agreement that, of the estimated  $10.27 billion (in U.S. fiscal year 2008 dollars) cost of the facilities and infrastructure  development costs, Japan would provide $6.09 billion, including $2.8 billion in direct cash  contribution, while the U.S. would fund the remaining $4.18 billion. Of the costs to be borne by  Japan, with regard to projects for which Japan takes measures in the form of direct cash  contributions (so called Mamizu projects)[8] in order to legally guarantee that actions taken by  Japan and the United States such as funding over multiple years by Japan are on a more solid  footing, the Japanese Government and the U.S. Government signed “the Agreement between the  Government of Japan and the Government of the United States of America concerning the  Implementation of the Relocation of the III MEF personnel and their dependents from Okinawa  to Guam” (the Guam International Agreement) in February 2009. As part of the measures based  on this Agreement, the transfer of funds to the U.S. Government in relation to the Mamizu  projects has been taking place since FY2009[9].  Subsequently, in the “2+2” Joint Statement of April 2012, the unit composition and the number  of personnel to be relocated to Guam were revised. More specifically, in the Joint Statement, it  was stated that it is planned that Marine Air-Ground Task Forces (MAGTF) will be positioned  and deployed in Guam. While approximately 9,000 U.S. Marine Corps personnel along with  their associated dependents will be relocated from Okinawa to locations outside of Japan and  the authorized strength of the U.S. Marine Corps forces in Guam is to be around 5,000  personnel, the end-state for the presence of the U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa will be consistent  with the levels envisioned in the Roadmap.  In this Joint Statement, the preliminary cost estimate by the U.S. Government for the relocation  is $8.6 billion (in 2012 U.S. fiscal year dollars). With regard to Japan's financial commitment, it  was reaffirmed that it was to be the direct cash contribution up to the amount of $2.8 billion (in  U.S. fiscal year 2008 dollars) as stipulated in Article 1 of the Guam International Agreement.

For design projects expenses, approximately 700 million yen and 200 million yen in FY2012 and FY2013 respectively, were budgeted. 9 Funds of approximately 34.6 billion yen in FY2009, approximately 46.8 billion yen in FY2010, and approximately 9.3 billion yen in FY2011 were provided to the United States.",page,502,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

Moreover, it was stipulated that any funds that had  already been transferred to the U.S. Government under the Guam International Agreement  would be counted as part of the Japanese contribution. Furthermore, as a new initiative, a  portion of the direct cash contribution of $ 2.8 billion mentioned above would be used to  develop training areas in Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands as  shared use facilities for Japan and the U.S. In addition, it was agreed that the remaining costs  and any additional costs would be borne by the U.S., and that the two governments were to  complete a bilateral cost breakdown.  At the “2+2” Meeting in October 2013, the Ministers confirmed that the relocation of U.S.  Marine Corps personnel from Okinawa contributes to sustaining the forward presence of the  U.S. Forces and promoting the development of Guam as the strategic strongpoint, while also  mitigating the impact on Okinawa. On that occasion, a Protocol amending the Guam  International Agreement, which forms the basis for the bilateral cooperation necessary to  achieve these goals of the relocation, was signed. The amendment, which is in line with the  “2+2” Joint Statement of 2012, confirmed the delinking of the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps  units from Okinawa to Guam from progress on the Futenma Replacement Facility, and added  provisions concerning the development of training areas in Guam and the Commonwealth of  Northern Mariana Islands and the shared use of these training areas by the U.S. Forces and the  SDF. The limit on Japanese cash contributions remains unchanged at $2.8 billion (in U.S. fiscal  year 2008 dollars).  Under the relocation plan described in the 2012 “2+2” Joint Statement, U.S. Marine Corps units  are to begin to relocate from Okinawa to Guam in the first half of the 2020s. The plan is  considered to promote the implementation of the consolidation plan on returning the land areas  south of Kadena Air Base published in April 2013.  _See_ `▶ Reference41 (Agreement between the Government of Japan and the Government of the United States of`  _America Concerning the Implementation of the Relocation of III Marine Expeditionary Force Personnel and Their_  _Dependents from Okinawa to Guam); Reference42 (Protocol amending agreement between the government of japan_  _and the government of the United States of America concerning the implementation of the relocation of III marine_  _expeditionary force personnel and their dependents from Okinawa to Guam)_  (3) Return of Land Areas South of Kadena Air Base  At the SCC Joint Statement in April 2012, it was decided to delink the progress on the Futenma  Replacement Facility from both the relocation of the III MEF personnel from Okinawa to Guam,",page,503,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

In addition, with regard to the land to be returned, it  was agreed to conduct consultations focusing on three stages, namely 1) land eligible for  immediate return; 2) land eligible for return once the relocation of functions is completed; and  3) land eligible for return after the relocation abroad.  Since the change of administration at the end of 2012, Japan and the United States have  continued consultation under the basic policy of the Abe administration to dedicate all its  strength to mitigate the impact of the U.S. Forces on Okinawa communities. Japan strongly  requested an early return of lands south of Kadena, including Makiminato Service Area (Camp  Kinser), and as a result of coordination with the U.S. side, both countries announced the  consolidation plan in April 2013, which stipulated the return schedule, including the specific  years of return.  In the consolidation plan, both sides confirmed that they will implement the plan as early as  possible. The Government of Japan needs to continue to work with all its strength so that lands  south of Kadena would be returned at the earliest possible date. Furthermore, following the  announcement of the consolidation plan, the consultations have been held since April 2013,  involving Ginowan City, Ginowan City Military Land Owners Association, Okinawa Prefecture,  Okinawa Defense Bureau, and Okinawa General Bureau[10], in order to promote effective and  adequate use of West Futenma Housing Area within Camp Zukeran (Camp Foster). The  Ministry of Defense has also been providing necessary cooperation.  As a result of initiatives put in following the announcement of the consolidation plan in April  2013 toward the early return of mainly “areas eligible for immediate return upon completion of  necessary procedures” (areas boxed in red in Fig. III-2-3-6), the road has been paved toward the  return of land of all the four locations involved, including the land return of the north access  road of Makiminato Service Area completed in August 2013. As confirmed in the “2+2” Joint  Statement in October 2013, these returns are ahead of schedule. On April 14, 2014, Kin Town  agreed to accept the relocation of Camp Zukeran (Camp Foster) in the Shirahi River Area  Zukeran to Camp Hansen in the town.

As  the main force of air components of the U.S. Marine Corps, MV-22 aircraft play an important  role in engaging in a broad range of activities, including transportation of personnel and goods.  The U.S. Marine Corps is in the process of replacing rotary-wing airplanes (CH-46) with  MV-22s, which have superior basic performance. In June 2011, the Department of Defense  announced the replacement of CH-46s deployed at MCAS Futenma with MV-22s. On June 29,  2012, the U.S. Government made a Host Nation Notification that 12 CH-46s of one squadron in  Futenma would be replaced by 12 MV-22s and that CH- 46s of the second squadron would be  replaced by MV-22s in the summer of 2013. Following the U.S. announcement and notification,  the MOD officials explained measures to ensure safety to Okinawa Prefecture and Iwakuni City.  The movement of the first and the second squadron to MCAS Futenma was completed in  October 2012 and in September 2013, respectively.  The MV-22 is a highly capable aircraft; compared with the CH-46, it can fly twice as fast, can  carry three times the payload, and has four times the range. Its deployment to Okinawa will  strengthen the deterrence of the U.S. Forces in Japan as a whole and greatly contribute to the  peace and stability of the region.  (2) Safety of the MV-22 Osprey  After the crash of an MV-22 in Morocco in April 2012 and the crash of a CV-22[11] in Florida in  June 2012, concerns about its safety have grown among Japanese people.

Additionally, in order to confirm its safety, a Japanese analysis  and assessment team was set up to validate the contents of the accident investigations of the U.S.  government, based on Japan’s own viewpoints and knowledge. The team examined the  investigation results and confirmed that the accident in which the MV-22 crashed in Morocco  and the CV-22 crashed in Florida were caused largely by human factors and that there were no  safety problems with the aircraft itself.  Furthermore, to maximize the safety of MV-22 flight operations, the two governments discussed  matters concerning operations and measures to prevent accident recurrence at the Japan–U.S.  Joint Committee and other occasions. At the Japan–U.S. Joint Committee, both sides confirmed  that measures have been taken to address these human factors in light of the lessons learned  from the accidents and agreed to implement specific measures to ensure the safety of MV-22  operations in Japan.  Based on the above, considering that the safety of MV-22 operations in Japan is fully confirmed,  the Government of Japan released “On MV-22 Osprey Deployment to Okinawa” on September  19, 2012, and then flight operation of the MV-22 Osprey was started in Japan. Since then, the  Government of Japan recognizes that the U.S. has been in full compliance with the Joint  Committee agreement concerning the MV-22 and is operating the MV-22 with maximum  consideration for safety. Furthermore, in order to ensure that full consideration is given to local  residents and the Joint Committee agreement is properly implemented, the Government of Japan  has been continuously engaging with the U.S. side through various opportunities, including the  Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Meetings.  _See ▶ Fig. III-2-3-7 (Chronology of MV-22 Osprey Deployment to Okinawa)_  (3) Usability of MV-22 Osprey in Case of Disaster  In the aftermath of the devastating typhoon that hit the central Philippines in November 2013,  14 MV-22 Osprey aircraft, deployed in Okinawa, were dispatched for humanitarian assistance  and disaster relief activities to support “Operation Damayan”. The MV-22 combines the vertical  takeoff/landing and hovering functions of rotary-wing aircraft on the one hand, and the speed  and range of fixed-wing aircraft on the other. Provided its unique capabilities, MV-22s were  deployed promptly to affected areas that are difficult to access, and it can transport several  hundred isolated victims and about six tons of support goods in a day.

In order to mitigate the concentrated  impact on Okinawa, the Government of Japan is making initiatives toward the realization of the  SACO Final Report and the Roadmap. The MOD is committed to further mitigating the impact  on Okinawa through the Okinawa Policy Council, its subcommittee and other means[12], while  listening to the opinions of the local residents.  At the Okinawa Policy Council Meeting on December 17, 2013, the Governor of Okinawa  presented a number of requests, including cessation of the operation of MCAS Futenma within  five years and its early return, the re-deployment of about 12 MV-22 Osprey aircraft to bases  outside of Okinawa, and the total return of Makiminato Service Area within seven years.  While fully understanding that these requests reflect the sentiments of all Okinawan people, the  Government as a whole is addressing the mitigation of the impact on Okinawa, including the  establishment of the Council for Promoting the Mitigation of the Impact of MCAS Futenma on  Okinawa, consisting of the Chief Cabinet Secretary, the Minister of State for Okinawa, the  Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Defense, the Governor of Okinawa and the Mayor  of Ginowan.  On January 22, 2014, the MOD established the Committee for Promoting the Mitigation of the  Impact of Bases on Okinawa, headed by the Parliamentary Senior Vice-Minister of Defense,  and is addressing the issue with the strong resolve to do everything it can in order to mitigate  the impact on Okinawa.  At Team for Promoting the Mitigation of the Impact of MCAS Futenma on Okinawa, training  exercises involving the use of Osprey such as Japan-U.S. Bilateral Training Exercises held at  Aibano training area located in Shiga Prefecture in October 2013 will continue to be deliberated  so that about half of Osprey training exercises can be held outside Okinawa Prefecture.

This section will explain the current situation regarding measures  of this kind, such as the realignment of the U.S. Forces, including the question of how they are  being executed in each of the regions other than Okinawa.  1 Realignment of USFJ Facilities and Areas in Kanagawa Prefecture  The ideal state of USFJ facilities and areas in Kanagawa Prefecture has been discussed between  Japan and the United States due to the strong desire from local public bodies and other  organizations for their return. As a result, the basic concept pertaining to the return of six  facilities and areas(including Kami Seya Communication Station in Yokohama City), as well as  the construction of approximately 700 housing units for the U.S. Forces families in the  Yokohama area of the “Ikego Housing Area and Navy Annex” were agreed in October 2004, by  the Joint Committee.  Subsequently, the Joint Committee in September 2010 agreed that the number of housing units  to be constructed for the U.S. Forces families would be around 400, as an interim measure to  facilitate the relocation of the Negishi Housing Area, instead of approximately 700 housing  units as agreed in October 2004, and that part of land in the Zushi area of the “Ikego Housing  Area and Navy Annex” would be jointly used once the requirements are fulfilled, as a stopgap  measure until the land is returned.  Up to now, two facilities and areas (Koshiba POL Depot and Tomioka Storage Area) were  returned. After a round of bilateral consultations on the realization of the early return of the",page,508,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
25014,"remaining facilities and areas, the Joint Committee in April 2014 agreed on the specific timing  of the return of the Fukaya Communication Site and the Kami Seya Communication Station. In  addition, the Joint Committee also agreed to change the number of housing units to be  constructed from approximately 400 to 171.  _See_ `▶ Fig. III-2-3-8 (Facilities and Areas Related to the Reorganization of the USFJ Facilities and Areas in`  _Kanagawa Prefecture)_  2 Current Situation Regarding the Realignment of the U.S. Forces in Japan as Stipulated in the  Roadmap  (1) Improvement of U.S. Army Japan Command and Control Capability  To have enhanced mobility and readiness as well as to enable joint missions, the headquarters of  U.S. Army Japan (USARJ) at Camp Zama (in Kanagawa Prefecture) was reorganized into the  headquarters of the USARJI Corps (Forward) in December 2007 and the reorganization took  place at the end of September 2008.  With the aim of strengthening coordination with the reorganized USARJ headquarters so as to  enable rapid responses to various contingencies, the JGSDF Central Readiness Force  Headquarters, which unilaterally controls mobile operation units and specialized units, was  relocated from JGSDF Camp Asaka (in Saitama Prefecture) to Camp Zama, where the  headquarters of U.S. Army Japan (USARJ) are located, at the end of FY2012. In accordance  with the transformation of USARJ headquarters, a mission command training center and other  support facilities were constructed within the U.S. Forces Sagami General Depot (SGD, in  Kanagawa Prefecture) using U.S. funding. In addition, measures will be implemented for more  effective and efficient use of Camp Zama and the SGD, including partial release of facilities and  areas. The partial release of land (approx. 17 ha) at SGD was approved by the Joint Committee  in June 2008, while the partial release of land (approx. 5.4ha) at Camp Zama, and the  joint/shared use of a portion of land at SGD (approx. 35ha) were approved in October 2011 and  June 2012, respectively, by the Joint Committee.  (2) Yokota Air Base and Airspace  a. Establishment of the Bilateral Joint Operations Coordination Center (BJOCC)  Enhancement of coordination between headquarters, combined with the transition to joint  operational posture, is quite important from the perspective of ensuring flexible and rapid  responses of the SDF and the U.S. Forces. The headquarters of the U.S. Forces in Japan located  at Yokota Air Base (in Tokyo) plays an important role in the various mechanisms under the  Guidelines. Therefore, along with the relocation of ASDF Air Defense Command HQ as",page,509,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
25015,"mentioned below, the BJOCC[13] was established and commenced operations at the end of  FY2011.  _See_ `▶Part III, Chapter 2, Section 1-2 (Recent Major Achievements in Defense Cooperation and Exchange)`  b. Relocation of ASDF Air Defense Command HQ  The ASDF Air Defense Command HQ not only defends airspace, but also functions as a  headquarters for BMD operations. In the case of air defense and BMD, the response time is very  short. Therefore, it is important for the SDF and the U.S. Forces to immediately share the  necessary information. Thus, at the end of FY2011, approximately 800 personnel from the  ASDF Air Defense Command HQ, which was formerly located in Fuchu (Tokyo), and its  relevant units were relocated to Yokota Air Base where the U.S.5th Air Force, Headquarters is  located. This arrangement and the establishment of the above-mentioned BJOCC have made it  possible to enhance coordination between the headquarters of the SDF and the U.S. Forces,  including the sharing of information concerning air defense and BMD.  c. Yokota Airspace  At Yokota Air Base, the U.S. Forces conduct radar approach control for the Yokota airspace  spreading from the western part of the Tokyo Metropolitan area to Niigata Prefecture. Measures  have been taken to facilitate the operation of civilian airplanes that enter the airspace.  Since September 2006, the temporary transfer of responsibility for air traffic control of portions  of Yokota airspace to Japanese authorities, when not required for military purposes, has been  started. Moreover, the collocation of the U.S. Forces and ASDF air traffic controllers at the  Yokota Radar Approach Control (Yokota RAPCON) facility started in May 2007. The area  adjacent to the west side of Haneda Airport was cut by about 40% in September 2008 and the  air traffic control operation was returned to Japan. In addition, the review of the conditions  required for the possible return of the entire Yokota airspace was completed in May 2010.  d. Civilian-Military Dual Use of Yokota Air Base  At the Japan–U.S. Summit Meeting held in May 2003, it was agreed that the joint  civilian-military use of Yokota Air Base would be studied, and a Liaison Conference was then  established as a working panel attended by relevant government ministries and agencies and the  Tokyo Metropolitan Government, with discussions ongoing since then.  13 The BJOCC functions to contribute to providing a joint response for Japan’s defense. To that end, it works to enhance information sharing between the Japanese and U.S. headquarters, close coordination, and interoperability.",page,510,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
25016,"The Governments of Japan and the United States have conducted a study, starting in October  2006, on the specific conditions and modalities, with the understanding that joint use will not  compromise the military operations and safety of Yokota Air Base. Based on further  coordination and the outcome of the study, both governments will consult and then make  appropriate decisions.  (3) Measures relating to U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka, Atsugi Air Facility and MCAS Iwakuni  a. Deployment of U.S. Aircraft Carrier  The nuclear aircraft carrier [14] USS George Washington is currently forward deployed to  Yokosuka (Kanagawa Prefecture).The presence of the U.S. Pacific Fleet plays an important role  in ensuring maritime security in the Asia-Pacific region as well as regional peace and stability.  The U.S. aircraft carrier provides the core capability of the Fleet.  In January 2014, the U.S. Navy announced that the aircraft carrier USS George Washington will  proceed to the United States in preparation for fuel exchange, and in its place, the  nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan will be forward deployed.  The U.S. Navy vows that it will continue to ensure that all of its nuclear-powered vessels  (including the nuclear carrier USS George Washington) adhere to the relevant safety policies.  For example, the nuclear reactor will normally be shut down while the aircraft carrier is  anchored, and repair work and fuel changes will not be carried out in Japan. The Government of  Japan intends to continue taking all possible measures to ensure safety.  b. Relocation of Carrier-Based Aircraft  Atsugi Air Facility (in Kanagawa Prefecture) is currently used as a base for carrier-based  aircraft. Since Atsugi Air Facility is located at the center of an urban district, the noise of carrier  jets taking off and landing in particular has been a problem for a long time. It is necessary to  resolve such problems as soon as possible in order to stably maintain the operations of aircraft  carriers.  On the other hand, after the completion of the runway relocation project[15] at MCAS Iwakuni  (the relocation of the runway approximately 1,000 meters offshore), safe aircraft operations  14 Nuclear-powered aircraft carriers are driven by energy generated in a nuclear reactor, so there is no need to replenish their fuel and they are able to maintain the high speeds necessary for the operation of aircraft, giving them excellent combat and operational capabilities. 15 A project to relocate the runway of MCAS Iwakuni by approximately 1,000 meters to the east (offshore), in response to the requests from Iwakuni City and other local authorities. The new runway commenced its operations in May 2010. The project was completed at the end of FY2010.",page,511,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
25017,"have been realized with less impact on the living environment of the surrounding communities.  Taking these factors into consideration, CVW-5 squadrons will be relocated from Atsugi Air  Facility to MCAS Iwakuni. In order to mitigate impacts of the increased operations at MCAS  Iwakuni due to the projected relocation, related measures will be taken, including:  (1) conducting the relocation after the runway is moved offshore, (2) relocation of MSDF  EP-3,etc. in MCAS Iwakuni to Atsugi Air Facility, and (3) deployment of KC- 130 (to be  relocated from MCAS Futenma to MCAS Iwakuni) on a regular rotational basis to MSDF  Kanoya Base and Guam, and (4) relocation of U.S. Marine Corps CH-53D helicopters from  MCAS Iwakuni to Guam.  As a result of these measures, it is expected that the noise around MCAS Iwakuni will be  alleviated. For instance, the area requiring residential noise-abatement work (so-called first  category area) will decrease from approximately 1,600 ha to 500 ha.  Subsequently, at the “2+2” held in October 2013, it was acknowledged that the relocation of  CVW-5 from Atsugi Air Facility to MCAS Iwakuni should be completed by around 2017. In  addition, with regard to the relocation of MSDF EP-3,etc. to Atsugi Air Facility as stated in  (2)above, upon the request of local public entities in the vicinity of MCAS Iwakuni, it was  confirmed that, as a result of Japan-U.S. deliberation including defense posture review, MSDF  EP-3,etc. would stay in MCAS Iwakuni.  Concerning the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps CH-53D helicopters from MCAS Iwakuni to  Guam in (4) above, Japan and the United States confirmed that based on the Roadmap, etc., the  unit, which has been dispatched to the Middle East from MCAS Iwakuni, will be relocated to  Guam without returning to MCAS Iwakuni.  With regard to the site (Atagoyama) for constructing family housing required for the relocation  of carrier-based aircraft to MCAS Iwakuni, the sales contract of the site was concluded in  March 2012, and site development work for family housing and sports facilities, etc. is being  undertaken now.  c. A bilateral framework to conduct a study on a permanent FCLP  The 2006 Roadmap prescribes that a bilateral framework to conduct a study on a permanent  FCLP facility is to be established with the goal of selecting a permanent site at the earliest  possible date. At the “2+2” Meeting of June 2011, it was stated that the Government of Japan  will explain to local authorities that Mageshima is considered to be the candidate for the new",page,512,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
25018,"SDF facility. This SDF facility would be used to support operations in response to a variety of  situations including large-scale disasters as well as regular exercises and other activities,  including use by the U.S. Forces as a permanent site for FCLP. In addition, the 2005 SCC  document confirmed that the U.S. Forces will continue to conduct FCLP at Iwo-To in  accordance with existing temporary arrangements until a permanent FCLP training facility is  identified.  d. Resumption of Commercial Aviation at MCAS Iwakuni  Considering that the local public entities, including Yamaguchi Prefecture and Iwakuni City, had  been working together to request the resumption of commercial aviation operations, in October  2005, it was agreed that commercial aviation operations of four round trips per day would be  allowed as long as such operations do not compromise U.S. military operational requirements.  It was then agreed in the Roadmap that portions of the future civilian air facility would be  accommodated at MCAS Iwakuni. Based on this agreement, Iwakuni Kintaikyo Airport was  opened on December 13, 2012, resuming regular flights of commercial aviation after 48 years.  (4) Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)  Japan and the United States are set to continue close coordination on BMD as the two countries  improve their respective BMD capabilities. More specifically, an AN/TPY-2 radar (so-called  “X-Band Radar”) system was deployed to the U.S. Shariki Communication Site[16]. Also in  October 2006, U.S. Army Patriot PAC-3 units (Patriot Advanced Capability) were deployed to  Kadena Air Base and Kadena Ammunition Storage Area.  At the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting in February 2013, both sides agreed on the necessity of the  additional deployment of TPY-2 radar in Japan, to further enhance BMD capabilities.  At the “2+2” Meeting held in October 2013, the Ministers confirmed their intention to designate  the ASDF Kyogamisaki sub-base as the deployment site for a second AN/TPY-2 radar (X-band  radar) system, and Japan provided the facilities and area necessary for the deployment to the  United States in December 2013.  _See ▶ Part III, Chapter 1, Section1-3 (Response to Ballistic Missile Attacks)_  (5) Training Relocation  16 The radar was deployed to ASDF Shariki Sub Base (in Aomori Prefecture) in June 2006, but was thereafter transferred to the neighboring U.S. Shariki Communication Site.",page,513,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
25019,"As for training relocation[17], the aircraft of three U.S. military facilities – Kadena, Misawa (in  Aomori Prefecture), and MCAS Iwakuni – are set to be relocated to the following ASDF  facilities for the time being: Chitose (in Hokkaido), Misawa, Hyakuri (in Ibaraki Prefecture),  Komatsu (in Ishikawa Prefecture), Tsuiki (in Fukuoka Prefecture), and Nyutabaru (in Miyazaki  Prefecture) in order to conduct joint exercises with ASDF. Based on this, since March 2007, the  U.S. Forces in Japan have conducted training relocation from their Air Bases to those ASDF  Bases. The MOD has been conducting site surveys at the ASDF bases to improve their  infrastructure, when required, – so that they can better host training relocation at the SDF  facilities.  MOD’s local Defense Bureaus have been making every effort to ensure that training relocation  goes smoothly by collaborating with the ASDF to support the U.S. Forces and that local people  feel safe during training periods by setting up an on-site local headquarters as liaison between  government agencies and local residents.  Furthermore, based on the “2+2” Joint Statement in May 2010, at the Japan-U.S. Joint  Committee held in January 2011, both governments agreed to include Guam as a training  relocation site and expand the scale of training. They continued to have discussions and agreed  on details such as sites where training is conducted, at the Joint Committee in October 2011.  According to the agreement, relocation training was conducted in areas including Guam for the  first time and since then, U.S. aircraft have been conducting training there.  Furthermore, in addition to existing fighter combat training, the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee  agreed to add air-to-ground firing/bombing training using the Misawa air-to-ground  firing/bombing range as part of training relocation to be conducted at ASDF bases at Misawa or  Chitose. This training contributes to enhancing interoperability between the SDF and the U.S.  Forces, and also relocates some of the air-to-ground firing/bombing training previously  conducted at the Torishima firing/bombing rage, etc. with U.S. Forces aircraft flying to Kadena  Air Base. Thus, this training relocation will help reduce noise around Kadena Air Base, thereby  contributing to the mitigation of the impact on Okinawa.  **5 Initiatives for Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of the U.S. Forces in Japan**  In order to smoothly implement the realignment of the U.S. Forces in Japan based on the  Roadmap, the “Act on Special Measures on Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of  17 USFJ aircraft conduct bilateral exercises at JASDF facilities in order to improve interoperability and reduce the impact of training activities on the areas surrounding USFJ air bases.",page,514,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
25020,"United States Forces in Japan (USFJ Realignment Special Measures Act)” was enacted in  August 2007. Realignment grants, Special Subsidy Rates for Public Projects, etc. and other  systems were established based on the law.  During a period of time before and after the implementation of realignment (10 years in  principle), realignment grants[18] will be awarded to help cover the expenses of projects[19] which  contribute to increasing the convenience of the lives of residents of local municipalities affected  by the realignment[20], and to stimulate local industries. To this end, they will be awarded in  accordance with progress made in the steps of U.S. Forces realignment, after the Defense  Minister designates the specified defense facilities and neighboring municipalities affected by  realignment. As of April 2014, 16 defense facilities in 41 municipalities are eligible to receive  the grant.  In addition, under U.S. Forces realignment, some USFJ facilities and areas will be returned, and  the U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa will be relocated to Guam. Since this may affect the  employment of USFJ local employees, the Government of Japan will take measures to maintain  their employment, including education and skills training.  18 Approximately 10 billion yen in the FY2014 budget 19 Under the Realignment Special Measures Act, changes in the composition of units of those naval vessels that conduct operations integrally with US air wings subject to realignment (replacement of the aircraft carrier at Yokosuka Naval Base with a nuclear aircraft carrier) will be treated in the same way as the realignment of the U.S. Forces in Japan. 20 The scope of specific projects includes 14 projects identified by Article 2 of the enforcement ordinance of the Act on Special Measures on Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of United States Forces in Japan, including education, sports, and cultural projects.",page,515,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

Based on the understanding that the United States is at an inflection point due to factors both insid e and outside the country, that is, the U.S. Forces’  withdrawal fro m Iraq and Afghani stan after a decade of war and the demand for deep cuts in gover nmen t spending including defense spending under the government’s serious fiscal situation, the guidance was  developed to review defense priorities and present a blueprint for the Joint Force in 2020. In the new Defense Strategic Guidance, the Obama Administration articulated a policy that would place the Asia  -   Pacific region at the focus of U.S. strategy, includ  ing the security strategy (Rebalancing to the Asia  -  Pacific Region). Furthermore, in March 2014 the Admin ist ration pu blished the Qua drennial Defense Revie w ( QDR), the second review  since President Obama took office. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense Strat egic  Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it, including rebalancing to the Asia  -  Pacific region, indicating that the Obama Administration continues to place an emphasis on the region.  **Meanwhil e, as the gr owing budget deficits of the U.S. go**  **ve rnment in rec ent years have ca lled**  **for deep cuts in spending, in January 2012 the Department of Defense announced that the reduction in defense spending will amount to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from**  FY2012 to FY2021 th various countries expand in terms of both  .

25022,"at tentio n will be paid to how the mandatory sequestration cuts in defense spending will impact  the U.S. defense strategies and security policies outlined in the QDR and other documents.  1 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR)  In March 2014, the Department of Defense released the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). The QDR outlines policies concerning U.S. Forces' capabilities and composition in anticipation  of the security environment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the Secretary of Defense submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds  on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it. (1) Understanding of Security  `The 2014 QDR states that the future international security environment remains uncertain and complicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between states, non- state entities and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly accelerating spread of information. In addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals, and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces.` _The QDR recognizes that the Asia_ _-Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce, politics and security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the region continues to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their milita_  _ry and_ `security capabilities, bringing greater risk that tensions arising from long- standing sovereign disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehe nsive scope of China’s military moderni zation c ontinues, co mbin ed with a relat ive la ck of transp arency and openness regarding both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its lo ng` _- range missile and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit_  _of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to_  th  e United States.  **As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of**  trans -national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile states. The report states that Iran remains a  destabilizing actor that threatens security by defying international law and pursing capabilities  that wo uld a llow it t o develop nucl ear weapons. Even as Iran pledges not to pursue nuclear egion, and the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting  (ADMM), which is a ministerial level meeting between defense authorities in the ASEAN  countries. In addition, at the 4[th] ADMM in May 2010, a decision was taken to establish the  ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus), which added eight new non-ASEAN  countries[1], including Japan to the members (those countries are called the “Plus countries”); the  1st ADMM-Plus was held in October that year, in Hanoi, Vietnam.  Until the establishment of the ADMM-Plus, there had been no official meeting for the region’s  defense ministers in the Asia Pacific region. The establishment of the ADMM-Plus is highly  significant from the perspective of encouraging the development and deepening of security and  defense cooperation in the region. Furthermore, the ADMM-Plus is a framework that tackles a  broad and diverse range of security issues in the region; the MOD and the SDF are also of the  view that the ADMM-Plus should be developed as a major pillar of security cooperation in the  region, and are providing active support for its initiatives.  At the 1st ADMM-Plus, it was decided to create (1) ADSOM-Plus (ASEAN Defence Senior  Officials’ Meeting-Plus), (2) ADSOM-Plus Working Groups (ADSOM-Plus WG), and (3)  Experts’ Working Groups (EWG), and Japan and Singapore served as co-chairs of the EWG on  Military Medicine until March 2014. In July 2012, the 2nd meeting of the EWG on Military  Medicine was held in Tokyo, and the participants exchanged practical opinions on approaches to  cooperation in each country and issues faced in this regard, in the field of military medicine at  1 Japan, the U.S., Australia, the ROK, India, New Zealand, China, and Russia.",page,517,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

Concerning the global trends, the report refers to the emergenc e of international partners with the capacity to play security roles in their respective regions, as well as international  cooperation and shared norms of behavior at unprecedented levels of global interconnectedness.

The QDR also says that while the force will become smaller, it will become more modern as well, with readiness improving. Furthermore, it states that particularly in an era of reduced budget and other resources, the Department will redouble its efforts to protect key capability areas listed below, that are most closely aligned to the pillars of the defense strategy.  1) Missile defense: Increase the number of Ground- Based Interceptors and build depth into the sensor network. Deploy a second radar in Japan that will improve early warning and tracking of any missiles launched by North Korea. Increase defense interceptor reliability and effectiveness to improve discrimination capabilities, and to establish a more robust sensor network.

(a) Program OverviewThe Bipartisan Budget Act by the Democratic and  Republican parties which passed in December 2013 mitigated the sequestration caps for FY2014 and FY2015.

For Overseas Contingency Operations, the budget includes 58.6 billion dollars, an amount that is 20.9  billion dollars les s than the amount in the FY2014 budget request, reflecting the plan to withdraw troops from Afghani stan. The key principles of the defense budget are as follows: (1) Seek a balanced force;  (2) Prepare for prolonged readiness challenges including uncertain fiscal outlook; (3) Continue to focus on institutional reform; and (4) Pursue compensation changes. Major decisions include a reduction of end strength of active Army from the current 520,000 down to 440,000 450,000 personnel, maintaining 11 aircraft carriers of the Navy, a commitment to the F 35 development  and procurement program, and retirement of all A-10 tactical fighters and U 2 rec onnaissan ce  aircraft.

Based on the understanding that the United States is at an inflection point due to factors both insid e and outsi de th e country, tha t is, the U.S. Fo rces’  withdrawal fr om I raq and Afgh anis tan after a dec ade of war and the demand for deep cuts in  government spending including defense spending under the government’s serious fiscal situation, the guidance was  developed to review defense priorities and present a blueprint for the  **Joint Force in 2020. In the new Defense Strategic Guidance, the Obama Administration articulated a policy that would place the Asia-Pacific region at the focus of U.S. strategy, includ**  ing the security strategy (Rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific Region). Furthermore, in March 2014 the Administration published the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the second review since President Obama took office. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense S  trategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it, including rebalancing to the Asia- Pacific  region, indicating that the Obama Administration continues to place an emphasis on the region.  Meanwhile, as the growing budget deficits of the U.S. go  vernmen t in recent yea rs have called  for deep cu ts in spending, in Januar y 2 012 the D epartmen t of Def ense a nnou nced that the  reduction in defense spending will amount to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from eY2012 to FY2021  and disaster relief activities..

The QDR outlines policies concerning U.S. Forces' capabilities and composition in anticipation  of the security environment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the Secretary of Defen se submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds  on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it.  (1) U nder standin g of Security The 2014 QDR states that the future international security environmen t remains uncertain and complicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between states, no n  -  state entities and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly accelerating spread of information. In  addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals,  and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces. The QDR recognizes that the Asia-Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce,  politics and security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the region continues to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their military and security capabilities, bringing greater risk that tensions arising from long  -  standing sovereign  disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehe  nsive scope of China’s military  mod erniza tion c ontinues, c ombine d with a relat ive lac k of tra nsparen cy a nd openne ss r egarding  both milita ry capab ili ties and inte ntions.

As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of  trans -national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile  states. The report states that Iran remains a destabilizing actor that threatens security by defying international law and pursing capabilities that would allow it to develop nuclear weapons. Even as Iran pledges not to pursue nuclear the defense field, it was decided to enhance practical cooperation and  commence negotiations towards a framework agreement in the field of defense equipment and  technology cooperation, as well as confirming that interoperability between the defense units of  the two countries will be improved, and further enhancing practical cooperation such as bilateral  exercises.

(1) Protect the Homeland: Maintain the capability to deter and defeat attacks on the United States. Protection of the hom  eland includes assisting U.S. civil authorities in protecting U.S.  airspace, shores, and borders, and in responding effectively to domestic disasters.  (2) Build security globally: Continue a strong U.S. commitment to shaping world events in  order to deter  and prevent conflict and to assure the allies and partners of the shared security.  (3) Project power and win decisively: the U.S. Forces deter acts of aggression in one or more  theaters by remaining capable of decisively defeating adversaries, while projecting power to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. The QDR states that across the three pillars, the U.S. Forces are capable of simultaneously implementing the following undertakings, and if deterrence fails at any given time, U.S. forces could defeat a regional adversary in a large  L scale multi - phased campaign, and deny the obj ectives of— or i mposin g un accep table costs on — another aggressor in another region  Corps.  1) Defending homeland 2) Conducting sustained, distributed counterterrorist opera  tions  3) Deterring aggression and assuring allies through forward presence and engagement in  multiple regions.

In November 2011, U.S. President Obama delivered a speech in the Australian Parliament, clearly stating, for the first time, that he will give top priority to the U.S. presence and mission in the Asia  -   Pacific region and indicating that the U.S. will maintain its strong presence in Japan and the Korean Peninsula, while enhancing its presence in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, the 2014 QDR states that the centerpiece of the Department of Defense commitment to the rebalance toward the Asia- Pacific region is to modernize and enhance  security alliances with Australia, Japan, the ROK, the Philippines and Thailand.  the regional situations including North Korea and the cooperation between Japan, the United  Some of the implications anticipated in the case of the return of the sequester  -  level cuts include a  reducti  on in end strength of active Army to 420,000, retirement of the USS George Washington aircraft  carrier (10 aircraft carriers), a reduction in end strength of marine corps to 175,000, a further retirement of  air force aircraft and a slowdown of purchases of F -   35 aircraft.

With regard to training and exercises, the MSDF participated in Japan-U.S.-ROK search and  rescue trilateral exercises in the waters in west of Kyushu in May and October 2013, and also  conducted counter-piracy exercises in the Gulf of Aden in December 2013, to strengthen the  coordination and cooperation among the three countries. In addition, the GSDF has been  promoting initiatives to enhance relationships, starting at the junior officer level who will  become future leaders, for example, through exchanges between junior officers held in  December 2013 and April 2014. It is important to further develop cooperative relations among  Japan, the United States, and the ROK in this way, in order to contribute to the peace and  stability of the region.",page,533,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

Moreover, in December 2009, the prime ministers of Japan and India formulated the Action  Plan to advance security cooperation between their two countries. The Action Plan includes  measures to promote cooperation in maritime security such as cooperation in anti-piracy  activities and the holding of joint exercises at sea.  2 Recent Major Achievements in Defense Cooperation and Exchanges  Upon Prime Minister Singh’s visit to Japan in May 2013, the prime ministers of Japan and India  welcomed the expanding defense relations between the two countries based on the Joint  Declaration on Security Cooperation between Japan and India. Also they signed the joint  statement in which they decided to conduct on a regular basis and with increased frequency  bilateral exercises between the MSDF and the Indian Navy and to establish a Joint Working  Group (JWG) regarding the US-2 rescue amphibian.  _See_ `▶ Part.

In June 2013, U.S. President Obama delivered a speech on the reduction of nuclear weapons in Berlin, whi ch was then followed by the release of the Report on Nuclear Employment Strategy by the Department of Defense on the same day. The report revealed U.S. intentions to negotiate  with Russia to pursue up to a one third reduction in deployed strategic nuclear weapons.

The key principles of the defense budget are as follows: (1) Seek a balanced force; (2) Prepare for prolonged readiness challenges  including uncertain fiscal outlook; (3) Continue to focus on institutional reform; and (4) Pursue compensation changes. Major decisions include a reduction of end strength of active Army from the current 520,000 down to 440,000-450,000 personnel, maintaini ng 11 aircraft carriers of the Navy, a commitment to the F- 35 development  and procurement program, and retirement of all A- 10 tactical fighters and U -  2 reconnaissance  aircraft.

The United States Code mandates that the  Secretary of Defen se submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds  on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it.  (1) Understanding of Security The 2014 QDR states that the future international security environment remains uncertain and complicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between states, non  -  state entities and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly  accelerating spread of information. In  addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals, and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces.  The QDR recognizes t  hat the Asia -Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce,  politics and security.

In  particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehe nsive scope of China’s military  modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding  both military capabilities and intentions.

Concerning the global trends, the report refers to the emergence of international partners with  the capacity to play security roles in their respective regions, as well as international cooperation and shared norms of behavior at unprecedented levels of global interconnectedness. At the same time it also states that the spread and proliferation of technology offers new tools for state and non- state adversaries such as terrorists to pursue asymmetric approaches in the 21st  century operational environment.

(2) Build security globally: Continue a strong U.S. commitment to shaping world events in order to deter  and prevent conflict and to assure the allies and partners of the shared security. (3) Project power and win decisively: the U.S. Forces deter acts of aggression in one or more theaters by remaining capable of decisively defeating adversaries, while proje  cting power to  provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. The QDR states that across the three pillars, the U.S. Forces are capable of simultaneously  implementing the following undertakings, and if deterrence fails at any given time, U.S. forces could defeat a regional adversary in a large  -  scale multi  -  phased campaign, and deny the objectives of  —  or imposing unacceptable costs on  — an other ag gres sor in a nothe r r egio n  convoy sails across the Gulf of Aden, the destroyer guard.  1) Defending homeland 2) Conducting sustained, distributed counterterrorist operations  3) D eter ring aggression and assuring allies through forward presence and engagement in multiple regions.

In January 2012, the Obama administration released the new_ `Defense Strategic Guidance . Bas ed on the understanding that the United States is at an inflection point due to factors both inside and outside the country, that is, the U.S. Forces’ withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan after a decade of war and the demand for deep cuts in government spending including defense spending under the government’s serious fiscal situation, the guidance was developed to review defense priorities and present a blueprint for the Joint Force in 2020. In the new Defense Strategic Guidance, the Obama Administration articul ate d a policy tha t wo uld place the Asia`  _-_ _Pacific region at the focus of U.S. strategy, includ_ _ing the security strategy (Rebalancing to the Asia_  -   **Pacific Region). Furthermore, in March** **2014 the Administration published the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the second review**  since President Obama took office. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense Strategic  Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it, including rebalancing to the Asia Pacific  region, indicating that the Obama Administration continues to place an emphasis on the region. Meanwhile, as the growing budget deficits of the U.S. go  vernment i n re cent years have c all ed for deep cuts in spending, in January 2012 the Department of Defense announced that the reductio n in defe nse spending will amount to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from  FY2012 to FY2021 . In addition, the g overnment budget sequestration  Anti, including defense spending, was init iated in March 201 3, bringing various impacts on the U.S. Forces including suspension of training, delayed deployment of aircraft carriers, and grounding of air squadrons. Although the Bi partisan Budget Act of the Democratic and Republican parties mitigated the sequestration spendin g cuts for FY2014 and FY2015, the QDR emphasizes that the risks to the  U.S. Forces would increase considerably if sequester-level cuts return in FY2016.

The QDR outlines policies concerning U.S. Forces' capabilities and composition in anticipation of the security environment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the  Secretary of Defen  se submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds  on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it. (1) Understanding of Security  The 201 4 Q DR s tates tha t the future international securit y en vironmen t r emains u ncertain and  complicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between states, non state entities and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly accelerating spread of information. In addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states  that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals, and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces. The QDR recognizes t  hat the Asia  -  Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce,  politics and security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the region continues to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their military and security capabilities, bringing greater risk that tensions arising from long standing sovereign disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehensive scope of China’s military  modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its long - range missil e and weapons of  mass d estruc tion (WMD) prog rams, particularl y i ts pursu it  of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to th  e United States.  As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of  trans- national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile states. The report states that Iran remains a destabilizing actor that threatens security by defying international law and pursing capabilities that would allow it to develop nuclear weapons. Even as Iran pledges not to pursue nuclear  The SDF promotes capacity-building initiatives regarding information-gathering abilities and  defensive abilities in dispatch destinations, which are required to complete missions while  ensuring the security of personnel and units during international peace cooperation activities.

The GSDF promotes initiatives to enhance the conditions  3 This is a system adopted by the United Nations in 1994 in order to facilitate agile deployment for U.N. peacekeeping operations.

For Overseas Contingency  Operations, the budget includes 58.6 billion dollars, an amount that is 20.9  billion dollars less than the amount in the FY2014 budget request, reflecting the plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. The key principles of the defense budget are as follows: (1) Seek a balanced force;  (2) Prepare for prolonged readiness challenges including uncertain fiscal outlook; (3) Continue  to focus on institutional reform; and (4) Pursue compensation changes. Major decisions include a reduction of end strength of active Army from the current 520,000 down to 440,000- 450,000 personnel, maintaining 11 aircraft carriers of the Navy, a commitment to the F- 35 development and procurement program, and retirement of all A  -  10 tactical fighters and U  _-_ `2 reconnaissance aircraft.

On homeland defense, the review noted that the U.S. would use ground-_ _based interceptors to respond to ICBMs f_  rom North Korea and Iran, and that in regard  to regional defense, the U.S. would expand investments in MD systems while taking a phased adaptive approach (PAA) that is tailored to each region and improve the MD capabilities step by step, working with partn  er countries and properly sharing the burden. However, in January 2012,  the U.S. announced that it will continue investments in MD programs in its homeland and Europe while reducing the spending for deployable regional MD systems with a view to increasing reliance on its allies and partners in the future.

In  `addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals, and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces.

Since  FY2005, the cost of maintenance and upkeep has overtaken the costs associated with the  purchase of major items of equipment and materials, creating an additional strain on the  procurement of new major items of equipment and materials. Moreover, the increasingly  high-performance and complex nature of equipment and materials has brought about a rise in  development and manufacturing costs, inflating the unit price of equipment and materials. These  circumstances have brought about a decline in the quantity procured, leading to problems such  as difficulties in maintaining and cultivating highly-skilled factory workers, as well as the  emergence of companies withdrawing from the defense business altogether, due to the opaque  outlook for the future.  _See_ `▶ Reference 61 (Change in Equipment Volumes Procured, by Procurement Method)`  2 The Current Status of Research and Development",page,575,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

In the new Defense Strategic Guidance, the Obama Administration articulated a policy that would place the Asia Pacific region at the focus of U.S. strategy,  includ ing the security strategy (Rebalancing to the Asia -oa cific Re gion). F urthe rmore, in M arc h 2014 the Administration published the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the second review since Pr esident Obama to ok office. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense S  trategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it, including rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific  region, indicating that the Obama Administration continues to place an emphasis on the region. Meanwhile, as the growing budget deficits of the U.S. government in recent years have called  for deep cuts in spending, in January 2012 the Department of Defense announced that the reduction in defense spending will amount to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from  FY2012 to FY2021  Based on this awareness, since March 2013, there have been several meetings held by the  .

The QDR outlines policies concerning U.S. Forces' capabilities and composition in anticipation of the security environment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the Secretary of Defen se submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds  on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it.  (1) Understanding of Security  The 2014 QDR s tates th at the futu re int ernational security environment remains uncertain and complica ted due to the shif ting inter nati onal balance of power; the greater interaction between  states, non -   state entities and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly [accelerating spread of information. In] addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states  that the Unite d S tates col lab orat es wi th all ies and partners t o accompl ish a wide range of goals,  and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces.  The QDR recognizes t  hat the Asia  -   Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce, politics and security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the region continues to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their military and  secu rity cap abi lities, bringing gr eater risk tha t t ensions ari sing fro m long  -  standing sovereign  disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In  **particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehe** **nsive scope of China’s military modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding**  both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its long  -   range missile and weapons of  mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to th  e United States.  As for the Midd le East, th e report sugg ests t hat the se ct arian di vide is among the sources of  trans -   national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile  states.

Furthermore, it states that as countries in the Middle East and Africa undergo political and social change, terrorist groups seek to expand their influence, and internal strife in Syria has become a magnet for global jihad, bringing ongoing spillover effects including an influx of foreign f ighters and a flood of refugees into neighboring countries. In Africa, it mentions that terrorists, criminal organizations and pirates exploit ungoverned and under  -  governed territory, causing potential for rapidly developing threats, particularly of terrorist attacks in fragile states, that could pose acute challenges to U.S. interests.  The report says that Europe remains the principal partner in promoting global security, particularly in addressing challenges such as persistent unrest and violence in the  Middle East  and North Africa. The QDR states that while the United States is willing to undertake security cooperation with  Russia, both in the bilateral context and in seeking solutions to regional challenges, Russia’s multi dimensional defense modernization and actions that violate the sovereignty of neighbors present risks and thus the United States will engage Russia to increase transparency and reduce the risk of military miscalculation.  Concerning the global trends, the report refers to the emergence of international partners with the capacity to play security roles in their respective regions, as well as international  cooper ation and shared norms of behavior at unprecedented levels of global interconnectedness. At the same time it also states that t he spread and pro liferati on of techn ology offers new to ols for state and non  state adversaries such as terrorists to pursue asymmetric approaches in the 21st  century operational environment. Furthermore, the report states that in coming years, countries su ch as China will continues seeking to counter U.S. strengths using anti  access and area -denial (A2/AD) approachesship missiles required  and by employing other new cyber and space control technologies. It also says that elements such as cyberspace, space, sophisticated technology, WMD, terrorism and climate change poses additional challenges. (2) Defense Strategy  The 2014 QDR emphasizes the following three pillars, which are interdependent and mutually  **See Part I Overview, Section 2, footnote 4**  In order to deal with the increase in expenditure on the maintenance of defense equipment,  initiatives focused on effective and efficient maintenance and replenishment are required. To  date, the MOD has been endeavoring to achieve greater efficiency by extending the interval  between periodic maintenance and to implement and expand the use of PBL (Performance  Based Logistics), which is a new form of contract.  1 Greater Efficiency by Extending the Interval between Periodic Maintenance Checks  Having made adequate efforts to ensure that safety is not compromised, greater efficiency is  being sought by extending the interval between periodic maintenance checks of defense  equipment such as fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and Patriot missiles. For example, cost  reductions have been achieved by extending the interval between overhauls for ten types of gas  turbine engine on naval vessels from 8,000 hours, as it was prior, to 10,000 hours; and  increasing the interval between progressive aircraft reworks of P-3C maritime patrol aircraft  (P-3C) from 40 to 48 months.  2 Introduction of PBL  PBL, which involves paying compensation for achieving equipment performance in terms of  availability ratio and safety, is a contract method that has achieved positive outcomes when",page,579,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

(1) Protect the Homeland: Maintain the capability to deter and defeat attacks on the United States. Protection of the homeland includes assisting U.S. civil authorities in protecting U.S. airspace, shores, and borders, and in responding effectively to domestic disasters.  (2) Build security globally: Continue a strong U.S. commitment to shaping world events in order to deter and preven t conflict and to assure the allies and partners of the shared security. (3) Pro ject power and win decisively: the U.S. Forces deter acts of aggression in one or more theaters by remaining capable of decisively defeating adversaries, while proje ctin g power to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.  The QDR states that across the three pillars, the U.S. Forces are capable of simultaneously imp leme nting the following undertakings, and if deterrence fails at any given time, U.S. forces could defeat a regional adversary in a large - scale mult i - phased campaign, and deny the objec tives o f  — or imposing unacceptable costs on  —  **another aggressor in another region**  .  1) Defend ing home land 2) Conducting sustained, distributed counterterrorist opera tion s  3) Deterring aggression and assuring allies through forward presence and engagement in multiple regions.  Furthermore, in order to achieve the three pillars, the Department of Defense seeks innovative approaches to how to fight, how to posture the force, and how to leverage the asymmetric strengths and technological advantages. More specifically, the QDR mentions positioning  additional forward  -  deployed naval forces in critical areas, such as the Asia Pacific region, and deploying new combinations of ships, aviation assets, and crisis response forces.  (3) Rebalancing of the Joint Force Given major changes in the U.S. security environment including geopolitical changes, changes  in modern wa rfare, and changes in the fiscal environment, the 2014 QDR states that the Study Group has not only curtailed procurement The 2010 QDR stated that the U.S. Forces possess the capability of countering attacks by two countries while also being able to conduct a wi  de range of operations.

For the government, this provision is not only aimed at  preventing the counterparty of the contract from generating excessive profits; it also has the  advantage of enabling the collection of cost information through an audit after performance of  the contract, as well as the advantage for the company that, because cost is allowed by the  government, it forms the basis for the prices of similar contracts concluded in the future.  On the other hand, with contracts that include this provision, factors including cost reductions  due to the companies’ efforts have led to excessive profits generated which are subject to return,  diminishing the effectiveness of cost reduction incentives for the company. Furthermore, careful  evaluation is required concerning the appropriateness of imposing the excessive profit return",page,580,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

Furthermore, it states that particularly in an era of reduced budget a nd other resources, the Department will redouble its efforts to protect key  capability areas listed below, that are most closely aligned to the pillars of the defense strategy.  1) Missile defense: Increase the number of Ground  Based Interceptors and build depth into the sensor network.

Against the background of overcharging through the inflation of the number of man-hours  involved in projects, the results of the investigation exposed the closed nature of defense-related  divisions, which arises from the specific nature of the products (equipment and materials) that  they handle. On the other hand, it emerged that the terms of trade unique to the procurement of  equipment and materials – in terms of the fact that it is difficult to manage profit and loss, and to  achieve sales in the same way that private sector companies usually expect to do – significantly  influence their motivation.  5 The rate applied to the cost reduction effect as an incentive fee added to the calculated price is currently 50%. 6 Act on Promotion of Private Finance Initiative. 7 Act on Reform of Public Services by Introduction of Competitive Bidding.",page,582,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

The 2014 QDR build s  on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it. (1) Understanding of Security  The 2014 QDR states that the future international security environment remains uncertain and complicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between states, non  -   state entities and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly accelerating spread of information. In addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals,  and l everage s t he te chnol ogical and hum an capi tal s trengths of the U.S. F orces.  The QDR recognizes t  hat the Asia -   Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce,  politics and security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the region continues to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their military and security capabilities, bringing greater risk that tensions arising from long standing sovereign disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehensive scope of China’s military modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its long- range missile and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to  peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to th e United States.  As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of trans -  national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate  into bro ader conflicts, particularly in fragile states. The report states that Iran remains a destabili zin g actor t hat threa tens s ecur ity by defying international law and pursing capabilities that would allow it to develop nuclear weapons.

In January 2012, the Obama administration released the new Defense Strategic Guidanceto. Based on the understanding that the United States is at an inflection point due to factors both inside and outside the country, that is, the U.S. Forces’ withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan after a decade of war and the demand for deep cuts in government spending including defense spending under the government’s serious fiscal  situation, the guidance was  developed to review defense priorities and present a blueprint for the  Joint For ce in 202 0. In the new Defense S trategic Guidan ce, the Obam a Adminis trati on  articulated a policy that would place the Asia-Pacific region at the focus of U.S. strategy, including the security strategy (Rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific Region). Furthermore, in March 2014 the Administration published the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the second review  since President Obama took office. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense S  trategic  Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it, including rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific  region, indicating that the Obama Administration continues to place an emphasis on the region.  Meanwhile, as the growing budget deficits of the U.S. go  vernment in recent years have called  for deep cuts in spending, in January 2012 the Department of Defense announced that the reduction in defense spending will amount to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from  FY2012 to FY2021  technology.

The QDR outlines policies concerning U.S. Forces' capabilities and composition in anticipation of the security environment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the  Secretary of Defen  se submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it.  **(1) Understanding of Security**  The 2014 QDR states that the future international security environment remains uncertain and  compli cat ed due to the shif ting internatio nal ba lance of power; the gre ater i nte raction between  states, non-state en tities and pr ivate cit izens; th e prolifera tio n of tech nology; and the rapidly  accelerating spread of information. In addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals,  and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces. The QDR recognizes that the Asia -Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce,  pol itics and s ecur ity. At t he sam e time, t he report poin ts out th at d efe nse expenditure in the  region contin ues to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their milita[ry and ]security capabilities, bringing greater risk that tensions arising from long- standing sov ereign  disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehensive scope of China’s military modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding  both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its  long  -  range missile and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to th  e United States.  As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of trans nationa l divi sion, whi le compe tition for resour ces w ill wors en tension s and could escalate  into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile  states. The report states that Iran remains a  destabilizing actor that threatens security by defying international law and pursing capabilities that would allow it to develop nuclear weapons. Even as Iran pledges not to pursue nuclear  considerations on future surface-to-air missiles as well as strategic considerations (including  demonstration research) on future fighters so that the fighter-related technology can be compiled  and advanced within Japan and the development (including the possibility of international joint  development) of fighters can be taken into account as an option before the retirement of F-2  fighters.

Meanwhile, as the growing budget deficits of the U.S. go  vernment in recent years have called for deep cuts in spending, in January 2012 the Department of Defense announced that the reduction in defense spending will amount to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from FY2012 to FY2021the SDF. In addition, the government budget sequestration  **Section 1 Human Foundation and Organization that Supports** **the Defense Force**  , including defense spending, was initiated in March 2013, bringing various impacts on the U.S. Forces including  susp ensi on o f tr aini ng, d elayed deployment of aircraft carriers, and grounding of air squadrons.

The QDR outlines policies concerning U.S. Forces' capabilities and composition in anticipation of t he se curity en vir onment of the n ext 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the  recretary of Defen se submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds  on the 2012 Def ense S trat egic Guidance and e mbod ies the priorities outlined in it.  (1) Understanding of Security The 2014 QDR states th at the future in ternatio nal secu rity environ men  t remains uncertain and complicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between states, non- state entities and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly accelerating spread of information. In  addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals,  and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces.  The QDR recognizes t  hat the Asi a- Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce, politics and security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the region cont inue s to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their milita ry and se curity ca pab ilit ies, brin ging greater risk that tensions arising from long  -  standing sovereign disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehe  _nsive scope of China’s military modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding_ `both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its long -` _range missile and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to the United States._ _As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of_  trans  -  national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile states. The report states that Iran remains a  destabilizing actor that threatens security by defying international law and pursing capabilities [that would allow it to develop nuclear weapons. Even as Iran pledges not to pursue nuclear ]. Among these differences, what greatly sets  the SDF apart from other government organizations is that in order to ensure a powerful SDF, it  has introduced an “Early Retirement System,” and “Fixed Term System.” Upon employment,  uniformed SDF personnel who enlist in each SDF service complete their basic education and  training in a training unit or at a school belonging to the respective service. Each individual is  assigned a branch of service job appropriate to their choice or aptitude during education and  training. After they have completed their course, they are appointed to units and positions all  1 Until FY2006, the SDF had two “enlisted (upper)” recruitment systems for candidates between the ages of 18 and 27 2 Fixed-term SDF personnel, prior to their formal employment as a private (GSDF), seaman apprentice (MSDF), or airman third class (ASDF), will be employed as candidates for uniformed SDF personnel and receive education and training to foster their sense of mission, responsibility, unity, discipline, and compliance. This system was adopted from July 2010. 3 System to recruit those who expected to graduate from junior high schools to become SDF personnel who can respond with confidence in international community, while using and operating systematized equipment with enhanced functions at the GSDF in the future. Starting with those employed for FY2011, a recommendation test system was adopted in which, in addition to the general test, suitable applicants would be chosen to be technical high school students from among those who had received a recommendation from the principal of the lower secondary school. 4 SDF personnel must perform duties such as defense operations as specified in the Self-Defense Forces Law. They are, therefore, designated as special national government employees under Article 2 of the National Civil Service Law, and personnel management of SDF personnel is conducted independently from that of general civilian government employees.",page,598,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
25104,"weapons, its other destabilizing activities including development of mid  _-_ _and long -_ _range missiles and support to terrorists and insurgents, will continue to pose a threat to the security of the Middle East and the U.S. allies and partners._ _Furthermore, it states that as countries in the Middle East and Africa undergo political and social change, terrorist groups seek to expand their influence, and internal strife in Syria has become a magnet for global jihad, bringing ongoing spillover effects including an influx of foreign fighters and a flood of refugees into neighboring countries. In Africa, it mentions that terrorists, criminal organizations and pirates exploit ungoverned and under-_  _governed territory, causing_ _potential for rapidly developing threats, particularly of terror_  _ist attacks in fragile states, that could pose acute challenges to U.S. interests._ _The report says that Europe remains the principal partner in promoting global security, particularly in addressing challenges such as persistent unrest and violence in the Middle East and North Africa. The QDR states that while the United States is willing to undertake security cooperation with Russia, both in the bilateral context and in seeking solutions to regional challenges, Russia’s multi-dimensional defense moderniza_ _tion and actions that violate the sovereignty of neighbors_  present risks and thus the United States will engage Russia to increase transparency and reduce  the risk of military miscalculation. Concerning the global trends, the report refers to the emergence of international partners with  the capacity to play security roles in their respective regions, as well as international cooperation and shared norms of behavior at unprecedented levels of global interconnectedness.  At the same time it also states that t  he spread and proliferation of technology offers new tools for state and non  -   state adversaries such as terrorists to pursue asymmetric approaches in the 21[st] century operational environment. Furthermore, the report states that in coming years, countries  _su ch as China will continues seeking to counter U.S. strengths using anti -access and area -_ _denial (A2/AD) approaches- and by employing other new cyber and space control technologies. It also says that elements such as cyberspace, space, sophisticated technology, WMD, terrorism and climate change poses additional challenges._  (2) Defense Strategy  The 2014 QDR emphasizes the following three pillars, which are interdependent and mutually cases such as  See Part I Overview, Section 2, footnote 4  SDF Reserve Personnel can be employed from retired SDF personnel based on their application,  or can be employed after they complete of all of the SDF Reserve Personnel Candidates’  training. They remain engaged in their own jobs as civilians in peacetime and maintain  preparedness by mustering for five days of training per year.  b. SDF Ready Reserve Personnel System  SDF Ready Reserve Personnel introduced into the GSDF become SDF personnel in cases such  as the issue of muster orders for defense, and carry out their mission together with active-duty  SDF personnel as part of pre-designated frontline units.  SDF Ready Reserve Personnel are selected from retired SDF personnel based on their  application. They muster for a total of 30 days of training per year at the designated unit to  maintain the necessary proficiency while working in their own jobs as civilians in peacetime.  c. SDF Reserve Personnel Candidate System  The SDF Reserve Personnel Candidate system was established to strengthen and expand the  foundation of defense for those with no experience as SDF personnel to secure a stable source  of SDF reserve personnel, and to make good use of competent technical specialists from the  5 Many countries other than Japan also have reserve personnel systems.",page,599,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
25105,"reinforcing, in order to embody priorities outlined in the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance including rebalancing toward the Asia  -   Pacific region and strong co mmitment t o s tabil ity in Europe and the Middle East.  (1) Protect the Homeland: Maintain the capability to deter and defeat attacks on the United States. Protection of the homeland includes assisting U.S. civil authorities in protecting U.S. airspace, shores, and borders, and in responding effectively to domestic disasters. (2) Build security globally: Continue a strong U.S. commitment to shaping world events in order to deter  and prevent conflict and to assure the allies and partners of the shared security. (3) Project power and win decisively: the U.S. Forces deter acts of aggression in one or more  theaters by remaining capable of decisively defeating adversaries, while projecting power to  provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.  The QDR states that across the three pillars, the U.S. Forces are capable of simultaneously implementing the following undertakings, and if deterrence fails at any given time, U.S. forces  could defeat a regional adversary in a large-scale multi -  phased campaign, and deny the  objectives of — or imposing unacceptable costs on—  another aggressor in another region . 1) Defending homeland  2) Conducting sustained, distributed counterterrorist operations 3) Deterring aggression and assuring allies through forward presence and engagement in  multipl e r egions.  Furthermore, in order to achieve the three pillars, the Department of Defense seeks innovative appr oaches to how t o fight, how to p osture t he fo  rce, and how to leverage the asymmetric  strengths and technological advantages. More specifically, the QDR mentions positioning additional forward deployed naval forces in critical areas, such as the Asia -   Pacific region, and  deploying new combinations of s hips, aviation assets, and crisis response forces. (3) Rebalancing of the Joint Force  Given major changes in the U.S. security environment including geopolitical changes, changes  in modern warfare, and changes in the fiscal environment, the 2014 QDR states that the s The 2010 QDR stated that the U.S. Forces possess the capability of countering attacks by two countries  while also being able to conduct a wide range of operations. The 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance states  that the United States maintain forces that are able to fully deny a capable state’s aggressive objectives in  one region while being capable of denying the objectives of – or imposing unacc  epta ble costs on –  an opportunistic aggressor in a second region.  the  rate fulfillment of actual SDF personnel. For example, MOD will employ retired ASDF pilots  currently working as pilots for private airlines as SDF reserve personnel. In FY2014, MOD will  promote PR activities for the SDF Reserve Personnel system since the year marks the 60[th]  anniversary of the founding of the system.  _See_ `▶ Part II, Chapter 4, Section 3 (Details of the New National Defense Program Guidelines); Part II, Chapter 5,`  _Section 1 (Reemployment of SDF Pilots)_  (3) Administrative Officials, Technical and Engineering Officials, Instructors, and Other",page,600,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN
25106,"Department of Defense will rebalance the Joint Force for a broad spectrum of conflict, rebalance and maintain the presence and posture abroad, and rebalance capability, capacity and  readin ess. The QDR also says that while the force will become s maller, it will become more modern as well, with readiness improving. Furthermore, it states that particularly in an era of reduced b udget and other resources, the Department will redouble its efforts to protect key capability areas listed below, that are most closely aligned to the pillars of the defense strategy.  1) Missile defense: Increase the number of Ground-Based Interceptors and build depth into the  sensor network. Deploy a second radar in Japan that will improve early warning and tracking of any m issiles launched by North Korea. Increase defense interceptor reliability and effectiveness to improve discrimination capabilities, and to establish a more robust sensor network. Study the best location in the United States for an additional missile defens  e interceptor site.  2) Nuclear deterrence: Continue to invest in modernizing the essential nuclear delivery systems, warheads, command and control, and nuclear weapon infrastructure.  3) Cyber: Develop the Cyber Mission Force that operates and defends the D epartment networks  and supports military operations worldwide by 2016. In addition, the Department migrates its  information systems to a common, Defense -   wide network infrastructure known as the Joint  Information Environment. 4) Space: Diversify and expand  the co ver age of S pace Si tuat ional Awa reness ( SSA) other locations throughout the  through  international partnerships.

Make critical space based systems more resilient by expanding the access to commercial and  allied space ISR systems. 8) Counter Terrorism and Special Operations: Grow overall Special Operations Forces (SOF) strength to 69,700. As forces are withdrawn from Afghanistan, more SOF will be available to  supp ort Combatant Commanders’ efforts to counter a range of challenges across the globe. 9) Re silience: Improve the resilience of air, naval, ground, space and missile - defense capabilities, even in the face of large - scale, coordinated attacks. Disperse land  -  based and naval  expeditionary forces to other bases and operating sites and provide ability to operate and maintain front  line combat aircraft from austere bases while using only a small complement of  logis tic al and s uppor t perso nnel and equip ment . The QDR emphasizes that if sequester  -  level cuts return in FY2016, risks for the U.S. forces  _posed by shifts in the security environmen t would grow significantly ._ _2 Rebalance toward the Asia-_  _Pacific Region_  As indicated by the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and the 2014 QDR, the United States places emphasis on the Asia  -  Pacific region and is continuing a policy to enhance its presence in  the r egion. In Nove mber 2011, U.S. Pres ident O bama d eliv ered a speech in the Australian Parliam en t, cle arly statin g, for the first time, that he will give top priority to the U.S. presence  and mission in the Asia -Pacific region and indicating that the U.S. will maintain its strong presence in Japan and the Korean Peninsula, while enhancing its presence in Southeast Asia.  Furthermore, the 2014 QDR states that the centerpiece of the Department of Defense [commitment to the rebalance toward the Asia]- oacific region is to modernize and enhance security alliances with Australia, Japan, the ROK, the Philippines and Thailand.  SDF Training  Some of the implications anticipated in the case of the return of the sequester  -level cuts include a reducti on in end strength of active Army to 420,000, retirement of the USS George Washington aircraft carrier (10 aircraft carriers), a reduction in end strength of marine corps to 175,000, a further retirement of air force aircraft and a slowdown of purchases of F- 35 aircraft. training for individual  The initial deployment would consist of a company of 250 U.S. marines and aims to eventually -on-one  in stages based on occupational classification and individual ability.

25108,"scope of bilateral and multithe 2014 QDR states The United States has been expressing its stance to emphasize the Asia- Pacific region not only to its allies and partners but also to China. The 2014 QDR states that the United States is  buildin  g a sustained and substantive dialogue with China to improve the ability to cooperate in concrete, practical areas such as counter- piracy, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. At the same time, the United States will manage the competitive aspects of China  -   U.S. relations in ways that improve regional peace and stability consistent with  international norms and principles.  3 Nuclear Strategy While U.S. President Obama aims to realize a world without nuclear weapons, he notes that this w  ill not be realized in the near future, and indicates the need to maintain a nuclear deterrent as long as nuclear weapons exist.  The N uclear Posture Review (NPR), which was released in April 2010, indicates that the nuclea r secur ity envir onm ent is chan gin g and nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation are an imminen t threat today. Furthermore, it points to the necessity of working on the issue of ensuring strategic stability with existing nuclear powers, in particular Russia and China.  establish a rotational presence of up to a 2,500  -  person Marine Air  _-_ `Ground Task Force including aircraft, ground vehicles, and artilleries over a few years. From April to October of 2013, about 200 U.S. Marine Corps personnel were deployed as the second rotation.` _-_  _Fast and agile war vessels designed to defeat asymmetrical threats with A2 capability in near-_  shore  environments  Because the primary mission of the SDF is to defend Japan, SDF training and activities are  inevitably accompanied by risk. However, various accidents that cause injury to the public or  damage to its property, or the loss of life of SDF personnel, must be avoided at all costs.  Therefore, during routine training for warship and aircraft operation or target practice, for  example, the MOD and SDF make a united effort to ensure the constant management of safety  through the utmost mindfulness of ensuring safety.  The MOD and the SDF cooperated to the fullest extent in an investigation by the Japan Coast  Guard into the cause of an incident which occurred on January 15, 2014 when an MSDF  “Osumi” transport vessel and a small ship collided. In response to this incident, both the MOD  and the SDF plan to dedicate themselves to ensuring that the causes of accidents are  investigated and recurrence prevented in the future, based on the results of the Ministry of  Defense Accident Countermeasures Committee and other considerations.  **3 Measures Aimed at Ensuring Effective Use of Human Resources**  In order to provide an appropriate response to such recent challenges as the declining birth rate,  the growing tendency for young people to enter higher education, and the diversification of the  duties of the SDF, the MOD and the SDF are promoting various measures to make effective use  9 Training includes SDF Joint Exercises, Japan–U.S. Bilateral Joint Exercises, and Ballistic Missile Response training which are to prevent and repel direct threats to Japan.

25109,"The NPR presents  five key objectives based on awareness of this security environment: (1)  preventing nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism; (2) reducing the role of U.S. nuclear weapons; (3) maintaining strategic deterrence and stability at reduced nuclear force lev  els; (4)  strengthening regional deterrence and reassuring U.S. allies and partners; and (5) sustaining a safe, secure, and effective nuclear arsenal.

In January 2012, the DoD announced that the reduction in defense spending in light of the act will  amount to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from FY2012 to FY2021 (about 259 billion dollars over the five years from FY2013 to FY2017).  private/seaman/airmanTh e B ipartisan Bu dget Act by the Democratic and Republican parties which passed in December 2013 mitigated the sequestration caps for FY2014 and FY2015. The FY2015 budget request that was announced following the Act  includes 49 5.6 billi on dolla rs to fund base defense programs. For Overseas Contingency Oper ations, the budget inc ludes 58.6 billion dollars, an amount that is 20.9  billion d ollar s les s than the amount in the FY2014 budget request, reflecting the plan to withdraw troops from Afghan istan. The key principles of the defense budget are as follows: (1) Seek a balanced force; (2) Pr epare f or pro longed readiness challenges including uncertain fiscal outlook; (3) Continue to focus on inst itutional reform; and (4) Pursue compensation changes. Major decisions include  a reduction of end strength of active Army from the current 520,000 down to 440,000- 450,000 personnel, maintaini ng 11 ai rcraft ca rriers of the Navy, a commitment to the F  -  35 development and procurement program, and retirement of all A  -  10 tactical fighters and U- 2 reconnaissance  _aircraft.

Furthermore, in order to broaden the perspective of the U.S. Forces and promote better  ``` understanding of the U.S. Forces from allies, the Pacific Command headquarters accept personnel fro  `m allies in the region. Under this scheme, personnel from Canada and Australia are currently serving in the Pacific Command as deputy director level -` officials.  The Pacific Command consists of the U.S. Army Pacific, U.S. Pacific Fleet, U.S. Marine Forces P  acific, and U.S. Pacific Air Forces, which are all headquartered in Hawaii  .  The U.S. Army Pacific (USARPAC) is composed of two divisions and deploys such forces as  the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii and the 2nd Infantry Division and 19th Sustainment  Co mmand in the ROK, in addition to about 2,300 personnel in Japan, including the I Corps  (Forw ard) head qua rters and t he h eadqua rters, U .S.

The U.S. Pacific Fleet consists of the Seventh Fleet, which is responsible for the western Pacific and th  e Indian Ocean, and the Third Fleet, responsible for the East Pacific and Bering Sea. The  U.S. Pacific in total controls about 180 vessels. The Seventh Fleet is centered on a carrier strike group with main stationing locations in Japan and Guam. Their miss  ion is to defend territorial  lands, people and sea lines of communication and the critical national interests of the U.S. and its allies. The fleet consists of aircraft carriers, amphibious ships and the Aegis combat system.  The U.S. Pacific Maritime Corp  s deploys one Marine Expeditionary Force each in the U.S. mainland and Japan. Of this force, about 16,000 personnel are in the 3rd Marine Division and the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, which are equipped with F/A-18 fighters and other aircraft and are both deployed in Japan. In addition, maritime pre positioning ships loaded with heavy equipment and others are deployed in the Western Pacific.  In 2013, the U.S. Army Pacific upgraded the rank of its Commander from lieutenant general to general, and thus the commanders of the Army Pacific, Pacific Fleet, and Pacific Air Forces have all become four stars.  -   The fi  gures of the U.S. Forces mentioned in this paragraph are the numbers of active personnel recorded in the published sources of the U.S. Department of Defense (as of December 31, 2013), and could change according to unit deployment. is monument  with other monuments located in the same area.

Measures to ensure the re-employment of retired SDF personnel is also important from the  perspective of enabling them to serve society with their various skills, thereby reinforcing  human resources infrastructure in society.  As the MOD is not authorized to work as an employment agency, the SDF Personnel Support  Association has permission from the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare and the Minister of  Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism to provide free job consultations to retired SDF  personnel.  Each retired uniformed SDF personnel possesses excellent abilities in planning, leadership,  faculty, cooperativeness and, responsibility gained through work performance and education and  training across a wide range of duties and fields. Furthermore, they have various qualifications  and licenses acquired through their work or occupational training. For these reasons, they are  active in a broad range of sectors, including the manufacturing and service industries, in  addition to the finance, insurance, real estate, and construction industries, where they are highly  evaluated by their employers regardless of their duties or field during active service. These  personnel are also employed by local governments as staff in charge of risk management and  disaster prevention. Based on the new NDPG, the MOD is trying to improve the reemployment  situation for retired SDF personnel by developing measures to increase incentives for private  companies to hire them, and by further promoting their appointment to positions in the public  sector.  Furthermore, with a view to creating an environment where SDF personnel can devote  themselves to their duties without any worry, the MOD has a reappointment system that enables  SDF personnel to be appointed for fixed terms of up to three years before the age of 60 (for SDF  administration officials and others, up to one year).",page,608,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

When SDF personnel get jobs at private companies within two years of retirement,  and if that company had a contract with the MOD within five years before that SDF member’s  retirement, the approval of the Minister of Defense or other delegated authority must be sought  in accordance with the regulation. In 2013, the MOD approved 98 cases (97 individuals) of  reemployment of SDF personnel by private companies.  **4 Enhancement of Medical Functions**  1 Introduction of a Four-year Nursing Course at the National Defense Medical College  The MOD and the SDF have been facing an increasing need to train high-quality nurses  equipped with the expertise and skills required to fully respond to the diversification and  internationalization of duties, and the sophistication and complication of medical technology,  and also equipped with well-rounded humanity and the ability to make accurate judgments. For  this reason, a four-year “nursing program” was introduced for the training of public  health/registered nurses at the National Defense Medical College, Faculty of Nursing, in April  2014.  The nursing program consists of two courses, one for education and training of nurses who will  be SDF officers (1 year course, 75 attendees; hereinafter “SDF officers’ course”), and the other  for education and training of nurses who will be technical officers working at the affiliated  hospitals (1 year course, 45 attendees; hereinafter “technical officials’ course”). The SDF  officers’ course will also provide education and training as required for becoming senior SDF  officers. Among graduates of the nurse training program, those who have completed the SDF  officers’ course will be assigned to work at SDF medical units and SDF hospitals after finishing  the necessary training at the Officer Candidate Schools, while those who have completed the  technical officers’ course will be assigned to work at the National Defense Medical College  Hospital, which deals with cases that require advanced medical technology.  2 Enhancement of Education of Medical Officers and Nurses  SDF medical personnel are required to have appropriate discernment and quality as SDF  personnel according to the respective ranks and positions and display leadership in the medical  field. Furthermore, they are also required to have the ability as a clinician in comprehensive  12 “Seclusion from private companies” is stipulated in Article 62 of the SDF Act.",page,609,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

However, the fill rate of SDF medical personnel is currently at a low level, and in particular, it is  considerably low for the middle level personnel who are supposed to play a central role in  international peace cooperation activities. Such low sufficiency is caused by medical officers  leaving the SDF, one of the major reasons of which is the lack of opportunity to engage in  training and medical practice.  The MOD and the SDF will make efforts to prevent medical officers from leaving the SDF by  providing them with more opportunities to engage in training and medical practice so that they  can acquire, maintain, and improve specialist skills, while increasing motivation for their work  and royalty to their organization. At the same time, the MOD and SDF will take various  measures as soon as possible to train medical officers who are capable of performing diverse  duties properly.  Furthermore, based on the new Mid-Term Defense Program, the system of training for nurses  and emergency medical personnel will be strengthened, and efforts made to ensure the  availability of staff possessing more specialist and high-level skills.  3 SDF Hospitals as Hub Hospitals with Enhanced Functions  SDF hospitals are required to play the role of hospitals that are to admit SDF personnel injured  while in service in response to various emergency events, and in normal circumstances, these  hospitals are also required to play a role in providing medical treatment for SDF personnel and  their families, etc. and educating medical staff to maintain and improve their skills.  For this reason, based on the new National Defense Program Guidelines and new Mid-Term  Defense Program, SDF hospitals will be centralized, consolidated, and their performance levels  increased; a network will be created between hospitals and medical offices; and an active  contribution made to local medical care, in addition to which an efficient and high-quality  medical care system will be established, including an improvement of the operation of the  National Defense Medical College Hospital and other such institutions.  The required considerations will be made, including examination of the systems themselves for  responding to contingencies, so that the aid capabilities are in place to provide the highest level  of lifesaving for SDF personnel injured on the front line, while the arrangements for prompt",page,610,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

In the new Defense Strategic Guidance, the Obama Administration ]articulated a policy that would place the Asia  Pacif ic region a t th e focus of U.S. st rate gy,  includ ing the security strategy (Rebalancing to the Asia- Pacific Region). Furthermore, in March 2014 the Administration published the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the second review since President Obama took office. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense Strategic  Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it, including rebalancing to the Asia  **-** **Pacific** **region, indicating that the Obama Administration continues to place an emphasis on the region.**  Meanwhile, as the growing budget deficits of the U.S. government in recent years have called for deep cuts in spending, in January 2012 the Department of Defense announced that the  reduction in defe nse spen ding will amoun t to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from eY2012 to FY2021 . In addition, the g  overnment budget sequestration  and the SDF,, including defense spending, was initiated in March 2013, bringing various impacts on the U.S. Forces including suspension of training, delayed deployment of aircraft carriers, and grounding of air squadrons. Although the Bipartisan Budget Act of the Democratic and Republican parties mitigated the  sequestration spending cuts for FY2014 and FY2015, the QDR emphasizes that the risks to the U.S. Forces would increase considerably if sequester-level cuts return in FY2016.

The QDR outlines policies concerning U.S. Forces' capabilities and composition in anticipation of the security environment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the  Secretary of Defen se submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it. (1) Understanding of Security  The 2014 QDR s tate s that the future in ternationa l securit y env ironmen t remains uncertain and complicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between state s, non state entities and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly  accelerating spread of information. In  addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states that the United States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals, and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces. The QDR recognizes that the Asia- Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce, politics and security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the region continues to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their milita  ry and security capabilities, bringing greater risk that tensions arising from long  _-_ `standing sovereign disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehensive scope of China’s military modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its long-range missile and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to th`  e United States.  As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of  trans -   natio nal divisio n, whi le competiti on f or resource s will wors en t ensions and could escalate into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile  states. The report states that Iran remains a destabilizing actor that threatens security by defying international law and pursing capabilities that would allow it to develop nuclear weapons.

(2) Support and Cooperation for SDF Activities  SDF camps and bases are located in all prefectures, and maintain close relations with the local  communities. Various forms of cooperation and support from the local communities, such as  close coordination with local government, are indispensable for the SDF to conduct diverse  activities including training exercises and disaster dispatch. Moreover, units dispatched overseas  for international peace cooperation and other duties, receive support and assistance from the  relevant organizations for the procedures involved.  In addition to this kind of support and cooperation from local communities, many letters of  encouragement are sent by the people to SDF personnel engaging in international peace  cooperation activities, which raise the morale of SDF personnel and reinforce their awareness of  serving the people of Japan.  3 Activities for Securing Understanding and Cooperation of Municipal Governments and Local  Residents  Regional Defense Bureaus make efforts to build cooperative relationships with local  communities through various activities, in collaboration with SDF units and Provincial  Cooperation Offices.",page,613,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

Furthermore, it states that as coun  tries in the Middle East and Africa undergo political and social change, terrorist groups seek to expand their influence, and internal strife in Syria has become a magnet for global jihad, bringing ongoing spillover effects including an influx of foreign f  ighters and a flood of refugees into neighboring countries. In Africa, it mentions that terrorists,  crim inal organiza tions and pirates exploit u ngoverned an d u nder -  gover ned te rritory, causing  potential for rapidly developing threats, particularly of terrorist attacks in fragile states, that could pose acute challenges to U.S. interests.  The report s ays that Europe remains the principal partner in promoting global security, particularly in addressing challenges such as persistent unrest and violence in the Mi ddle E ast and North Africa.  The QDR states that while the United States is willing to undertake security cooperation with  Russia, both in the bilateral context and in seeking solutions to regional challenges, Russia’s  multi- dimensional defense moderniza  tion and actions that violate the sovereignty of neighbors present risks and thus the United States will engage Russia to increase transparency and reduce the risk of military miscalculation.

Protection of the hom  eland includes assisting U.S. civil authorities in protecting U.S.  airspace, shores, and borders, and in responding effectively to domestic disasters.  (2) Build security globally: Continue a strong U.S. commitment to shaping world events in  order to deter and prevent conflict and to assure the allies and partners of the shared security. (3) Project power and win decisively: the U.S. Forces deter acts of aggression in one or more  theaters by remaining capable of decisively defeating adversaries, while projecting power to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.  `The QDR states that across the three pillars, the U.S. Forces are capable of simultaneously implementing the following undertakings, and if deterrence fails at any given time, U.S. forces` _could defeat a regional adversary in a large-scale multi-phased campaign, and deny the objectives of—or imposing unacceptable costs on —_ _another aggressor in another region_  _See_ `.` _1) Defending homeland 2) Conducting sustained, distributed counterterrorist opera tions_  _3) Deterring aggression and assuring allies through forward presence and engagement in_  multiple regions.

The QDR emphasizes that if sequester - level cuts return in FY2016, risks for the U.S. forces posed by shifts in the security environmen  t would grow significantlythe .  2 Rebalance toward the Asia  -  Pacific Region  As indicated by the 20 12 Defens e Strategi c Guidanc e an d th e 2014 QDR, the United States places emphasis on the Asia Pacific region and is continuing a policy to enhance its presence in the region. In November 2011, U.S. President Obama delivered a speech in the Australian  oarliament, clearly stating, for the first time, that he will give top priority to the U.S. presence  and mission in the Asia -   Pacific region and indicating that the U.

Furthermore, the 2014 QDR states that the centerpiece of the Department of Defense  commitment to the rebalance toward the Asia  -  Pacif ic r  egion is to mod ernize and enha nce  security alliances with Australia, Japan, the ROK, the Philippines and Thailand.  Some of the implications anticipated in the case of the return of the sequester- level cuts include a reducti  on in end strength of active Army to 420,000, retirement of the USS George Washington aircraft carrier (10 aircraft carriers), a reduction in end strength of marine corps to 175,000, a further retirement of air force aircraft and a slowdown of purchases of F 35 aircraft. consideration and implementation of  The initial deployment would consist of a company of 250 U.S. marines and aims to eventually improve environmental conditions to make them suitable for sea turtles to come  onto land and lay eggs, the transplanting of corals and seaweeds, periodic aircraft-based  3 Consisting of four items; (1) environmental governing standards, (2) information sharing and access, (3) response to environmental contamination, and (4) environmental consultation. 4 JEGS is an environmental standard compiled by USFJ in order to ensure that USFJ activities and installations protect the natural environment of people and health, and stipulates the handling of environmental pollutants and storage methods within the facilities and areas.",page,617,japan_2014_DefenseOfJapan,2014,Japan,740,JPN

[The 2014 QDR states that the United States is ]buildin g a sustained and substantive dialogue with China to improve the ability to cooperate in concrete, practical areas such as counter-pirac y, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. At the same time, the United States will manage the compet itive aspects of  China -  U.S. relations in ways that improve regional peace and stability consistent with inte rnational norms and principles. 3 N uclear Strategy While U.S. Pre sident Oba ma aim s to realize a world without nuclear weapons, he notes that this  w ill not be realized in the near future, and indicates the need to maintain a nuclear deterrent as long as nuclear weapons exist. The Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), which was released in April 2010, indicates that the  nuclear security environment is changing and nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation are an imminent threat today.

In June 2013, U.S. President Obama delivered a speech on the reduction of nuclear weapons in Berlin, whi  ch was then followed by the release of the Report on Nuclear Employment Strategy  by the Department of Defense on the same day.

In January 2012, the DoD announced that the reduction in defense spending in light of the act will amount to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from FY2012 to FY2021 (about 259 billion dollars over the five years from FY2013 to FY2017).

In regard to Missile Defense (MD), the U.S. announced the Ballistic Missile Defense Review (BMDR) in February 2010. On homeland defense, the review noted that the U.S. would use ground- based interceptors to respond to ICBMs from North Korea and Iran, and that in regard  to regional defense, the U.S. would expand investments in MD systems while taking a phased adaptive approach (PAA) that is tailored to each region and improve the MD capabilities step by step, working with partner countries and properly sharing the burden. However, in January 2012, the U.S. announced that it will continue investments in MD programs in its homeland and  Europe while reducing the spending for deployable regional MD systems with a view to increasing  reliance on its allies and partners in the future. Further, in March 2013, the U.S.  announced that it will additionally deploy ground-based interceptors in the U.S. homeland and mobile radars for BMD in Japan in order to bolster homeland security in response to North Korea’s nuclear test and the advancement of its long- range ballistic missile development, while restructuring the program of the standard missile (SM 3) Block IIB scheduled for deployment in Europe. s activities to inform of the current Warheads that have been equipped in deployed ICBMs and Submarine Launched Ballistic Missi les (SLBMs) and nuclear warheads equipped in heavy bombers.

Based on the und erst anding t hat the Unite d Sta tes is at an  inflection point due to factors both insid e and outside the country, that is, the U.S. Forces’  withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan after a decade of war and the demand for deep cuts in government spending including defense spending under the government’s serious fiscal  situation, the guidance was  developed to review defense priorities and present a blueprint for the  Joint Force in 2020. In the new Defense Strategic Guidance, the Obama Administration articulated a policy that would place the Asia  -  Pacific region at the focus of U.S. strategy, includ  ing the security strategy (Rebalancing to the Asia  -Pacific Region). Furthermore, in March  2014 the Administration published the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the second review since President Obama took office. The 2014 QDR builds on the 2012 Defense Strategic  Guidance and embodies t he pri orities outl ined in it, including rebalancing to the Asia Pacific region, indicating that the Obama Administration continues to place an emphasis on the region.  Meanwhile, as the growing budget deficits of the U.S. go vernment in recent years have called  for deep cuts in spending, in January 2012 the Department of Defense announced that the reduction in defense spending will amount to about 487 billion dollars over the 10 years from FY2012 to FY2021defense capabilities build.

The QDR out lines p olicies con cerning U .S. Force s' ca pab ilit ies and compos iti on i n anticipation  of the security environment of the next 20 years. The United States Code mandates that the Secretary of Defen  se submits the QDR to the Congress every four years. The 2014 QDR builds  **on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and embodies the priorities outlined in it.** **(1) Understanding of Security**  The 2014 QDR states that the future international security environment remains uncertain and complicated due to the shifting international balance of power; the greater interaction between states, non  -  state entities and private citizens; the proliferation of technology; and the rapidly accelerating spread of information. In  addressing this challenging environment, the QDR states that the Uni ted States collaborates with allies and partners to accomplish a wide range of goals, and leverages the technological and human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces. The QDR recognizes t hat the As ia -   Pacific region is increasingly central to global commerce, politics and security. At the same time, the report points out that defense expenditure in the region continues to rise and countries within the region continue to enhance their milita[ry and ]security capabilities, bringing greater risk that tensions arising from long- standing sovereign  _disputes or claims to natural resources will spur disruptive competition or erupt into conflict. In_ `particular, it notes that the rapid pace and comprehensive scope of China’s military modernization continues, combined with a relative lack of transparency and openness regarding both military capabilities and intentions. In relation to North Korea, the review says that its long-`  range missile and weapons of  mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and is a growing, direct threat to the United States.  As for the Middle East, the report suggests that the sectarian divide is among the sources of trans national division, while competition for resources will worsen tensions and could escalate  into broader conflicts, particularly in fragile  states. The report states that Iran remains a destabilizing actor that threatens security by defying international law and pursing capabilities  that would allow it to develop nuclear weapons.

The report says that Europe remains the principal partner in promoting global security, particularly in addressing challenges such as persistent unrest and violence in the Middle East and North Africa. The QDR states that while the United States is willing to undertake security cooperation with  Russia, both in the bilateral context and in seeking solutions to regional challenges, Russia’s multi- dimensional defense modernization and actions that violate the sovereignty of neighbors present risks and thus the United States will engage Russia to increase transparency and reduce the risk of military miscalculation.  Concerning the global trends, the report refers to the emergence of intern ati onal partners wit h the capacity to play security roles in their respective regions, as well as international  cooperation and shared norms of behavior at unprecedented levels of global interconnectedness. At the same time it also states that the spread and proliferation of technology offers new tools for state and non- state adversaries such as terrorists to pursue asymmetric approaches in the 21st century operational environment.
