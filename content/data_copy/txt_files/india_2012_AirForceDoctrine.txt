### Foreword

Air Chief Marshal NAK BROWNE

PVSM AVSM VM ADC

Chief of the Air Staff

Th e IAF has had a remarkable and memorable journey since its
formation on October 8, 1932. It has since been operating in an
environment that is both challenging and demanding and is now a
seasoned and battle tested force. Its inventory has been diverse and
it has executed its tasks and roles with professionalism and élan. Th e
IAF’s quest for greater professionalism in conducting its operations is a
continuous process. Recording the collective memory of core beliefs in
the form of a doctrine enforces a discipline and clarity of thought that
helps sustain this dynamic process. Once recorded and periodically
updated, the doctrine provides a common baseline for education and
the dissemination of collective thought.
Th e fi rst air power doctrine of the IAF was published in October
1995. It dealt with topics such as: the theory of war, characteristics of air
power and its relationship with strategy, various air campaigns, combat
support operations and aspects related to prosecuting an air war. It
provided an exhaustive narrative of the basics of air power employment.
Taking into account, the considerable changes in technology and the
evolving global security environment, the doctrine was revised in
2007. Hence, an updated version entitled IAP 2000-07 (Part 1 & 2) was
issued in 2007. In keeping with the evolutionary nature of air power
and the need to stay relevant across the spectrum of confl ict in an interconnected environment, we felt the need to share our thoughts with
the diverse stakeholders of national security that included not only

the armed forces and government, but also think-tanks, universities,
media and all those interested in knowing more about how the IAF
operates. Th is unclassifi ed version of the doctrine is the result of that
endeavour.
Th e basic doctrine of the IAF has been declassifi ed and revised. It is
refl ective of the environment around us, and adopts a holistic approach
towards the security paradigm that engulfs us, and is a sincere eff ort
to reach out to a much wider audience which has an equal stake in the
security and well being of India. It is a foundational document which,
hopefully, will help the reader understand the nuances of application
of air power and lead to better understanding and appreciation of the
capabilities of air power. Since a doctrine is not a dogma, it changes
and evolves. Suggestions from air warriors, strategists, academicians,
research scholars and practitioners of land and naval warfare will
enrich the discourse on the employability and development of air
power. I sincerely hope that this document contributes to the overall
development of strategic thought in our country.

**Jai Hind!**

### Preface

A doctrine provides a military commander with the framework to
prepare and fi ght a war in a coordinated and controlled manner. Th is
edition of the ‘Basic Doctrine’ of the IAF has been declassifi ed to allow a
wider audience to understand the IAF’s vision, organisation, structure
and role. Air power has come a long way in its journey of a little over
hundred years. Th e expectations from its inherent capabilities have
also increased exponentially. In our context, therefore, it is important
to defi ne the IAF’s role and its responsibilities. A potent and lethal
force, the IAF, provides a wide spectrum of choices to decision makers
in any contingency. Principles of war have evolved over time. However,
the contexts in which they need to be understood and employed have
their own nuances. Th e characteristics of air power and its peculiarities
need to be understood within the right framework for its correct
application.
Th e structure of air power too needs to be appreciated to ensure
optimal employment of air power to achieve national security objectives.
Air strategy gets eff ectively utilised by executing the three aerial
campaigns viz. Counter Air, Counter Surface Force Ops and Strategic
Campaign with the omnipresent requirement of Combat Enabling
Operations. Experiences of the recent past have clearly highlighted
the growing proliferation of sub conventional warfare. Contrary to a
widespread belief, air power possesses diverse and eff ective tools to
make a signifi cant contribution in these operations. Joint operations
are the only way to achieve political objectives in modern confl ict. Air
power remains the lynchpin of any joint application of combat power in
modern warfare. Space is no longer a frontier. Th e IAF has for long been
aware of its importance in modern war fi ghting. It enables commanders
to make decisions in the fog of war and provides the advantage of high
ground. Information is the key to success in any endeavour and more

so in aerial operations. It is pervasive in nature, omnipresent and yet
not always visible. It has its own dynamics that needs to be assimilated
and understood. It calls for motivated and trained air warriors, who
understand technology and can incorporate it into the art of warfare.

### Air Power in the Indian Context

_Doctrine does not fi ght wars; people do. And although airmen may_

_prefer to be ‘doers,’ only those who can think rigorously but creatively_

_about future war are likely to be successful when crisis presents itself._

_— Colonel Phillip S. Meilinger_

###### AIR POWER IN PERSPECTIVE
Th e contemporary global environment is characterized by change and
the future is expected to be no diff erent. In this dynamic environment,
it is essential to have a clear understanding of the attributes, limitations
and the potential of air power to enable its optimum exploitation for
furthering national objectives. India’s security environment is an amalgam
of its history, geography, culture, politics etc and thus the security
challenges facing India are varied, complex and dynamic. Th erefore, for
India national security is an essential adjunct of overall national growth
and development. Th e new millennium has witnessed sweeping changes
with India emerging as a fast growing economy with a major stake and
infl uence in the global arena. As the nation marches ahead on the path
of socio-economic growth and seeks to fulfi l the legitimate aspirations of
its citizens, it can ill aff ord to be complacent about the existing and future
security challenges. Seeking optimal solutions to these challenges would
be imperative for our uninterrupted growth and development.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

India’s response to these challenges through the years has always
been restrained, measured and moderate. Th is is because India’s national
security objectives have evolved against the backdrop of its core values
of democracy, secularism, peaceful co-existence and the national goal
of social and economic development. Even though as a nation India
has no extra-territorial ambitions, it is still essential that it possesses a
potent instrument of national power capable of deterring confl ict and
maintaining peace.
Air power fulfi ls all these needs. Th e varied roles played by air power
have been demonstratively proven in the recent past. Th e aerospace
medium has enabled nations vastly removed in distance and time to
exercise their power and infl uence across continents with astonishing
rapidity. On the other hand, non-state actors have also exploited gaps
in air defence to fl y passenger aircraft into buildings. Th e opportunities
and challenges, therefore, are manifold. It is only a clearly articulated
air power doctrine that allows nations to leverage and exploit its
tremendous potential.
Air power doctrine is primarily a derivative of the fundamental
principles that guide the application of air and space power and
off ers innovative ideas for the optimum exploitation of the medium.
Fundamental principles draw on operational experiences and are timehonoured ways for achieving optimum success. Th ey are guidelines
that have worked in the past. Conversely, innovative ideas are futuristic
and are limited only by imagination and technology. Th e interaction
of these two constituents, makes an air power doctrine particularly
dynamic bound only by experience, imagination and technology.
Unless the unique attributes and limitations of air power are
understood, its sub-optimal utilisation would continue. History is
replete with such instances primarily because air power is the youngest
form of military power. Its relevance and application are yet to be
completely comprehended by military strategists and practitioners of
operational art. Th is is particularly applicable in our unique context.
It is a historical fact that various empires through thousands of years


-----

air power in the indian context

were entirely dependent on their armies and navies for survival. Armies
and navies have traditionally been visible manifestations of sovereign
might and capability. Th us, a generic appreciation regarding the utility
of armies, and to a certain extent, maritime power, is inherent in most
national psyches.
Air power, by contrast, only arrived in the last century and its
optimum exploitation only began in the past few decades. Hence,
its relevance, potential and applicability are yet to be fully absorbed
into our nation’s consciousness. Air power as a powerful and fl exible
tool of national security, statecraft and overall development is yet to
be comprehended in full measure, leading to continued instances of
its sub-optimal utilisation. Th e full-scale utilisation of IAF during
conventional wars like the 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pak wars, its nonutilisation during the 1962 Indo-China war and restricted use during
the 1999 Kargil confl ict serve to illustrate the point.
Air power, in a classic sense is defi ned as the _total ability of a_
_nation to assert its will through the medium of air. It includes both civil_
and military aviation, existing and potential. In the modern sense,
air power which has evolved into aerospace power is defi ned **as the**
**product of aerospace capability and aerospace doctrine. Air power**
is the strength of an air force as opposed to an attendant capability. Th e
strength of India’s air power lies in the IAF with the capabilities of air
arms of the other services reinforcing that strength. Aviation related
research and development as also industrial capabilities have a force
multiplier eff ect. Space capabilities further add to the above to enhance
the aerospace power of the nation.
Th e IAF has played a pivotal role in the country’s security ever
since its inception nearly 80 years ago. Th e IAF was established as an
independent force on October 8, 1932 making it one of the oldest,
continuously functioning independent air forces of the world. Over the
years the IAF has evolved from being primarily a tactical auxiliary arm
of the Royal Air Force in India, to an independent professional strategic
force which endeavours to be at the forefront of national service.

###### AIR POWER AND NATIONAL SECURITY
Th e dominant role played by air power in modern warfare, the high cost
of aircraft and allied equipment, and a host of other factors demand that
its capability and role in securing national interests be closely scrutinised.
Th e case of the IAF can be no diff erent, since the strength of our nation’s air
power is rooted in the IAF. It is hence essential to understand the place of
the IAF in the national security matrix.
Th e Preamble to the Indian Constitution summarises our aims and
objectives as a nation which in turn determines our national security
objectives. Th ese, in turn, dictate the military strategy, which is the
process of coordinating the development, deployment and employment
of military forces to achieve national security objectives. Military
strategy essentially is a combination of land, maritime and air strategies.
Since land, sea and air have their distinct characteristics, advantages
and limitations, the strategic options enabled by land, maritime and air
power are equally distinct.
Success in conventional confl ict has historically hinged on the
destruction of an enemy’s fi elded forces, followed by the capture or
capitulation of the enemy’s leadership. Hence, land and naval forces
had few options apart from fi ghting their way through even if it
meant having to accept signifi cant attrition. Th e advent of air power
changed all that. Air power could circumvent the enemy’s land, naval
forces and directly attack the enemy leadership, their command and
control centres and other critical vulnerabilities, which would hasten
the enemy’s capitulation. Th is was illustrated in ample measure during
the 1971 Indo-Pak war when following the bombing of the governor’s
house in Dhaka by the IAF, Pakistan agreed to a ceasefi re when most of
its military forces in the western sector were largely intact.
Air power can also decisively interfere with enemy land and sea
operations without the reverse being true. A striking example of this is
the battle of Longewala, wherein, Pakistan’s armour was decimated by
the IAF without reciprocal damage. Th e IAF dominated the skies and
hence it could operate freely as it pleased.

Tempest over Kashmir Valley, 1948

Th e ability of the IAF to rapidly project military force and infl uence
statecraft has become increasingly evident post-independence. Th e
speedy aerial reinforcement of Srinagar during the 1947-48 confl ict
with Pakistan was the fi rst visible exploitation of air power by India
to further national strategy. Similarly, the aerial evacuation of King
Tribhuvan of Nepal in 1950 and his subsequent restoration to the

throne paved the way for the Indo-Nepalese treaty of friendship. Th e
swift air landed operation undertaken by the IAF during Operation
_Cactus in 1989 to airdrop Indian forces at Male was crucial in the_
foiling of a coup attempt and the subsequent restoration of the
Maldives government.
In keeping with its mandate of enabling national development,
the IAF also plays a significant role in aid to civil population during
disasters, crisis etc. Notwithstanding the size of the country and
the varied terrain, it deploys swiftly and frequently across the
country for disaster mitigation and control. The IAF is frequently
deployed for supply drops as also aerial evacuation during natural
disasters such as earthquakes, cyclones, landslides, floods etc both
within the country and even beyond. For instance, during the 2004
Tsunami, the IAF undertook airlift and relief operations in the
Andaman & Nicobar Islands as also in the Maldives and Sri Lanka.
Its transcontinental reach was apparent when during Hurricane
Katrina the IAF rapidly responded and delivered aid and supplies to
St Louis, Mississippi, USA. The IAF has conducted numerous such
operations as for instance: evacuating thousands of people during
snowstorms in Jammu and Kashmir in 2005; airlifting of more than
100,000 Indian citizens from Iraq and Kuwait during Gulf War I
in conjunction with Air India and Indian Airlines which are the
other elements of Indian air power. The IAF also serves the ends
of democracy by periodically transporting paramilitary and civilian
personnel for election duties.
Th e role of the IAF in defending the skies on a daily basis is
carried out by fully armed aircraft on live Operational Readiness
Platforms (ORP) or Combat Air Patrol (CAP). Th ese are capable of
launching within minutes to signal the resolve of the government of
India for deterring any aerial misadventure. All the above examples
demonstrate that air power enables force projection, both benign and
otherwise, to support national security objectives in more ways than
one.

###### RECENT PERSPECTIVES
Following World War II, the invention of nuclear weapons changed the
concept of both warfare, and strategic deterrence. Th e emphasis during
the Cold War was on nuclear balance and strategic bombing was linked
to this balance. Th is led to the development of nuclear bombers and
high altitude interceptors. Th e large payloads carried by these aircraft
and the unmatched rapidity with which they could deliver them made
air power the instrument of choice. Achieving air superiority quickly,
proved crucial in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war for neutralising superior
Arab capabilities. Th e Vietnam War highlighted the limitations of air
power against low value low contrast target systems and the need for
Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) to reduce aircraft losses.
As air defences against aircraft fl ying at medium and high altitudes
improved, air forces around the world came to prefer the protection
off ered by a high-speed low-level ingress while operating in a densely
hostile air defence environment.
Th e 1973 Arab-Israeli war clearly highlighted the potency of air
defence (AD) weapons and reinforced the importance of SEAD to
reduce attrition. In the 1980s, the Air Land doctrine was enunciated
**by the US army. It highlighted the signifi cance of manoeuvre warfare**
and the synchronised application of air power to manipulate the
battlefi eld for swift success in wars. In the 1982 Bekaa Valley operations,
force multipliers such as RPAs, AWACS, and EW played a vital role in
gaining technological asymmetry and for creating conditions which
would quickly achieve air superiority. In the 1991 Gulf War, once again
**medium and high attitude operations came back into favour to**
prevent aircraft losses to shoulder fi red missiles and highly lethal low
level air defences. Th is was also validated during the Kargil confl ict of
1999. In the 1991 Gulf war technology created a paradigm shift albeit
selectively in the employment of air power. Th e enemy was treated as a
target system and air power was used strategically to carry out parallel
attacks on the enemy’s vital Centres of Gravity. In Kosovo, air power
was the only military instrument used to achieve coalition objectives.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

**Air power’s ability to create strategic outcomes without transiting**
**territories on ground made it a primary instrument of choice.**
However, subsequent air campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq along with
the Israeli experience against Hezbollah and other non-state actors have
yielded mixed results. Th e clear lesson is that while air power remains
an instrument of choice, its eff ectiveness depends to a large extent upon
the adversary, the kind of target systems that can be engaged through
the medium of air, and the ability of military and political leadership to
use it for maximum eff ect.
Th e major post Cold War innovations included stealth, precision,
extended reach, night sensors and enhanced computing power.
Leadership now became a viable target. A signifi cant shift also took
place with the development of night fi ghting enabling technology that
reduced the fl exibility enjoyed earlier by surface forces to manoeuvre
at night. Further, space became closely integrated with warfare and
was utilised for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR)
functions, secure communications, integrated early warning, weather
forecasting and navigation. Space based assets signifi cantly enhanced
the potency of air power. Due to increased battlefi eld transparency,
it also became easier to discern enemy intentions. **Use of precision**
**weapons at long range proved eff ective in causing a strategic**
**paralysis.**
Th e media brought warfare into living rooms and therefore
signifi cantly infl uenced the way in which wars were conducted. It
created international pressure and sensitivity regarding friendly losses
and collateral damage. Whilst short duration of wars meant there was
little time for the strategic eff ect to manifest itself, but the necessity of
making a swift strategic impact, increased especially when operating
under nuclear thresholds. With technological advancement, air power
provided the capabilities that linked tactical actions with strategic
outcomes that could prove crucial, especially in short duration wars.
With increasing globalisation, power concepts are moving away
from territorial acquisitions to the extracting of political/economic


-----

air power in the indian context

concessions. While traditional threats have reduced, threats from nonstate actors have increased. From attrition oriented warfare, war waging
concepts have rapidly moved towards **Eff ects Based Operations,**
wherein functional paralysis is more desirable than the physical
destruction of target systems. Th e Revolution in Military Aff airs has
transformed the role of technology and doctrines in fi ghting wars. Th e
aim now is to isolate the enemy’s command and control structures,
augment psychological warfare and precision strikes on the critical
vulnerabilities deep inside enemy territory. **Th ese changes favour**
**employment of air power more than any other form of military**
**power.**
Th e importance of sequential advantage in warfare has been
recognised and its relationship with force and space appreciated. As
such, air power today applies parallel force at all levels of war. Th e
strategic, operational and tactical levels themselves have been merged
and are now more related to functionality than to location or type of
targets. Th e networking of sensors, operators and decision makers has
signifi cantly reduced the sensor-to-shooter time period. Th is has also
resulted in transforming linear warfare into non-linear warfare. Th e
increased focus today is on knowledge and eff ect and to apply forces
synergistically to achieve the desired outcome in the shortest period
**of time, with minimum casualties and collateral damage.**

###### AIR POWER AND JOINTNESS
Th e IAF has always been cognizant of the fact that air power delivers
best when used in synergy with the other components of military power.
Th e confl icts and developments of the past three decades indicate a
growing role for air forces. In fact, certain air campaigns conducted in
the 1980s and 1990s led to the emergence of a school of thought that
believed that wars could be won entirely by air forces. However, the IAF
does not subscribe to this view since it is based on the experiences of
air forces pitted against markedly inferior militaries with little or no air
power capabilities.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

In India’s case, it is clear that air power alone cannot win a war, but
at the same time, no modern war can be won without it. Our experience
indicates that in almost every war fought since independence, the IAF
has played a signifi cant, and at times a pivotal role. It is also clear that
air power can best be exploited not only in synergy with the other two
components of the military, but also in tandem with diplomatic eff orts
and other national civil processes. Th e spectrum of modern confl ict
is signifi cantly diff erent and modern wars, whether conventional or
sub-conventional (with or without a nuclear overhang) cannot be won
singly by any one of the three primary components of military power.
Modern confl icts can be decisively infl uenced only by each component
of military power operating in synergy with each other and optimally
exploiting the unique attributes of its medium of operation (air, land and
sea) to achieve national objectives. Since the objective is common, joint
operations would be the most logical response to national challenges.
Integrated and joint operations are the cornerstone of modern military
operations and air power must be seen as the binding factor. Th is is so,
mainly because land and naval forces historically operated independent
of each other until the advent of air power. It is air power that enables
land and naval forces to undertake sustained operations beyond their
physical operating mediums, leading to the increasingly accepted
perception that air power is the lynchpin of joint operations.

### Principles of War and the Nature of Air Power

_Th e raison d’être, the reason for its (the air force’s) very existence, is to_

_try and neutralise the enemy’s various war potentials in wartime, by_

_every possible means and to protect one’s own._

— Air Chief Marshal PC Lal

###### BLENDING AIR POWER WITH PRINCIPLES OF WAR
Th e principles of war are the most fundamental form of doctrine. Th ey
have evolved from the experience of previous wars and are designed
to provide a better understanding of combat operations. However, the
characteristics of wars have undergone signifi cant changes due to the
considerable technological advances. Th ese have led to changes in the
hitherto accepted principles and introduced a few new ones that refl ect
the changing nature of warfare.

� **Selection and Maintenance of Aim. Th is would be a combined**
Politico-Military aim. In war, it is essential to identify an aim clearly
so as to provide a focus to all elements involved in warfare. Th ereaft er,
synchronised eff orts must be made for its attainment. Since war is an
extension of state policy, military aims are based on political objectives.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

Further, multiple constraints including domestic pressures could
play an important role in defi ning the desired end state, especially in
asymmetric confl icts. Th e military aim should ensure maximum post
confl ict advantage while being achievable. Th e aim must be decided
aft er due consideration of all politico-military factors and it should
be modifi ed if there is a change in circumstances. All components of
national power should be focused towards attaining this aim.

� **Intelligence.** Th e key to air power is targeting and the key to
targeting is intelligence relating to the potential enemy’s intentions,
dispositions and the likely pattern of his operations. Intelligence is
vital for identifying the enemy’s crucial vulnerabilities, weaknesses
and strengths and his Centres of Gravity which in turn will help
in devising an eff ective strategy. A force needs precise intelligence
if it is to employ precision weapons. Intelligence also has a direct
bearing on the attainment of eff ect and managing change.

� **Maintenance of Morale. Morale is a state of mind, but it is very**
sensitive to material conditions. It remains high when it is based
on a clear understanding of the assigned task, periodic practical
training and discipline. It is especially responsive to good leadership
and eff ective leadership can sustain high morale even when all
other factors go against it. It is adversely aff ected by inferior or
ineffi cient equipment and poor administration. History shows
that success in battle is the best stimulant for morale. In the case
of asymmetric warfare, morale can play a signifi cant role due to
the involvement of the civilian population. Th e factors important
for the maintenance of morale include dynamic leadership, sound
administration, discipline and the welfare of personnel.

� **Off ensive Action.** In conventional wars, off ensive action was
the prime means of seizing the initiative and establishing moral
ascendancy over the enemy. Th is entailed control over the purpose,
scope and intensity of operations while placing premium on early
action. In unconventional or sub-conventional confl ict, the initiative
may not be with the state and pre-emptive action without proper


-----

principles of war and the nature of air power

intelligence may prove counterproductive. Hence, most states end
up reacting to situations rather than taking a pro-active approach.
However, the freedom to act at a place and time of one’s choosing
even while reacting to a scenario, would wrest the initiative from the
enemy at any level of confl ict. In these circumstances, the emphasis
should be more on achieving and exploiting freedom of action
across all levels and dimensions of war as well as denial of the same
to the opponent. Th is would need accurate real time intelligence,
physical and information security, a sound and focused strategy,
technology savvy forces, eff ective deployment, synergy of eff ort,
prompt off ensive action and sound logistics. Th e side that loses
freedom of action loses its ability to infl uence the conduct of war.

� **Concentration of Force. Traditionally, success in war depended**
on the ability to fi eld forces superior to those of the enemy at a
particular time and place. However, modern concepts of warfare
look at systemic targeting and ensuring strategic paralysis rather
than the amassing of forces. It is better to concentrate decisive
fi re power on crucial locations and vulnerabilities to achieve the
desired eff ect. Air power with its ability to circumvent the enemy’s
massed forces, coupled with superior technological capabilities that
go beyond visual range engagements and standoff weapons has
changed the focus from the earlier concept of concentrating mass
to concentrating fi re power at the decisive point. Eff ects and not
mass lie at the heart of concentrating air power.

� **Economy of Eff ort. Economy of eff ort is the principle of judiciously**
employing available resources in warfare. However with the advent of
eff ects based operations, it may be more prudent to view this principle
as attainment of the desired eff ect. By shift ing the focus to attainment
of eff ect rather than merely economising eff ort, the emphasis
shift s to the goal rather than the means. Further, economy of eff ort
automatically forms part of attainment of eff ect, because achieving
the desired outcome by causing functional paralysis is always more
economical than causing physical destruction of target systems.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

� **Security. Th e** physical protection of assets and information denial
is essential for all military operations since it enables friendly forces
to achieve their objectives despite enemy interference. Security of
key force multipliers such as Aerostats/AAR/AWACS would be
crucial for success in war. Adequate measures must be taken to
ensure their physical security on ground even against asymmetric
attacks. Th ere is a need, therefore, to not only physically guard
these vital assets but also have electronic surveillance devices in
place to supplement physical surveillance both during peace and
in war.

� **Deception and Surprise. Speed, reach and elevation endow air**
power with a high degree of inherent surprise. Surprise plays
the greatest role in war, and its eff ect on morale is great. In some
operations, particularly when other factors are unfavourable,
surprise may prove essential to success. Surprise can be achieved
through a manoeuvre, or by exploiting a new doctrine and
technology. Its elements are secrecy, concealment, deception,
originality, audacity, timing and speed. Deception can be combined
with initiative and innovation to increase the element of surprise.

� **Flexibility and Managing Change. Armed forces should be able**
to adapt themselves to change. Th is could be termed as “Managing
Change” and goes beyond fl exibility and can also be achieved by
fl exibility in employing combat power. Th e change could occur in
the various dimensions of war – land, sea and air – and also at the
various levels of warfare – tactical, operational or strategic. Th e
purpose should be to derive maximum advantage from the altered
circumstances. It would require initiative, mobility and fl exibility
to be encompassed into one philosophy. Air power best exemplifi es
these attributes because it can be switched from one theatre or area
of operations to the other, from one target to the other or from one
role to the other.

� **Synergy, Synchronisation and Cooperation. Modern wars**
demand the joint and synchronised application of force by all


-----

principles of war and the nature of air power

elements of national power for achievement of national objectives.
Th is is even more valid in limited wars/asymmetric confl icts where
limitations of time, space or method demand synergy of eff ort. In
the future, there is a likelihood of large and varied forces including
non-military elements being employed; hence unity of command
may not be feasible at all times. It is here that coordination and
cooperation between diff erent agencies becomes the guiding
principle. Joint planning, training, a clear perspective about
the functioning of the other services and the establishment of
supportive organisations will be essential to ensure synergy. Th is
would also enhance survivability.

� **Generation & Sustenance of Favourable Asymmetry.** Th e
increase in battle space transparency may reduce the impact of
surprise at all levels of wars. Th erefore, the emphasis now has to
be, not only on, catching the enemy off guard but also on keeping
him off balance. Th is would require generating asymmetry at the
desired time and place, for wresting signifi cant combat advantage.
Th e methods employed include generating surprise in terms of
time, space and force, a favourable diff erential in technology and
weapon systems at the decisive point, exploiting sound operational
art, formulating eff ective and synergistic strategy and maintaining
information superiority.

� **Administration. A** sound administration and responsive logistics
are a pre-requisite for success in military operations. A disregard
of sound logistics has led to failure in wars on numerous occasions
in the past. Sustainability is the ability of a force to maintain the
###### necessary fi ghting power during the time needed to achieve military objectives. Th e physical and moral sustenance of personnel, the maintenance and repair of equipment and aircraft,
the provision of combat supplies and expendable commodities
and the treatment, evacuation and replacement of casualties are
###### all aspects of sustainability.

###### CHARACTERISTICS OF AIR POWER
Air power exploits the vertical dimension and its nature is a function
of the physical attributes of this dimension. Th e vertical dimension
is exploited not only as a medium of transit, but also for manoeuvre,
concealment, surprise and a host of other factors. An understanding
of the distinct characteristics and limitations of the vertical dimension
is essential to enable optimal exploitation of air power. Th ese distinct
physical attributes make for the distinct characteristics of air power.
Th e core characteristics of air power are speed, fl exibility, reach and
elevation. Th ese attributes are shared with the space environment, but
in a diff erent way, and on an entirely diff erent scale; consequently, the
unique features of space power are dealt with separately. Th ese core
characteristics make up the larger sub-set of characteristics which are
as follows:

� **Flexibility & Versatility.** Th e fi rst set of characteristics of air
power can be placed under the heading of fl exibility and versatility.
Flexibility consists of the ability to use combat power in ways suited
to the situation while versatility implies that the same weapons
platform can be used for a variety of missions. For example, a
modern multi-role combat aircraft like the SU-30 MKI can be used
for almost all roles that are assigned to modern fi ghter aircraft .
Similarly, most modern transport aircraft like the C-130 J Hercules
and helicopters like the Mi-17 V5 are designed as multi-role
platforms. Flexibility and versatility have a special relevance for the
IAF as aircraft and equipment costs are rising exponentially, and
there is need to extract the maximum value for taxpayers’ money.
In short, the IAF cannot aff ord to operate aircraft, which can only
be employed at one level of confl ict or for one type of role.

� **Mobility.** Th e unique ability of aircraft to manoeuvre freely and
swift ly in three dimensions gives them the speed and the range to
apply military power where needed over a very large area. Mobility
has particular relevance in joint operations where forces need to be
moved and re-supplied at short notice within and between theatres.


-----

principles of war and the nature of air power

In many circumstances aircraft will be the only means of reacting
in the time available.

� **Responsiveness.** Associated with fl exibility and mobility is the
characteristic of responsiveness. In a crisis, the use of air power will
normally be the option most readily available and usable by the
government. Air power can be used to demonstrate national resolve
quickly by deployment, or heightened states of readiness, and it is
the most readily available means for demonstrating combat power.
Air forces can also be used to establish and maintain a military
presence as an extension of diplomacy.

� **Shock Eff ect. It is an eff ect that goes beyond mere surprise; it is an**
eff ect which can induce confusion and psychological disorientation.
It is created by the aircraft ’s ability to concentrate fi re power and
deliver it with little or no warning. Th e shock eff ect of air power
has been enhanced greatly with the development of air launched
Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) and other specialist weapons.

� **Concentration.** Th e fl exibility and responsiveness of air power
allows a commander to concentrate force. Th is is of vital importance
especially in a fl uid tactical situation. Th e shock eff ect inherent in air
power is the product of its capacity to be concentrated in time and
space. However, the capacity to concentrate force can be dissipated
by ineffi cient command and control arrangements, inappropriate
division of responsibilities or dilution of core competencies. It
takes intelligence and sound judgment to determine where to
strike and the quantum of force to be used. If leveraged properly,
air power off ers national leaders and military commanders the
capability to concentrate power in very eff ective ways. Historically,
concentration refers most obviously to off ensive power, but it is not
limited to that. Apart from concentrating the off ensive power of
strike aircraft, air power can be used, for example, to deliver land
forces in a concentrated form to the point on the battlefi eld where
they can have the maximum eff ect. Th e ability to move swift ly, to
concentrate and to descend from out of the blue gives the advantage


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

of shock to air-landed or airborne troops. Concentration is also
applicable to large volumes of relief that can be delivered in disaster
and humanitarian relief contingencies. Th is ability to concentrate
quickly is the characteristic which must be exploited fully if air
power is to be used to its maximum potential, both as a tool for
force projection and nation building.

� **Off ensive Action.** Only air forces have the ability to carry
off ensive action deep into enemy territory while operating from
secure bases. Defensive action may prevent defeat, but wars can
be won only by off ensive action. Th is principle of war, which
is also the central characteristic of air power, is oft en neglected
or overlooked by policy-makers unversed in the application of
military power. Off ensive capability provides the best defence.
It changes one’s stance from reactive to active and allows one to
seize and hold the initiative in operations. Th e potential to apply
air power off ensively is a positive contribution to deterrence. It
forces a potential aggressor to look at his own vulnerabilities and
divert resources to their defence. Th e eff ectiveness of deterrence
depends on the perception of the potential enemy regarding the
likelihood of success in relation to the costs and penalties he will
incur. Air power, with its inherently off ensive characteristic can
raise the costs, and impose penalties that would be unacceptable to
the potential aggressor. Combined together, the core characteristics
of air power coupled with modern space enabled communication
systems, sensors; precision positioning and navigation capabilities
off er tremendous capabilities that can decisively infl uence both the
strategic and operational environment.

� **Reach. Th e medium of air and the continuum of space does not**
hinder the employment of air power. Isolated and distant targets in
diffi cult terrain do not prevent engagement of such targets from the
third dimension. Modern technology has matured to such an extent
that air power has unparalleled reach, and if exploited correctly,
will provide a tremendous advantage to the side exploiting it.


-----

principles of war and the nature of air power

###### LIMITATIONS OF AIR POWER
Like its strengths, air power has its limitations too. Th ese limitations are
relative rather than absolute and need to be understood as such. Some
of these limitations are highlighted below and will enable a holistic
understanding of air power.

� **Sustainability. Th e sustainability of air forces is frequently limited by**
logistics, particularly in the case of technology intensive platforms.
Th is could prove critical in a long drawn-out war. Air forces
consume large amounts of resources; infrastructure demands are
extensive and expensive, and the training takes considerable time.
Sustainability becomes critical when air operations are prosecuted
well beyond national boundaries in expeditionary operations, the
likes of which have been undertaken by the US and its coalition
partners in Iraq and Afghanistan.

� **Base Dependency. Air power operates most eff ectively from**
permanent bases, although rotary wing aircraft can operate away
from fi xed facilities. Th is dependence on a large supporting
infrastructure is a negative feature of air power. It results in air
power assets becoming concentrated at readily identifi able points
where they are vulnerable to attack. Th is dependence can also limit
the eff ectiveness of air power in a particular area if suitable airfi elds
are not available. Th e ability of aircraft to operate from short and
unprepared landing strips derives its strength from this limitation.

� **Sensitivity to Technology. Air power is a product of technology**
and because of this it tends to be more sensitive to technological
changes than the other two services. Even minor technological
innovations can have a major impact on air power eff ectiveness.

� **Vulnerability.** Air power assets are necessarily concentrated at
bases owing to their infrastructural requirements. Besides being
vulnerable in the air, they are high value targets when on the ground.
Protective measures such as Hardened Aircraft Shelters (HAS), can
reduce their vulnerability. However, by their very nature aircraft
are fragile and even comparatively low grade battle damage can


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

have catastrophic eff ects. Th is limits the extent to which they can
be exposed to the risk of enemy fi re.

� **Impermanency. Th is limitation relates to air power’s inability to**
hold ground. As such, air power is an impermanent form of military
force. Th e eff ects it creates are transient, and to sustain those eff ects,
operations have to be repeated or complemented by other arms of
military power.

� **Political Constraints. Th e limitations of air power’s relevance,**
especially in sub-conventional contingencies, lie not in its
capabilities, but in the political will to use these capabilities. Political
constraints on the use of air power can only curtail its eff ectiveness
and make it counterproductive. Managing perceptions regarding
the eff ectiveness of air power in diverse situations is key for shaping
political opinion on the employment of air power, particularly in
the sub-conventional domain.

� **Weather.** Notwithstanding the technical advances that facilitate
24x7 operations, air power continues to be more aff ected by weather
compared to land and maritime power.

###### SOURCES OF AIR POWER
Air power is a derivative as also an indicator of national power. Th e
ability of a nation to utilise all air power resources at its disposal
determines its air power capabilities. Air power, hence, is the sum total
of a nation’s aviation and related capabilities. It comprises national
aviation assets usually described as air forces, air arms and civil aviation,
along with their associated organisations, infrastructure, logistics and
personnel. Th e use of space, either independently or in support of air
power, is on the rise and consequently the term ‘aerospace power’ is
coming increasingly into vogue. Th e diff erent sources of air power are
as follows:

� **Air Force. Th is is the traditional term for the independent military**
force that delivers air power. Th e capabilities of air forces refl ect
national perspectives, priorities and strategic needs. It is only the air


-----

principles of war and the nature of air power

forces, that are capable of employing air power to prosecute all the
air campaigns, and this is refl ected in their structure, technology,
organisation, training and infrastructure. It is this that sets an air
**force apart from an air arm.**

� **Air Arm. In exceptional cases, an air arm is an organic component**
of armies, navies and para military forces, and provides a capability
that is not inherent in other elements of that surface force. However,
this arm would be in support of the tactical objectives of the surface
force unlike the objectives of the air force that are strategic in
nature. Air arms also tend to be much smaller than air forces. As a
result, they are not capable of prosecuting all the air campaigns. An
exception to this is the US which maintains large air arms integral
to its naval and land forces.

� **Civil Air Resources.** Civil aircraft and infrastructure also
contribute to a nation’s air power. Th ey augment airlift capabilities
and if suitably modifi ed, could also be used for combat support
operations.

� **Space. Th e acquisition, exchange and exploitation of information**
in the modern world have been revolutionised by the onset of the
space age. An important aspect of modern air power is that it is
really an ‘air and space power’. Th e demarcation between ‘air’ and
‘space’ is becoming increasingly irrelevant, and a modern air force
must be prepared to operate seamlessly in both elements. An air
force that can tap into space based assets can dramatically improve
its ability to prosecute a war quickly and with minimal risk.

### Air Power Doctrine and the IAF

_A doctrine of war consists in a common way of objectively approaching_

_the subject; second, in a common way of handling it._

— Ferdinand Foch: Precepts. 1919

‘Doctrine’ is derived from the Latin ‘doctrina’ and signifi es a code
of beliefs or a body of teachings. In military terms, doctrine refers
to the central beliefs that enable an organisation to optimally fulfi l
its national obligations. Air power doctrine refers to the central
beliefs and principles of the IAF that guide the employment of air
power in the furtherance of national objectives. Th ese beliefs have
been acquired from the study and analysis of experiences in confl icts
and crises, as well as fi eld exercises, equipment tests etc in peace
time. Where experience is lacking, the IAF in its collective wisdom
analyses the theory and postulates action. Th us a doctrine is a guide
to the “best way to conduct Air Force aff airs”

###### IMPORTANCE OF DOCTRINE
The national strategy is determined by the Union Cabinet and is
based on the National Security Policy. Its purpose is to combine
all components of national power, political, diplomatic, economic,
military, technological, informational, social and cultural, to


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

safeguard national interests and achieve national security objectives.
The national strategy entails the coordinated employment of all
elements of national power. The doctrine offers precepts for the
development and employment of national power. For example,
India’s nuclear doctrine as operationalised by the CCS note of
January 4, 2003, guides the national strategy. The joint military
strategy decides the development and employment of military power,
along with the respective land, maritime and air strategies. Military
doctrine provides the conceptual framework for the role, scope and
application of military power and underpins the formulation of
military strategy.

###### LEVELS OF DOCTRINE
Apex doctrines relating to national security and military power,
off er precepts for the development and employment of power at the
strategic, operational and tactical levels. Accordingly, doctrines have
distinct levels that broadly correspond with the levels of war fi ghting,
viz. strategic, operational and tactical.
**Strategic Level: This doctrine enunciates the fundamental and**
enduring principles which guide the use of air forces during war
and crises. It establishes the framework for the effective use of air
power. For example, the tenet that: ‘control of air becomes a prerequisite for effectiveness of all military activities’ is an enduring
principle.
**Operational Level: Th is translates the principles of the basic doctrine**
into military action by prescribing the proper use of the air forces on
the basis of: distinct objectives, force capabilities, broad mission areas
and operational environments. An example of an operational doctrine
in consonance with strategic doctrine could be: ‘AOC-in-C employing
his air force in counter air operations by orchestrating a variety of roles
to achieve control of the air’.
**Tactical Level: Th is converts basic and operational doctrine by**
delineating the proper use of specifi c weapon systems to accomplish


-----

air power doctrine and the iaf

detailed objectives. Tactical doctrine prescribes how roles and tasks are
to be carried out and is usually published in manuals such as those
brought out by the Tactics and Air Combat Development Establishment
(TACDE). For example if Mirage-2000 aircraft are fl ying escort to an
airfi eld attack package, then tactical doctrine would indicate how the
Mirage 2000s would be integrated and co-ordinated within the force
package.

###### THE DOCTRINAL LOOP
A doctrine is formulated on the basis of inputs. Th e output would
then provide the framework within which viable military capability
can be developed. Th ese capabilities would require validation through
peace-time exercises or war experiences so that the feedback could be
employed to refi ne the doctrine further. Th e doctrinal loop is pictorially
depicted below.

###### DOCTRINE AND TECHNOLOGY
Doctrine is derived from the past and developed in the present for
application in the future. Its true benefi t is not what it tells us about
the past, but what it suggests about the future. Th e doctrinal process
therefore should analyse and infl uence the course of new and developing


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

technologies. In the Indian context, it may not always be possible
for doctrine to drive technology due to resource and technological
constraints. Instead, doctrine may be limited to playing an interactive
role with technology. As such, our doctrine must be receptive to the
potential advantages that new technologies have to off er. India has
taken many strides in exploiting the new technologies for defence
applications. An example of technology driving doctrine is the evolution
of net centric warfare. Doctrine evolves post the absorption of such
technological developments.

###### DOCTRINE AND FORCE STRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
Doctrine is an important element in the development of future force
structures and capability requirements. Although force structures keep
changing they also exhibit enormous inertia and must be given the right
direction and impetus. Th e guiding infl uence of doctrine in relation to
force structure and capabilities can best be illustrated by an example. A
decision on whether or not to acquire Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)
will depend on a host of factors that include cost, maintainability,
operational characteristics and doctrine. Th e impact of doctrine on
this decision is not to select a particular type of RPA or the numbers
to be acquired, but to determine the applicability of this technology or
capability to the employment of air power. Th e doctrinal argument in
favour of its acquisition may proceed along the following lines:
In isolation, the RPA is neither an off ensive weapon system like
an aircraft, nor a defensive weapon system like a SAM. Th e key to
its usefulness, however, is in the opportunities that the RPA off ers to
other off ensive weapon systems with its ability to provide real time
reconnaissance and intelligence that is so vital for targeting and making
the battlefi eld transparent. In addition, the use of RPAs for Battle
Damage Assessment would make air power more responsive and make
it unnecessary to risk manned aircraft for the same purpose.
Th e doctrinal argument thus supports the procurement of RPA
technology.

###### SUMMARY
Th is chapter highlights the following:

� Military doctrine could be defi ned as “a set of fundamental
principles by which military forces direct their actions in the quest
of national objectives”.

� Air power doctrine enunciates the “fundamental principles that
guide the employment of air power elements to achieve national
objectives”. It is a statement of offi cially sanctioned beliefs, war
fi ghting principles and terminology that determines and directs the
correct use of air forces in military operations.

� An air force doctrine determines the manner in which air forces
organise, train, equip, fi ght and sustain their forces.

� Doctrine is authoritative but its application requires judgment.

### Structure of Air Power

_Air Forces are defeated or weakened at least as much by their internal_

_illusions as by the enemy. Th e minute that, readiness data ceases to_

_be realistic; training is cut back or separated from realistic combat_

_conditions; eff ectiveness is exaggerated; equipment performance and_

_lethality are overstated; gaps in training and doctrine are ignored;_

_and an Air Force becomes a bureaucracy rather than a ruthlessly self_

_–critical fi ghting machine; an Air Force places itself in the position when_

_it must try to carry out in war the preparation it should have carried_

_out in peacetime._

— Anthony Cordesman

###### AIR STRATEGY
Air strategy could be termed as the process of coordinating the
_development, deployment and employment of air power assets to achieve_
_national security objectives. Air power with its intrinsic characteristics_
of speed, elevation and reach provides tremendous strategic options.
Th ese strategies are then prosecuted by air campaigns which comprise
of a variety of air operations.
As aerial warfare evolved and the importance of command of
the air grew, a distinctive strategic area for application for air power
emerged. This involved operations to deter, contain or defeat the
enemy’s air power, a strategy which came to be termed as “counter
air”. Air forces can also be employed both independently of, and in


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

co-ordination with the surface forces to attack vital target systems.
Historically, the purpose of an independent strategy was to weaken
the enemy’s ability to wage war and degrade his will to resist by
attacking his sources of power. In contrast, the purpose of the coordinated strategy was to help friendly surface forces contain or
defeat the enemy’s land and naval forces. The operations mounted
to prosecute the independent strategy came to be known as the
“strategic bombing campaign”, while those mounted to prosecute
the auxiliary strategy were termed “tactical air support”, or more
recently as a “counter surface force campaign”. Counter air, strategic
air and counter surface force operations are the three elements of
air strategy. Historically, the choice between these three strategies
has tended to be one of emphasis rather than on their employment
in isolation. In most recent conflicts, air forces have undertaken to
prosecute all the three air strategies simultaneously, although the
resources devoted to each have varied considerably. Therefore, air
strategy would encompass all these options.

###### AIR CAMPAIGNS
Since each of these strategies is meant to achieve a specifi c aim, and
does so by using distinct methods, its prosecution requires a dedicated
“campaign”. Hence, an air commander may have to wage three distinct
but interdependent air campaigns in pursuit of his chosen air strategy.
Th e sheer fl exibility and versatility of modern aerial platforms and


-----

structure of air power

weapons allow a commander to conduct parallel operations by
prosecuting all campaigns simultaneously.
A defi nite order for the employment of air power can be discerned
in each air campaign. For example, the counter air campaign comprises
two basic air operations; Off ensive Counter Air (OCA) and Defensive
**Counter Air (DCA) better known in the IAF as** **Air Defence (AD).**
Similarly, the strategic air campaign consists of conventional and nuclear
operations, and the counter surface force campaign consists of air land and
**maritime air operations. An additional example would be air mobility**
operations that would form part of the combat enabling operations.
Normally, control of the air should be the fi rst priority for air forces.
Th is permits own air and surface forces to operate more eff ectively and
denies the same to the enemy. Th e required degree of control is achieved
through counter air operations. Th ereaft er, the air commander can deliver
combat power when and where needed, to attain military objectives at any
level of war. Th is he does by conducting strategic air and counter surface
force campaigns. All the air campaigns can be conducted independently,
parallel with, or in support of surface operations. A description of the
various air campaigns, as well as of the combat support operations is given
below:

basic doctrine of the indian air force

###### OPERATIONAL ART
Operational strategy employs the forces earmarked for the military/
air campaigns. It can be defi ned as the art and science of planning,
orchestrating and directing military/air campaigns within a theatre to
achieve national security objectives. A campaign consists of a series
of related major operations, each of which may involve a number of
battles, which together seek to achieve a particular objective. Within a
campaign the capabilities of various forces must be combined to achieve
synergy and on a broader scale, separate campaigns must be combined
harmoniously to achieve war objectives. Whilst the air strategy is
developed at the Air HQ, the operational art for employing air power is
evolved at IAF Command HQs. For successful execution of operational
art a commander must have:

� An awareness of the national security environment and the political
aims

� A clear grasp of the military aim and the strategy

� Technological awareness

� An understanding of civil military aff airs and media management.

###### TACTICS
Tactics are the art and science of employing forces at the battlefi eld. Th e
diff erence between tactics and higher levels of strategy is that tactics are
employed on the battlefi eld while operational strategy brings the forces
to the battlefi eld. Modern wars necessitate that tactics must keep pace
with advancements in technology and weapons. Failure to do so could
prove to be devastating, especially for the air forces. Tactics should be
designed to exploit the capabilities of equipment and weapon systems
to enhance eff ectiveness and reduce vulnerabilities. However, in some
circumstances, equipment may need to be adapted to fulfi l tactical
requirements. Innovative and unpredictable tactics will always produce
positive results.


-----

structure of air power

###### INTER-RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN AIR CAMPAIGNS
Each air campaign includes conduct of **specific air operations,**
which encompass various tactical level air power functions or “roles”.
These not only include combat roles but also combat enabling roles.
For example, the combat roles needed to prosecute **OCA** include
suppression of enemy air defences (SEAD), airfield attacks, fighter
**sweeps and escorts. To be fully effective these missions need to be**
enabled by electronic warfare assets, surveillance and reconnaissance
information, airborne warning and control systems (AWACS), airto-air refuelling (AAR) and at times air transport support. Also
necessary, are a sound command, control, communications and
intelligence system, ground defences, maintenance, logistics and
administrative support.
Combat roles tend to be specifi c to a particular air operation,
combat enabling air roles can apply to many, if not, to all air operations,
while ground support activities apply to all air operations.
The air power roles are accomplished through a series of tasks,
which involve a number of missions and each mission may involve
one or more sorties. For example as part of air strategy, we would
execute a counter air campaign, involving OCA operations by
aircraft in SEAD role which could be tasked to target high power
radar inside the enemy territory. To accomplish this task, a mission
of strike aircraft (with appropriate force packaging) undertaking a
number of sorties would be planned. The structure of air power is
as follows:

**Fig. 3: Th e Structure of Air Power**

###### AIR CAMPAIGNS AND ENABLING FUNCTIONS
Th e relevance of the various air campaigns and enabling functions can
be better understood by viewing air power employment in its four basic
functions. Th ese are:

� **Control of the Air. Th is is achieved by a dedicated counter air**
campaign through off ensive counter air and defensive counter air
or air defence operations. Th eir objective is to gain and maintain
the required degree of control of air so as to permit eff ective
employment of all facets of air and surface power.

� **Application of Combat Power. Th is is achieved through strategic**
air and counter surface force campaigns. Here, combat power is
applied against surface targets and does not include the targets that
are specifi c to the counter air campaign. Typical roles for air land


-----

structure of air power

operations are air interdiction, battlefi eld air interdiction, battlefi eld
air strike, tactical recce, search and strikes while anti shipping and
maritime air strikes are undertaken by the maritime air arm.

� **Enhancing Combat Power. Th e air power roles contributing to**
enhancement of combat power increase the mobility, lethality,
accuracy, survivability or fl exibility of air and surface forces. Th is
is achieved by combat enabling air operations and air mobility
operations. Combat enabling air operations include airborne
assault, special air operations, special heliborne operations, air-toair refuelling, electronic warfare, surveillance and reconnaissance,
airborne early warning and search and rescue. Combat enabling
air operations also involve testing and evaluation and research and
development.

� **Sustaining Combat Power.** If air operations are to be successful
they need to be sustained and supported by combat enabling ground
operations. Runway rehabilitation, CBRN defence, ground defence,
passive air defence (including camoufl age and concealment),
training, administration and HRD are some examples of these.

###### ROLES
Th e exact role that an air force will play would depend on the nature of
the threat, resources available and the unique nature of the campaign.
Usually, roles envisaged for the air force are as follows:

� Defence of national and island territories, against attacks from air
and space both during peace and war.

� Deterring an aggressor from carrying out hostile acts and if
deterrence fails to mount an eff ective response.

� During operations, achieve control of the air to the required degree
to provide full freedom of action to the air and surface forces.

� Applying direct pressure on the enemy’s power of resistance by
attacking his crucial centres of gravity.

� Synergising the combat potential of air power with that of the
surface forces to achieve joint military aims and objectives.


-----

� Deploying and employing forces to protect and project the national
interests in any out of country contingency operation.

� Assisting the government in disaster management or humanitarian
relief tasks.

� Executing counter terrorism and counter insurgency operations.

� Fulfi lling international commitments requiring air power assets,
consistent with our national policies and interests.

� Providing viable second-strike capability in case of a nuclear
attack.

### The Air Campaigns

THE COUNTER AIR CAMPAIGN
THE COUNTER SURFACE FORCE CAMPAIGN
THE STRATEGIC AIR CAMPAIGN

##### SECTION I

###### THE COUNTER AIR CAMPAIGN

_Any one who has to fi ght, even with the most modern weapons against_

_an enemy who has complete control of air, fi ghts like a savage, under the_

_same handicaps and with the same chances of success._

— Field Marshal Rommel

###### INTRODUCTION
With the increase in the eff ectiveness of air power, the need to contain
the enemy’s air power also increased signifi cantly. As early as in World
War I, air power was used in airfi eld attacks, air to air combat and
off ensive sweeps to seek and destroy enemy aircraft in the air as well
as on the ground, so as to achieve control of air. During World War II,
the need for a dedicated counter air campaign was realised not only for
the success of air operations, but virtually for all types of surface and
sub-surface operations. Various campaigns e.g. the Arab-Israeli war in


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

1967 and the India-Pakistan confl ict of 1971 highlighted the successes
achieved due to control of the air.

###### AIM OF THE COUNTER AIR CAMPAIGN
Th e aim of the counter air campaign is to achieve and maintain the
**necessary degree of control of air. Th ese operations are directed against**
the enemy’s air power either in air or on ground with the objective
of preventing the enemy from using his air power eff ectively against
friendly forces, yet permitting own use of air power against him.

###### DEGREES OF CONTROL OF THE AIR
Th e three classical degrees of control of air are:

� **Air Supremacy. Air supremacy exists, if the enemy air power**
has been incapacitated to the extent that it is incapable of any air
interference. Th is is characterised as: fi rstly, not being limited by
time and space and secondly, being representative of the highest
degree of ‘control of air.’

� **Air Superiority. Air superiority can be defi ned as a high degree**
of dominance in air, which permits the conduct of land, sea
and air operations at a given time and place without prohibitive
interference from the enemy air force. Th is condition is said to exist
when, fi rstly, aircraft of all types can operate in all types of roles at a
given time and place without serious interference from the enemy
and secondly, it can limit the enemy’s air operations. Further, this
provides the additional advantage of information superiority due
to own ability to execute desired reconnaissance missions, while
preventing the enemy from doing so.

� **Favourable Air Situation (FAS). FAS is limited by time and space**
to a much greater extent and it assures a lower degree of control
of the air. Th erefore, a higher degree of enemy air interference can
be expected. Th e level of control of air is such that it enables the
exercise of specifi c capabilities or conduct specifi c operations. An
example of FAS is when one acquires just the required degree of


-----

the air campaigns

control of air in a localised area by executing SEAD, airfi eld attacks
and off ensive sweeps to permit a friendly break out of armour at the
desired time.

###### ACHIEVING CONDITIONS FOR CONTROL OF AIR
Th e degrees of control over air are intangible. While air supremacy,
can be easily discerned, it is not so in the case of air superiority and
favourable air situation. In the case of the latter, the achievement of
the said condition is known only aft er it is achieved and exploited.
Th ese realities imply that in the campaigns carried out to achieve the
conditions for control of air, eff ort must be made to achieve it with a
higher degree of assurance.

###### PRIMACY OF THE COUNTER AIR CAMPAIGN
Th e above three air campaigns historically have been pursued
simultaneously but in case the enemy has a powerful air force, priority
must be given to the achievement of control of the air so that the enemy
air force’s ability to interfere with own surface force action is blunted.
However, this does not mean that no other campaign is to be undertaken
till air superiority is achieved. Instead, it means that no other operations
be commenced, if they are going to jeopardise the attainment of air
superiority, or are going to use up the resources required to attain or
maintain air superiority. At the same time, temporary emergencies may
arise when such resources have to be diverted to other tasks as was the
case in the opening moments of 1965 war when the IAF thwarted the
Pak armour thrust in Chamb area on September 1, 1965 by launching
fi ghter aircraft within one hour of getting the clearance to seek and
destroy Pak armour, anti-aircraft guns and vehicles.

###### COUNTER AIR CAMPAIGN
Th e counter air campaign comprises of two distinct but complementary
operations; off ensive counter air and air defence (or defensive counter
air). Th e components of the counter air campaign are as shown below:

**Counter Air Campaign**

**Off ensive Counter Air Operations (OCA)** **Air Defence (AD) Operations**

**Fig. 1: Counter Air Campaign**

###### OFFENSIVE COUNTER AIR OPERATIONS
Off ensive counter air operations or OCA are aimed at destroying,
disrupting or limiting the enemy air power as close to its source as
possible. Air superiority is hindered by aircraft and ground based
weapon systems which are supported by radars, other sensors,


-----

the air campaigns

communications and intelligence. Not directly related to combat, but
nevertheless essential, is the infrastructure that supports these combat
systems – ammunition, fuel, airfi elds and aircraft servicing areas.
Attacks on some or most of these target systems may be necessary to
achieve air superiority.

###### INTELLIGENCE
Intelligence is a vital input for planning and executing OCA operations.
During peacetime, targets need to be prioritised depending on how
vulnerable the enemy would be to their individual and/or collective
destruction. Prior to commencement of hostilities intelligence agencies
should be clearly aware of the intelligence required by the operational
air commander and his intent, so that information gathering systems
are put in place. An additional requirement during war would relate to
Bomb Damage Assessment (BDA).

###### ROLES OF OCA
Successful OCA operations require:

� Suppression/Destruction of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD/DEAD).

� Airfi eld attacks.

� Fighter sweeps.

� Escorts.

� Helicopter and Transport aircraft .

basic doctrine of the indian air force

**Suppression/Destruction of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD /**
**DEAD).** The early seventies proved to be a critical watershed in
the history of air warfare. During the opening stages of the 1973
Arab-Israeli War, Syria and Egypt so dominated the skies over the
Golan heights and Sinai respectively with an integrated network of
surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and anti-aircraft-artillery (AAA)
that they succeeded in imposing – at least temporarily – “air denial”
on the Israel Air Force. In the first three days of war, the Israelis
experienced attrition of over 4 per cent. So grave were the losses
that Israel had to temporarily suspend operations over the Golan
Heights till the SAMs and AAA had been neutralised by ECM and/
or physical attacks. The importance of electronic warfare and the
need for specialist aircraft and munitions to suppress, degrade or
destroy enemy ground-based air defences was brought into sharp
focus during this war.
SEAD/DEAD can be defi ned as activity which neutralises, destroys
or temporarily degrades enemy air defence systems in a specifi c area
by physical attack (hard kill) and/or electronic warfare (soft kill).
SEAD can signifi cantly reduce attrition and help sustain off ensive
air action against an enemy who has a strong air defence network.
Specialised weapons, tactics and training play a particularly important
part in SEAD. Targets to be attacked would include radars and other
types of sensors, SAMs and AAA sites, and communication systems/
nodes. Th e inherent weaknesses of each component of the AD system
would have to be identifi ed and targeted to produce results, which is
where Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Communications Intelligence
(COMINT) and other means of intelligence gathering would play a vital
role. Th e major role in SEAD will invariably be played by the air forces,
but the contribution of surface forces should not be overlooked. Special
forces, artillery and naval support have been employed successfully in
past confl icts to help suppress enemy air defences.
**Airfi eld Attacks. Airbases have traditionally been crucial targets for**
off ensive counter air attacks. Th ough the importance of airfi elds as


-----

the air campaigns

targets is on the decline, on account of rapid runway rehabilitation
systems and the shift of focus on eff ects based operations, but even so
airfi elds being static concentration centres would continue to contain
densely packed high-value targets. Aircraft on the ground at airfi elds are
more concentrated and vulnerable than they are in fl ight. Experience
of the 1991 Gulf War has shown that even when aircraft on ground are
protected by Hardened Aircraft Shelters (Blast Pens as the IAF terms
it), they are not suffi ciently protected; because of the precision attack
and penetrative capability of PGMs. Apart from aircraft, the damage or
destruction of critical base facilities can also prove to be decisive. When
airfi elds are unable to provide landing, take-off or critical support
facilities (maintenance, fuel, ammunition), air forces are eff ectively
grounded. Reducing the number of enemy operable bases leads to the
overcrowding and overtaxing of the available bases, making them even
more worthwhile targets. Airfi eld attacks were used to devastating eff ect
by the Israelis in 1967 war wherein, the Arab air forces were decimated
on ground itself.

**Operating Surfaces. Damage to runways and taxi tracks can only**
temporarily close airfi elds. Modern runway repair equipment makes
it possible to make an airfi eld operational within a few hours. While
this may be a worthwhile objective, to either assist friendly ground
forces to launch an off ensive, or to deny enemy ground forces air
support to prosecute their off ensive, it must be kept in mind, that
the attrition suff ered in repeated airfi eld attacks against runways and
taxi tracks could also subsequently render the attacker too weak to
counter the opposing air force. Another factor to be kept in mind
is the eff ort required to attack a well-defended airfi eld. During the
1991Gulf War, a package of 38 aircraft needed 30 support aircraft to
ensure that eight aircraft could hit a target with a reasonable chance
of survival, i.e. a ratio of support aircraft to strike aircraft of 4 to 1.
**Other Airfi eld Targets. Besides targeting operating surfaces,**
airfi eld attacks must also target aircraft, personnel and the support
infrastructure. However, detailed intelligence would be required


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

regarding the location of such facilities, their hardening and
redundancy. Key facilities are likely to be hardened and concealed and
target acquisition would be diffi cult. At the same time, the collateral
impact on the morale of the local commander and his administration
because of intense pressure of bomb disposal, casualty evacuation
and treatment, fi re fi ghting and base recuperation, cannot be over
looked.

**Fighter Sweeps. Th ese are operations mounted to seek and destroy**
enemy aircraft in the air in an allocated area of operations. Mission
success depends on two factors. Firstly, the availability of friendly
radar cover in the area of the sweep (supplemented by onboard hitech AI radars), and secondly, the willingness of the enemy air forces
to oppose the sweep. Fighter sweeps are best conducted by modern
air superiority fi ghters, which have higher loiter times, excellent AI
radars, IFF integration and long range BVR capability. Th eir potency
is signifi cantly enhanced by AWACS/Aerostats support. Th e off ensive
sweeps also help generate dynamic air control in the enemy air space.
In case, enemy air power refuses to engage, then the aircraft could carry
air to ground armaments and attack high value targets in a role termed
as ‘Intimidation’. Th is combines the off ensive sweep role with the attack
function.


-----

the air campaigns

**Escorts. Th is role involves the assigning of fi ghter aircraft to protect**
friendly strike aircraft during a mission. Th eir purpose is to act as
counter threat to the enemy air defence fi ghters, and by doing so, enable
friendly missions to proceed unhindered to their targets and back.
Fighter escorts are usually provided to strike aircraft, ECM aircraft and
photo recce aircraft . Th ey could also be provided to transport aircraft
involved in combat enabling or support missions.
**Helicopter and Transport Aircraft . In a counter air campaign, the**
forward tier of enemy radars could be neutralised by armed and attack
helicopters, which can play a signifi cant role in realising campaign
objectives. Utility helicopters escorted by armed helicopters can also
insert special forces in the vicinity of forward tier enemy radars with an
aim of neutralising the radars by direct action. Transport aircraft like
C-130 could also be utilised for inserting special forces and capturing
enemy airfi elds.

###### FORCE PACKAGING
OCA missions are likely to include a package of attack aircraft supported
by other combat support elements such as AAR and EW, SEAD and AD
aircraft . Th e coordination of such packages is demanding and requires
training and practice in peacetime. Operational eff ectiveness should
be achieved by saturating defences through spatial and temporal
compression of the attacks carried out.

###### AIR DEFENCE OPERATIONS
Air defence (AD) involves the employment of a combination of passive
and active measures to nullify or reduce the eff ectiveness of an enemy
aerial attack or a hostile ballistic/cruise missile attack. Air defence,
by itself, cannot achieve a lasting favourable air situation, since it is
reactive. A military strategy which is based solely on AD operations
concedes the timing, scope and tempo of air operations to the enemy
and entails considerable military risk. AD operations have little scope


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

of exploiting surprise, initiative and off ensive action. AD operations
should always be complemented by OCA operations to retain the
initiative and authority in air.
Eff ective AD depends upon the integration of sensors, weapon
systems, secure communications and the real-time transfer of data. A
centralised command and control infrastructure must be overlaid to
provide both direction and co-ordination for the many elements of an
air defence system including those from other armed forces, especially
in an integrated battlefi eld scenario. Th e eff ectiveness of an AD system
is heavily dependent on its surveillance and early warning systems to
provide time in which to react. Th is response usually entails committing
a range of weapon systems against the threat via the medium of the
control system. In practice, both surveillance operations and control
systems utilise a common system known as Control and Reporting
(C&R) system.
Th e success of AD operations depends largely upon factors such as
the quality and timeliness of intelligence, the assurance of detection,
response times of weapon systems and the ability of AD elements
to remain operational while absorbing battle damage. Th e degree of
reliability and redundancy in the air defence command and control
system is a critical factor.
Th e overall structure of AD operations is as shown below.

Th e IAF air defence system is structured to allow:

� Wide-area surveillance coverage and control capability.

� High degree of control of national airspace and the tactical
battle area.

� An ability to infl ict high attrition on the enemy.

� Suffi cient system redundancy to ensure that battle damage will
not signifi cantly hamper sensor, data exchange or command
and control functions.

###### PRIORITIES IN AIR DEFENCE
Th e aim of AD is to suitably defend relevant airspace and assets, and
in this process, also infl ict maximum attrition on the enemy. Should
this be achieved, the adversary’s capability to concentrate eff ort in
subsequent raids would be reduced and he would be dissuaded from
carrying out future attacks. Consequently, the damage sustained by
friendly forces and facilities would also be reduced. Th is then should
guide the force structuring and related operational art. Th e emphasis
should be on causing maximum attrition by means of an active air
defence network.
**Principles of AD. Th e four employment principles applicable when**
planning for active AD are: mass, mix, mobility and integration. Th e
control and reporting (C&R) structure must be able to eff ectively
handle a number of AD units, i.e. “mass”, and also a “mix” of airborne
and ground-based weapon systems. Th e C&R system should be at the
same time responsive to the changing tactical situation, which involves
“mobility” and “fl exibility”. Finally, all the elements need to be integrated
to provide a layered and in depth coverage.
**Airspace Control. Airspace control is a combination of airspace**
organisation and planning procedures to achieve eff ective control and
coordination minimise risks and permit effi cient and fl exible use of
airspace by all the elements involved in joint air, land and sea operations.
While airspace control promotes greater fl exibility of operations, the
authority to approve, disapprove or deny combat operations is vested


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

in only one operational commander. Th is would signifi cantly reduce
chances of fratricide.

**Methods of Airspace Control.** Th ere are two basic methods of
exercising airspace control:

� **Positive Control.** Positive airspace control employs electronic
elements for the positive identifi cation, tracking and directing
of aircraft within given airspace. Radar is the primary means of
exercising such control, though other sensors such as IFF can also
be employed. Th ese sensors need to be integrated with control
centres through real time reliable, secure and jam-resistant
communications. Data link will further strengthen the capability.
Only such integration can achieve the positive identifi cation of
platforms and avoidance of fratricide.

� **Procedural Control. Procedural airspace control is a system of**
airspace control, which relies on a combination of previously,
agreed and promulgated orders and procedures. Procedural
airspace control includes techniques such as segmenting the
airspace by volume and time and/or the use of weapon control
orders. This method is more restrictive than positive air-space
control, but is less vulnerable to interference by electronic
means and physical attack. It however does ensure continuity of
operations under adverse environmental conditions, and must
always be available as an immediate fall-back system should the
positive control be degraded, or when positive control is not
considered appropriate for the operation at hand.

###### CONTROL AND REPORTING
Success in AD engagements depends, to a large extent, on the ability
to detect an attack at the earliest possible. Th e defender must be aware
of an impending attack in good time so as to be able to alert his own
forces, to neutralise the eff ects of surprise and to prevent the enemy
from concentrating his attack in time and space. ‘Early Warning’ is the
generic phrase that encompasses the means for doing this and they can


-----

the air campaigns

be split into two distinct categories; ground-based systems and airborne
early warning (AEW). AEW off ers far greater fl exibility, signifi cantly
larger early warning and the ability to intercept incoming threats at far
greater distances, compared to ground-based systems, thus enhancing
the level of attrition infl icted on the enemy. In eff ect, with AWACS
aircraft, area defence becomes much more eff ective and at the same
time provides greater in depth defence and a favourable force-to-space
ratio.
Th e integration of a number of diverse sensor systems is necessary
for achieving an eff ective level of early warning. Layered surveillance
operations provide for the optimum use of sensor systems. Airborne,
ship/ground based radars and mobile observation posts (MOPs) should
be interconnected with links capable of rapidly transmitting electronic
data, as well as voice information. Secure digital links are necessary for
achieving this. Civilian radars can not only assist in correlating civil
traffi c but also contribute eff ectively towards strengthening the AD
network with additional sensors and redundancy. Naval air defence
radars, whether the ships are in port or at sea, and army radars in the
tactical battle area, can also contribute signifi cantly towards building
a comprehensive air picture. Interoperability at the architectural level
would be the key issue. Adequate systemic checks and fi ltering of
information on a need to know basis, must be built into the architecture
to avoid any overload of information at the respective levels of AD
command and control.
**Communications. Th e eff ectiveness of an AD system depends on an**
integrated and secure communications network which can meet the
imperatives of the network centric warfare of the future. Without
reliable communications, even the most carefully developed system
will be ineff ective. All links, from aircraft to ship or shore, from an
operations centre to a SAM battery or from the senior to subordinate
commanders, must be completely reliable and secure. Communication
links consist of a combination of satellite, landline, optical, microwave
and HF networks. Such communication networks must be built around


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

a reliable media architecture which has the capacity and capability
to carry data, voice, images, video, etc., in digital mode for real time
transmission and usage.
**Electronic Warfare.** AD operations are especially vulnerable to EW
because of their reliance on the sensors to provide information in an
accurate and complete form and for that information to be communicated
in real-time. Air defence radars and associated equipment, therefore,
must be designed for resistance to EW measures. Irrespective of the
availability of ECCM, standard operating procedures (SOPs) should
assume that operations will be conducted in a hostile EW environment
and suitable training for the same must be an integral part of peacetime
activity and training exercises.

###### WEAPON SYSTEMS
An air defence weapon system will normally consist of two
complementary components, fi ghter aircraft and surface-to-air
defences.

� **Fighter Aircraft . Fighter aircraft have limited individual endurance**
(this now can be increased through AAR) and they cannot be rearmed, re-crewed or serviced in the air (though most modern
ASFs are heavily armed for increased endurance / range and hence
number of engagements). However, they are fl exible and reusable
and can be switched to tasks other than air defence, should the
operational situation demand it. Fighter aircraft are also mobile
and can be used to protect large areas or be concentrated rapidly to
counter enemy saturation raids. Th ey can be used for the following
types of tasks:

� **Interception. An intercept mission may involve the scramble**
of fi ghters from a high state of readiness, or the redirection
of aircraft from previously launched combat air patrols.
Interceptions can be carried out autonomously or with the
assistance of AD radars.


-----

the air campaigns

� **Combat Air Patrol (CAP). Combat air patrols are mounted in**
an objective area over a force: that needs protection; over the
critical area in a combat zone or over an air defence area, for the
purpose of intercepting and destroying hostile aircraft before
they reach their targets. Air eff ort for AD cover under such
circumstances must be carried out judiciously; otherwise it can
lead to a waste of air eff ort. Th e availability of AWACS / aerostats
can off set the limited availability of radar cover at low altitudes
inside the enemy territory. Combat air patrols traditionally are
defensive in nature and sustaining them, particularly at long
range and over long periods, can absorb a great deal of eff ort,
hence they should be used with prudence. However, with air to
air refuelling and AWACS cover, they have become signifi cantly
more potent and can be strategically employed well forward to
enhance air dominance capability.

� **Surface-to-Air Defences. Surface-to-air defences consist of surface**
to air missiles (SAMs) and anti aircraft artillery (AAA). Th ese
defences allow a state of high readiness to be maintained over long

Live fi ring of Pechora SAM-III Surface to Air Missile

periods, enable quick response (including fi ring a large number of
weapons in a relatively short period of time) and in certain cases
can be used to counter ballistic missiles as well. Th ey have limited
range and low mobility compared to fi ghter aircraft and therefore,
relatively large numbers of surface to air defence systems would be
required to defend anything other than point targets. However, the
IAF is moving towards area defence with induction of long range
surface to air weapons. Th e concept of multilayered point defence
will shift to networked area defence with high priority targets being
protected by multiple weapons providing multi tier defence.

###### IFF AND FRATRICIDE
Fratricide could become signifi cant in any future war. Th ough reducing
fratricide is desirable, eliminating it may not be entirely possible.
Fratricide occurs for various reasons such as misidentifi cation,
inexperience and lack of command and control. While inexperience
could be countered by training and inadequacy in command and
control by better coordination among the various AD elements/
services, reliable and foolproof identifi cation friend or foe (IFF) is still
a necessity. SAMs and AAA have their own problems of IFF. With the
multiplicity of SAM systems being inducted into the three services
compatibility of IFF system needs to be ensured to avoid fratricide as
well as to gain maximum operational benefi ts.

###### OFFENSIVE AIR DEFENCE
An overall defensive posture has been the traditional approach to air
defence. Th e acquisition of ASF aircraft and technologies such as BVR /
AAR / Aerostat / AEW / AWACS / RPAs / IACCS, necessitates a macro
shift in as much that air defence tasks be taken to the enemy’s air space
instead of waiting for his aircraft and weapons to enter own airspace.
Th us the entire philosophy of AD needs to shift from the reactive–
defensive approach to off ensive. Th e aircraft, supporting control and
reporting structures of AD can be employed very eff ectively with an


-----

the air campaigns

off ensive outlook to the defensive tasks. Th is would imply placing
the AD assets literally in the enemy air space under AWACS control
to tackle the enemy air power at the earliest and create conditions for
achieving air dominance.

###### RESPONSIBILITY FOR AIR DEFENCE
Th e overall responsibility for the air defence of the country as per the
Union War Book has been vested in the IAF, both for the combat zone
as well as in other areas including the island territories and off shore
installations. Th e defence of the airspace at sea within the limits of
ADIZs except the AD of naval assets at sea also rests with the IAF.
Th e AD of naval assets at sea, within the ADIZ or outside is a naval
responsibility except when specifi c assistance is sought from the IAF.
Air HQ is the highest authority with the ultimate responsibility for AD
of the country. Because of India’s large size, this responsibility has been
further delegated to operational air commands, who exercise operational
control over all AD forces within their respective geographical area
of responsibility. Air Command HQ, either directly or through Air
Defence Control Centres (ADCCs), where established, lays down
broad policies, lays down operating instructions and procedures and
is responsible for training and operational preparedness of all C & R
and AD elements under their command and control. During war, Air
Command HQ exercises operational control over all C&R and AD forces
including those from other commands / services, operating within its
area of responsibility. Th ese capabilities would need to mesh with a
futuristic Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) to provide an integrated and
comprehensive AD coverage of the nation.
Whilst AD operations may be executed jointly by the IAF and the
army/navy, the overall responsibility for air defence would always rest
with the IAF. Th e army and the navy look to their integral air defence
weapons for the protection of vital assets and formations from aerial
attack. Th e reality is that these weapons are self-defence weapons designed
to sanitise an immediate airspace and while they need the support of


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

surveillance, data transfer and command and control systems, they
are not focused on the AD of the entire nation. Th ey cannot therefore
exercise an all-encompassing control over the usage of airspace, which
is the primary function of a balanced AD system. Naval and land forces
can signifi cantly enhance the defensive depth and the level of attrition
on the attacking enemy aircraft but, they can do so only if they are fully
integrated within the AD system as a whole. Failure to integrate would
invite disastrous consequences in war in terms of fratricide.

###### DOCTRINAL PRECEPTS
Th e major doctrinal lessons of counter air campaign operations are
listed below:

� Control of the air is vital for the success of, not only air operations
but also for the success of virtually all types of surface and subsurface operations.

� To achieve the required degree of control of the air, a dedicated air
campaign is necessary to neutralise enemy air power.

� Suppression/destruction of enemy air defences is of crucial
importance in the counter air campaign, especially against a
modern air force.

� Even in a generally hostile air situation, it is possible to achieve a
favourable air situation, temporarily, for specifi c operations.

� Th e relationship between the off ensive and defensive components
of the counter air campaign is dynamic and complementary and
the emphasis on one or the other depends on a variety of factors.

###### INTRODUCTION
Th e strategic aim of the counter surface force campaign is to deprive
the enemy of the military power required to occupy, control or exploit
territory or sea space. Counter surface force action involves the use
of air power, in cooperation with friendly surface forces to deter,
contain, neutralise or defeat the enemy’s army and/or navy. Th e ability
to prosecute a counter surface force campaign eff ectively will depend
heavily on the success of the counter air campaign and invariably these
two campaigns will be closely integrated.

###### AIR LAND OPERATIONS
Th e inherent speed and reach of combat air power enables rapid
engagement of enemy ground targets across the length and breadth
of the battlefi eld. Air land operations include the following air power
roles:

� Air Interdiction

� Battlefi eld Air Interdiction (BAI)

� Battlefi eld Air Strike (BAS)

� Tactical Reconnaissance

� Search and Strike

Air operations in an air-land battle should be so designed that they
either deny the enemy the ability to concentrate forces in time and
space, or facilitate the rapid momentum of own advance. Th e extended
reach of air power and its ability to circumvent massed forces and target
crucial vulnerabilities in depth provides us with the vital capability to
control the force, space and time dimensions of warfare and it is in
these dimensions that air power produces the desired eff ect.
Generally speaking, air power contributes to the land battle in one
of three ways. Firstly, by attacking enemy ground forces, which are
actually engaged in combat with friendly surface forces. Th is activity
is termed Battlefi eld Air Strikes (BAS). Secondly, by attacking enemy
forces, which are in the vicinity of the battlefi eld, and may be closing
in to join the ground battle in the immediate future. Th ese air attacks
would take place a short distance behind the battle area and would seek
to have both a direct and speedy impact on shaping the battlefi eld. Th ese
are known as Battlefi eld Air Interdiction, or BAI. Air Interdiction or AI
involves the targeting of strategic reserves, reinforcements and re-supply
of the entire battle space up to several hundred kilometres behind the
front line. Th ese three operations are designed to infl uence a limited
area of operations, and though they are usually cited as examples of the
tactical use of air power, they have the potential to create a ‘strategic
eff ect’. A typical example is the impact of air interdiction operations by


-----

the air campaigns

the Allied Forces against Rommel’s Afrika Corps and its overall impact
on the strategic contours of the North Africa campaign during World
War II.

###### AIR INTERDICTION
Th e aim of these operations is to cut off the battlefi eld from strategic
reserves and essential supplies as well as prevent or delay the enemy’s
strategic reserves/strike corps and crucial supplies from reaching their
point of application, deny the enemy the options that he needs to employ
his off ensive elements from the countervailing position, degrade his
sustenance capability and his off ensive potential in the battlefi eld, and
prevent the enemy from moving in and out of the battlefi eld, thereby
denying him strategic space to manoeuvre. Air interdiction operations
therefore are designed to destroy, neutralise or delay the enemy’s
strategic military potential before it is eff ectively brought to bear in the
battlefi eld.
Th ese missions are conducted at such distances from friendly forces
that their detailed integration with own troops is not necessary. For
men and equipment, transit routes would be along established lines of
communication. Similarly, material also has to fl ow from its source to
the front over these communication lines. Any air operations designed
to slow down or inhibit this fl ow of men and material to the battlefi eld
is termed as air interdiction. Interdiction targets include the enemy’s
strategic reserves and his supplies and the means by which his forces
and provisions are moved. In other words, air interdiction prevents the
**enemy from moving in or out of the battlefi eld. Typical targets would**
include troop and vehicle concentrations, supply trains and convoys,
amphibious forces, strategic ammunition dumps, communication
centres, bridges, railways and waterways.
Air interdiction is the best means of exploiting the reach of air
power as it can strike the enemy where he is most vulnerable and forces
him to extend his air defences over a greater area. Th e capacity of air
interdiction for disruption, diversion and, particularly, delay can produce


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

decisive eff ects. Th e greater the enemy land force’s need for supplies and
reinforcement, the more eff ective air interdiction is likely to be. It can
have a major impact on an enemy army conducting an intensive, highly
mobile battle. Th is will also be true for a retreating enemy too, where
the synergy between air and land force off ensive action is most likely to
yield decisive results. However, there is inevitably a delay between an air
interdiction attack and its eff ects being felt at the battle front. Moreover,
the eff ects of air interdiction are cumulative, and to be fully eff ective, air
interdiction should be undertaken for an extended period.
Joint planning by land and air forces is key to eff ective interdiction
operations. Th is plan should set out the degree of neutralisation
required, when desired, and the relative priority of the tasks. Based
on this guidance, the air force executes the air interdiction campaign.
Timely and accurate intelligence is a prerequisite to successful
interdiction. Strategic analysis can identify vulnerable elements in the
enemy’s forces. Th e air commander must be aware of the extent of the
enemy’s communication lines, the time it takes for his forces/supplies
to reach the battle area and the points where personnel and material
will most likely gather for departure or arrival. Th ese concentration
points, whether supply depots/storage areas, troop staging areas, or
transportation centres where re-routeing and reloading are done, will
be the most lucrative targets. Th e same eff ect could also be achieved
by isolating the battlefi eld by targeting the communication lines and
preventing movement.

###### BATTLEFIELD AIR INTERDICTION (BAI)
Battlefi eld Air Interdiction is defi ned as air action carried out against
hostile land targets, which are in a position to directly aff ect the friendly
forces and which require joint planning and co-ordination, but do not
require intimate synchronisation with the fi re and movement of own
forces. Th e basic diff erence between BAI and BAS lies in the proximity
of targets to friendly forces and the control arrangements that are
therefore needed. BAI attacks are conducted **to delay, destroy or**


-----

the air campaigns

**neutralise enemy forces, in the battlefi eld, that are not yet in contact**
**with friendly land forces. Th ese operations may be used to isolate the**
**enemy forces in the battle zone from his essential reinforcements**
**and supplies and to restrict his freedom to manoeuvre. BAI missions**
are planned against targets usually beyond the limit of friendly artillery
fi re. Because they are conducted away from the confusion of the active
battle front, they are potentially the most eff ective form of air support.
Th e advantages of BAI operations over BAS are that these operations
have a wider area of infl uence, target identifi cation is relatively easy,
targets are less likely to be defended well, chances of fratricide are lower
and the targets are likely to be more vulnerable.
Th e objectives of BAI operations are to shape the battlefi eld by:

� Isolating the battle zone from critical supplies and reinforcements.

� Denying the enemy freedom of space to manoeuvre by attacking
crucial lines of communication

� Degrading the enemy’s off ensive potential, and rendering him
incapable of taking meaningful off ensive action.

� Preventing the enemy from reaching decisive locations and launch
pads to further their off ensive.

###### BATTLEFIELD AIR STRIKES (BAS)
Battlefi eld Air Strikes are the air actions
carried out against enemy targets in the
close vicinity of own ground forces and
require not only joint planning but close
coordination with the fi re and movement
of own forces. Aircraft could be employed

MiG-27 on a BAI mission

eff ectively, where the situation is becoming
critical, response time requirement is less or targets are inaccessible or
invulnerable to the army’s organic fi re power. Th e ground commander
must play a key role in determining where BAS is to be employed.
However, the air commander must be the fi nal authority to decide on
the employment of air assets keeping in mind the overall air situation.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

Limited air assets imply that BAS should be employed primarily in critical
operations and not frittered away in penny packets. BAS are meant to be
employed quickly and decisively, and concentrated in space and time.
However, BAS have their own limitations. Th ese include problems in
target acquisition and identifi cation, diffi culty in identifying the bomb
line, lethal AD environment, jamming of communication between strike
pilots and the FAC and high probability of fratricide.

###### RELATIONSHIP OF BAS WITH OTHER AIR OPERATIONS
Th e greater the ‘degree of control of the air’, the greater the range of
options available for undertaking BAS operations. Suppression of
enemy air defences in the TBA is vital for unhindered BAS. Both air
and ground commanders must contribute the necessary fi repower and
EW assets to achieve this. Th e eff ectiveness of interdiction operations
in disrupting the enemy supply routes, limiting reinforcement of enemy
ground forces and destroying/neutralising follow on echelons will
infl uence the size and intensity of BAS requirements. Th e importance
of tactical reconnaissance by both air force and army sensors can assist
in identifying the right targets.


-----

the air campaigns

###### EMPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS
Th ese are as follows:

� **High Th reat Tactics. A heavy concentration of AAA and SAMs may**
inhibit eff ective air operations over the target area, necessitating the
use of sensor fused and loitering weapons that can be dropped from
outside the SAM and AAA envelope.

� **Air Space Management. Th e need for continuous operation**
of organic fi repower in the battlefi eld area will require detailed
procedures for integration with BAS missions and incorporation of
eff ective IFF systems.

� **Communication Jamming. Normal radio communications may be**
denied, requiring procedures for control/clearance for BAS strikes
with little or no radio communications. Secure and jam proof
communications between the pilot and the Forward Air Controller
(FAC) are therefore essential for executing BAS missions.

� **Night/Adverse Weather BAS.** Providing adequate support to
ground forces at night or in adverse weather is a challenging task
and necessitates the availability of night vision devices and night
targeting capability.

� **Requirement of Surgical Accuracy. Taking into account the close**
proximity of own troops with the BAS target systems and the likely
small target dimensions, it may be necessary to execute strikes with
precision weapons. Th e designation could be carried out by the
RPAs, by the delivery aircraft itself, or from ground by FACs with
the help of portable laser designation systems.

� **Importance of Forward Air Controllers.** For successful conduct
of BAS, it is essential to train a large number of personnel as FACs.
Th e manpower would be provided by both the army and the IAF.
Th erefore, during peacetime it must be ensured that selected cadres
undergo realistic training. In addition interoperability of equipment
has to be ensured for eff ective utilisation of FACs on ground. It is
pertinent to note that a well-trained and motivated FAC can make
the crucial diff erence in any critical situation on ground.

###### ARMED/ATTACK ROLES OF HELICOPTERS IN BAI/BAS MISSIONS

Helicopters could be used eff ectively in BAI / BAS missions. Major
tasks of armed/attack helicopters are:

� To provide suppressive fi re options to the ground troops. Th is would
be useful in conditions where artillery or the ground attack eff ort
is either not available or is likely to be less eff ective. On account of
the helicopters’ variable speed and hover capabilities, engagement
of surface targets in various situations would be highly eff ective.

� To provide fl ank protection to mechanised formations.

� To provide route cover and suppressive fi re to heliborne assaults to
create a favourable ground situation.

� To provide air defence cover against enemy armed or attack
helicopters.

� To engage enemy helicopters involved in troop carriage,
reconnaissance and communication duties.

� To interdict targets in the close vicinity of the TBA.


-----

the air campaigns

� To neutralise radar sites located close to the border.

� To neutralise bridges used by the enemy for breaking out.

###### FUTURE PROSPECTS OF HELICOPTER OPERATIONS
Keeping in mind the changing modern battlefi eld, the helicopter fl eet
of the IAF may be entrusted with the following roles in the future:

� Urban warfare, involving precise deployment and extrication of highly
specialised troops from congested and densely populated areas.

� Covert operations within enemy territory using night vision
devices, infrared systems and stealth techniques.

� Counter surface force operations in conjunction with special
forces.

� High altitude operations including operations in low light
conditions.

� Rapid movement of forces within the theatre.

###### TACTICAL RECONNAISSANCE
Collection of intelligence through the medium of airborne sensors in
the tactical area is termed as tactical reconnaissance. Tactical recce
information pertains to the disposition, composition, location, activities
and movement of the enemy forces over land or sea. Timely response
to such intelligence information is possible only if the evaluation and
dissemination of tactical recce output is in near real time. Such a recce
could also provide damage evaluation and is obtained through a broad
spectrum of sensors employed on fi ghter aircraft, RPAs and satellites
that range from high resolution cameras to synthetic aperture radars
and infra-red (IR) detection sensors. A good C[3]I network will enable
real time dissemination of tactical recce intelligence.

###### SEARCH AND STRIKE
Air power is an option that may be exercised under conditions of air
superiority, with or without FACs. Th ese missions are meant to locate
and attack enemy targets such as material, personnel and facilities. Th ey


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

are also useful in attacking opportunity targets under close control in
dynamic situations.

###### MARITIME AIR OPERATIONS
The IAF would be employed in close cooperation with Indian naval
forces including naval aviation assets to undertake maritime air
operations. Control of IAF aircraft would be exercised by HQ Maritime
Air Operations in coordination with the Indian Navy. In the maritime
realm, air power has the potential to operate deep, achieve surprise and
bring to bear accurate fi repower against maritime targets at considerable
distances from advancing naval forces with speed. Air power could also
be tasked to exert passive and oft en compelling psychological force on
an adversary merely through the conduct of routine aerial activities
like surveillance and patrolling. Air superiority fi ghters on CAP, fi ghter
sweep or free escorting duties could have a profound deterrent eff ect on
the adversary in the maritime domain.
Th e IAF can be called upon to carry out the following maritime air
roles:

� **Anti-Shipping Strikes. In the Indian context, detection and**
identifi cation of maritime targets is the responsibility of the Indian navy.
Th ereaft er, IAF aircraft would be integrated to carry out anti shipping
strikes. Th ese strikes would be carried out in conjunction with maritime
reconnaissance (MR) aircraft of the navy, supported by other naval ships
or aircraft against enemy’s naval assets in the vicinity of own naval forces.
Secure communications between the strike and the support aircraft are
essential for a successful strike. AWACS aircraft would considerably
enhance the eff ectiveness of maritime air operations.

� **Maritime Strike. Unlike anti shipping strikes, where enemy naval**
forces are in contact, during maritime strikes, air power is applied
against enemy naval targets that are not in contact with friendly
forces, but pose an indirect or long term threat. Th ese strikes could
include enemy naval facilities on shore as well as naval vessels and
installations in harbour and maritime patrol aircraft on ground.

**Aerial Patrolling. Th e aerial patrolling of sea lines of communications**
is a task that is normally carried out by maritime patrol aircraft of
the Indian navy. However, there is a possibility that this eff ort will be
supplemented by multi-crew IAF aircraft like SU-30 MKI that have an
extended reach and loitering capability.

**Reach of Land Based Air Power. Aerial refuelling would signifi cantly**
increase the reach of land-based air power, thereby adding fl exibility
and eff ectiveness for engaging maritime targets. While modernity
of platforms is important, they must be regarded as only a means to
operational ends and the ends are the eff ects produced by weapons.
Modern ship AD defences are potent and constantly improving. It
is therefore logical to attack naval vessels with fi re-and-forget ASMs
from long stand-off distances well outside the range of the ship AD
systems.

###### DOCTRINAL PRECEPTS
Th e following doctrinal lessons emerge from the history of counter
surface force operations.

� Some degree of control of air is necessary to execute counter surface
force missions.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

� Counter surface force air action can be used either to supplement
or as a substitute for surface force action.

� Except in crisis situations, BAI prevails over BAS in exploiting the
inherent capabilities of combat air power.

� Organic AD weapons of ground forces must be integrated into the
overall IAF AD network to avoid fratricide.

� Lack of tactical recce capability adversely aff ects the conduct of
counter surface force operations.

� Counter surface force air action works best when used in direct
cooperation with friendly surface operations, and where the enemy
is forced to expose and manoeuvre his forces under fi re.

� Air attack against surface forces is particularly eff ective when an
enemy is hampered by geographical restrictions, such as being
forced to operate without cover (as in a desert situation), or being
forced to traverse narrow defi les, causeways or roads bordering
inhospitable terrain.

� Air attacks have a profound impact on ground troops, oft en out of
proportion to the physical damage and destruction caused.

� Command of air forces must be retained at the highest practicable
level and that too under an air force commander.

� Synergy between air and surface operations produces maximum
eff ect, especially if they are planned jointly.

� Th e nation’s and in turn the navy’s out of area contingency capability,
at least for the present, is limited to the regional maritime domain.
If planned and employed optimally in concert with carrier borne
air power of the IN, the IAF’s land based air power is more than
capable of meeting regional out of area requirements of the nation.

##### SECTION III

###### STRATEGIC AIR CAMPAIGN

_It is not necessary for an air force, in order to defeat an enemy_

_nation, to defeat its armed forces fi rst. Air power can dispense with_

_that intermediate step, can pass over the enemy navies and armies,_

_penetrate the air defences and attack direct the centres of production,_

— Viscount Trenchard

###### INTRODUCTION
Strategic air operations are designed to target the enemy’s capability
to fi ght or his will to resist. In the context of short-duration wars,
strategic targets have to be identifi ed and neutralised so as to weaken
the adversary’s capability to wage war and to put him under pressure to
achieve the desired political objectives. JFC Fuller the noted historian
has identifi ed three dimensions of war: the physical, the mental and the
moral. Physical implies the fi ghting power or the means to fi ght, mental
relates to the thinking power, and the moral dimension indicates the
staying power or the motivation of the men to fi ght. A strategic air
campaign targets these dimensions at the strategic level to achieve the
desired impact.
The strategic level deals with the overall conduct of war and
includes those critical capabilities that constitute national power.
The critical capabilities at the strategic level include moral strength,
leadership, economic and technological muscle and the armed
forces. The classification of an offensive air operation as ‘strategic’
is not determined by range, platform type or the weaponry used,
but is determined by the objective or the purpose served by the
neutralising of a particular target. It is the objective and it’s effect


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

on the course of the war that determines whether an attack is
strategic or not. Technology now enables all combat systems
and elements to be deemed as strategic or tactical depending on
their intended objective. The distinction is based on the target’s
importance for achieving the commander’s objective rather than
on the nature of the target itself. Thus, communication nets, fielded
forces, oil refineries and transportation systems have a strategic or
tactical implication depending on the desired outcome. Air power
is inherently strategic in nature and its tactical application would
only fritter away its prime advantage of creating strategic effects.

###### CONVENTIONAL STRATEGIC AIR OPERATIONS
Conventional strategic air operations could be used effectively
both during crises and war situations. During the former, threat of
punitive action or actual punitive strikes serves to project power,
and sends the desired political signals. However, should the enemy
have the capability to retaliate, own defences have to be strong
enough to counter the retaliatory action. During war, conventional
strategic air operations have the desired strategic influence on the
operations of the army, navy and the air force, provided the targets
are chosen correctly.

**Target Selection. Targets would need to be prioritized, keeping in**
mind their impact at the strategic level. Th e following target systems
merit consideration:

� **Command and Control. Th e enemy’s command and control nodes**
are vital targets for paralysing leadership and consequently, erode
combat eff ectiveness. Reliable intelligence would be a pre-requisite
for locating key target systems such as communication centres
and other vital structures in the command hierarchy. Successful
attacks on vital command and control nodes would yield the most
immediate results in war as compared to attacks on other strategic
target systems. Th ey would also serve to isolate the military from
the commanders in the fi eld, leaving them without guidance and
breaking their cohesiveness.

� **Industrial Infrastructure/Vital Economic Targets.** Targets such
as oil installations and power generation facilities could have a
crucial impact on morale and on the enemy’s capability to sustain
war. Industries that have direct military connotation such as
ammunition/ordnance factories and research establishments too
would be strategic targets. Th e eff ect produced by these attacks


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

would be proportionately less in case of short duration wars, as
there could be suitable reserves to overcome immediate shortages.

� **Transportation Systems.** Th e transportation system of any
nation is extremely vital for sustaining its war eff ort. Destruction
or disruption of the same would isolate the enemy forces in the
battlefi eld and prevent them from launching and sustaining
off ensive operations. Care should be taken in target selection and
alternate transportation networks must also be made inoperative.

� **Fielded Forces in Depth. In a conventional confl ict, fi elded forces in**
depth off er signifi cant security to commanders in terms of reserves.
Vulnerable targets in such locations, if degraded, can diminish the
war fi ghting potential and provide a strategic advantage in the
overall campaign.

**Selection of Weapon Systems.** Conventional strategic air operations
can be undertaken by manned aircraft and missile systems. Th e relative
advantages of these weapons systems need to be considered before
deciding on the target to weapon matching. Th e cost-eff ectiveness,
fl exibility and greater accuracy of manned aircraft in combination with
PGMs favour their use. Sustained levels of readiness, a high degree of
pre-launch survivability, especially with mobile launchers, diffi culty of
interception during fl ight and therefore, a high probability of reaching
the target and the rapid improvements in navigation/guidance systems
favour the employment of SSMs. Ideally an optimum combination of
the two would have to be employed in practice.

###### TYPES OF CONVENTIONAL STRATEGIC AIR OPERATIONS
Th e following types of conventional strategic air operations are
envisaged:

� **Strategic Bombing. It seeks to attain strategic military objectives**
independently. Air strikes against selected targets such as industrial
infrastructure, power grids and communication networks would
fall in this category.


-----

the air campaigns

� **Political Signalling. The mere threat of conventional air strikes**
or enforcement of no fly zones provides governments with
a flexible and responsive instrument of crisis management. It
enables them to send the desired political signals regarding
their intent and determination to deter impending aggression
threaten escalation or eliminate specific enemy capabilities or
facilities.

� **Psychological Operations (Psy Ops). Th ese are designed to change**
the attitude and behaviour of the armed combatants and also of the
civilian population. Psychological operations directly focus on the
moral dimension of the war and are intended to weaken the enemy’s
will to fi ght. Off ensive air action could also be employed as part of
psy ops.

###### NUCLEAR AIR OPERATIONS
Nuclear weapons are used to convey political signals and are the ultimate
national safeguard and deterrence. Th e authority to decide whether to
exercise the nuclear option rests at the highest political level. India’s
no fi rst use policy is based on minimum but credible deterrence that
promises assured and massive retaliation. As part of this strategy, IAF
could provide credible second strike capability.

###### STRATEGIC EFFECT IN SUB-CONVENTIONAL OPS
In recent times there is an increasing focus on the strategic impact
of air power even in sub-conventional warfare. A classic example
of air power creating a ‘strategic effect’ has been _Op Geronimo:_
undertaken by the US to eliminate Osama Bin Laden. It was
air power that facilitated stealthy and speedy execution of the
mission. Not only do these operations validate the ability of air
power to create a strategic effect across the spectrum of conflict,
they also reinforce all its classic attributes of speed, flexibility and
surprise.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

###### DOCTRINAL PRECEPTS
Th e following doctrinal aspects are relevant for strategic air
operations:

� Targets for strategic air attacks need to be carefully chosen and
must have a direct link with the enemy’s strategy or his decision
making process; the neutralisation of these targets should lead to
the desired strategic infl uence.

� Th e strategic air campaign can be carried out independent of other
air and land campaigns; however, it tends to be much more eff ective
when fully integrated with the overall campaign plans.

� Air superiority is desirable for conducting such operations; however,
surprise and deception may also yield decisive results.

� Strategic air operations are mostly determined by political
considerations unlike counter air or counter surface force
operations.

� Strategic air operations straddle the spectrum of confl ict.

### Combat Enabling Air Campaigns

_However, no amount of modernisation of arms, equipment, tactics, and_

_organisations can produce results unless we have the right state of mind,_

_manning the system._

— General K Sundarji

**Defi nition. Combat enabling operations are those that are undertaken**
to sustain the combat power of air or surface combat forces. Combat
power can be enhanced by the elements of mobility, surprise, lethality,
accuracy, survivability, availability or fl exibility of air and surface
forces.
**Sustaining Combat Power.** If air operations are to be successful,
they need to be sustained and supported by dedicated air and ground
activities termed as ‘combat enabling air and ground operations’ which
are as follows:

� **Combat Enabling Air Operations.**

##### SECTION I

###### COMBAT ENABLING AIR OPERATIONS

 AIR TRANSPORTED OPERATIONS
Th ese are operations that involve the movement by air of personnel and
cargo through fi xed wing or rotary aircraft within and between theatres
of operations.

###### CATEGORIES OF AIR TRANSPORTED OPERATIONS

� **Strategic Airlift . A strategic airlift is the carriage of passengers or**
cargo between theatres (inter-theatre), or to any place within an
area of interest. Th e movement of Indian troops by air from the
eastern to the western theatre in 1971 and the Maldives operation
in 1988 are examples of strategic airlift .

� **Tactical Airlift . A tactical airlift is the carriage of passengers and**
cargo within a theatre (intra-theatre). Tactical airlift is resorted to
for rapid and responsive movement within an area of operations to
meet specifi c tactical goals.

**Composition of Force. Th e IAF transport fl eet maintains a capability**
for both strategic and tactical airlift s. Fixed-wing aircraft have higher
transit speeds, carry heavier loads, are more reliable and are far cheaper
to operate as compared to rotary wing aircraft . However, helicopters
have the capability to land anywhere, and because of their greater ability
to utilise terrain masking, they have greater survivability in a combat
zone. Th us, both are necessary in the overall air transport force mix.
**Use of Civil Resources. Civil airlines could also be pressed into service**
in war or crisis situations as was the case during the airlift ing of the
IPKF to Sri Lanka. Th e problems of employing civil aircraft are:

� **Cargo. Indian carriers generally do not operate any dedicated cargo**
aircraft excluding those on lease. Th erefore, they may need to be
modifi ed to be used for cargo purposes.


-----

combat enabling air campaigns

� **Infrastructure. Modern civil aircraft need appropriate ground**
infrastructure as well as special ground equipment.

� **Trained Aircrew. Civil air crews lack a military orientation which**
inhibits full exploitation of civil aircraft . Air force personnel too
may not be able to exploit these assets as they may not be trained to
operate these aircraft .

###### HELICOPTERS
Th e employment of helicopters has the following advantages:

� Fixed wing aircraft require proper strips and the use of helicopters
saves engineering eff ort, especially in wet climates where it is
diffi cult to make all weather landing strips.

� Troops and equipment can be delivered direct into action, thereby
doing away with the need for ground lines of communication from
airheads.

� Time is saved by carrying under slung loads as elaborate load
lashing is not necessary.

� It is easier to conceal helicopters and helipads than airstrips.

Air transported operations for the IAF comprise of fi ve major
roles:

� Airborne Operations.

� Airborne Assault.

� Air Landed Operations.

� Special Heli-Borne Operations (SHBO).

� Air Maintenance.

� Scheduled Services.

� Special Air Operations.

� Casualty Evacuation.

**Airborne Operations. Airborne operations involve the movement of**
combat forces and their logistic support in an objective area from the
air. Combat forces and their support may be delivered by air landing
or airdrops from a fi xed or rotary wing aircraft . If, on despatch from
the supporting aircraft, the forces are required to immediately engage
in combat, they could carry out a parachute assault or slither from
a helicopter at hover. On the other hand, forces could be air landed
by fi xed or rotary wing aircraft, and thereaft er join operations in a
nearby objective area. Combat forces delivered into an objective area
normally require subsequent air maintenance support until a surface
link-up is eff ected or withdrawal is accomplished. Some other tasks
of airborne operations include: gaining and maintaining favourable
air situation; reconnaissance and interdiction to isolate the area of
airborne operations; and to provide a high degree of immunity from
enemy interference. Deception would be vital in the planning phase
of any airborne operation and must be made part of the operational
plan. In addition, logistic considerations in terms of fuel and loading
of aircraft as well as the handling capacity of air bases must be kept
in mind. Other important aspects are securing of launch bases from
air and ground attacks and secrecy regarding the nature of airborne
operations. Airborne forces once brought to the launch air bases, must
be kept isolated and secured. Th ey are capable of performing a variety
of tasks, such as:


-----

combat enabling air campaigns

IL-76 taking off for a mission

� **Independent Operations. Operations in which airborne troops**
have tasks independent of immediate ground operations. For
example, the Entebbe rescue or the Maldives operation.

� **Strategic Tasks. Th ese could include capture of an airhead inside**
the enemy territory to serve as a base for further operations or
capture of a strategically important area.

� **Special Tasks**

� **Raids. Th e aim may be the destruction of enemy installations,**
headquarters or individuals. Withdrawal is diffi cult and must
be planned carefully.

� **Guerrilla Operations. Airborne forces can be used to carry out**
widespread guerrilla operations in enemy occupied territory.

� **Tactical Tasks. Th ese involve close cooperation with the ground**
forces and are the most decisive method of using airborne
troops. Th ese operations may involve the following tasks:

� Capture of ground which is not readily accessible to the
surface troops, but is vital to the enemy.

� Seizure of dominating ground or defi les, along the line of
advance.

� Flank protection and blocking of enemy reserves.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

� Seizure of beaches or bridgeheads.

� Attacks to disrupt enemy maintenance areas, signal
communications and Headquarters.

To achieve these tasks, airborne operations could be used to perform
the following three broad roles:

� **Airborne Assault. Airborne assault is a particular phase of an**
airborne operation and is carried out by specially trained units
and formations dropped by parachute or landed by assault aircraft
with their equipment. Airborne
assault transports troops for
immediate operations and has
a considerable shock eff ect on
the enemy. As a result, airborne
forces are capable of producing
results out of proportion to
their numerical strength and
fi re power. A favourable air
situation is essential for success,

AN-32 landing at Daulat Beg Oldie airfi eld (Elevation 16,700 feet)

as is joint staff work, contingency
planning and rigorous combined training. An example of this is the
successful airborne assault by the Indian forces at Tangail during
1971 Indo-Pak war, which led to the collapse of Dhaka’s defences
and a speedy end to the war.

� **Air Landed Operations.** Air landed operations are those where
the troops are landed near their objective by fi xed wing aircraft, or
helicopters. Th ey organise themselves into combat units and then
assault the objective either on foot or on vehicles. A favourable air
situation is a must for undertaking air landed operations since the
troops are particularly vulnerable immediately aft er landing until
they get organised.

� **Special Heliborne Operations (SHBO).** Helicopters are a very,
versatile component of air power. Th ey can induct troops and


-----

combat enabling air campaigns

equipment direct into action. More importantly, they can extricate
them on completion of the task. SHBO operations could include
strikes on enemy targets where the troops either slither down on the
objective, or are landed close to the objective for an assault. Helicopters
can also be utilised to overcome impediments imposed by terrain as
was done during the 1971 Indo-Pak war, where helicopters were used
to form an air bridge over river obstacles in East Pakistan to ferry
troops across in order to maintain the pace of advance.

**Air Maintenance Operations.** Air maintenance includes tasks,
other than airborne operations, conducted to distribute and recover
troops, equipment and supplies. Th ey diff er from airborne operations
in that air maintenance does not usually involve the carriage of troops
ready for immediate combat. Maintenance by air can be divided into
the following main categories:

AN-32 carrying out para drop to sustain troops at high altitude post


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

� **Strategic Air Supply. Th ese are air operations carried out to airlift**
the maintenance requirements of a force in bulk from a main
location to a theatre or from one theatre to another.

� **Tactical Air Supply. Th ese ensure the provision of aerial supplies**
within a theatre either by dropping or by landing. It is further
classifi ed as follows:

� **Routine Air Supply.** Air maintenance carried out as per
scheduled/routine replacing surface mode of maintenance.

� **Emergency Supply.** Th is is resorted to in cases of sudden
operational requirements, e.g. when forces are cut off from
other means of maintenance due to weather or operational
reasons. Time is of vital importance in such cases.

**Scheduled Services. Scheduled air transport services are**
regular, programmed point-to-point air services for movement of
personnel and supplies. Courier services flown by IAF aircraft in
a pre-planned manner to airlift equipment and personnel are one
such example.

**Special Air Operations. Special air operations are conducted,**
at any level of confl ict, to support clandestine and psychological

C-130J taking off on a training mission


-----

operations. Th ese operations include inserting agents or troops into the
enemy occupied territory and may require specialist training such as,
low level ingress and landings by using night vision devices. Some of
these operations may have to be carried out regardless of the total air
situation and under conditions not normally considered suitable for air
operations.

**Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC). Casualty evacuation involves**
the movement of the injured to and between medical treatment facilities
by air transportation. Casualties are evacuated from the combat zone
to a forward casualty clearing area and from there moved to the rear.
Casualty evacuation requires special preparation, training, equipment
and personnel and can be a demanding task. Helicopters are better
suited for tactical CASEVAC though modern transport aircraft like
C-130 and C-17 can be fi tted with equipment to support large-scale
medical evacuation from battle or crisis zones.

###### AIR-TO-AIR REFUELLING (AAR)

 DEFINITION
Air-to-Air refuelling operations involve transfer of fuel from one aircraft
to another in fl ight. Th e Indian Air Force achieved AAR capability in
2003 with the induction of IL-78 tanker aircraft . Th ese wide bodied
aircraft are capable of transporting meaningful loads from one theatre
to another, and can also dispense fuel to receiver aircraft in air without
requiring any major change of confi guration. AAR aircraft considerably
reduce the lead-time and cost of operations and increase the number
of options available for operations. In fact, IL-78s can be utilised for
strategic lift s, para/cargo drops, air landed operations, air maintenance
and CASEVAC apart from their primary role of air-to-air refuelling.
Th ere are essentially three types of air-to-air refuelling methods; probe
and drogue, fl ying boom and buddy refuelling.
**Applications. Air-to-air refuelling capability has particular relevance for**
India. Th e size of the country as well as the protection of its vital national


-----

interests in the island territories make it imperative for the IAF to have
a capability to project its air power from the mainland to these areas
rapidly. Air-to-air refuelling extends the range, payload, time on task
and fl exibility of aircraft . It applies equally to air campaigns as well as to
all types of combat enabling operations. Air-to-air refuelling can be used
to enhance the capabilities of virtually all types of aircraft . In addition,
where the enemy enjoys enormous depth, AAR is indispensable for
reaching a greater number of targets, which otherwise would have been
out of reach. It also causes potential enemies to expend disproportionate
eff ort in defensive measures. It therefore acts as a “force multiplier”
which not only increases the potency of the IAF in war, but also its
deterrent value. Some of the advantages of AAR are:

IL-78 refuelling a pair of Mirage-2000

� **Increased Range. Th e reach of IAF’s strike aircraft has increased**
considerably with the help of AAR. Short-range aircraft can now be
used for deep penetration strikes.

� **Increased Endurance. Combat or combat support air missions can**
be extended in duration up to the limits of crew endurance.

� **Response Time. AD aircraft can be kept airborne for long durations**
thus increasing their ability to respond to intercept requirements
at short notice. Likewise strike aircraft would be able to carry out


-----

combat enabling air campaigns

long range strikes without the need to stage through airfi elds, thus
improving their reaction time.

� **Increased Flexibility. Th e fl exibility of IAF aircraft has increased**
signifi cantly with AAR. Short range combat aircraft can escort
combat or combat support aircraft over longer distances. Aircraft
can take off with a greater weapon load while retaining the
fl exibility in choice of fl ight profi les and tactical routing or even
target selection.

� **Enemy Considerations. Extending the strike range of IAF aircraft**
by AAR would have a greater impact on the enemy who would now
need to expend a disproportionate amount of resources and eff ort
for protecting area in depth.

While air-to-air refuelling off ers signifi cantly enhanced capability
to a force, it nevertheless has important limitations. Th ese are:

� **Vulnerability. An aircraft is** most vulnerable when fuel transfer is
taking place in air. AAR missions must be carefully planned in safe
areas avoiding hostile air environment. Escort aircraft may become
essential to protect the tanker force.

� **Tanker Ground Survivability. Large tankers are very vulnerable**
on ground. Th ey cannot usually be housed in hardened aircraft
shelters nor is it practical to do so. Hence, tankers would have to
be dispersed to airfi elds in depth. However, this would complicate
planning, and underscore the need for eff ective communications.

� **Lead Time. AAR requires special equipment, dedicated aircraft,**
trained crew and well-rehearsed procedures for its effi cient use
during day and night. Such a capability will have to be sustained
and it takes time and planning to organise and sustain the training
status of participants.

###### SURVEILLANCE AND RECONNAISSANCE
Surveillance and reconnaissance operations involve the collection of
information from space-based, airborne, and ground sensors regarding


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

the activities, forces and resources of an enemy or potential enemy.
Th ese operations can be further classifi ed as:

� **Surveillance. Surveillance is the systematic, repetitive gathering of**
information by photographic, radar, infra red, electronic, acoustic
or visual means. Information gained from surveillance would
normally be used for strategic decision making and building data
bases.

� **Reconnaissance.** Aerial reconnaissance is the visual/photo
observation of specifi c targets, interests and areas at a particular time
to gain information about the activities, resources and intentions of
an enemy.

**Diff erence** **Between** **Reconnaissance** **and** **Surveillance.**
Reconnaissance is the collection of information via a specifi c mission,
usually conducted over a limited period of time and directed against
a specifi c target whereas, surveillance is the systematic observation
of areas, or targets over a period of time by any sensor to provide
accurate and timely knowledge of a potential adversary’s capabilities
and intentions. Surveillance and reconnaissance operations encompass
the following roles:

� **Strategic Reconnaissance.** Strategic reconnaissance operations
gather the information necessary for the formulation of policy,
strategy and military plans at the national level. Th e objective of
strategic reconnaissance is the collection of data which builds up a
basic pattern of activity in an area of interest to track any signifi cant
departures or trends. Satellites provide an extremely important
capability in this.

� **Tactical Reconnaissance.** Tactical reconnaissance operations
collect information related to enemy dispositions and target
systems. It also encompasses BDA following air attacks for the
planning and conduct of further air operations. Th e objective of
tactical reconnaissance is to provide information for targeting and
damage assessment.


-----

combat enabling air campaigns

� **Target Acquisition.** Data linking strike aircraft with RPAs would
provide real-time imagery of targets in the battlefi eld to aid target
acquisition. Th is has specifi c relevance to BAS and BAI missions.

###### REMOTELY PILOTED AIRCRAFT (RPA)
**Capabilities. New generation RPAs can carry the latest Electro-optical**
(EO), Infra-Red (IR) or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors and
even PGMs. Th ey can fl y at high altitudes for extended periods of
time and possess threat warning and ECM capabilities. Th e multiple
capabilities of these RPAs allow them to undertake a host of missions
that include reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA)
as well as targeting and deception operations. Th ey can also undertake
maritime operations, EW and SIGINT, CBRN reconnaissance, special
and psychological operations, meteorology missions, artillery direction,
battle damage assessment, radio and data relay and precision attacks on
high value target systems. Th e important employment considerations
for RPAs are:

� RPAs generally require an extensive support infrastructure. Th is
factor limits their options for deployment in operational areas.
Th ey also require data links from the control stations to the decision
makers and users.

� RPAs can cover only limited areas with desired resolution in short
time periods and initially require intelligence inputs and guidance
from either satellites or human sources to reach a localised area of
interest. Within this area, they can then search for targets.

� While the initial fl ight profi le, small size and low speeds may conceal
their entry, but once detected, the RPA is vulnerable to enemy air
defences.

� Th e operator remains a key part of the mission, hence increased
endurance of RPAs require multiple shift s of personnel for them
to be successful. Th e organisational structure should be versatile
and fl exible, and the specialist personnel should be cross-trained to
perform multiple tasks.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

**Force Mix. While imaging satellites can cover large swathes of**
area without violating another nation’s air space they are expensive,
vulnerable to deception techniques, diffi cult to “dynamically re-task”,
have extended re-visit times and do not provide direct inputs to the
ultimate user. Also, since these satellites normally occupy a low earth
orbit, they cannot remain stationary over a given point or area of
interest. Hence their real-time tactical application becomes severely
restricted. Manned aircraft off er better resolution and fl exibility, but
are vulnerable and have low endurance. In contrast, RPAs have role
fl exibility, are relatively cheap and survivable. SATCOM capabilities
have greatly enhanced the area coverage of the RPAs which is limited
only by the time it takes to reach the intended target area, considering
the relatively low ground speeds achieved by RPAs. On the other hand,
ground-based systems have limited coverage, but off er permanence.
Th e overall force mix should, therefore, have an optimum combination
of all such systems and should provide comprehensive picture of the
battle space.

###### AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING AND AIRBORNE WARNING AND CONTROL SYSTEM (AWACS)
Th e induction of AWACS heralds a new chapter in the IAF’s
transformation to a more agile and eff ective combat force. Characterised
by the most advanced sensor and information age technologies,
AWACS, as a force multiplier gives combat forces a defi nite edge over
the adversaries. Th e integration of its advanced air-battle management
and C4ISR functionalities into operations also needs to be undertaken
for greater effi ciency. Th ere is also a need to revamp our campaign
planning and operational concepts to capitalise on the immense
potential off ered by AWACS.
Over the course of its history, the AWACS mission has evolved
from that of primary surveillance and early warning to executing
offensive air power. Often, as the first airborne asset to enter a
campaign and one that is the last to leave, AWACS would be in the


-----

AWACS landing aft er a mission

Capable of detecting airborne and maritime targets as well as
providing data link communication to tactical elements, the AWACS
has the following inherent capabilities:

� **Enhanced Detection.** By virtue of taking the sensor to a greater
height the low level detection capability of the radar can be greatly
increased. Th is leads to a better situational awareness deep inside
the enemy territory and a reduction in the desired alert status
because of timely early warning.

� **Mission Flexibility/Versatility. History has shown that AWACS**
can respond quickly and eff ectively to a crisis and can support
worldwide deployment and operation at short notice. AWACS has
a greater chance of surviving in warfare than fi xed radar system


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

because of its mobility. Th e planned profi le can be adapted as per the
mission vis-à-vis emerging situations and survival requirements.

� **Deployment. With in-fl ight refuelling, the system can be deployed**
over extended and inaccessible terrains such as seas, deserts and
other inhospitable terrain.

###### STRATEGIC ROLES OF AWACS
**Potent Instrument of Diplomacy. Given its capabilities, AWACS has**
been eff ectively utilised as a deterrent in diplomacy and as an eff ective
instrument of force application.
**Disaster Management. Post natural disasters, AWACS can play a vital**
role in surveillance, aircraft control and airspace management to fi ll
the void created by the inability of ground based systems to move in
quickly and operate in diffi cult terrain and poor infrastructure.
**Humanitarian Missions.** AWACS help establish localised command
and control mechanisms until ground systems are able to build
situational awareness.
**Search and Rescue. AWACS can be eff ectively utilised to provide**
valuable search and rescue support through direct communication with
non-traditional joint players such as the coast guard, local enforcement
and rescue crews. Close coordination and the employment of the
AWACS radar would allow crews to de-confl ict the fl ow of airborne
assets to and from the disaster area.

###### AWACS COMBAT ENABLING MISSIONS
**Deep Penetration Attack.** AWACS is capable of providing long
range detection and identification of air threats, sea-surface tracks,
and can detect and report the current status of an enemy’s strategic
SAM and EW radars through its ESM systems. The ability to
quickly relay the air and real time intelligence picture can provide
the beyond the line of sight picture to both the strike elements and
commanders on ground, enabling real time C2 including timely
corrective decisions.


-----

combat enabling air campaigns

**Strike Control. One of the biggest advantages of the airborne radar**
platform is the ability to warn and control own strike missions in the
adversary’s territory, which hitherto was not possible owing to line of
sight constraints of ground based radars.
**Air Control Operations. AWACS can be used to acquire air control**
over an adversary’s air space as well as over own air space. It can support
the battle along with the army and navy to attain time critical military
objectives. Initiative, surprise, concentration of fi repower, shock eff ect
and operational advantage over adversaries would remain the guiding
principles for utilisation of AWACS.
**Air Defence. Th rough its improved low level and long range radar**
coverage AWACS is capable of acting as an extension of AD sectors.
Th e AWACS is an excellent option for control of air defence weapon
platforms well inside the enemy territory.
**Air Intelligence. As the monitoring and analysing of the enemy’s air**
activity is an ongoing process during peace and during operations
AWACS with its integral sensors can augment existing ELINT and
COMINT systems.

###### AEROSTATS
Th ese are aerodynamically shaped, tethered balloons that house
airborne radars, a few of which are operational in the IAF. Th ey provide
electronic coverage at low, medium and high altitude deep inside the
enemy territory. However, they are limited by their static location. Th ey
would, therefore, need to be protected from aerial attacks and ground
threats.

###### ELECTRONIC WARFARE
**Defi nition. Electronic Warfare (EW) is defi ned as the art and science of**
preserving the electromagnetic spectrum for friendly use while denying
its use to the enemy. EW involves the military use of electronics to
determine, exploit, reduce or prevent hostile use of the electromagnetic
spectrum as well as to ensure its eff ective use by friendly forces. EW


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

includes systems using all forms of electromagnetic energy e.g., radio,
radar, IR optical systems, lasers, etc. However, radiation produced by
nuclear weapons is usually classifi ed as nuclear fallout.
**Applications.** EW is a force multiplier. Electromagnetic capabilities
are associated with all aspects of air power employment and EW
considerations should form an integral part of planning and execution
of all types of operations. EW operates on multiple levels in a confl ict
ranging from self-protection to operational attack plans. When
EW actions are properly integrated with other military operations,
a synergistic eff ect is achieved, losses minimised, and eff ectiveness
enhanced. Th ere is a particularly close inter-relationship between EW
and the SEAD role wherein EW provides the ‘soft kill’ option.

###### SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATIONS
**Defi nition. Air search and rescue operations involve the use of aircraft**
and helicopters to locate and rescue personnel in distress and, in
particular, to recover aircrew who have abandoned their aircraft . Combat
Search and Rescue (CSAR) is a specifi c task performed to eff ect the
recovery of distressed persons including downed aircrew and isolated
personnel from a confl ict zone or battle area. Space enabled SAR has
also signifi cantly enhanced the eff ectiveness of SAR operations.

###### PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS FOR SAR
**Peace Time.** Considering the geographical expanse of the country,
the IAF has to be prepared for search and rescue operations in various
terrains, which may dictate use of diff erent types of aircraft . Th ese
aircraft must have the facility to home onto the distress transmission
of the pilot rescue beacon of the downed aircrew and must also posses
winching facilities. Rescue of civilians in disaster situations will be
covered in a subsequent chapter.
**In War.** Search and rescue helicopters are unarmed and therefore,
vulnerable to enemy attack. Th is is an important consideration when
downed aircrews have to be rescued from enemy territory. Th is would


-----

combat enabling air campaigns

involve the use of an attack helicopter, or unarmed helicopter along with
attack helicopters to provide covering fi re, or even an armed helicopter
with fi ghter escorts. Such operations may prove to be costly, especially if
the enemy is aware of where the aircraft has crashed and deploys air and
surface forces in that area. Hence, combat search and rescue operations
should only be undertaken, if, the prospects of success are good and if
surprise can be maintained. Th e depth of penetration would depend on
enemy defences in that area. Further, armed helicopter escorts should
take into account their own vulnerability as regards the enemy’s AD
systems.
**Imperatives for Successful Execution of CSAR.** CSAR is a specialised
operation. Th e main factor for success in CSAR operations is quick
response. Th us as soon as the aircrew ejects, his position must be quickly,
and as far as possible, accurately relayed to the nearest CSAR base; the
base must be located close to the border; the crew must be close to the
aircraft ; and the rescue beacon available with the pilot must be able to
accurately indicate his location. Th e other contributory factors include
accurate intelligence, secure communications, appropriate control over
air, AD, enemy surface forces in the area and the weather.

###### TESTING, EVALUATION, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D)
Technology and doctrine are dynamic processes and must necessarily
adapt to change lest they become obsolete and lose their relevance.
Self reliance in testing and fl ight evaluation ensures that new weapon
systems acquired by the country meet the requirements of the IAF.
Th e Aircraft and Systems Testing Establishment (ASTE) is the nodal
agency for testing and evaluation activities in the IAF. Its activities
support the acquisition, modifi cation, upgradation, and maintenance
of weapon systems and equipment. ASTE ensures that aircraft and
equipment meet the requirement of peace and war time. It undertakes:
evaluation of aircraft and equipment at the prototype stage; the
evaluation and service trials of new aircraft and airborne equipment


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

and fl ight trials post any major modifi cations carried out on aircraft
and systems.
Ideally, the doctrinal process should scrutinise and infl uence the
direction of new and developing technologies. Th e IAF therefore
determines the air power requirements that best fulfi l its doctrinal
needs for war fi ghting. Th ese requirements direct the R&D eff ort
and must be futuristic and yet practical and can be fulfi lled by the
further advancement of contemporary technologies. Th e R&D
process includes concept defi nition and refi nement, technology
demonstration and system development and deployment. ASTE works
as the interface between the user and the R&D agencies. ASTE steers
the process of identifying user requirements based on current and
future technologies on the one hand and operational requirements
on the other.

##### SECTION II

###### COMBAT ENABLING GROUND OPERATIONS

 MAINTENANCE
Air power must be underpinned by sound maintenance to ensure a high
degree of aircraft /equipment availability at all times during operations.
An eff ective indicator of a potent force is its ability to ensure high sortie
generation rates as they would then relate to the mass – in terms of
air power assets to tackle a large number of target systems in a short
time span. Th is in turn is a function of aircraft serviceability, system
reliability and spares availability.
Air power maintenance requirements are knowledge and capital
intensive. Th e maintenance costs of air power assets are high due to
repair and replacement costs, infrastructural demands and the need
for skilled technical expertise. In addition, aviation activities are
extensive and incorporate a wide range of modern high tech weapon
systems, multiple aerial platforms, diff erent radar systems and complex
communication networks. Th ese require diverse and highly specialised
engineering support facilities. Some of the measures taken to resolve
complex issues are the integration of the operational, maintenance and
training philosophies right from the planning stage of the procurement
cycle to ensure a seamless man-machine-materials-methods interface
over the life cycle of stores and equipment.
Maintenance is also related to inspection and servicing, repairs and
overhauls, storage, tracking of equipment life and extensions thereon
and measures taken to prevent degradation of systems due to operations
in diff erent climatic conditions and terrains which can cause corrosion,
humidity, temperature and structural fatigue.
Quality assurance of all weapons, equipment, systems and stores
at every level must conform to similar specifi cation standards at all
times. Various prevention and control programmes and maintenance


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

workshops must be anticipated and planned periodically to promote
eff ective maintenance philosophies. Newer methods and technologies
must support the foolproof remote testing and calibration of equipment.
Proper and simple documentation in all engineering, logistics and
maintenance activities ensures accountability and systemisation.
Standardisation of weapon systems, procedures, practices,
documentation and infrastructure go a long way in guaranteeing ease
of operations, maintenance, retention of expertise and interoperability.
Computers and networking also simplify maintenance activities.

Maintenance: Air Warriors servicing Su-30 MKI

Ongoing midterm life upgrades resolve the problems faced by
ageing fl eets. Mastering upgrade technology and the indigenous
application of the same in other utility platforms and equipment would
further bolster performance of ageing systems. Further, modifi cations
in airborne and ground based systems overcome deterioration in
performance due to design defi ciencies. In addition, systematic defect
trend analyses and the incorporation of improvement schemes with
inbuilt safety mechanisms facilitates better performance.


-----

combat enabling air campaigns

Information and communication technologies have revolutionised
the conduct of warfare. True convergence of information and
communication data on the same network and eff ective use of bandwidth
and robustness of equipment have ensured the reliable networking of
information for eff ective decision making.
Clear SOPs for care and maintenance of various sensors, platforms
and conventional and un-conventional weapons must be incorporated
during procurement of such systems. Requisite infrastructure of
the desired standard must be put in place to ensure the guaranteed
performance of such high technology assets. Maintenance organisation
should be seamless to ensure smooth transition of responsibility
in maintenance of systems, networks and procedures. It should be
adaptable and respond eff ectively to changes in technological and
operational requirements. Since air operations generate maintenance
requirements, maintenance organisations must be knowledgeable
regarding the nuances of air operations and the peculiar requirements
of aerial warfare.

###### INTEGRATED LOGISTICS
Logistics involves planning and eff ecting the movement and sustenance
of forces along with providing the physical means of support necessary
for mounting and sustaining operations. A force is only as combat capable
as the logistic support it receives. Operations require provisioning of
right stores at right time, in the right quantity and at the right place. Th us
logistic activities must be conducted smoothly and adequate system
and equipment availability must be guaranteed. Th e integrated online
materials management system has injected effi ciency into maintenance
and logistic functions by providing greater transparency and visibility to
the air warriors tasked with functions of maintenance and logistics.

###### PASSIVE AIR DEFENCE
**PAD. Passive Air Defence includes measures taken to minimize the**
damage caused by enemy air attacks. Some of these are:


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

� **Protective Measures.** Th ese are fundamental measures taken to
protect and safeguard life and assets and include PAD training,
evacuation of families, dispersal of aircraft and vehicles, deploying
of decoy aircraft and targets, sandbagging of important buildings,
digging of trenches to provide shelter and an eff ective air raid
warning system. It also includes the setting up of alternate facilities
for sustaining air operations. Hardened Aircraft Shelters (HAS) are
an important element in the PAD scheme to protect aircraft .

� **Control Measures. Th ese are measures taken immediately aft er an**
air attack and include processes that facilitate prompt reporting of
bomb damage, casualties, fi re and location of unexploded bombs.
It also includes fi rst aid and transfer of casualties to hospitals, fi re
fi ghting, clearance of debris, emergency repair of damaged power
and waterlines and restoration of communications.

� **Restorative Measures.** Th ese consist of measures taken aft er an air
raid to restore normalcy to the extent possible. Of critical importance
would be the steps undertaken to quickly restore aircraft operating
surfaces and support services to permit eff ective re-commencement
of air operations. ‘Control’ and ‘Restorative’ measures are closely
interlinked and may have to be undertaken simultaneously.

� **Camoufl age and Concealment. Camoufl age and concealment of**
targets, besides confusing the enemy, would also reduce the time
available between target acquisition and weapon release, thus
degrading the accuracy of attack. Simple and innovative methods
go a long way in degrading the eff ects of enemy air attacks.

###### GROUND DEFENCE
Security of bases and installations is essential for eff ective air operations.
Th e threat could be from airborne troops, guerrilla forces or from
asymmetric fi ghters. Th e aim of ground defence should be to prevent an
attack by deterrence, and if that fails, to defend the airfi eld and installations
from hostile attacks. Ground defence forces must be available in strength
for credible deterrence. Further, appropriate lighting devices and electronic


-----

combat enabling air campaigns

alarm systems must be installed at suitable locations. Th e threat of an
enemy attack would be the highest for forward airfi elds, EW radars and
the airfi elds where strike forces and high value assets are based.
**Forces Available.** All combatant personnel of the IAF and units of
Defence Security Corps held on strength are classifi ed as combatants,
and are therefore available for ground defence. Moreover, units of
Border Security Force, the Provincial Armed Police, and Home Guards
will also be provided in emergency. Th ese troops operate under the
control of the station commander.
**Counter Intelligence.** With the advent of modern, compact
communication systems, and their likely use by the enemy agents, D/F
locating and rapid reaction may be the only means available to counter
this threat. Close liaison with the local police and the population around
the airfi eld increases the eff ectiveness of counter intelligence activities.

###### SPECIAL FORCES (SF) OPERATIONS
**Characteristics. IAF Special Forces are highly trained and are equipped**
to carry out specifi c operations, in off ensive and defensive roles. Th ey
operate in small numbers but the payoff s from a successful operation
are generally much higher given the size of the forces involved. Th ey
generally operate independently or in close coordination with other
forces at the operational level.
**Role. Th ough the Special Forces are primarily to be used for off ensive**
operations, the conditions for their employment are fl exible. Some of
these are:

� Surveillance and reconnaissance.

� Combat and peace time search and rescue missions.

� Counter Terrorism.

� Destruction and degradation of enemy air assets (DEAA).

� Special missions in the interest of IAF, sister services and the
nation.

� Protection of IAF high value assets.

� Emergency response force.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

Garuds: IAF special forces in action

Some of the salient aspects that need to be considered for the
employment of the Special Forces are:

� Selection of objective at the strategic level and integrating with
plans at the operational and tactical level.

� Joint planning from inception stage. Detailed planning for insertion,
extraction and recovery. Th ese are imperative for the successful
execution of these operations.

� Success will depend on a combination of precise and accurate
HUMINT, COMINT and SIGINT.

� SF have to survive in hostile environment. Th us, the elements of
surprise, and the secrecy will be essential for the success of SF
operations.

###### RUNWAY REHABILITATION
One of the limitations of conventional fi xed wing aircraft is their
dependence on runways and other operating surfaces. During war,
the enemy may target runways and taxi tracks. Runway rehabilitation
ensures operations are resumed at the earliest and this can be achieved
by well trained personnel.


-----

combat enabling air campaigns

###### CHEMICAL BIOLOGICAL RADIOLOGICAL AND NUCLEAR DEFENCE
Successful chemical biological radiological and nuclear (CBRN) defence
relies on deterrence that threatens equal if not higher CBRN capability.
To successfully counter the CBRN threat, it is essential that plans are
made in peacetime, protective clothing and equipment procured and
personnel trained in their use. CBRN indoctrination capsules will go a
long way towards increasing awareness regarding this vital aspect.

###### TRAINING
Th e purpose of training is to prepare air warriors of the IAF to undertake
their operational functions effi ciently and eff ectively by providing
them with the necessary knowledge and skills. Since IAF operates high
technology equipment, and air power assets require higher levels of
skill, training assumes even greater importance. Th e training process
should have the twin objectives of developing individual skills, as
well as imparting professional military education to develop the skills
required to take on higher responsibilities. Th is education must promote
the study of war and the role of air power, so that IAF personnel are
prepared to apply theory and knowledge to the task of fi ghting and
winning the war in the air.
A review of training courses was carried out to address existing
limitations, streamline the course syllabi and provide ‘just in time’
training. Th e basic learning is now being carried out through ‘distance
education’ with a short contact programme. Th e highlight of this
training policy is that it is now mandatory for all the offi cers. Th is
also signifi cantly promotes self-learning amongst the IAF personnel.
Training should not only aim at developing individual skills, but
also on developing a collective war-fi ghting capability. Th e ultimate
goal should be to produce a competent and cohesive team capable of
applying combat air power to meet India’s national security objectives
most eff ectively.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

###### ADMINISTRATION
Administration includes all activities other than training and
operations that are necessary to enable the IAF to operate eff ectively
and economically. It includes security, medical services, accounts and
work services. Good administration has a signifi cant and positive
infl uence on morale. Operations and administration go hand in hand.
Th erefore, for each operational plan, there must be a corresponding
administrative plan. Administration provides a secure and fi rm base
for operations. No operational plan is likely to succeed unless there
is an effi cient administration. Administrative arrangements must be
designed to allow the commander maximum freedom of action for
executing the operational plan. Th e administrative organisation must be
structured in a way that once activated it enables maximum resilience
and improvisation during war.
**Medical Support. Medical support must be tailored to meet the demands**
of war. In peacetime, it is essential that medical offi cers be trained to
deal with CBRN and for providing health cover to all service personnel
and their dependents. Th e system’s eff ectiveness would be measured by
its ability to return patients to duty quickly, while minimising morbidity
and mortality. In case of a likely CBRN threat, appropriate specialist
measures would be necessary. Prompt and adequate medical support
and facilities have an important bearing on the morale of the personnel
and their families.

### Sub-Conventional Warfare

_In light of the rapidly changing nature of warfare, the reduced possibility_

_of large scale conventional confl ict and the increased proliferation of_

_sub conventional warfare, air power is a powerful tool that the state in_

_general and India in particular could employ to win the war against the_

_non-state actor._

Th e fl exibility and precision of air power makes it eminently suited for
employment across the spectrum of warfare. Th e proliferation of terrorism
and the unholy designs of non-state actors along with their capability to
target the soft under belly of democratic nations have created an asymmetry
of alarming proportions. In such a scenario, it is important to review the
roles, missions and capabilities of air power to tackle sub conventional
threats from guerrillas, insurgents, terrorists and extremists who threaten
national security. Air power is a powerful tool to achieve this objective and
must be employed in all its aspects to achieve national objectives.

###### THE ROLE OF AIR POWER IN SUB CONVENTIONAL WARFARE
Air power can play a major role in bolstering government
control, while interdicting terrorist/insurgent feeders. It is


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

important that in such cases air power can and must be used
in more than the traditional combat roles – to defend the
nation’s integrity. Ingenuity is a prerequisite for exploiting air
power in sub conventional warfare. Aerial reconnaissance can
play a key role in tracking terrorist/insurgent activities and
identifying operating bases, training camps and supply nodes.
Visual, photo, satellite, and RPA reconnaissance, will be of great
utility in this effort. Dense vegetation and mountainous terrain
hinder aerial reconnaissance. However, advances in systems and
techniques have given air power the ability to overcome these
problems. Electronic support measures or ESM can be used to
locate terrorist/insurgent lines of communication and operating
bases, as well as the hiding places of key leaders, even across
international borders. Intelligence gained from adversary
communications can be used to direct operations against them.
The key advantages offered by air power are: flexible collection
platforms with direction finding capability and long loiter times,
advanced signal analysis and correlation systems, advanced signal
decryption system systems, rapid communications intelligence
processing capabilities, near-real time data link to other sensors,
command centres and weapons platforms.
Mobility and responsiveness are perhaps the most significant
contribution of air power to sub-conventional warfare. Air mobility
gives the government a virtual presence capability, in which a small
reaction force can effectively respond within a large geographic area.
Air mobility resources enable, ground security forces to be rapidly
concentrated when and where needed, in varied terrain. Military air
power can also be used to transport police and other civil security
elements in response to crisis. Mobility greatly enhances the speed
and reach of humanitarian relief and civil support operations, all
of which support government legitimacy and reduce adversary
influence. Key capabilities include flexible transport platforms with
sufficient range and the ability to operate from small landing strips


-----

sub-conventional warfare

or zones, fully developed communications infrastructure allowing
rapid coordination with the key civilian agencies, integrated civilmilitary command and control processes, and a systematically
developed nation-wide infrastructure of landing strips/zones and
maintenance facilities.
Utility and attack helicopters will be equally relevant and effective
in future sub conventional conflict as they have been since their
introduction. They provide a significant reconnaissance and on-call
fire support capability that can be a tremendous force multiplier.
Such platforms can be used to support civil security forces, quick
reaction forces or larger operations. They can also be used as
escort platforms for military or civil ground movements, including
humanitarian relief convoys. Low speed, low altitude and smaller
munitions mean attack helicopters can be employed for strike
operations with reduced risk of collateral damage. Key capabilities
include: enhanced self defence systems to increase survivability,
improved day night capabilities, advanced target acquisition
systems, smaller, more precise weapons; near-real time data link
for passing and receiving target data, and flexible command and
control systems and structures that incorporate civilian agencies for
integrated civil-military operations.
Punitive strikes by multi-role combat aircraft are an option in
the Indian context, particularly in a proxy war situation – should the
political leadership so decide. Targets for punitive strike would mainly be
training camps or the leadership. Fighters and attack helicopters would
be best suited for this role. Th e importance of real time intelligence
cannot be understated, as targets are not likely to be static. In order
to avoid collateral damage in such attacks, precision attack capabilities
would also be required.
Though casualty evacuation is a non-combatant role of air
power, it is going to play an important role in sub conventional
warfare. Tolerance for loss of human life in sub conventional conflict
is typically lower than in the case of a full scale conventional war.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

Rapid medical evacuation will greatly increase the survival rate of
combat injuries. It can also be used to move doctors, both civilian
and military, around the region, to provide medical care to civilians.
Military aircraft could also be used to transport supplies into a
remote location, provide assistance to the population and enhance
popular support for the government.

###### TECHNOLOGY IN SUB-CONVENTIONAL WARFARE
The application of air power in sub-conventional warfare would
be incomplete without taking into account the impact of emerging
technology such as: intelligence, sensors, precision weapons,
advanced aircraft design and electromagnetic dominance. Subconventional warfare is generally characterised by a difficulty
in finding, identifying and isolating targets, whether in urban
areas, mountains, caves or forests. Intelligence sensors can be
broadly classified as wide area surveillance assets and close target
reconnaissance assets. Wide area surveillance assets provide the
overall picture of the target and also help in identifying the locations
within the target area that require more intensive investigation.
Technologies like the foliage penetration synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) and moving target indicators (MTD), multispectral and
hyper spectral sensors, and chemical sniffers can enhance wide
area surveillance capabilities in the context of small wars and subconventional warfare.

###### STRATEGIES TO FIGHT SUB CONVENTIONAL WARFARE
Unlike conventional confl icts where there is a clear de-lineation between
military action and politico-diplomatic tools for confl ict resolution,
strategies to combat sub-conventional warfare are far more complex
and nebulous. Military action, political initiatives, diplomatic parleys
and socio-economic action have to be synergised to defeat proponents
of sub-conventional warfare.

sub-conventional warfare

###### MILITARY OPTIONS
Post World War II, by and large, in most sub conventional confl icts,
ground forces have been deployed to combat insurgencies and
guerrilla movements across the globe. Air power has been mainly
used in the supporting role. It was the Israelis who realised the
potential of air power as a powerful tool of the state when faced with
– what was literally – a struggle for survival in the late eighties. Th e
Israelis were also amongst the fi rst to successfully use air power in
conjunction with Special Forces to conduct an anti-terrorist operation
during the famous raid on Entebbe. Since then, air power has been
used off ensively by Turkey against Kurdish insurgents, by Russia
against the Afghan and Chechen rebels, by US and coalition forces
in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq, by Sri Lanka against the LTTE, and
most recently, by Pakistan against the Taliban in the Swat region. Th e
use of air power by India in Kargil does not typically fall into the
category of, air power being used against non-state actors, but is an
instance of the use of air power at the lower end of the spectrum
of warfare – bordering on sub-conventional warfare – because the
infi ltrating force that occupied the icy heights of Kargil was a mix
of regular troops and terrorists. Whenever off ensive application of
air power has been followed by clinical ground operations, the nonstate actor has been pushed to the verge of defeat. However, whenever
attempts have been made to defeat a non-state actor by using only air
power, the campaigns have been less than successful. Th e non-kinetic
and support roles of air power therefore continue to be extremely
relevant in the war against non-state actors. A few pre-requisites for
the successful employment of air power are enumerated below:

� **Political Will. Th e single most important factor is the resolve of**
the government to use air power in sub conventional confl icts,
particularly within own territory. Th is becomes even more critical
when the use of off ensive air power is contemplated.

� **Integration. Th e fi ght against the non-state actors has to be centrally**
controlled and directed.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

� **Surveillance Grid. A wide and extensive surveillance grid that**
covers the entire area of ops is essential for integrating the terrain
obstacle system, troop deployment and surveillance devices
including satellites, RPAs and Human Intelligence (HUMINT).

� **Intelligence.** Th e integration of all intelligence sources and high
grade actionable intelligence would be crucial to achieve success.

� **Targeting & Collateral Damage. Judicious targeting minimises**
the risk of collateral damage. However, the government must be
sensitised that limited collateral damage will be inevitable if the
situation deteriorates to the extent that off ensive air power has to
be employed.

� **Escalation.** Off ensive use of air power would raise the stakes and
lead to an escalation in case the non-state actors acquire / use man
portable air defence system (MANPADS). Self-protection suites
and tactics should cater for such an escalation.

� **Training. Training in selected squadrons should focus on the lower**
end of the spectrum of warfare. Special emphasis should be on joint
training with all elements actually earmarked for such ops.

� **Night & Weather Capability. All crew operating in such areas**
should be NVG qualifi ed and exposed to the nuances of operating
in such terrain.

� **Media.** Th e media should be engaged and public opinion built up
to support military ops.

###### ROLE OF AIR POWER
Th e most acceptable use of air power has been in the non-kinetic and
supporting role, subordinate to action by ground forces. However,
advances in modern weaponry, longer ranges, and more destructive
conventional munitions with precision and low collateral damage
probabilities, off er various options to the state. Some of the more
important ones are as below:

� Surveillance and reconnaissance by all available platforms
(satellites, RPAs and manned aircraft ) are extremely vital to fi nd,


-----

sub-conventional warfare

fi x, target and engage the mobile and highly elusive non-state actor
as compared to static targets that are associated with conventional
confl ict. Th erefore, real time intelligence is critical.

� Air mobility and logistics support to ground forces that are engaged
in counter insurgency, counter terrorism and proxy war operations
by fi xed wing aircraft and helicopters. Use of medium lift transport
aircraft and utility helicopters for insertion and extraction of
forces in the combat area, attack helicopters for sanitising the area
and providing fi re support are some other roles. Last but equally
important, fi ghter aircraft may be required to ensure air defence
cover so that the country that is providing proxy support to the
non-state actor is not able to provide air support to them.

� Targeting the terrorist and the non-state leadership is a key role
of off ensive air power and has yielded rich dividends in various
confl icts in the recent past. Th e systematic elimination of the AlQaeda leadership in Iraq and Afghanistan and the LTTE leadership
in Sri Lanka, have greatly changed the course of the confl icts.

� Destruction of terrorist infrastructure, launch pads and training
camps is vital in the current environment, and would be a key
mission for air power in any strategy that involves ‘hot pursuit’. Fixed
wing platforms and attack helicopters with precision weaponry and
real time targeting capability remain best suited for the two options
stated above.

� Other key roles for air power in sub-conventional warfare involve
casualty evacuation and search and rescue missions, humanitarian
relief missions and ‘show of force’ and peacekeeping missions under
the UN fl ag.

###### JOINT OPERATIONS AND SUB CONVENTIONAL OPERATIONS
It is extremely important to reiterate that even if air power has
the ability to coerce and deter the non-state actor; surface action
is imperative for final conflict resolution. Joint operations in sub

-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

conventional warfare demand far greater synergy and responsiveness
given the unpredictable nature of the adversary. Synergy has to be
developed systematically and honed first, in conventional scenarios,
before being applied in contingencies arising from insurgency and
terrorism. In the Indian context, it has emerged that synergies
have to be built not only between the three services, but between
the three services and the para-military forces and other wings
of government, both at the centre and the state levels. Air power
invariably is a critical facilitator in such operations and must be
exploited by adhering to the basic tenets of employment.

### Joint Operations

_Separate ground, sea and air warfare is gone forever. If ever again we_

_go should be involved in war, we will fi ght it in all elements, with all_

_services, as one single, concentrated eff ort._

— President Dwight D. Eisenhower,

Speech to US Congress 1958

Prior to the advent of air power, armies and navies could fi ght battles in
their respective domains, independent of each other. Air power, with its
attributes of rapid mobility, reach and fl exibility changed the paradigm
of warfare by ensuring that troops or marine vessels could be targeted
regardless of their domains. Advancing technology increasingly shapes the
conduct of modern warfare, and also demands the use of military forces in
concert with one another. Military forces on land, sea and air now reinforce
and complement each other more than ever before. It would hence be
essential to grasp the implications of these facets of modern warfare and
capitalise on the synergistic value of joint operations.

###### THE DOCTRINE OF JOINTNESS
‘Cooperation’ among the three services has long been accepted as a
principle of war by the Indian armed forces. Jointmanship is a progression
of this principle, and enables all the three services to complement each
other to achieve overall national security objectives. Th e essentials of
jointmanship as articulated by the IAF in its fi rst doctrine are:


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

Indian Army and IAF special forces on a joint operations training mission

� Cooperation rather than competition. It may well be worth
remembering that the competition is in fact with the enemy.

� Operating as a partnership and respecting each other’s capabilities.

� Trust and confi dence, along with sincere eff orts to learn about and
understand the capabilities and limitations of each service.

� Finally, joint operations involve using the right tools at the right
time and not necessarily a bit of everything.

Th ese essentials of jointmanship are the building blocks of the
concept of jointness. Joint operations imply an amalgamation of the
strengths of each service to produce a singular synergistic eff ect, which
is greater than the sum of the single service parts. However, true synergy
only obtains if each part is strong, competent and adaptable in its own
right. Each service intrinsically possesses distinct strengths which enable
achievement of national security objectives. Matching these strengths
to missions is the essence of joint operations. For instance, the intrinsic
strength of air power to swift ly target crucial enemy vulnerabilities
in depth should be optimally and creatively exploited so that surface
forces can achieve quick and decisive results and then hold ground or
dominate the waters to achieve strategic objectives.


-----

joint operations

Jointness seeks to achieve military effi ciency and this can be attained
by a well trained army, navy and air force. Specialised competencies or
professional mastery of land, sea and air are fundamental to eff ective
joint operations. Th us, when a joint force is packaged, it must be
tailored around the objective, not around parochial interests. For
example producing a shock eff ect on the battlefi eld is a core competence
of the air force, particularly when it involves the delivery of precision
weapons with surprise. Th is is something that the other services must
understand and exploit. Th e objective is the most important issuenot which service makes the largest contribution, or that each service
contributes equally. In the national security matrix, an integration of
the strengths of the three services is an index of not just operational
eff ectiveness, but is also a force multiplier, and above all, a means of
ensuring economy and effi ciency.

###### PLANNING OF JOINT OPERATIONS
Th e effi cacy of joint operations rests on planning and effi ciency. Th e
planning commences with an understanding of the mission, objective,
purpose, intent and the desired end-state. It is guided by the fundamentals
of joint operations in conformity with the principles of war and
operational requirements. Th e Chief of Staff Committee (COSC) initiates
the planning process on being so directed by the Cabinet Committee
on Security (CCS)/ Raksha Mantri (RM). Planning for conventional
operations would involve the respective service HQ for exercising
contingencies jointly. In case of special joint operations, the COSC would
issue the operational directive to the designated HQ that would be tasked
to execute the operation. Th e planning process in either case is the same
and is as laid down in the joint doctrine of the Indian armed forces. Th is
broad planning process lays down the norms for the planning of joint airland operations and maritime air operations. Th e planning in this case
also follows the same route of having a clear understanding the mission,
objective, purpose, intent and the desired end-state.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

###### CONDUCT OF JOINT OPERATIONS
Th e Chief of Staff Committee (COSC) issues a directive based on the
aims of the war as laid down by the government. Th ese directives
would determine the actions that the land, maritime and air forces will
undertake to achieve the aim. Th e key facets of any military operation
are synchronisation and integration of various elements of combat
power so that their eff ects complement and reinforce each other. Th e
directions would hence enunciate the ways and means of conducting
an integrated battle to achieve a quick and decisive victory with least
loss of life, material and national assets.
Hence the air operations, in this case, would be tailored to attain
the overall objective. Th is would again involve degrading the enemy’s
air power and following it up by reducing the enemy’s capability to
interfere with the operations of own surface forces; constraining the
enemy’s manoeuvrability and mobility; create an imbalance in his force
disposition; and destroy or damage his communication and logistics.

###### JOINT OPERATIONS AND OUT OF AREA CONTINGENCIES
As India’s economy grows and its area of infl uence increases, the armed
forces on their part would have to prepare for tackling any contingency/
emergency that occurs beyond its geographical boundaries and has the
potential to adversely impact our national interests. In such a scenario,
it is a given that air power will form an integral part of most task forces.
Th e country will look for speedy mobility, eff ective surveillance, precision
engagement and air support for re-supply of troops and equipment.
Th erefore, the IAF will be required to undertake all types of air operations
with the help of diverse airlift platforms, long range fi ghters, air to air
refuellers and if possible, operate from air bases in our neighbourhood.
While the IAF is well on its way to bolster and operationalise these
capabilities, there is a need to validate the concepts through realistic
exercises and by refi ning the operating concepts. Air power will play a
greater role in the domain of military diplomacy in any future OOAC
that our armed forces may be called upon to address.

### Nation Building, Aerial Diplomacy & Perception Management

_What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments, but_

_what is woven into the lives of others._

**— Pericles, Greek Statesman & General**

###### INTRODUCTION
At a time when ‘soft power’ is increasingly being seen as a powerful tool
of statecraft, it is important to re-visit some of the missions and roles
undertaken by air power to discern situations where it can be leveraged
for exerting ‘soft power’ in furtherance of national objectives, nation
building and to formalise the concept of aerial diplomacy.
In a globalised world where the utility of force is increasingly being
questioned, soft power is emerging as the fi rst option for nations to
legitimately get what they want, either from other nations, or in the case
of larger countries like India, from their own people. Joseph Nye, Jr. a
distinguished professor at Harvard defi ned soft power as “the ability to
_get what you want through attraction and not coercion”. Soft power as_


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

a doctrinal concept is not new to India. Writing in the third century
Chanakya in his treatise Arthashastra clearly enunciated that war should
always be the last resort for a king in confl ict resolution. From a doctrinal
standpoint it is important to examine how India can leverage the soft
power capability of the IAF to further nation building and diplomacy.

###### NATION BUILDING
Nation building in a geographically large, ethnically varied and culturally
diverse country like India primarily involves getting people together and
working collectively to achieve national aims and objectives. Th is is a complex
process that revolves around the three important pillars of governance,
development and security. Th e armed forces have a vital role to play in,
development and security, and it is in this context air power assumes signifi cance
for the years ahead. While the IAF has always been at the forefront of assisting
civil administration during natural calamities and sustaining remote areas
whenever asked to do so, there is a need for sensitising the country at large
of the tremendous contribution of the IAF in these areas. Th ere is a close
relationship between nation building and internal unrest and that explains
why this chapter follows the chapter on sub-conventional warfare. Many of the
roles mentioned below have been the critical drivers for aerial campaigns in
sub-conventional warfare. However, even aft er the sub-conventional confl ict
is resolved, the IAF has continued to perform these in the overall process of
nation building and integration. Th erefore, the overlapping of these roles into
nation building is deliberate and necessary as in the case of:

� Disaster and humanitarian Relief.

� Sustenance of remote areas through the medium of air.

� Mobility for governance and election duties.

� Casualty evacuation both during disasters and internal security
operations.

� Air displays to promote national integration and inspire national
pride.

� Presence and employment generation in remote areas where air
bases are located.

###### AERIAL DIPLOMACY
In recent times, diplomacy has emerged as the fi rst option for both
power projection and confl ict resolution, albeit with military power
to back it up with deterrence and coercive capability. Military power
allows diplomacy to communicate both intent and credibility during
negotiations, thereby acting as a critical enabler while remaining in
the background. Diff erent elements of military power off er diff erent
capabilities for diplomacy to leverage at diff erent times. For example,
one of the many ways in which an army can be diplomatically leveraged


-----

nation building aerial diplomacy & perception management

is by engaging with land locked neighbours. Th e close cooperation
between the Indian Army and the Nepal and Bhutan armies is a classic
case of diplomacy being furthered by land power that leverages ethnic
connects. Th e deployment of the Indian Navy in anti-piracy operations
is a classic example of maritime diplomacy that hinges on presence and
a fi rm intent of making a pro-active contribution to global security.
Similarly, the aerial evacuation of Indian citizens from war torn Kuwait
prior to the Gulf War in 1991; from Lebanon in 2006; and Libya in
2011, signals a fi rm commitment on the part of Indian diplomacy to
leverage air power to protect national interests and human capital well
beyond its shores. Th e decisiveness of Indian diplomacy was bolstered
by air power during Operation Cactus, the air landed operation at Male
that ensured that President Gayoom’s government was not overthrown
by mercenaries. Th e participation of IAF Jaguar fi ghter aircraft and IL78 aerial tankers in Exercise Cope Th under in Alaska in 2005 saw the
coming of age of aerial diplomacy and the ability of the IAF to support
trans-continental diplomacy. Th ere are numerous such examples that
cement the inescapable linkages between air power and diplomacy. Th e

main competencies that air power brings to diplomacy are speed, reach,
fl exibility, and as a last resort, even fi repower. Some of the globally
acceptable missions of aerial diplomacy are listed below and refl ect the
capabilities off ered by air power to shape strategic events.

IAF Mi-17 in UN operations

� Humanitarian evacuation of Indian citizens from potential confl ict
zones.

� Speedy intervention on specifi c requests from friendly countries
for assistance to mitigate the impact of natural disasters, human
confl ict and threats to sovereignty.

� Participation in UN mandated peace keeping and peace enforcement
missions that further India’s reputation as a responsible global player.

� Active participation in Out-of-Country contingency operations as
part of a joint Indian task force.

� Air displays by aerobatic teams and friendly exercises with air forces
at home and abroad.


-----

nation building aerial diplomacy & perception management

###### PERCEPTION MANAGEMENT
Perception management is emerging as a key competence that
government institutions must have if they want to reach out to
the world and their own people. Th is is because of the all pervasive
infl uence of institutions like the media and a host of non-governmental
organisations that seek to understand diverse issues. It is, therefore,
important for the IAF to develop skill sets that allow it to eff ectively
engage with these organisations to ensure that a correct image of the
service is transmitted to the world. Doctrinally, this would be a part of
the ‘soft power’ capability of the IAF that translates into eff ective media
management, public relations and image building.
With the sustained expansion of the IAF’s air mobility assets in
the form of both strategic and tactical transport aircraft and multi-role
helicopters, the role of the IAF in nation building and aerial diplomacy
is bound to increase in the coming years. It must thus be factored into
the overall potential of the IAF as an important tool of governance and
state policy. Air power has the potential to speedily reach hot spots
well before other organs of state power and provides the state with
credible and sustainable intervention capability. Th is is, by far, the most
enduring characteristic of air power that can be exploited for eff ective
nation building and diplomacy.

### The Air and Space Paradigm

_It was only in the crucible of the 1991 Gulf War that the synergistic_

_potential of air and space assets began to be appreciated... In manifold_

_ways, space demonstrated what it could bring to the new face of air_

_warfare._

— Benjamin Lambeth

Space capabilities are becoming absolutely essential for national
development, besides being crucial for conducting successful
military operations. India has a robust civil space programme which
is essentially geared towards scientific and development goals.
Utilisation of space for economic and developmental purposes is
likely to increase, and as dependence on space assets and systems
increases, the concurrent vulnerability of our country to hostile
action seeking to destroy, degrade or deny our space capabilities so
painstakingly built over the decades would increase. It is, therefore,
essential to institutionalise measures to secure, sustain and promote
our peaceful utilisation of outer space.
Before dwelling on the doctrinal aspects, it is important to briefl y
examine the broad rationale for the military, and in particular, the IAF’s
involvement in space.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

###### THE RATIONALE FOR MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN SPACE
Recent incidents clearly indicate that threats from outer space are
now a reality. Our investments in space are substantial and there is a
pressing need to protect our assets in space along with the necessity
of protecting our terrestrial assets on ground against threats from
outer space. Space enabled capabilities are universally regarded as
the backbone of military modernisation, particularly in the context
of air power. Space capabilities lie at the core of the revolutionary
transformation of military capability, commonly termed as Revolution
in Military Aff airs (RMA). Th e starting point for the public awareness
of RMA was the US military operations, particularly Op Desert Storm
in 1991. _Op Desert Storm was the fi rst war in which space systems_
were used by operational commanders and integrated into their daily
decision-making processes. Th e war demonstrated the enormous utility
and military transformation enabled by RMA, or Net Centric Warfare
Capability (NCW) as it was later termed. Eff ects Based Operations (EBO)
and Force Transformation Architecture (FTA) became the absolute
essentials of military strategy. Th e bottom line was the transformation
in the conduct of military aff airs by the combined potential of air
and space assets in terms of Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance
(ISR), communications, navigation etc. Th is ‘aerospace’ combination
provided the information dominance vital for the nuanced application
of force, which in-turn enabled decisive war-winning eff ects.
Th e most important driver for the IAF’s involvement in space is that it
is the primary military service mandated for securing national assets and
investments against threats from the skies. Th reats in the new millennium
range from passenger aircraft s being fl own into buildings, to high speed
manoeuvring missiles to anti satellites (ASAT) launched from ground and
airborne platforms. Th e challenges have evolved beyond air into space and
now encompass the entire vertical dimension of aerospace. Th e IAF would
have to transform accordingly to cope and it would not be possible to do so
without being involved in outer space.


-----

the air and space paradigm

###### THE DOCTRINAL DRIVERS OF MILITARY SPACE UTILISATION
Th e military uses of space expand with every passing confl ict as
emerging technologies aff ord greater exploitability of the environment
for military activities. Th is expansion, however, has largely been within
the doctrinal imperative of gaining the “high ground” for military
advantage. Th e quest to go higher and observe the adversary from an
altitude high enough not to be shot down led to the development of
high-altitude aerial platforms like the U-2 and later SR-71s etc and also
provided the impetus for space based observation. Space platforms
were beyond the reach of terrestrial weapons and hence they enabled
a more effi cient and safer means of delivering military ordnance and
observation.
Instead of being a frontier now, space complements air power in
numerous missions as an enabler. Air and space are now regarded as
complementary components of defence in that they compensate for
each other’s inadequacies in maintaining surveillance of the vertical
dimension and in countering threats from systems like ballistic missiles
that transit and manoeuvre through both air and space. Th us, in spite
of technological, environmental and other diff erences, military space
employment doctrines in the past and even today are primarily based
on air power doctrines.

basic doctrine of the indian air force

commenced with Cold War initiatives like the testing of anti-satellite
(ASAT) weapons by the USSR, and the US Strategic Defence Initiative
(SDI) that was popularly known as Star Wars. Space based assets like
satellites were mainly meant for ‘force-enhancement’ missions e.g.
observation, communications, navigation, meteorology etc which
allowed terrestrial military forces to conduct military aff airs more
effi ciently. Th us most military space missions were auxiliary to other
more direct military activities. Most present day satellites (excluding
ASATs) aff ording military capabilities or performing military functions
are incapable of directly destroying or damaging another country’s
property. Apart from ‘early-warning’ satellites which have a clear-cut
military role, most of the other military activities can also be performed
by civilian satellites and vice-versa.
However, as the military and commercial reliance on satellites grows,
so does the awareness that space based assets are centres of gravity,
which are likely to be targeted in war. But, while during the Cold War,
space systems were mainly focused on force-enhancement missions,
the focus now has shift ed to controlling space for one’s own benefi t
while denying it to the adversary. Th e focus of the military utilisation
of space is gradually shift ing beyond enhancement of military force
capabilities to control over the environment and actual application of
military force ‘in, from and through space’. Th is is why a number of
nations are currently embarking on programmes for space control and
space force projection. It is now evident that aft er a brief lull at the end
of the Cold War, the competition for space is seeing a transition from
militarisation to weaponisation.

###### FORCE ENHANCEMENT
Achieving full spectrum capabilities would of course be ideal. However,
in view of our unique needs as also capabilities and limitations, a
departure from the doctrinal prescriptions is essential. India does not
currently subscribe to Counter-space or space based force applications
which imply ‘non-peaceful’ uses of outer space. Th e mission of force


-----

the air and space paradigm

enhancement is ideally suited to our purposes and capabilities. It is also
within the realm of our capabilities, and fi nances and hence, it should
be our primary focus. Th e panoply of capabilities in the realm of space
enabled force enhancement include:

� Early Warning Satellites.

� Observation/Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) satellites.

� Communication Satellites.

� Navigation Satellites.

� Metreological Satellites.

� Geodetic Satellites.

A prudent option for building up our nascent capabilities would be
to build on what is available and ‘doable’. It needs to be borne in mind
that the integration and operationalisation of these capabilities took
the US the better part of four decades. Integration of space capabilities
into our conventional military apparatus would be an equally time
consuming aff air fraught with a variety of technological and economic
challenges, and we would need to maintain our focus accordingly.

###### INTEGRATING SPACE
Th e doctrinal, operational and technological challenges of integrating
space into air operations and networking are demanding as well as time
consuming. Going by the lessons of past confl icts and the advances
in technology, information enabled assets in air and space are the key
facilitators for the effi cient operation of various military systems. To
integrate space capabilities with air power; it would be essential to network
the diverse and yet potent elements of air and space for optimal effi ciency
in fulfi lling the obligations of national security. Only then would the true
benefi ts of aerospace power become demonstrably evident. To this end,
it would be necessary to develop systems for linking sensors as well as
weapon platforms etc. Th e eff ort should be to shorten the prevailing
‘sensor-to-shooter’ link and deliver vital inputs and information into
cockpits as also to the control and reporting centres etc.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

###### SECURITY OF ASSETS
Air space management and security challenges have progressed
to aerospace levels. Th e crowding of the national airspace and the
challenges of air space management in the near future would also
demand greater coordination of air and space assets. It would be even
more imperative in view of platforms like the “Multi-Purpose Aerospace
Vehicle” which operate in both air and space. All of these measures
can be undertaken within the ambit of the prevailing laws governing
outer space. For instance, surveillance in aerospace is well within the
ambit of the ‘peaceful uses of outer-space’ along with hardening and
manoeuvrability options. Th e need to weaponise outer space is not
currently being envisaged; hence it is not discussed in this document.

###### LIMITATIONS IN USING SPACE
Space is not a substitute for all other military capabilities, or a panacea
for all the information voids or military inadequacies plaguing our
national security. Our doctrine on space is therefore dictated by
rational security needs and not the limits of what could be technically
possible. Th us, keeping the ‘availability and aff ordability’ criteria, in
mind the presently available space technologies need to be leveraged to
meet present national security and defence requirements. Any future
requirements should be factored in with due attention to costs, the
legalities and treaties in vogue, technical feasibility etc. Luxuries in
the new millennium are no longer aff ordable, and hence the doctrinal
approach is to seize the opportunities as and when they present
themselves.

### Information Warfare

_Successful warfare is all about – and has always been all about –_

_acquiring and exploiting information._

— Richard P Hallion, air power historian

Th e information age is transforming military operations by providing
commanders with information that is unprecedented in quantity and
quality. A modern military commander invariably possesses adequate
information on the battle space, which gives him a powerful, if not
decisive leverage over the adversary if he manages to analyse and sift
that information well. It is this complex combination that comprises
information warfare.

###### IW CATEGORIES
Information warfare can be defined as the action taken to preserve
the integrity of one’s own information system, while at the same time
exploiting, corrupting or destroying an adversary’s information
system, and in the process, achieving an information advantage
for the application of force. There are two mutually supportive
categories of information operations (IO) – the offensive and the
defensive.

� **Off ensive Information Operations involve. Th e integrated use of**
assigned and supporting capabilities and activities, to aff ect enemy
decision-makers by attacking their information and information
systems.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

� **Defensive Information Operations.** Integrate and coordinate
policies and procedures, operations, personnel, and technology to
protect and defend friendly information and information systems.

###### ORGANISATION
A fully functioning IO system requires synergistic merging of the
capabilities and related activities of its components. As IO will be
conducted at the strategic, operational and tactical levels it will require
a tiered organisational set up.
Various agencies at the national level are responsible for computer
emergency response, data assurance standards, cryptography, and cyber
law and training. Th e MoD interacts with ministry of communication
and IT on issues relating to information security. HQ IDS is responsible
for information security and projects in the three services.

###### CYBER WARFARE
Cyber warfare is an attractive low cost war-waging model because it
has some notable features such as: low entry cost, blurred traditional
boundaries and an expanded role for perception management. Off ensive
cyber warfare can be conducted across the entire range of military and
nonmilitary operations to achieve national objectives. Th reats in the
sphere of cyber security originate from a variety of sources (known as
well as unknown). Th ese can target infrastructure, the fi nancial sector,
individuals, governments and the militaries of a country. Th e gravity of
these attacks will vary depending on the objectives. Th e cyber defence
environment requires deployment of technologies and capabilities for
real-time protection and incident response. Th e existing cyber threats
to the IAF can be categorised as follows:

� **Th reats to IT Infrastructure. Information networks and applications**
like the communication systems, air defence systems, logistics network
etc span all areas of operations, administration and maintenance and
this reliance will only increase in the future. Networks across the entire
country will use a variety of means, ranging from optic fi bre cables,


-----

information warfare

unshielded twisted pair cables, satellites, and other wireless channels
and technologies, such as MPLS, VoIP, etc. Th ese media will have
their own inherent vulnerabilities, which may render the network
susceptible to attack. A disruption of these networks would result in
failures that would severely hamper aerospace operations and interservice integration. Th erefore, a robust and secure information security
system is necessary for ensuring the security of the IT infrastructure.
Notwithstanding the insulation of air force networks from the Internet,
these networks would be vulnerable to IW weapons and attacks from
the Internet, introduced physically by agents or subverted personnel.
In future our Information networks and applications will also have
to be secured from electromagnetic pulse (EMP), high energy laser
(HEL) and high power microwave (HPM) devices.

� **Soft ware/Hardware Based Th reats. User-friendly operating**
systems, anti-virus soft ware, browsers, fi rewalls, intrusiondetection systems, encryption soft ware, etc, are mostly of foreign
origin. Similarly, most of the critical hardware components for
high-end computers (mother-boards and processors) and network
elements (switches, routers, modems and network cards) are also of
foreign origin. Th ese soft ware(s)/hardware(s) may have malicious
“backdoors”, to perform a pre-programmed hostile activity.

� **3G and Wi Max Networks.** 3G and Wi Max networks are being
established in the IAF to enhance the data and voice communication
and as backup networks. Th e necessary security mechanisms should
be in place to ensure the security, integrity and availability of data
and tackle cyber related threats such as virus, worms, eavesdropping
and denial of service.

� **Sophisticated Malwares. Th e dynamic and vulnerable nature of IT**
infrastructure has forced the hacker community to continuously
develop sophisticated and sustainable malwares, which could
be deployed through various mechanisms and triggered when
required. Agents or subverted personnel can deploy such malwares
physically on the intranet.

###### CONCLUSION
Information warfare has gained signifi cance, both in the military as a
whole and the air force in particular. To counter the myriad threats and
benefi t from cyber warfare capabilities, it is necessary for the IAF to
have a well defi ned roadmap.
Cyber warfare capability will play a crucial role in future wars, but
unlike other technologies used in warfare thus far, expertise in waging
a cyber war is not limited to the armed forces. Cyber warfare relies on
information technology, which is used as much by the armed forces as
by civilians. Ultimately, the dominance of a nation state in cyber war
would critically depend on the extent to which it is able to integrate the
eff orts of the armed forces and other agencies.

### Human Resource Development

_During an operation, decisions have usually to be made at once; there_

_may be no time to review the situation or even to think it through. If_

_the mind is to emerge unscathed from this relentless struggle with the_

_unforeseen, two qualities are indispensable: First, an intellect that,_

_even in the darkest hour, retains some glimmerings of the inner light_

_[commander’s vision] which leads to truth; and second, the courage to_

_follow this faint light wherever it may lead._

— Karl von Clausewitz

###### INTRODUCTION
Human resources are one of the most important force multipliers
available to the IAF. IAF personnel – officers, airmen, NCs (E) or
civilians – all contribute to its ability to conduct operations across
the entire spectrum. The selection, training, employing and retaining
of personnel is a foundational endeavour and has a direct bearing
on our ability to undertake operations and effectively employ the
weapon systems that we possess or are planning to acquire. With the
increasing sophistication in technology, the ability of its personnel
to exploit these assets would finally determine the effectiveness of
the IAF.

###### THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
Air warriors with professional leadership skills are at the core of force
development. Th e goal of force development is to prepare the air warriors
to successfully lead and operate in a rapidly evolving environment,
while at the same time being able to meet personal and professional
expectations.

###### FORCE DEVELOPMENT: THE PROCESS OF MAXIMISING CAPABILITY
Human resource development (HRD) processes are designed to
produce and maximise the capabilities of air warriors. HRD aims
to optimise the capabilities of the individual between personal
needs and organisational requirements. A focus on the elements
of the force development process – induction, development
and sustainment, supported by proper planning, will make for a
balanced, diverse, and capable workforce. These elements combine
to produce effects greater than the sum of the parts. The process is
depicted as follows:

**Fig. 1: Process of Force Development**

###### FORCE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS: DEFINITION
Eff ective HRD is based on capability-based requirements. Th e **success**
of air operations depends on the eff ective integration of human
capabilities with the tools, tactics, techniques, and procedures that
combine to produce the full spectrum of aerospace power. Th e fi rst
step in integrating air warriors into IAF operations is by defi ning the
required capabilities and thereaft er building the skills required to
produce those capabilities.

###### INDUCTION
HR induction ensures that over time IAF continues to maintain the
professional competence of its workforce. As human requirements
and capabilities change, the processes associated with induction also


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

evolve. Advertising and recruiting strategies, pre-commissioning, basic
military training objectives and pipeline training capabilities are crucial
elements in the induction process. Th ese will drive the IAF’s ability to
attract, procure and produce the right skills and competencies to meet
operational requirements.
Promotion of air warriors is an indication of recognition of potential
and provides a leadership cadre. Promotion also serves to motivate,
to aspire to lead by providing opportunities for greater responsibility,
compensation and prestige.

###### DEVELOPMENT
Development processes and systems hone individual capabilities
through education, training and experience, thus producing skilled
and competent air warriors who can apply the best tools, techniques
and procedures to produce a required operational capability.
Development is the process where raw aptitudes, attitudes and abilities
are supplemented and transformed to craft individual competencies
into the capabilities required by IAF to execute its aerospace missions.
Education and training are the critical components of the development
process. Education develops critical thinking skills, encourages
exploration of unknown areas and creative problem solving and the
ability to foresee unknown situations or new challenges. Training on
the other hand focuses on providing a structured skill set and provides
the individual with skill expertise.
An ongoing programme of professional, technical and academic
development from the very beginning, prepares air warriors to
comprehend and accomplish their assigned missions. Further,
experience blended with skill, knowledge and motivation, refi nes the
leadership qualities possessed by each air warrior. Th rough career
planning and development, air warriors are assigned and deployed
to meet mission requirements. Th e IAF leverages these competencies
to expand the capabilities of the entire workforce and to achieve the
national military objectives.

human resource development

###### SUSTAINMENT
Sustainment processes and programmes balance organisational
requirements with individual aspirations and changing operational
requirements. Th ese processes are structured to capitalise on
investments in HR development. ‘Quality of life’ programmes clearly
refl ect the high value that IAF places on its people and the need to
retain the right mix of people with professional / leadership skills and
associated capabilities.
Physical and mental fi tness along with discipline, enhance an air
warrior’s ability to sustain a high state of readiness. As readiness is a
perishable state, the IAF continuously assesses and addresses individual
and unit readiness issues.
Th e IAF recognises the value of family support in motivating
and sustaining the capabilities of air warriors. Career decisions
and associated issues of retention and force readiness take into
consideration diverse family requirements. By supporting families and
ensuring that they are able to enjoy a quality of life and opportunities
comparable to those enjoyed by the citizens of the nation they
protect, the IAF makes a tangible commitment to air warriors that
recognises and values their services. Th ese initiatives are intended to
increase their commitment and their impact on morale and retention
is signifi cant.
Recognition of personnel for their achievements motivates
others to aspire for excellence. Given the high risks associated with
preparing for and engaging in military operations, it is only proper
to honour those who have valiantly fought and voluntarily sacrifi ced
their personal comfort to triumph over an adversary. Similarly,
exceptional performance cannot be recognised only through fi nancial
remuneration, but should be formally acknowledged and reinforced.
Th e IAF’s recognition programmes are designed to highlight excellence
of leadership and technical skills, as well as extraordinary dedication in
performance of assigned duties or service to the nation.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

###### CONCLUSION
Leadership is fundamental to the IAF. Creating future leaders is the
responsibility of the current ones, and HRD is their means of doing
so. By taking an organised approach and developing leaders from the
tactical level, through the operational, to the most senior strategic
levels in the air force, the service will ensure its continued pre-eminent
position in the world. Leaders are inextricably linked to mission
eff ectiveness; and developing leadership qualities through a deliberate
process that guarantees that the IAF will produce the requisite leadership.
**Leadership and HR development must continue to provide the IAF**
**with its most valuable resource – its people – its motivated and**
**superbly qualifi ed air warriors.**

### Technological Perspectives

_Victory will smile upon those who anticipate changes in the character of_

_war, not upon those who wait to adapt themselves aft er changes occur._

— Gen Giulio Douhet, in Th e Command of Air, 1921

###### INTRODUCTION
Aerospace power, since its very inception, has relied upon cuttingedge technology to maintain its supremacy over adversaries. The
capabilities, effectiveness and therefore the utility of aerospace
power are premised mainly on technology, with the aim of making
aircraft, systems, sensors and weapons more capable and potent.
Even if not related to weapon-systems, technological innovations
serve to enhance fundamental organisational capabilities and
efficiency, which in turn enhance their operational potential. The
IAF is rapidly modernising itself by introduction of advanced
and the state of the art technology across all levels. What drives
the quest for technological advantage is the need to stay ahead of
adversaries in terms of building significant pro-active and deterrent
capabilities.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

###### LEADERSHIP CHALLENGES
Along with its many advantages, technological advancement also
enhances complexities. Unlike in the past, where requirements drove
technology, today technology is driving requirements at a rapid pace.
Leaders are faced with the continuing dilemma as to whether the
introduction of latest technology would truly be an advantage. Training
and the stabilisation of new and advanced systems before they can be
made operational is a time consuming process. It must be remembered
that technology is a tool, a means to an end, and not an end in itself.
If the end state is known and analysed adequately, technological
requirements fall into place automatically. In other words, capability
building should drive technological induction and not the other way
round.

###### MANPOWER CHALLENGES
A key concern when dealing with the rapid advancement of technology
is that there is a mismatch between natural human capacities and
the enormous data volumes, processing capabilities, and decision
speeds that technologies either offer or demand. Although humans
today are more capable of performing certain tasks than machines;
machine capabilities are expected to increase to the point that
humans will become the weakest component in the wide array of
systems and processes. Humans and machines will need to become
far more compatible, through improved human-machine interfaces
and by direct augmentation of human performance. Newer ways of
using science and technology to augment human performance will
be essential for benefiting from the various technologies. This will
further increase human efficiency, reduce the manpower needed for
the same activities or provide enhanced capabilities with the given
manpower.
Ensuring the adequate availability of manpower, both in terms
of quality and quantity, for effective exploitation of the chosen
technology, will continue to pose a challenge. There is a need to


-----

technological perspectives

understand and differentiate between the people operating the
weapon system and those who perform the back up communication,
logistics and command functions. The proverbial tooth-to-tail
ratio reduces with technology and factoring this in during the
transformational process and accounting for the same is another
important leadership imperative.

###### NEED FOR TECHNOLOGY
Th e energy that is injected into the system due to enhanced technology
is commonly referred to as ‘information’. Th e human race has been
fi ghting wars since time immemorial and only till a few years ago,
control over high ground was considered an absolute must to win a war,
mainly because it translated into better information. Th e concept that
information is an asset and a commodity that needs to be controlled
is relatively new, and is not being referred to in the classical sense as
‘information warfare’. By information we mean that an enabling attribute
is enhanced by the incorporation of technology. In the cockpit it may
manifest itself in a higher number of tracked targets; in navigation
systems in terms of higher accuracies and in terms of terminal guidance
as better SSKP or CEP.

###### TECHNOLOGY PERSPECTIVE
It must be understood that the advancement of technology will
dictate and influence how a force operates in the future. Even if
unrelated to weapon-systems, technological innovations serve to
sharpen fundamental organisational capabilities and efficiency,
which in turn enhance operational potential. The thrust areas that
have influenced the formulation of the IAF’s technological needs are
as follows:

� Replacement/modernisation of combat aircraft, transport aircraft,
helicopters and training aircraft .

� Induction of force enhancers.

� Acquisition of modern armament and weapon systems.


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

� Strengthening of air defence networks/systems/weapons.

� Building up of the information and electronic warfare capability.

� Setting up of reliable and secure communication facilities.

� Space based systems and their exploitation.

� Modernisation of training facilities.

� Development of operational infrastructure.

### Conclusion

Two basic criteria have to be met to ensure the defence of our
nation: fi rstly, the government must be prepared to use its military
instruments for the protection and projection of our national interests
and secondly, the military instruments must be developed and readied
during peacetime. We have the option of allocating our resources both
strategically and tactically. We can opt for deterrence or protection or
we can choose to neutralise the forces arrayed against us and degrade
even their places of origin.
In a democracy like India, a defensive posture appears as being
politically and economically attractive, but allows a potential opponent
the freedom to concentrate all his resources on off ensive strategies. To
deny him this freedom of action, it is imperative that a nation’s military
instruments must be forged a way that they can be actively turned
against an aggressor. At the cutting edge of such a capability is a nation’s
air power with its inherent qualities of speed, reach, lethality, precision,
ability to concentrate, fl exibility in the selection of weapon options,
roles and target systems and shock eff ect.
Th ere is no single application of air power that forms its chief strength.
Be it strategic attack, counter air, battlefi eld air strike, interdiction or
EW, it is the synergy between the multiple roles, missions, platforms
and people that defi nes the utility of air power. Air power can go it
alone, lead or follow, as the situation demands.
Military operations in the future will be increasingly networked and
rely greatly on connectivity, ISR, communications and data handling
capability. IAF assets that are likely to be inducted shortly, or are in
the process of being inducted into service, will heighten the capability
of seeking, processing and utilising information. With heavy payloads
and long range weapon delivery platforms, infi ltration and extraction


-----

basic doctrine of the indian air force

of own forces from an area of confl ict will be possible. Intervention
in a deteriorating geo political situation or providing succour in a
humanitarian crisis require a robust and powerful capability. Th e
country will demand and expect the armed forces to respond and help
the needy. Th e speed, reach, mobility and responsiveness of air power
will sustain relief and rehabilitation operations. In short, air power also
off ers decisive non-kinetic options to commanders.
Th e challenges facing joint operations in the future will mainly
revolve around inter-operability and the shedding of dogmatic
approaches to war fi ghting. Single service approaches to war fi ghting
cannot be wished away immediately. However, a visionary leadership,
focussed policy, continuous joint training and an ‘objective’ oriented
approach will yield rich dividends when it comes to evolving a truly
‘joint’ philosophy of exploiting all military arms of the state in pursuit
of stated national objectives.
Looking forward, the IAF is well on its way to becoming a truly
transformed and lethal force. Th e weapon systems that have been
inducted, and are being inducted will generate the necessary force
multiplier eff ect to exploit the tenets of air power with effi ciency and
precision. However, it is the intangible force multipliers like leadership,
morale and training that can make all the diff erence in war and these
are oft en neglected in peacetime. Th e IAF owes it to the country to
maximize operational excellence, maintain its technological edge and
preserve its off ensive potential.
