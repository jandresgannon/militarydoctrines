### A. INTRODUCTION

1. Czech Republic Military Strategy (CR) is a document containing set of basic principals ensuring CR defense and rules for the build-up and use of Czech Republic Armed Forces (hereinafter
the armed forces). It reflects assessment of status and predicted development of the security
situation, defined security interests of the Czech Republic and defense policy principals, stated
in updated Security Strategy of the Czech Republic and develops basic principals of NATO
Strategic Concept.

2. CR Military Strategy belongs among the basic security documents of the Czech Republic establishing conceptual scope for CR Armed Forces to perform military tasks of country defense,
commitments of collective defense of NATO countries and participation on alliance, union and
coalition operations. It also expresses principals of cooperation with other entities participating
on CR defense. In accordance with CR foreign policy, it establishes conditions for the armed
forces active participation on European security and defense policy implementation within EU.

3. Based on assessment of security situation and CR security interests definition, a chapter of CR
Political-Military ambitions expresses **„what“** the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic must
be able to fulfill in order to ensure the country defense; a chapter of CR Defense Strategy expresses principals „how“ the Czech Republic defense would be fulfilled and a chapter of Defense Capacity and Resources expresses „by what means“, indeed what means and resources
would be used for those purposes.

### B. SECURITY SITUATION

4. CR is in a relatively friendly security environment. This status is provided especially by good
relations with adjacent countries and membership of NATO and European Union (EU). The
Czech Republic membership of NATO and EU occasions that CR has become a country inside
of those organizations territory which significantly increase its security. Presented membership
also means acceptance of commitments to specifically participate on performance of joint security and defense policy of those two organizations.

5. An essential role for the security of the Euro-Atlantic region is played by the maintenance and
development of the transatlantic link, where NATO plays a central role in the security-political
and defense dimension. The challenges that NATO is facing as a result of the developments of
the security environment, especially increasing tendency of asymmetric threats, augmented by
possible WMD application, result in widening of the spectrum of the tasks related to CR defense and security and formulation of new priorities of the armed forces development. A process of NATO enlargement, its internal adaptation and development of the alliance capabilities
like specialization, armament modernization and establishment of mobile and rapid deployable
forces is a response on current security threats.

6. An intensive dialog of EU member countries affirms the importance of European security and
defense policy. CR supports further development focused on establishment of defense means
and capabilities enabling EU to deal with conflicts and crisis threatening global and local security including employment of NATO planning means and capacity. CR seeks to close cooperation between EU and NATO in prevention and handling with current security threats.


-----

7. In consideration of deepening Common Foreign and Security Policy, the importance of the
European Union to ensure the European security is being strengthened. The integration of
Europe increases ability of action in peacekeeping, rescue and humanitarian operations. Establishment of appropriate military capacity, complemented by police forces and other civilian
components, contributes to it. The treaties and commitments adopted within Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) play an important role in enforcing security and
confidence in Europe.

8. The armed forces are assigned to perform tasks related to commitment of participation in the
CR security interests provisions that are summarized in the CR Security Strategy:

-  **vital interests - ensuring of CR existence, its sovereignty, territorial integrity and political**
independence; defense of democracy and legislative state, protection of human rights and liberty of inhabitants;

-  strategic interests - security and stability in Euro-Atlantic area; keeping of global stabilization role and increase of UN effectiveness; firm transatlantic link within NATO and establishment of strategic partnership between NATO and EU; complementary development of NATO
and EU defense capabilities; development of OSCE role in prevention of armed conflicts, stabilization and democratization; abatement of international terrorism; reduction of WMD risks;
elimination of organized maleficence and illegal migration; support to regional cooperation; ensuring economic security of CR; strengthening of national defense industry competitiveness and
ensuring adequate reserve level; support to float of freedom and democracy and legislative state
principals;

-  other important interests - prevention and readiness in unpredictable natural, ecological and
industrial disasters; environmental protection; possible relations with global climatic changes,
food and water shortage, industrial potential and energy shortage, etc. .

9. Occurrence of large-scale armed conflict interfering CR territory and territory of another NATO
member country in predictable time horizontal is very improbable; it will be possible to disclose
potential threat in advance enabling to take adequate steps in accordance with economicindustry and administrative decisions of concerned national bodies and institutions. In longterm perspective this possibility (including WMD engagement) cannot be excluded and it is
necessary to keep it in mind during establishment and preparation of the armed forces. In the
global terms security situation is getting worse which influence national defense provision and
definition of specific requirements on the armed forces capabilities focusing on threats elimination. CR security situation and predicted tendency of its development can be characterized following way:

-  Increase of asymmetric threats urgency; related especially to the subjects organizing terrorists´ attacks using mostly the civilian targets; those subjects are increasingly seeking for
WMS; targets and purpose of terrorists´ attacks can hardly be specified; there are seen tendencies for their coordination;

-  Nowadays, the security threats are represented by countries, non-government groups and
organizations that do not respect the principles of international law and democracy, accompanying by danger of religious and ethnical conflicts or economy or social problems and political rules instability eventuating into local but also wider limited

-  Threats of non-military character related to natural and industrial disaster, organized
crime, legal and illegal massive migration, drugs trafficking, dangerous infectious disease,
disruption of information and control systems and violation of order and property are still
sustaining.

### D. STRATEGY OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC DEFENSE

**a)** **General Conditions**

23. The defense policy of the Czech Republic is based on the principle of complex defense based
on indivisibility of its external, internal, military and non-military aspects, on the activities of
prevention and on capability of instant sufficient reaction.

24. CR defense is an issue relating to all society, each citizen that share the basic values of
a democratic country. CR defense is ensured not only by the armed forces but also armed corps,
rescue corps and emergency services in cooperation with state bodies, territorial self-governing
parts and other corporate bodies and other legislative and physical entities.

25. Defense of state is a collection of arrangements to ensure sovereignty, territorial integrity, principals of democracy and legislative state, protection of inhabitants’ lives and their properties
against external attack. It includes build up of the national defense system, preparation and engagement of adequate forces and means and participation in a collective defense system.

26. The basic security guarantee for the Czech Republic is NATO membership relying on the transAtlantic links. Except strengthening of the position within the democratic states community and
integrating among the strongest defense structures of current world, the Czech Republic accepted an appropriate part of responsibility for allies´ security and NATO defense policy implementation within NATO Strategic Concept.

27. CR defense planning and control is under responsibility of the government with participation of
other constitutional bodies, authorities and institutions with the assigned tasks defined by the
appropriated laws.

28. CR will actively participate on the EU security and defense policy defined by political-military
ambitions. The armed forces capabilities and their potential available in alliance environment
will be engaged for that.

**b) Principles of Build-up of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic**

29. The structure of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic, their size and capabilities, are elicit
from the set political-military ambitions and the appropriate resource limits and must respect
principals of reasonable sufficiency of individual forces. Within the set political-military ambitions fulfillment, the units are being prepared to perform a wide scope of possible operations
and missions in international and national measure.

30. Potential of the armed forces is being developed as one complex with some elements assigned
for the different ways of engagement. They can be used in both national conditions for operations of NATO, EU or other coalition or task forces.

31. The peace structure of the armed forces will be build up to be able to perform tasks resulting
from political-military ambitions of the Czech Republic in peace conditions. There will also be
established a system of arrangements (planning, training, operating, mobilization, economic,
legislative etc.) providing a gradual transfer of the armed forces into a war structure and their
full using for CR territory defense. At the same time there will be completed conditions for the


-----

full engagement into the operations under Article 5 operations WT of lower and higher intensity
and task performance of CR defense in line with mobilization arrangements implementation.

32. The war structure of the mobilized armed forces will not go beyond increase of 1.2 multiple of
peace numbers. The first phase of combat power increase of the Czech Army units and formations will utilize the active reserves being prepared already during peace conditions. If necessary, a government decision can cause an increase of mentioned ratio to accept extraordinary
measures.

33. Individual elements of the Czech Army are based on readiness for operational engagement divide into three readiness levels relating to their earmarking for the operations within CR,
NATO, EU or other coalition task units. Their classification also respects a principle of stepped
readiness and reflects their stationing and mobility capability. The basic force structure according readiness levels is following:

-  **high readiness forces would be ready within 90 days;** **NATO Response Forces** or EU
**Rapid Response Forces that** would be ready within 5-30 days;

-  law readiness forces would be ready within 365 days and would be used among others for
rotation of high readiness forces that would be in this case ready up to 6 months;

-  long-term build-up forces would be ready for engagement at first in 365 days and would be
developed by mobilization.

34. The Czech Republic Armed Forces will focused especially on development of capabilities in
areas of radiation, chemical and biological protection, military medical service, electronic warfare and passive surveillance systems together with keeping reasonable symmetry of forces
structure. Integration of CR into international programs of defense research, development and
armament with prior focus on armed programs and strategic project of NATO and EU armament will be gradually increased. Development of cooperation with national defense industry,
together with research and development platform will be prior.

35. The capabilities to the armed forces to ensure political-military capabilities are conditional on
keeping an adequate level of defense costs and their effective use for fulfillment of the armed
forces reform tasks. The basic criterion of readiness for the armed forces build-up and development is a capability to consistently perform tasks resulting from CR Constitution.

36. The Czech Army assigned units and parts (one mechanize brigade, units and means of Ground
Forces, Air Force and support forces to support named units, NBC battalion, mobile elements
of biological protection, passive surveillance system unit) will achieve the initial operational
**capabilities of the armed forces by December 31, 2006, i.e. fulfillment of basic criteria arising**
from applied NATO standards. After achievement of initial operation capabilities, the transfer
to a target organization structure of the armed forces will continue so all formations and unit
will be after achievement of target operational capabilities able to be fully useable for the armed
forces tasks engagement in a complete scope. Based on available resources the target operation
capabilities will be achieved in planned time horizon by 2010-2012.

37. Units, formations and facilities of Joint Forces will be organized and assigned to be able based
on operation character to establish a required task force. Effective use of organization structure
of mechanized brigade and combat support units and support on operation-tactical level will
enable their deployment to operations based on the set political-military ambitions and gradual
increase of capacities for units’ rotations in operations and missions abroad


-----

**c)** **Principles of the Armed Forces Engagement**

38. The strategic principle of CR defense provision is an active participation on NATO collective
defense system. The participation in NATO, EU, UN or other coalition formations missions and
operations abroad minimizes danger to transfer an armed conflict on the CR territory.

39. The Czech Republic will use all available means, from diplomacy activities to military force
use, to defend and ensure vital interests. All activities of the armed forces will respect CR law
and international law concerning especially combat conflict.

40. The CR defense provision on national and alliance level will still be implemented especially by
prevention arrangements. Effectiveness of preventive (deterrent) actions decreases necessity of
reactive arrangements.

41. Preventive actions are based on:

-  effectiveness of military intelligence, representing by permanent assessment of security situation and intensive exchange of intelligence information among allies with the view to timely
discover potential threats and to eliminate factor of surprise,

-  the armed forces active participation on the international preventive arrangements of prevention of crisis situation establishment or dealing with them especially within NATO and EU,

-  demonstration of possibilities of effective engagement of the armed forces units and capabilities,

-  readiness of national defense system and its link to the alliance system of crisis situation responses,

-  maximal level of interoperability with alliance forces through standardization, coordinated
processes in all areas of defense planning, doctrine development and joint exercises´ participation.

-  systematic improvement of CR defense system.

42. The military defense of the Czech Republic is built on engagement of own forces and means
and on security guarantees related to NATO and EU memberships. The fundamental for successful actions of the Czech Republic within NATO or coalition or task forces is the development of own defense capabilities.

43. The military defense of the Czech Republic is based on optimally structured, full combatable,
professionally and modernly equipped armed forces. The armed forces are the guarantee for national military defense. The armed forces capabilities are ensured by existence of volunteer active reserves and by incensement of combat force in mobilization process. Effective size and
combat level of the armed forces engagement including effective use of resources will provide
the seamless acceptance of an acceptable level of security risks and their prospective elimination. In the first place the tools of preventive actions (if needed they would be supported by
adequate arrangements) will be applied.

44. The military defense of the Czech Republic is build on three pillars including both preventive
and reactive actions and national and alliance, resp. union participation and responsibility for
their implementation:

**1. pillar - defense of own territory, including mobilization arrangements, plus operation prepa-**
ration of national territory, assistance to CR Police and integrated rescue system and HNS;


-----

**2. pillar - protection and defense of CR air space, especially through an active participation in**
NATINEADS;
**3. pillar – capability to participate in alliance and union operations by fully trained and**
equipped mobile forces including employment of earmarked forces depending on character and
size of the crisis situation to NATO, EU and coalition task purpose operations.

### E. DEFENSE CAPACITIES AND RESOURCES

**Military capacities**

45. To implement defined political-military ambitions and tasks, the armed forces will have following basic military capacities:

**a)** **Joint Forces, established from :**

-  **Ground Forces, their main parts will be 3 mechanized brigades (one would be build-up**
by mobilization) and 1 artillery brigade. They will be the main part of mobile forces for
task performance of prevention and response to crisis situation in national and alliance

staffs, reconnaissance and EW that will (in scope based on appropriate special law) gather, collect and asses information required for ensuring military defense of CR and its alliance commitments; will continuously assess risks and threats to the CR security, focusing on functionality of preventive and reaction arrangements;


-----

**d) Military Police, performing police protection of armed forces in full spectra of activities and**
will be ready to perform in international police units and peace, rescue and humanitarian operations out of CR territory; simultaneously it will be also prepared to provide assistance in favor
of CR Police and integrated rescue system units.

The common system of command, control, communication and availability of information necessary for decision-making processes support that becomes phenomenon sufficiently influencing effective national defense will be gradually introduced into all forces and skills.

**Human resources**

46. The key point of the armed forces development is transfer to fully professional armed forces by
January 1, 2005 that peace numbers will be gradually stabilized in 2010-2012 on about
26 thousand career soldiers and 9 thousand civilian employees.

47. The essential condition for implementation of goals related to political-military ambitions of the
Czech Republic is recruitment and sustaining good quality and high-motivated military and civilian personnel.

within the system of the CR defense planning and by import under the condition of fulfillment
of security, economy, legislative and utility criteria. During crisis situations, the national resources (in form of necessary supplies of products, labor and services) will be provided through
a system of economic mobilization and will be replaced by utilization of national material reserves and infrastructure. The Army of CR will modify a composition of its reserves in accordance with NATO standards and will reduce a stored equipment amount and a size of material
means of untouchable reserves so they achieve a projected level of utilization in possible threats
probable in midterm and long-term time horizon.

51. The rationalization of the supply system, logistics and other services support will increase the
part provided by civilian sphere, including contracting support of direct supplies during crisis
situations.

52. National Strategy is being developed in accordance with CR Military Strategy and becomes an
initial document of the armed force armament. It concretes the basic approach to providing material resources; it identifies a role and position of home industry and economy base in the national system of defense planning. It reflects development trends of armament enabling effective creation of material and intellectual resources for implementation of security and defense
national policy, the armed forces armament and consolidation of CR economy growth.


-----
