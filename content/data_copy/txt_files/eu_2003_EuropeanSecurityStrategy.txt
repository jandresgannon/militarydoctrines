# A Secure Europe in a Better World: European Security Strategy

## European Council

### Introduction
Europe has never been so prosperous, so secure nor so free. The violence of the first half of the
20th Century has given way to a period of peace and stability unprecedented in European history.
The creation of the European Union has been central to this development. It has transformed
the relations between our states, and the lives of our citizens. European countries are committed
to dealing peacefully with disputes and to co-operating through common institutions. Over this
period, the progressive spread of the rule of law and democracy has seen authoritarian regimes
change into secure, stable and dynamic democracies. Successive enlargements are making a
reality of the vision of a united and peaceful continent.
The United States has played a critical role in European integration and European security, in
particular through NATO. The end of the Cold War has left the United States in a dominant
position as a military actor. However, no single country is able to tackle today’s complex
problems on its own.
Europe still faces security threats and challenges. The outbreak of conflict in the Balkans was
a reminder that war has not disappeared from our continent. Over the last decade, no region of
the world has been untouched by armed conflict. Most of these conflicts have been within rather
than between states, and most of the victims have been civilians.
As a union of 25 states with over 450 million people producing a quarter of the world’s
Gross National Product (GNP), and with a wide range of instruments at its disposal, the
European Union is inevitably a global player. In the last decade European forces have been
deployed abroad to places as distant as Afghanistan, East Timor and the DRC. The increasing
convergence of European interests and the strengthening of mutual solidarity of the EU makes us
a more credible and effective actor. Europe should be ready to share in the responsibility for
global security and in building a better world.

### I. The Security Environment: Global Challenges And Key Threats
**_Global Challenges_**

The post Cold War environment is one of increasingly open borders in which the internal and
external aspects of security are indissolubly linked. Flows of trade and investment, the
development of technology and the spread of democracy have brought freedom and prosperity to
many people. Others have perceived globalisation as a cause of frustration and injustice. These
developments have also increased the scope for non-state groups to play a part in international
affairs. And they have increased European dependence—and so vulnerability—on an
interconnected infrastructure in transport, energy, information and other fields.

Since 1990, almost 4 million people have died in wars, 90% of them civilians. Over 18
million people world-wide have left their homes as a result of conflict.

In much of the developing world, poverty and disease cause untold suffering and give rise to
pressing security concerns. Almost 3 billion people, half the world’s population, live on less than
2 Euros a day. 45 million die every year of hunger and malnutrition. AIDS is now one of the
most devastating pandemics in human history and contributes to the breakdown of societies.
New diseases can spread rapidly and become global threats. Sub-Saharan Africa is poorer now
than it was 10 years ago. In many cases, economic failure is linked to political problems and
violent conflict.

Security is a precondition of development. Conflict not only destroys infrastructure,
including social infrastructure; it also encourages criminality, deters investment and makes
normal economic activity impossible. A number of countries and regions are caught in a cycle of
conflict, insecurity and poverty.

Competition for natural resources—notably water—which will be aggravated by global
warming over the next decades, is likely to create further turbulence and migratory movements
in various regions.

Energy dependence is a special concern for Europe. Europe is the world’s largest importer of
oil and gas. Imports account for about 50% of energy consumption today. This will rise to 70%
in 2030. Most energy imports come from the Gulf, Russia and North Africa.

**Key Threats**

Large-scale aggression against any Member State is now improbable. Instead, Europe faces new
threats which are more diverse, less visible and less predictable.

**Terrorism: Terrorism puts lives at risk; it imposes large costs; it seeks to undermine the**
openness and tolerance of our societies, and it poses a growing strategic threat to the whole of
Europe. Increasingly, terrorist movements are well-resourced, connected by electronic networks,
and are willing to use unlimited violence to cause massive casualties.

The most recent wave of terrorism is global in its scope and is linked to violent religious
extremism. It arises out of complex causes. These include the pressures of modernisation,
cultural, social and political crises, and the alienation of young people living in foreign societies.
This phenomenon is also a part of our own society.

Europe is both a target and a base for such terrorism: European countries are targets and have
been attacked. Logistical bases for Al Qaeda cells have been uncovered in the UK, Italy,
Germany, Spain and Belgium. Concerted European action is indispensable.

**Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction is potentially the greatest threat to our**
security. The international treaty regimes and export control arrangements have slowed the
spread of WMD and delivery systems. We are now, however, entering a new and dangerous
period that raises the possibility of a WMD arms race, especially in the Middle East. Advances in
the biological sciences may increase the potency of biological weapons in the coming years;
attacks with chemical and radiological materials are also a serious possibility. The spread of
missile technology adds a further element of instability and could put Europe at increasing risk.

-----

The most frightening scenario is one in which terrorist groups acquire weapons of mass
destruction. In this event, a small group would be able to inflict damage on a scale previously
possible only for States and armies.
**Regional Conflicts: Problems such as those in Kashmir, the Great Lakes Region and the**
Korean Peninsula impact on European interests directly and indirectly, as do conflicts nearer to
home, above all in the Middle East. Violent or frozen conflicts, which also persist on our
borders, threaten regional stability. They destroy human lives and social and physical
infrastructures; they threaten minorities, fundamental freedoms and human rights. Conflict can
lead to extremism, terrorism and state failure; it provides opportunities for organised crime.
Regional insecurity can fuel the demand for WMD. The most practical way to tackle the often
elusive new threats will sometimes be to deal with the older problems of regional conflict.
**State Failure: Bad governance—corruption, abuse of power, weak institutions and lack of**
accountability—and civil conflict corrode States from within. In some cases, this has brought
about the collapse of State institutions. Somalia, Liberia and Afghanistan under the Taliban are
the best known recent examples. Collapse of the State can be associated with obvious threats,
such as organised crime or terrorism. State failure is an alarming phenomenon, that undermines
global governance, and adds to regional instability.
**Organised Crime: Europe is a prime target for organised crime. This internal threat to our**
security has an important external dimension: cross-border trafficking in drugs, women, illegal
migrants and weapons accounts for a large part of the activities of criminal gangs. It can have
links with terrorism.
Such criminal activities are often associated with weak or failing states. Revenues from drugs
have fuelled the weakening of state structures in several drug-producing countries. Revenues
from trade in gemstones, timber and small arms, fuel conflict in other parts of the world. All
these activities undermine both the rule of law and social order itself. In extreme cases, organised
crime can come to dominate the state. 90% of the heroin in Europe comes from poppies grown in
Afghanistan—where the drugs trade pays for private armies. Most of it is distributed through
Balkan criminal networks which are also responsible for some 200,000 of the 700,000 women
victims of the sex trade world wide. A new dimension to organised crime which will merit
further attention is the growth in maritime piracy.
Taking these different elements together—terrorism committed to maximum violence, the
availability of weapons of mass destruction, organised crime, the weakening of the state system
and the privatisation of force—we could be confronted with a very radical threat indeed.

### II. Strategic Objectives
We live in a world that holds brighter prospects but also greater threats than we have known. The
future will depend partly on our actions. We need both to think globally and to act locally. To
defend its security and to promote its values, the EU has three strategic objectives:

**Addressing the Threats**
The European Union has been active in tackling the key threats.

  - It has responded after 11 September with measures that included the adoption of a
European Arrest Warrant, steps to attack terrorist financing and an agreement on mutual
legal assistance with the U.S.A. The EU continues to develop cooperation in this area and
to improve its defences.

  - It has pursued policies against proliferation over many years. The Union has just agreed a
further programme of action which foresees steps to strengthen the International Atomic
Energy Agency, measures to tighten export controls and to deal with illegal shipments
and illicit procurement. The EU is committed to achieving universal adherence to
multilateral treaty regimes, as well as to strengthening the treaties and their verification
provisions.

  - The European Union and Member States have intervened to help deal with regional
conflicts and to put failed states back on their feet, including in the Balkans, Afghanistan,
and in the DRC. Restoring good government to the Balkans, fostering democracy and
enabling the authorities there to tackle organised crime is one of the most effective ways
of dealing with organised crime within the EU.

In an era of globalisation, distant threats may be as much a concern as those that are near at
hand. Nuclear activities in North Korea, nuclear risks in South Asia, and proliferation in the
Middle East are all of concern to Europe.

Terrorists and criminals are now able to operate world-wide: their activities in central or
southeast Asia may be a threat to European countries or their citizens. Meanwhile, global
communication increases awareness in Europe of regional conflicts or humanitarian tragedies
anywhere in the world.

Our traditional concept of self-defence—up to and including the Cold War—was based on
the threat of invasion. With the new threats, the first line of defence will often be abroad. The
new threats are dynamic. The risks of proliferation grow over time; left alone, terrorist networks
will become ever more dangerous. State failure and organised crime spread if they are
neglected—as we have seen in West Africa. This implies that we should be ready to act before a
crisis occurs. Conflict prevention and threat prevention cannot start too early.

In contrast to the massive visible threat in the Cold War, none of the new threats is purely
military; nor can any be tackled by purely military means. Each requires a mixture of
instruments. Proliferation may be contained through export controls and attacked through
political, economic and other pressures while the underlying political causes are also tackled.
Dealing with terrorism may require a mixture of intelligence, police, judicial, military and other
means. In failed states, military instruments may be needed to restore order, humanitarian means
to tackle the immediate crisis. Regional conflicts need political solutions but military assets and
effective policing may be needed in the post conflict phase. Economic instruments serve
reconstruction, and civilian crisis management helps restore civil government. The European
Union is particularly well equipped to respond to such multi-faceted situations.

**Building Security in our Neighbourhood**

Even in an era of globalisation, geography is still important. It is in the European interest that
countries on our borders are well-governed. Neighbours who are engaged in violent conflict,
weak states where organised crime flourishes, dysfunctional societies or exploding population
growth on its borders all pose problems for Europe.

The integration of acceding states increases our security but also brings the EU closer to
troubled areas. Our task is to promote a ring of well-governed countries to the East of the
European Union and on the borders of the Mediterranean with whom we can enjoy close and
cooperative relations. The importance of this is best illustrated in the Balkans. Through our

#2628-E 4


-----

concerted efforts with the US, Russia, NATO and other international partners, the stability of the
region is no longer threatened by the outbreak of major conflict. The credibility of our foreign
policy depends on the consolidation of our achievements there. The European perspective offers
both a strategic objective and an incentive for reform.

It is not in our interest that enlargement should create new dividing lines in Europe. We need
to extend the benefits of economic and political cooperation to our neighbours in the East while
tackling political problems there. We should now take a stronger and more active interest in the
problems of the Southern Caucasus, which will in due course also be a neighbouring region.

Resolution of the Arab/Israeli conflict is a strategic priority for Europe. Without this, there
will be little chance of dealing with other problems in the Middle East. The European Union
must remain engaged and ready to commit resources to the problem until it is solved. The two
state solution—which Europe has long supported- is now widely accepted. Implementing it will
require a united and cooperative effort by the European Union, the United States, the United
Nations and Russia, and the countries of the region, but above all by the Israelis and the
Palestinians themselves.

The Mediterranean area generally continues to undergo serious problems of economic
stagnation, social unrest and unresolved conflicts. The European Union's interests require a
continued engagement with Mediterranean partners, through more effective economic, security
and cultural cooperation in the framework of the Barcelona Process. A broader engagement with
the Arab World should also be considered.

**An International Order Based on Effective Multilateralism**

In a world of global threats, global markets and global media, our security and prosperity
increasingly depend on an effective multilateral system. The development of a stronger
international society, well functioning international institutions and a rule-based international
order is our objective.

We are committed to upholding and developing International Law. The fundamental
framework for international relations is the United Nations Charter. The United Nations Security
Council has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.
Strengthening the United Nations, equipping it to fulfil its responsibilities and to act effectively,
is a European priority.

We want international organisations, regimes and treaties to be effective in confronting
threats to international peace and security, and must therefore be ready to act when their rules are
broken.

Key institutions in the international system, such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO)
and the International Financial Institutions, have extended their membership. China has joined
the WTO and Russia is negotiating its entry. It should be an objective for us to widen the
membership of such bodies while maintaining their high standards.

One of the core elements of the international system is the transatlantic relationship. This is
not only in our bilateral interest but strengthens the international community as a whole. NATO
is an important expression of this relationship.

Regional organisations also strengthen global governance. For the European Union, the
strength and effectiveness of the OSCE and the Council of Europe has a particular significance.
Other regional organisations such as ASEAN, MERCOSUR and the African Union make an
important contribution to a more orderly world.

It is a condition of a rule-based international order that law evolves in response to
developments such as proliferation, terrorism and global warming. We have an interest in further
developing existing institutions such as the World Trade Organisation and in supporting new
ones such as the International Criminal Court. Our own experience in Europe demonstrates that
security can be increased through confidence building and arms control regimes. Such
instruments can also make an important contribution to security and stability in our
neighbourhood and beyond.

The quality of international society depends on the quality of the governments that are its
foundation. The best protection for our security is a world of well-governed democratic states.
Spreading good governance, supporting social and political reform, dealing with corruption and
abuse of power, establishing the rule of law and protecting human rights are the best means of
strengthening the international order.

Trade and development policies can be powerful tools for promoting reform. As the world’s
largest provider of official assistance and its largest trading entity, the European Union and its
Member States are well placed to pursue these goals.

Contributing to better governance through assistance programmes, conditionality and
targeted trade measures remains an important feature in our policy that we should further
reinforce. A world seen as offering justice and opportunity for everyone will be more secure for
the European Union and its citizens.

A number of countries have placed themselves outside the bounds of international society.
Some have sought isolation; others persistently violate international norms. It is desirable that
such countries should rejoin the international community, and the EU should be ready to provide
assistance. Those who are unwilling to do so should understand that there is a price to be paid,
including in their relationship with the European Union.

### III. Policy Implications For Europe

The European Union has made progress towards a coherent foreign policy and effective crisis
management. We have instruments in place that can be used effectively, as we have
demonstrated in the Balkans and beyond. But if we are to make a contribution that matches our
potential, we need to be more active, more coherent and more capable. And we need to work
with others.

**More active in pursuing our strategic objectives. This applies to the full spectrum of**
instruments for crisis management and conflict prevention at our disposal, including political,
diplomatic, military and civilian, trade and development activities. Active policies are needed to
counter the new dynamic threats. We need to develop a strategic culture that fosters early, rapid,
and when necessary, robust intervention.

As a Union of 25 members, spending more than 160 billion Euros on defence, we should be
able to sustain several operations simultaneously. We could add particular value by developing
operations involving both military and civilian capabilities.

-----

The EU should support the United Nations as it responds to threats to international peace and
security. The EU is committed to reinforcing its cooperation with the UN to assist countries
emerging from conflicts, and to enhancing its support for the UN in short-term crisis
management situations.

We need to be able to act before countries around us deteriorate, when signs of proliferation
are detected, and before humanitarian emergencies arise. Preventive engagement can avoid more
serious problems in the future. A European Union which takes greater responsibility and which
is more active will be one which carries greater political weight.

**More Capable. A more capable Europe is within our grasp, though it will take time to**
realise our full potential. Actions underway—notably the establishment of a defence agency—
take us in the right direction.

To transform our militaries into more flexible, mobile forces, and to enable them to address
the new threats, more resources for defence and more effective use of resources are necessary.

Systematic use of pooled and shared assets would reduce duplications, overheads and, in the
medium-term, increase capabilities.

In almost every major intervention, military efficiency has been followed by civilian chaos.
We need greater capacity to bring all necessary civilian resources to bear in crisis and post crisis
situations.

Stronger diplomatic capability: we need a system that combines the resources of Member
States with those of EU institutions. Dealing with problems that are more distant and more
foreign requires better understanding and communication.

Common threat assessments are the best basis for common actions. This requires improved
sharing of intelligence among Member States and with partners.

As we increase capabilities in the different areas, we should think in terms of a wider
spectrum of missions. This might include joint disarmament operations, support for third
countries in combating terrorism and security sector reform. The last of these would be part of
broader institution building.

The EU-NATO permanent arrangements, in particular Berlin Plus, enhance the operational
capability of the EU and provide the framework for the strategic partnership between the two
organisations in crisis management. This reflects our common determination to tackle the
challenges of the new century.
**More Coherent. The point of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and European**
Security and Defence Policy is that we are stronger when we act together. Over recent years we
have created a number of different instruments, each of which has its own structure and
rationale.
The challenge now is to bring together the different instruments and capabilities: European
assistance programmes and the European Development Fund, military and civilian capabilities
from Member States and other instruments. All of these can have an impact on our security and
on that of third countries. Security is the first condition for development.
Diplomatic efforts, development, trade and environmental policies, should follow the same
agenda. In a crisis there is no substitute for unity of command.

-----

Better co-ordination between external action and Justice and Home Affairs policies is crucial
in the fight both against terrorism and organised crime.
Greater coherence is needed not only among EU instruments but also embracing the external
activities of the individual member states.
Coherent policies are also needed regionally, especially in dealing with conflict. Problems
are rarely solved on a single country basis, or without regional support, as in different ways
experience in both the Balkans and West Africa shows.
**Working with partners There are few if any problems we can deal with on our own. The**
threats described above are common threats, shared with all our closest partners. International
cooperation is a necessity. We need to pursue our objectives both through multilateral
cooperation in international organisations and through partnerships with key actors.
The transatlantic relationship is irreplaceable. Acting together, the European Union and the
United States can be a formidable force for good in the world. Our aim should be an effective
and balanced partnership with the USA. This is an additional reason for the EU to build up
further its capabilities and increase its coherence.
We should continue to work for closer relations with Russia, a major factor in our security
and prosperity. Respect for common values will reinforce progress towards a strategic
partnership.
Our history, geography and cultural ties give us links with every part of the world: our
neighbours in the Middle East, our partners in Africa, in Latin America, and in Asia. These
relationships are an important asset to build on. In particular we should look to develop strategic
partnerships, with Japan, China, Canada and India as well as with all those who share our goals
and values, and are prepared to act in their support.

### Conclusion

This is a world of new dangers but also of new opportunities. The European Union has the
potential to make a major contribution, both in dealing with the threats and in helping realise the
opportunities. An active and capable European Union would make an impact on a global scale.
In doing so, it would contribute to an effective multilateral system leading to a fairer, safer and
more united world.
