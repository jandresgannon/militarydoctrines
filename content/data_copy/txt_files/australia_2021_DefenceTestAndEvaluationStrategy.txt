# Defence Test & Evaluation (T&E) Strategy

##### Vision: T&E across Defence supports risk-based capability decisions and is actively supported by a strong sovereign base.


-----

## Introduction

The Defence Test and Evaluation (T&E) Strategy
provides a vision for T&E across Defence, and
articulates the desired 2030 future state of the
capability. The Strategy also:

      - summarises the current state of T&E in Defence

      - outlines the strategic drivers, and the needs for
change that Defence must address as part of a
wider sovereign T&E capability

      - summarises the 2030 future state

      - provides short, medium and longer term
horizon-based objectives along four priority lines
of effort, to improve the T&E capability to meet
Defence’s future requirements. The lines of effort
are:

º Governance and Assurance

º Workforce

º Defence Training and Test Environment

º Technology

      - provides achievable outcomes that can be **Implementation. The T&E Strategy will**

## Drivers for Change

**Drivers for Change**

**The geo-strategic environment and technology. Australia faces**      - changing geo-strategic

and more capable military systems enabled by technological change.
Rapid advances in technology has seen an increase in capabilities      - modern joint force
and networked systems that deliver effects across the five warfighting comprised of high levels

systems and domains

**Modern joint force. Interoperability across the warfighting domains**
will give the relatively small Australian Defence Force (ADF) a      - emerging technologies
competitive advantage. Activities such as T&E must continue to demanding new approaches.
ensure they meet the demands of a joint force commander.

**Competition for workforce. The scale of recapitalisation of Defence capability has placed increased**
pressure and competition on Australia’s small, highly skilled T&E workforce. A sustainable T&E Workforce
Plan is required that equally supports current and future needs.

**Leverage physical and synthetic environments. To meet the demands of the joint force, Defence must**
optimise training opportunities for testing of capability systems. This requires infrastructure investment that
integrates physical and synthetic capabilities, as part of a modern training and test environment.

**Industry and government capacity. Defence must better coordinate and manage its T&E resources and**
workforce, and engage across Government, industry and academia to build a more resilient sovereign T&E
capability.

**Emergence of new approaches to T&E. Verification and validation of emerging technologies requires**
new approaches to T&E. This includes not just the conduct of T&E, but also the application of new
technology to support it. This includes artificial intelligence, data analytics, robotics and synthetic
representations.
