#### Foreword by the Honourable Minister of Defence and Military Veterans, L.N. Sisulu, MP

###### In the 2010 budget Vote, we pro� led the conscious development of reliable, dependable human capital base within the Defence Force. To this end, we announced the establishment of the National Defence Service Force Commission, revitalisation of the Defence Reserves and  � nalisation of the non statutory Force Military Veterans Pension, to mention but a few. Auditable outputs have been recorded in so far as these are concerned and are evidenced by the Promulgation of Defence Amendment Act 22 of 2010, whose object is to provide for the establishment of the National Defence Force Service Commission charged with a role to create a separate dispensation for the Defence Force, creating a paradigm that prescribes contracts for Defence Reserves whilst protecting them from discrimination by employers and creditors.

 Stemming from the President’s announcement at a special Cabinet meeting on 25 October 2010, a new growth path for the country has been agreed upon. This path places people’s employment at the centre of government’s economic policy. Defence commits itself to support government’s intent in terms of inherent available Defence capabilities and initiatives such as the MSDS and National Youth Service system in contribution to national skills development and job creation.

 Notwithstanding the auditing standards that are continually being enhanced, the Ministry will earnestly pursue the realisation of a quali� cation free Audit. Some auditable strides have been registered which are a result of the multi-pronged strategy to realise the quali� cation free audit, of which operation “Clean Audit” is but one. Deepening in establishing internal controls that will help to proactively mitigate functions and processes that could lead to an audit quali� cation will be prioritised. A strong monitoring and evaluation capability will be enhanced.

 The role of Defence within the Government Cluster system in the International Co-operation Trade and Security (ICTS) Cluster, will continue to receive priority attention in order to strengthen South Africa’s support of international and regional peace, security and stability.

 The SANDF contributes with contingent force of 1229 men and women under the Mission dubbed MONUSCO in the DRC and 634 soldiers under the Mission code named UNAMID in Sudan. Apart from the troop contribution in the Peace Mission in the DRC, SANDF troops also provide post con� ict reconstruction in that country with the view to strengthening the weak state apparatus and institutions. In this respect the focus areas are integration and team building training, transformation process and general military training of the Armed Forces. On the basis of bilateral arrangements with Central African Republic, SANDF has deployed 49 men and women with the view to providing general military assistance in the form of training to the Armed Forces of said country.

 Internally, the SANDF has since April 2010 deployed for border safeguarding along the borders of RSA and her neighbouring countries. Currently, SANDF has already set its footprint along RSA/Zimbabwe Border and RSA/ Mozambique border and due to deploy along RSA/Lesotho border on 1 April 2011. State resources need to be mobilised more aggressively to ensure the stable roll out of Operation CORONA (border-safeguarding). Currently, Defence is furthermore exploring possibilities to ensure security against piracy prevails in the SADC waters on a bilateral and multinational basis. The piracy threat is real and therefore they is a need to ensure in accordance with safe guarding territorial integrity that we need to develop a plan on how to deal with this problem and ensure that our trade lines remain safe and secure.

 At the time of writing, the SANDF has joined forces with National Disaster Management Centre for humanitarian assistance community affected by � oods national. To this end, the SANDF has deployed air assets to airlift entrapped people to safety, as well as delivering food parcels for those in need. The mandate of the Defence remains that of Defence and protection of the, Republic, its territorial integrity and its people in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic and the principles on international law regulating the use of forces. 

 We have entered into a Delivery Agreement (DA) with the President to facilitate service delivery in terms of selected Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) outcomes. In the meanwhile Defence has implemented the outcomes based strategic planning approach in order to ensure that high performance levels are achieved and properly accounted for.  I am also a signatory to the delivery Agreements of Outcome 2, 3,


-----

###### and 5 and as such obligations that � ow from these delivery agreements must � nd expression in the planning instruments of the Constitutional institutions that service the Defence mandate, with the Defence Secretariat providing the essential norms and standards to guarantee implementation.

 The Strategic Plans are developed to give effect to the two constitutional entities that service the Defence Mandate which are the Defence Force and the Defence Secretariat re� ect, amongst others, the essence of the Delivery Agreement (DA) entered into, between myself and the Commander in Chief in terms of applicable Outcomes and provide parameters and expectations that I consider achievable for Defence. The alignment of Defence with the Constitutional and legislative mandate is re� ected through the pursuance of our identi� ed Outcomes, Outputs, Vision and Mission which will ensure that Defence remains relevant to the dynamic circumstances.

 Finally, allow me to re� ect a little on impact assessment of my Portfolio. During the Budget Vote 21 of both FY2009/10 and FY2010/11, I outlined the institutional reforms that will form the strategic levers of my transformation Agenda. In the FY 2009 Budget Vote, I indicated the need to provide a visible reward and recognition to all those that sacri� ced their well being to help us realise the freedoms that we now enjoy. As such Military Veterans were consciously my transformation agenda. To date the Department is indeed in place. The coming years will thus be characterised by initiatives to maximise the functionality of the organ of State by widening the footprint of a reliable and dependable service delivery focused Department.

 The execution of the Constitutional and legislative Defence mandate of both the Defence Secretariat and the South African National Defence Force are provided in the strategic and annual performance plans accompanying this Overarching Statement. These documents provide the required detailed information on the functioning of these two Defence entities.

 I am con� dent that through these planning instruments, distinctive features of the Defence Force will be protected whilst delivery to the citizens will be enhanced.

 (L.N. SISULU) MINISTER OF DEFENCE AND MILITARY VETERANS, MP

#### THE DEFENCE FUNCTION IN CONTEXT
###### DEFENCE CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE

 The primary object of the Defence function is to provide for the Defence and protection of the Republic, its territorial integrity and its people. The Constitution provides that the rendition of the Defence function should be done in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Constitution and the principles of international law regulating the use of force.

 The Department of Defence (DOD) derives its mandate primarily from section 200(2) of the Constitution[1] as well as section 227 of the Interim Constitution of the Republic of South Africa[2]. The Defence mandate is given substance by the Defence Act[3], the White Paper on Defence (1996) and the Defence Review (1998).

 The DOD comprises of the Defence Secretariat which is established in terms of Section 204 of the Defence Act and the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) established in terms of Section 200 (2) of the Interim Constitution[4].

 VISION

 Effective Defence for a democratic South Africa.

 MISSION

 To provide, manage, prepare and employ Defence capabilities commensurate with the needs of South Africa as regulated by the Constitution, national legislation and Parliamentary and Executive direction. The above will be provided through the proper management, provision, preparedness and employment of Defence capabilities, which are in line with the domestic and global needs of South Africa.

 THE DOD MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGIC FOCUS

 In the medium to long term, the DOD will execute its mandate through focusing on the following:

 �� To defend and protect South Africa, its sovereignty, its territorial integrity, its national interests and its people in accordance with the Constitution and principles of international law regulating the use of force.

 �� To contribute to freedom from fear and want, including the promotion of human security, both nationally and internationally.

 �� To contribute to a better life for the people of South Africa.

 Whilst emphasising its obligation, the DOD embraces Government’s initiatives and priorities to alleviate poverty and underdevelopment. The DOD support to these Government initiatives requires that:

 �� Defence capabilities are enhanced and maintained.

 �� Peace, security and con� dence-building in the SADC region and the rest of the continent are promoted through constructive dialogue aimed at nurturing sound Defence diplomatic relations and projecting South Africa’s foreign policy principles and objectives;

 �� The Government’s policy to resolve con� icts peacefully through recognised international instruments and mechanisms be supported by deploying the SANDF in international peace missions;

 �� The Government’s diplomatic engagements are supported through participation in multilateral institutions such as the SADC, AU and UN.

###### THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE AND MILITARY VETERANS (MOD&MV) PRIORITIES

 For the period ahead, the Minister has made a determination of matters considered important for the DOD to pursue as strategic priorities. The execution of these strategic priorities will enhance the effective realisation of the Defence mandate. Monitoring and evaluation of performance against these identi� ed strategic priorities will test the extent to which the Defence function has been able to “do things differently and achieve more with less”. The strategic priorities identi� ed are as follows:

 �� Execution of the Border Safeguarding Function. The safeguarding of the borders of South Africa remains one of the key functions of the SANDF. The phased in approach, adopted by the SANDF in undertaking this function, will continue in FY2011/12 with the � nal phase completed in FY2012/13.

 �� Establishment of the New Service Dispensation. The Defence Amendment Act, 22 of 2011, has been enacted. As intended, the Defence Amendment Act has created a new service dispensation for the SANDF members. In FY2011/12 the DOD shall focus on the implementation of the afore-mentioned  amendment in order to realise this dispensation. Consequential amendments to other Acts will also be taken into account.

 �� Enhancement of the SANDF’s Landward Defence Capabilities. In order to undertake all required missions, the enhancement of the Landward Defence Capabilities is essential. For the Landward Defence Capability to operate jointly with the Air Defence and Maritime Defence Capabilities, this enhancement is considered a priority. The Landward Defence Capability has not enjoyed the advantage of being part of the Strategic Defence Packages and is thus lacking technologically advanced Primary Mission Equipment.

 �� Maritime Security. The Defence and security of South Africa is inextricably linked to that of the region and the continent. Being a littoral country, South Africa needs to have a balanced maritime capability to effectively respond to arising maritime security threats affecting South Africa. 

 �� Job Creation. In support of the government initiative on job creation, the DOD plans to create job opportunities in the following areas:

 �� Filling of all 1 401 vacant funded positions in the DOD. �� Recruitment of 5 700 young South Africans per year to the Military Skills Development System (MSDS). �� Call up of 16 400 Defence Reserve members per year to undertake speci� c tasks over speci� c periods of time. �� The enhancement of the DOD Works Capability to create opportunities for people with technical skills within the SANDF. This in turn will allow for the SANDF intakes to increase with the same number of the SANDF members transferred to the DOD Works Capability.  �� Creation of job opportunities in the Defence Industry through approved DOD projects.

 �� Enhancement of the SANDF’s Peacekeeping Capability (SANDF Deployability). The role of the SANDF in promoting peace and security in the region and the continent necessitates the enhancement of the SANDF’s peacekeeping capability that will include the SANDF’s Forward Deployment Capability.

 �� National Youth Service. The implementation of the National Youth Service by using core Defence capabilities to provide initial training to the youth prior to absorption into service delivery departments.

 �� Revitalisation of the Reserves. As part of the One Force concept, the Reserves must be transformed and revitalised to ful� l the various important Defence roles allocated to them.

 �� Restructuring and Support of the Defence Industry. The restructuring should focus on Defence capability, the interactive framework and function alignment in order to properly synchronise these with the requirements and mandate of Defence. The emphasis should be on Governance, Risk Management, Compliance and Accountability framework applicable within Defence Portfolio.

 �� Department of Defence Works Capability. The state of the DOD facilities portfolio calls for the review of the existing arrangements for the repair and maintenance of Defence facilities. The establishment of the DOD Works Capability seeks to achieve an end state where the DOD will have an in-house capacity that will ultimately assume the full responsibility of the Defence facilities repair and maintenance. The DOD Works Capability will at the same time create job opportunities in the DOD, thus contributing to the Government’s priority of job creation.

 DEFENCE OUTCOMES
 The Defence outcomes relate to the medium-term results that are the consequence of achieving speci� c Departmental outputs Outcomes are “what we wish to achieve” The Defence Outcomes are as follows:


-----

###### �� Enhanced Civil Control of the Department of Defence.

 �� RSA is Defended and Protected. DEFENCE OUTPUTS

###### INFORMATION SYSTEMS SUPPORTING DOD PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

 Since 2005, the DOD has developed an information system called “GEJIMA” which provides for one-stop-shop capturing of performance information. The aforementioned system is managed by the State Information, Technology Agency (SITA), and is utilised to conduct gap and trend analysis with regards to performance information. Notwithstanding the challenges with the current local area networks experienced in certain domains within the DOD, the Department is determined to improve on the integrity, currency and reliability of the performance information. In cases of infrastructural failures, capturing of data on the system as it relates to planning and performance data is undertaken at the SITA of� ces and the consolidated information is con� rmed by Departmental planning authorities.

###### FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN ALLOCATION OF THE DEFENCE PROGRAMMES

 The composition of the Defence’s Budget Programmes as published in the Estimates of National Expenditure (ENE) 2011, Vote 22 is as provided the Table below.

5 Data as reported for the � rst two quarters of the FY2010/11.
6 The indicator has been changed from 2011/12 to only re� ect “large-scale” operations, as the requirement for general military assistance and smallscale operations cannot be accurately projected. Currently the requirement is for two large-scale (Battalion + [More than 800 members]) operations,
but contingency planning is being done to be prepared for a third operation of limited duration, should it be required.
7 The large number in 2010 was due to operations in support of the 2010 FIFA World Cup and the gradual increase from 2011/12 onwards is the result of
the phasing in of border safeguarding operations.

###### DOD EXPENDITURE TRENDS The detail of DOD’s estimated expenditure is re� ected in Government’s Estimate of National Expenditure 2011 and is included in the Appropriation Bill 2011 tabled in Parliament on 23 February 2011.

 DEPARTMENTAL RECEIPTS

 Departmental receipts are mainly from the sale of redundant or obsolete equipment and Defence matériel, the rental of accommodation to personnel, and board and lodging. The reason for the � uctuations in real departmental receipts, speci� cally � nancial transactions in assets and liabilities, is due to the unpredictable nature of reimbursements for peace support operations. Revenue collection projections are also hampered by the unpredictable nature of the potential buyers of SANDF equipment, and by international treaties, protocols and licence agreements. Between FY2009/10 and FY2013/14, revenue is expected to increase from R676.7 million to R885.9 million, at an average annual rate of 7.7 percent.
