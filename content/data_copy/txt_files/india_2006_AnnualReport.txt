 - and maritime borders with five countries.


1.1 India’s national security environment is
determined by a complex interplay of its
geographical attributes, historical legacy, and
socio-economic circumstances as well as regional
and global developments. India is the seventh
largest country in the world with a land area of
3.2 million square kilometres, a land boundary of
15,000 kilometres, peninsular coastline of 7700
kilometres, 600 island territories and an Exclusive
Economic Zone of 2.5 million square kilometres.
Some of the island territories in the east are 1300
kilometres away from the mainland and virtually
adjacent to India’s ASEAN neighbours. India
shares land borders with seven countries including Bangladesh (4096 kms), China (3439
kms), Pakistan (3325 kms) and Myanmar (1643
kms) - and maritime borders with five countries.

1.2 Given the size of the country and its role
in the comity of nations, our security concerns
and interests are not limited to our immediate
neighbourhood. India’s area of security interest
clearly extends beyond the confines of the
conventional geographical definition of South
Asia. Given its size, geographical location, trade
links and the EEZ, India’s security environment
extends from the Persian Gulf to the straits of
Malacca across the Indian Ocean, including the
Central Asian region in the North West, China in
the North East and South East Asia.

1.3 With geo-economics gaining precedence
over geo-politics, the tasking of defence forces
the world over, is undergoing a sea change. Our


Armed Forces are now playing a pivotal role in
creating stable conditions for the nation’s
economic development. With its economy
growing at over 8% per annum last year and set
to rise further, India’s one billion people are
increasingly becoming an engine of regional and
global growth and prosperity. Software,
manufacturing, agriculture, nuclear energy,
space, disaster management, maritime affairs,
entertainment and culture are only some of the
areas in which India’s role is becoming
increasingly vital for the region and the world.
With the steady growth of the Indian economy,
India has now a significant stake in a stable world.

1.4 There are grave challenges facing the
region. While India and some other littoral states
appear to be on a path of sustained economic
progress, high levels of poverty characterise most
of the region. As per rough estimates, it is also
the locus of 70% of the world’s natural disasters.
The presence of a number of nuclear weapon or
nuclear capable states makes the situation even
more critical. In fact India has to operate in a
neighbourhood fraught with chronic political
instability. There is also an apprehension that the
sources of conflict between the states will multiply
in the coming days as there will be an intense
competition among states for water and nonrenewable energy resources like oil. India has to
adopt a forward looking policy of constructive
engagement with all its neighbours to take on
these challenges in future.


-----

1.5 Unlike the other major oceans of the world,
the Indian Ocean is bounded by landmasses.
Flow of shipping into the Indian Ocean is impeded
by many sensitive choke points. Indian Ocean can
be accessed from the West only via the Cape of
Good Hope; from the North via the Straits of
Hormuz and the Persian Gulf; from the East via
the Straits of Malacca, the Sunda and LombokStraits and the Ombai-Wetar-Straits. It is well
known that oil is a critical factor in influencing the
geo-political strategies of a nation, and any
disturbance in its supply could have serious
security ramifications. Considering the fact that
India, China and Japan are relying on oil
shipments to push forward their economies, it is
natural that these countries are sensitive to the
security of the sea-lanes of communication
(SLOCs) and choke points of the region. Major
energy lifelines of the world, carrying 66% of the
total world oil trade, pass in close proximity to
India, thereby placing a prime responsibility


towards safety of this key energy flow. This can
only be achieved by having visible and potent
defence forces that can effectively deter attempts
by any state or non-state actors to destabilize the
trade routes. India is a major maritime country in
Asia, with blue water – capable Navy,
commensurate with its responsibilities and
commitments. Apart from the geo-strategic
importance of the straits, the increased incidences
of maritime crime are prompting several regional
and extra-regional countries to discuss and move
towards maritime security cooperation.

1.6 It is a fact of life that the end of the Cold
War has not made the world any safer.
Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and
missiles and their related technologies continue
to threaten regional and international security.
India is deeply concerned at the nuclear test
conducted by DPRK in violation of its international
commitments. The test confirms vividly the true


Infantry soldiers crossing a riverine obstacle in the North East


-----

extent and depth of clandestine transfers that
have taken place to DPRK. India has all along
expressed its concern regarding such
proliferation. At the global level there is a wider
recognition of India as a responsible power and
a growing desire to work with India to eliminate
such threats. India has expressed its readiness
to be part of any constructive effort at the
international level to ensure regional and global
security.

1.7 At a time when the international scenario
is surcharged with violence, insecurity and
tension, it is comforting to see in
our immediate neighbourhood that **_At the global level_**
the political violence and social **_there is a wider_**
turmoil in Nepal have tapered out,
with political space opening up for **_a responsible power_**
popular democracy. It is
encouraging to see the **_to work with India to_**
reconciliation process between the **_eliminate nuclear_**
Seven Party Alliance and Maoists **_threats. India has_**
moving ahead. However, the **_expressed its_**
overall security environment in our
immediate and extended
neighbourhood has continued to **_at the international_**
deteriorate over the years and **_level to ensure_**
there is a need to continuously **_regional and global_**
monitor and analyze developments **_security._**
impinging upon our security. The
menace of international and cross-border
terrorism is growing rapidly in all parts of the world,
both in magnitude and in sophistication. Similarly,
employment of subversive tactics for resolution
of inter-state disputes is continuing. All these
factors pose new challenges to international
peace and security and need to be taken into
account for determining the role to be played by
India in the future.

1.8 The global ascendancy in violence directly
impacts on India’s internal security scenario. The
violence level in the North East has shown a
marginal increase in 2006, mainly in Assam and


Nagaland . Terrorist violence was also witnessed
during the year in Varanasi, Mumbai, Malegaon
and other parts of India, in which the role of
externally supported terrorist groups was strongly
evident. Naxal violence is also an area of concern.
While the number of naxal violent incidents has
shown a marginal decrease in 2006, casualties
of civilians and security personnel have remained
at the same level as in 2005.

1.9 On the Jammu & Kashmir issue, India is
ready to look at options, short of redrawing the
boundaries. On 24 March 2006 and again on 20
December 2006 at Amritsar, the
Prime Minister declared India’s
readiness to find a pragmatic
solution to resolve the J&K issue. He
also envisaged a situation where the
two parts of Jammu & Kashmir can,
with active encouragement of the
governments of India and Pakistan,
work out cooperative, consultative
mechanisms so as to maximize the
gains of cooperation in solving
problems of social and economic
development of the region.

1.10 India is continuing to have
security concerns with Pakistan on
cross-border terrorism. Terrorist
groups continue to operate freely in
Pakistan. They also find shelter, support and
training for operations across the border/LOC
from elements in Pakistan. Recent incidents of
terrorism and suicide bombings in some countries
have demonstrated the ever-increasing reach of
Pakistan-based terrorist organisations, such as
the homegrown Lashkar-e-Taiba. India is
committed to peace, friendship and good
neighbourly relations with the people and the
government of Pakistan. In pursuance of this goal,
Government of India has taken a number of policy
initiatives. It has proposed several confidencebuilding measures aimed at enlarging the areas


-----

of convergence and building trust. We have
repeatedly reiterated the need for Pakistan to fulfil
its commitment outlined in the joint Press
Statement of 06 January 2004 of not permitting
the use of territory under its control to support
terrorism in any manner. In fact, the whole
dialogue process hinges on building an
atmosphere of trust and confidence, free from
violence and terror. Infiltration has to stop and
Pakistan needs to take decisive action on
dismantling the infrastructures of terrorism. For
an effective end to terrorism, the training camps,
launching pads and communication networks of
terrorist organizations must be eliminated. There
cannot be a segmented approach to terror.

1.11 In the wake of Mumbai blasts, Prime Minister
declared that the terror modules behind the dastardly
attacks in Mumbai on 11 July 2006 are instigated,
inspired and supported by elements across the
border. India has tried to impress upon the
Government of Pakistan that it is extremely difficult
for any Government to carry forward the peace
process unless acts of terrorism are controlled. As


a positive move, India and Pakistan have instituted
a Joint Anti- Terror mechanism in November 2006.
It is India’s hope that demonstrable action will be
taken by Pakistan against terrorism, and make this
mechanism work effectively.

1.12 India-China relations are progressing.
China today is India’s second largest trading
partner with over 20 billion US dollars worth trade
a year. Mr. Hu Jintao’s visit in November 2006 is
the first visit by a Chinese President to India in
ten years. The Joint Declaration issued during the
visit contains a ten-pronged strategy for the
development of the India-China “strategic and
cooperative partnership”. Earlier, Premier Wen
Jiabao’s visit to India in April 2005 had yielded an
important agreement on the political parameters
and guiding principles for the settlement of the
boundary question. The Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) signed on the 29 May 2006
during the visit of Defence Minister to China
envisages regular and institutional contacts
between the armed forces and defence officials
and experts of the two countries. This MOU is

-----

expected to serve as an instrument for a regular
and sustained dialogue on defence issues
between the two countries. Peace and tranquillity
continued along the long India-China border as
did differences in perception with regard to the
boundary issue.

1.13 China’s military modernisation, with
sustained double-digit growth in its defence
budget for over a decade and continued
upgradation of its nuclear and missile assets,
development of infrastructure in the India-China
border areas and its growing defence links with
some of India’s neighbours continue to be
monitored closely. The Chinese assistance to
Pakistan’s nuclear and missile programme has
been a matter of concern as it has adversely
impacted on India’s national security environment.
We have also taken note of the recent destruction
by China of one of its own satellites in polar orbit
through direct ascent anti-satellite test.

1.14 India is committed to developing close,
friendly and mutually beneficial relations with
Bangladesh. Although India appreciates the


commitment and assurance given by the
Government of Bangladesh that its territory will
not be allowed to be used for activities inimical to
India, we are yet to see the commitment being
translated into concrete and visible action. The
rise of fundamentalism in Bangladesh is a threat
not just to Bangladesh but also to the entire region
including India. India is seriously concerned about
the recent involvement of certain Bangladesh
outfits or nationals in terrorist activities within India.
India wishes to see a strong, stable and
prosperous Bangladesh. India will be happy to
extend all assistance and cooperation to help
Bangladesh achieve that goal.

1.15 India has very strong and traditional
people – to – people ties with Nepal, which also
extends to their armed forces. A unique feature
of this relationship is that we have open borders
and a large number of Nepalese citizens serve in
the Indian armed forces. We also play a key role
in training the Nepalese forces.

1.16 Momentous developments have taken
place in Nepal in the recent past. The people of


Patrolling along the fence at LOC in J&K


-----

Nepal have demonstrated their disenchantment
with monarchy and have asserted their rights to
adopt a more liberal form of democratic
government. As a result of this popular movement,
spearheaded by the Maoists of Nepal, a new
Seven Party Alliance government has been
formed.  We respect the wishes of the Nepalese
people in whatever future political arrangements
they choose. We wish to see a peaceful, stable,
and prosperous Nepal. The most important issue


confronting Nepal at the moment is the
rehabilitation of its economic, social and political
fabric and rapid economic and social
development. India is willing to provide necessary
assistance within its means, in Nepal’s effort to
move forward.

1.17 India – Afghanistan bilateral relations are
fast moving towards a partnership, which is very
special to us. A sovereign, stable, democratic
and prosperous Afghanistan is not
only in India’s best interest but also
essential for peace and stability in the
region. India has been closely
associated in Afghanistan’s
reconstruction. While India will not get
militarily involved in Afghanistan
without a UN mandate, it has been
fully involved in rebuilding
Afghanistan’s civil society, in the fields
of transportation, health, education
and industry, with a commitment of
over US$ 600 million in assistance in
these fields. We need to closely watch
the changing scenario in Afghanistan
since it has ramifications on the
security environment of the region.
We wish to see a strong Afghanistan
capable of protecting its frontiers and
citizens and becoming a democratic
and self-reliant member of the
international community.


1.18 India is concerned over the
escalation of violence in the recent
months in some parts of Afghanistan.
Indulgence in violence by remnant
elements of Taliban, Al-Qaeda and
Hizb-e-Islami continue to be the
primary source of insecurity. India is
particularly concerned about the antiIndia rhetoric being used by some of
Troops slithering down Army aviation helicopter these terrorist groups.

1.19 Traditionally, India has
enjoyed friendly relations with its

**_associated in_**

**_Afghanistan’s_**

recent times, the relationship has
acquired a strong economic

**_India will not get_**

dimension. India has an abiding
interest in the security of Sri Lanka
and is committed to its unity,

As regards the ethnic issue, India

historic and our relationship is **_US$ 600 million in_**
extremely close. These relations are **_assistance in these_**
conducted in a spirit of complete **_fields._**
mutual understanding and respect,
and rest on solid foundations.

1.21 Myanmar has considerable significance
for our strategic interests. Myanmar borders our


north-eastern states affected by
insurgency. In the past the
Myanmar army has conducted
operations against Indian insurgent
groups operating from Myanmar.
There have been regular
exchanges of high level visits and
a bilateral interaction mechanism in
defence cooperation is in place.

1.22 India – Maldives relations
are close and cordial. Both the
countries remain engaged in
developing infrastructure and
capacity building in the Maldives
through economic and technical
assistance programmes, besides
providing training facilities to
Maldivian nationals in various fields.

1.23 The security scenario in
the extended neighbourhood of India in
Southeast, East, West and Central Asia has been
closely watched, as it evolved during the year.
The conflicts in Iraq, the Israel – Palestine


Combat Manoeuvres by IN Ships during Defence of Gujarat Exercise 2006


-----

confabulations, West’s growing confrontations
with Iran and North Korea have impacted India’s
economic and energy security concerns
adversely. These developments are also a matter
of concern to us, as we share close cultural and
civilizational affinities with some of these troubled
states.

1.24 To sum up, India’s relationship with all
her neighbours is cordial and wide-ranging. There
are however, a few areas of increasing concern:

(a) Promotion of terrorism by fundamentalist
groups in the neighbourhood.

(b) Large scale human migration **_India hopes that its_**
into India across our borders, **_rapidly expanding_**
by people seeking a better
economic and stable life. **_and ties with all_**

(c) Proliferation of Weapons of **_friendly countries_**
Mass Destruction (WMD) and **_including its main_**
missiles, especially the
development of mobile and **_as France, Israel,_**
increasingly accurate solid
fuel missiles by Pakistan.

(d) Continuation of political

**_the security_**

instability in India’s neighbour
**_environment in the_**

hood.

**_region, but also the_**

1.25 An unprecedented **_global security_**
proliferation of narcotics and small **_scenario._**
arms trafficking in the region
threatens the stability of states and societies in
the region. India is located in the middle of the
world’s major narcotics producing and exporting
regions, viz., North West Pakistan and
Afghanistan on the one side and Myanmar on the
other. The involvement of insurgent and criminal
groups in the global drug trade is also a major
cause for concern. Militant training camps in
Taliban-controlled areas in Afghanistan are a
major source of international terrorist activities.

1.26 In the coming years, India hopes that its
rapidly expanding defence cooperation and ties


with all friendly countries including its main
defence partners such as France, Israel, Russia,
United States, and United Kingdom will enhance
not just the security environment in the region,
but also the global security scenario. India is
making every effort to enhance its defence ties
with its extended neighbourhood in Southeast
Asia, Northeast Asia, Central Asia, the Gulf and
Middle East regions. Within her means and
resources, India seeks to extend its ties with the
countries in other parts of the world including
Africa, Europe and Latin America by sharing with
them our growing expertise in
defence matters.

1.27 As India’s economy is
growing, it has an interest in a safe,
secure and stable neighbourhood.
India is ready to join any endeavour
at the regional or international level
to bring peace, prosperity and
stability to the region and the world.
India has a unique ability to evolve
as a peaceful, multi-cultural society,
a functioning democracy and a
vibrant economy. There is an
understanding gaining strength in
India that prosperity for only the
privileged is unsustainable. India is
prepared to share its experience with others in
the region and has invited its neighbours to
participate in its economy and to reap the benefits
of its growing market.

1.28 At the same time, we understand that a
strong defence is a necessary prerequisite for
growth and stability. In fact, India is fully alive to
issues concerning its defence and security and
is committed to raising the levels of its defence
preparedness to deter any potential threat
emerging from outside. In fashioning its nuclear
doctrine of credible minimum deterrence, India


-----

has demonstrated a defensive posture, restraint
and responsibility. India has a declared policy of
no-first-use of nuclear weapons and a firm
commitment to avoidance of nuclear weapons
against non-nuclear weapon states, except in the
event of major WMD attack. India is willing to
strengthen the commitment on no-first-use by
undertaking bilateral agreements as well as
engaging in discussions on a global no-first-use


agreement. India believes that a global no-firstuse agreement would be the first step towards
the delegitimisation of nuclear weapons. India’s
commitment to global, non-discriminatory nuclear
disarmament, which would enhance its security
and that of all states, remains unaltered. With
reference to recent developments, India has made
clear that it does not support the emergence of
new nuclear weapon states.

###### ORGANISATION AND FUNCTIONS OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE

Beating Retreat


-----

###### he principal task of the Ministry is to obtain policy directions of the Government on all defence and security related

# T

###### matters and communicate them for implementation to the Services Headquarters, Inter-Service Organisations, Production Establishments and Research & Development Organisations.


###### ORGANISATIONAL SET-UP AND FUNCTIONS

2.1 After independence Ministry of Defence
was created under the charge of a Cabinet
Minister, and, each Service was placed under its
own Commander-in-Chief. In 1955, the
Commanders-in-Chief were renamed as the Chief
of the Army Staff, the Chief of the Naval Staff and
the Chief of the Air Staff. In November 1962, a
Department of Defence Production was set up to
deal with research, development and production
of defence equipment. In November 1965, the
Department of Defence Supplies was created for
planning and execution of schemes for import
substitution of defence requirements. These two
Departments were later merged to form the
Department of Defence Production and Supplies.
In 2004, the name of Department of Defence
Production and Supplies was changed to
Department of Defence Production. In 1980, the
Department of Defence Research and
Development was created. In 2004, the
Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare was
created.

2.2 The Defence Secretary functions as head
of the Department of Defence and is additionally
responsible for co-ordinating the activities of the
four Departments in the Ministry.

###### DEPARTMENTS

2.3 The principal task of the Ministry is to
frame policy directions  on defence and security


related matters and communicate them for
implementation to the Services Headquarters,
Inter-Service Organisations, Production
Establishments and Research & Development
Organisations. It is required to ensure effective
implementation of the Government’s policy
directions and the execution of approved
programmes within the allocated resources.

2.4   The principal functions of the Departments
are as follows:

(i) The Department of Defence deals with the
Integrated Defence Staff (IDS) and three
Services and various Inter-Service
Organisations. It is responsible for the
Defence Budget, establishment matters,
defence policy, matters relating to
Parliament, defence co-operation with
foreign countries and co-ordination of all
defence related activities.

(ii) The Department of Defence Production is
headed by a Secretary and deals with
matters pertaining to defence production,
indigenisation of imported stores,
equipment and spares, planning and control
of departmental production units of the
Ordnance Factory Board and Defence
Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs).

(iii) The Department of Defence Research and
Development is headed by a Secretary, who
is the Scientific Adviser to the Raksha
Mantri. Its function is to advise the
Government on scientific aspects of military


-----

equipment and logistics and the formulation
of research, design and development plans
for equipment required by the Services.

(iv) The Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare
is headed by a Special Secretary and deals
with all resettlement, welfare and
pensionary matters of Ex-Servicemen.

2.5 A list of subjects dealt with by various
Departments and Finance Division of the
Ministry of Defence is given in Appendix-I to this
report.

2.6 The three Services Headquarters, viz., the
Army Headquarters, the Naval Headquarters and
the Air Headquarters function
under the Chief of the Army Staff **_To ensure_**
(COAS), the Chief of the Naval **_transparency in_**
Staff (CNS) and the Chief of the Air
Staff (CAS) respectively. They are **_Procurement_**
assisted by their Principal Staff

**_acquisition and_**

Officers (PSOs). The Inter-Service
Organisations, under the

**_Manual for revenue_**

Department of Defence are

**_procurements, have_**

responsible for carrying out tasks
related to common needs of the
three Services such as medical
care, public relations and personnel management
of civilian staff in the Defence Headquarters.

2.7 A number of Committees dealing with
defence related activities assist the Raksha
Mantri. The Chiefs of Staff Committee is a forum
for the Service Chiefs to discuss matters having
a bearing on the activities of the Services and
also to advise the Ministry. The position of
Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee
devolves on the longest serving Chief of Staff,
and consequently rotates amongst the three
Services. To facilitate the work of the Chiefs of
Staff Committee, a number of sub-committees
have been established.


2.8 Information regarding the Ministers in the
Ministry of Defence, the Chiefs of Staff, the
Secretaries in the Departments of the Ministry and
the Secretary (Defence Finance)/ Financial
Advisor (Defence Services) who held positions
from April 1, 2006 onwards is given in AppendixII to this report.

###### DEFENCE (FINANCE)

2.9  Finance Division in the Ministry of Defence,
deals with all matters having a financial
implication. This Division is headed by Secretary
(Defence Finance) and is fully integrated with the
Ministry of Defence and performs an advisory role.

2.10 To facilitate greater
efficiency in administration and
quicker disposal of cases Ministry of
Defence enjoys enhanced
delegated financial powers in
consultation with the Finance
Division. With a view to ensuring
transparency in exercise of these
powers and compliance with the laid
down policy guidelines, Defence
Procurement Procedure and
Defence Procurement Manual were
brought out in 2005. While the
Defence Procurement Procedure deals with
capital acquisitions, the Defence Procurement
Manual deals with revenue procurements. The
Defence Procurement Procedure and Defence
Procurement Manual were revised in 2006 to
incorporate experiences gained since 2005.

2.11 Some of the important features of the
Defence Procurement Procedure 2006 are:

(a) All decisions to be taken simultaneously
for reducing the timeframe for acquisitions;

(b) Enhanced transparency by placing the
generic requirements on Ministry of
Defence website and generating vendor
registration through internet;

**_Pensions._**

contracts above Rs
300 crores.

2.12 The Defence Procurement Procedure2006 contains Fast Track Procedure 2006 as also
the Defence Procurement Procedure for the
‘Make’ category.

2.13 Major highlights of the Defence
Procurement Manual 2006 are as follows:

(a) Incorporation of GFR – 2005 provisions
relating to Limited Tender Enquiry, Cash
purchase limit, purchase through
Proprietary Article Certificate, price variation
clause and limits for advance payment;

(b) Apportioning quantity to L2 and L3 when
L1 does not have capacity to supply as per
RFP requirement, at L1’s rate, in line with
CVC’s guidelines;

(c) Re-floating tenders, when the Tender
Evaluation Committee shortlists only one
vendor, after reformulating Services
Qualitative Requirement to ensure
competitive bidding.

(d) Providing level playing field to indigenous
vendors vis-à-vis foreign vendors by
comparing CIF price with indigenous
vendors’ offer without Excise Duty, Sales
Tax and local levies.

(e) Rate contract for common user items up to
three years to ensure economy of scale


while providing safeguard provisions like fall
clause and short closure in the event of fall
in prices.

(f) Reduction in repeat order quantity to 50%,
with such orders to be placed within six
months by certifying no downward trend in
prices.

2.14 Financial powers are further delegated to
various echelons in the Services. These powers
are also generally exercised by the designated
competent financial authority in consultation with
and with the concurrence of the designated
integrated financial advisors. In July 2006 more
financial powers were delegated to all the three
Services. This includes powers for capital
schemes up to Rs 10 crores.

2.15 Finance Division prepares and monitors the
Defence Services Estimates, Civil Estimates of
the Ministry of Defence and the Estimates in
respect of Defence Pensions. Break-up of the
actual expenditure for the years 2004-05 and
2005-06, as also the Revised Estimates for 200607 and Budget Estimates for 2007-08 are given
in the Tables and charts at the end of this Section.

2.16 Summary of the latest report of the
Comptroller & Auditor General on the working of
the Ministry of Defence is given in Appendix III to
this Annual Report.

###### he Indian Army is equipped with requisite modern technology and equipment to meet all

# T

###### challenges.


3.1 The contours of India’s security
challenges are numerous and varied. To the
military complexities arising out of the problems
of unsettled borders, the challenges of the proxy
war in Jammu and Kashmir, the insurgency in the
North East and the growing naxal menace in
Central India, we can now add the ever enlarging
spectre of terrorism and numerous non-military
threats to our security. The Armed Forces are
constantly reviewing preparedness to meet these
challenges.


###### MODERNISATION OF ARMY

3.2 Modernization and upgradation of the
Armed Forces is a continuous process. The Indian
Army is equipped with requisite modern
technology and equipment to enhance its combat
capabilities. The focus of modernization has been
on Capability for Network Centre Warfare, NBC
Protection, Increased mobility, Improvement in fire
power, Enhanced surveillance capability and
Night fighting capabilities.

3.3 **_Mechanized Forces: Mechanized_**
Forces’ ability to operate by night is being
addressed on priority, by procurement of a range
of Night Vision Devices. The mobility and
navigational capabilities of T-72 tank are being
enhanced by upgradation of its power pack and
Global Positioning System (GPS) and Advanced
Land Navigation System (ALNS).

3.4 **_Artillery: Main focus for Artillery has been_**
acquisition and engagement of long

modernization plan for the Artillery **_relieve the Regular_**
includes acquisition of long range **_Army of their static_**
guns and missiles along with all
weather surveillance devices. **_civil authorities in_**

3.5 **_Army Air Defence: Army_**

**_calamities and_**

Air Defence is acquiring new guns

**_maintenance of_**

(Static/ Self Propelled) as well as

**_essential services._**

upgrading their existing weapon
system. An important aspect is early fructification
of an automated Control and Reporting System.
The Army Air Defence equipment at present in
service are RADAR Flay catcher, STRELA 10M.
ISPTA Lakshya, ZU-23MM-2B Gun, IGLA 1M
Missile and KVADRAT Missile System.


3.6 **_Aviation: The capabilities of Army_**
Aviation are being strengthened by replacing
existing utility helicopters with higher capacity
helicopters and induction of armed helicopter for
special operations as well as Tactical Battle
Support Helicopters.

3.7 **_Engineers: Procurement of state-of-the-_**
art Mine Mark-II has enhanced the deterring
power of our minefields. The Army
has also achieved the capability of
detecting and assessing levels of
radiological, chemical and
biological contamination so as to
provide adequate safeguard to the
troops.

3.8 **_Signals: For effective_**
communication, the following
nationwide communication
networks have been
commissioned to strengthen the
communication at strategic, operational and
tactical level:
(a) Army wide Area Network (AWAN)

(b) Mobile Satellite Station (MSS) Hub


Cheetah Helicopters ready for operations in high altitude conditions


-----

(c) Large Very Small Aperture Terminal
(LVSAT) Phase I

(d) Army Static Switch Communication Network
(ASCON) Phase-III

3.9 **_Infantry: The modernized Infantry_**
Battalion of the Indian Army is provided with the
state-of-the-art weapon systems of great lethality,
range and precision, thermal imaging devices,
bullet and mine-proof vehicles and secure radio
sets enhancing its combat potential, surveillance
and counter-insurgency capabilities.

3.10 **_Containerization of Ammunition and_**
**_Explosives: For safe and secured transportation_**
of ammunition and explosives through containers,
a contract has been concluded with M/S Container
Corporation of India Ltd (CONCOR). The
ammunition, explosives and other
sensitive stores are now being
transported in sealed containers **_and enthusiastic_**
with enhanced security measures. **_participation of the_**
Armoured escorts with “Live-in” **_people in the local_**
Containers with all essential
facilities accompany the containers.
Initially, M/s CONCOR has **_the desire of the_**
established four serving terminals
for providing containers. **_peace._**

###### TERRITORIAL ARMY

3.11 The Territorial Army (TA) is a voluntary,
part time Army consisting of otherwise gainfully
employed Indian citizens, eager to perform their
role in the country’s defence in the event of a
national emergency by relieving the Regular
Army of their static duties and to aid the civil
authorities in dealing with natural calamities and
maintenance of essential services. It also
provides units for the Regular Army, when
required. There are a total of 66 TA Units of all
types including 42 non-departmental Infantry
Battalions/ units and 24 Departmental Battalions.
There are four types of Departmental TA units
namely, Eco Battalions, Railway Engineer


Regiment, General Hospitals and Oil Sector
Units.

3.12 **_Home and Hearth Battalions_** **_(TA):_**
Seven Home and Hearth Battalions (nondepartmental) have also been raised under TA
for the purpose of generating gainful employment
for local youth in border states.

###### Counter Insurgency Operation

3.13 Army assists the Civil Authority in handling
internal security situation as and when called for
and directed by the Government.

3.14 **_Jammu & Kashmir: The current phase_**
of the proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir has
shown a marked improvement as compared to
the previous years. A combination of factors –
both external and internal –
provides the opportunity to move
decisively towards conflict
resolution in the State.

3.15 The ceasefire on the
borders is holding out with a few
minor aberrations. Local level flag
meetings are encouraged to
resolve differences and diffuse
tensions along the border ensuring
that the Indo-Pak peace process
does not get vitiated due to inadvertent or
malicious acts by mischievous elements.
However, there are no signs of the terrorist
infrastructure across the borders being
dismantled.

3.16 There has been a marginal rise in
infiltration since last year. Government is taking
measures to arrest the upward trend. It is
noteworthy that there is a sharp rise in the
terrorists violence. While the surgical and
professional operations based on hard
intelligence continue, the focus is also on inducing
surrenders amongst local terrorists, while
encouraging them to join the mainstream.


-----

3.17 In conduct of operations all precautions
are taken to see that minimum inconvenience is
caused to the local populace. The Army remains
particularly sensitive to allegations of Human
Rights Violations. Any complaint received in this
regard is investigated in a fair and transparent
manner.

3.18 The other notable trends are that overall
violence levels have dropped,
notwithstanding the occasional
incident related spurt. Terrorists are
increasingly on the defensive, the
most visible manifestations being

**_by providing_**

the fact that they are avoiding
contact with Security Forces and

**_and education and_**

resorting to strikes at police
organizations, soft targets, grenade

**_rescue operations_**

lobbing in urban areas and the like.

**_during natural_**

3.19 The surge in tourism and **_calamities._**
enthusiastic participation of the
people in the local civic bodies elections are a
manifestation of the desire of the common
Kashmiri for peace. The recent targeting of


tourists in the Kashmir valley has led to protests
against such attacks.  Also, there has been no
decrease in the number of tourists and pilgrims
visiting Jammu or Ladakh. The Amarnath Yatra
saw pilgrim traffic surging to 2.7 lakh. People are
opposing recruitment efforts by various terrorist
tanzeems. Intelligence inputs by the local people
on terrorist activities have helped in the launch of
successful operations, elimination
of top terrorist leaders and recovery
of arms and ammunition. The
opening of the Punch- Rawalakot
Bus Link and other Confidence
Building Measures undertaken by
the Government have been well
received.

3.20 **_Assam: The ‘Suspension_**
of Operations’ agreements with the
National Democratic Front of
Bodoland (NDFB), and United
Peoples Democratic Solidarity
(UPDS) have ushered in relative peace and
stability in most parts of Assam. Conduct of
peaceful and incident free elections in the State


Tactical Battle Support Helicopter in action


-----

has been a noteworthy achievement. The
Security Forces were able to positively shape the
security environment  for the Government to take
a decision for “Cessation of Offensive Operations”
against the United Liberation Front of Asom
(ULFA). However, ULFA’s failure to seize the
opportunity and negotiate directly with the
Government forced the latter to once again
commence offensive operations against ULFA
after six weeks. The influence of ULFA however,
is on the decline. It is active only in a few districts
of Assam which have been its traditional
stronghold. Instances of common
people resisting extortion demands
and protesting against violence by
ULFA are on the rise, which is a

**_Lebanon displayed_**

welcome sign.

**_exemplary_**

3.21 **_Nagaland: In general peace_**
prevailing in the State, the security
environment is however being
vitiated due to violence by both the

**_and 73 individual_**

NSCN factions involved in a turf war
against each other.  Firm and deft

**_in recognition of its_**

handling of the situation by the Army

**_efforts by the_**

and Assam Rifles has ensured that

**_International_**

the “Peace Process” remains on

**_Community._**

track. The resolve of the people to
seek peace has been a significant
development. Many times, people have
intervened to stop clashes and drive out the
factions from towns and villages.

3.22 **_Manipur: In Manipur, the initiative to sign_**
a ‘Suspension of Operations’ agreement with
sixteen groups has been a major achievement.
More groups are being encouraged to join the
national mainstream. Consequent to the launch
of successful operations in the southern districts
of Manipur, normalcy in the area is getting
restored gradually. Measures are now being taken
to consolidate the gains with a view to denying
operational space to the terrorists.


3.23 **_Tripura: The overall situation in the State_**
continues to remain peaceful. Due to sustained
operational pressure of the Security Forces on
the terrorists, 79 cadres of National Liberation
Front of Tripura (Bishen Mohan) [NLFT (B)] and
30 cadres of All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTF)
surrendered till December 31, 2006.

3.24 **_Other States: The situation in the states_**
of Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Mizoram
is by and large peaceful. In Mizoram the decade
old unrest over the Bru refugees is likely to be
resolved finally. The Bru Liberation Front of
Mizoram (BLFM) which was based
in Tripura and waging an armed
struggle against the Mizoram
Government finally surrendered on
October 26, 2006. The surrender
will facilitate the peaceful return of
Bru refugees from Tripura to
Mizoram.

3.25 **_Surrender_** **_and_**
**_Rehabilitation:_** Sustained
operational pressure on most of the
terrorist groups in the North Eastern
States has resulted in increasing
surrenders by the militants. Till
October 31, 2006 a total of 1357
militants of different groups
surrendered to various Government agencies in
the region.

3.26 **_Naxal Violence: The revival of Naxal_**
Violence poses an additional challenge to national
security. The Army is engaged in capacity
building through rendering training to police forces
and Central Para Military Forces in Counter Naxal
Operations, Counter IED Operations and Training
of Trainers. 16 Companies and 4800 ExServicemen have already been trained while an
additional 92 Companies and 5000 ExServicemen will be trained by May 2007. The
experiment of providing officers on deputation for


-----

setting up a Counter Terrorism and Jungle
Warfare College at Kanker, as also offering exservicemen expertise has worked well.

###### RASHTRIYA RIFLES

3.27  The sanctioned strength of the Rashtriya
Rifles is 63 battalions and they are deployed in the
Northern Command. Due to sustained pressure
of Rashtriya Rifles, terrorist organizations have lost
their cohesion resulting in in-fighting amongst
various groups. The Rashtriya Rifles have also
played a role in winning the heart and minds of
people by providing assistance in health and
education and carrying out relief and rescue
operations during natural calamities.

###### PARTICIPATION IN UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS

3.28 Since 1950 when Indian troops were sent
to Korea, the Indian Armed Forces have
participated in the United Nations peacekeeping
operations. The ongoing Peace Missions are
UNIFIL – Lebanon, UNMEE- Ethiopia –Eritrea,


MONUC - Congo, UNMIS- Sudan, UNDOFGolan Heights, Israel. Indian Army has made
significant contribution in maintaining peace and
stability in conflict areas under the aegis of the
United Nations.

3.29 India has so far, provided 12 Force
Commanders in various UN Missions. Towards
the fulfillment of India’s commitment to the UN
and peace, 122 Indian soldiers have, so far, made
the supreme sacrifice. In recognition of their
gallant and distinguished service while serving the
noble cause of world peace, Indian Army
personnel have been honoured with 1 Param Vir
Chakra, 5 Maha Vir Chakras, 1 Kirti Chakra, 19
Vir Chakras, 3 Shaurya Chakras, 4 Yudh Seva
medals, 10 Sena Medals and 2 Vishishth Seva
Medals.

3.30 Recently the 4 SIKH Battalion deployed
in Lebanon displayed exemplary commitment
during the 34 Day Israel-Hezbollah war.  The
Battalion was awarded a Unit Citation and 73
individual citations for gallantry in recognition of
the efforts by the International Community.

###### ARMY ADVENTURE AND SPORTS

3.32 Life in the Army demands that its soldiers
be able to adapt themselves easily to hazardous


conditions to be able to prevail upon adversaries
in wide ranging situations. Adventure activities like
mountaineering develop determination, courage,
inner resolve and comradeship in abundant
measure along with self-discipline, dependability,
humility, physical and mental resilience, initiative
and ability to take decision under the ever present
threat of personal safety. Some of the adventure
activities organized during the year are given in

###### INDIAN NAVY

The Indian Navy - A Multi Dimensional Force


-----

###### t has been the objective of the Navy to prepare for all manner of contingencies through meticulously planned operations

# I

###### that hone the skills of personnel; exhaustively evaluated induction of the most appropriate equipment;  and focussed training to get the best from the personnel.


4.1 The Indian Navy has grown in stature as
a self confident, highly professional and
responsible force for stability and support in the
region. The Indian Navy, today, is a complete
reflection of the nation’s growing economic,
technological and diplomatic eminence. Strength
of Indian Navy lies not only in high technology
ships, submarines and aircraft but also in the
cadre of highly disciplined,
professionally competent personnel

**_The year saw the_**

who man these machines.

4.2 **_New Construction Ships:_** **_technologies in the_**
The Indian Navy’s continued
emphasis on self reliance is in
accordance with the Maritime **_Early Warning_**
Capability Perspective Plan. These **_systems, both_**
include destroyers, stealth Frigates **_indigenous and_**
and the Scorpene submarine project
at Mazagaon Docks Limited (MDL), **_the Fleet a highly_**
Mumbai; Offshore Patrol Vessels at **_potent capability._**
Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL), Goa;
the Landing Ship Tank (Large), Anti-Submarine
Warfare (ASW) corvettes and Fast Attack Craft
at Garden Reach Ship Engineers Ltd, (GRSE);
and, the Indigenous Aircraft Carrier at Cochin
Shipyard Limited (CSL), Kochi. The first of the
follow-on Project 15 class ships, was launched
on March 30, 2006 at Mumbai and the third
Landing Ship Tank (Large), Yard 3016 (Airavat)
was launched on March 27, 2006 at Kolkata. A
landmark event was the signing of the contract
for three follow-on ‘Talwar’ class stealth frigates
with Russia. These ships would be equipped with
the indigenous ASW and Communications suite


and equipped with the Indo-Russian BrahMos
Cruise Missile. Another important milestone is the
transfer of the USS Trenton to the Indian Navy in
January 2007.

4.3 **_New Technology Inductions:  The year_**
saw the induction of sunrise technologies in the
Navy for the first time. Highly sophisticated Early
Warning systems, both indigenous
and imported, have given the Fleet
a highly potent capability. Network
centric operations, are being given
adequate impetus in order to
integrate all our shore facilities with
our sea going assets which include
ships, submarines and aircraft. To
achieve this, a Naval
Communication Satellite is being
developed by ISRO. A joint
development project between the
DRDO, Israel and the Indian Navy
to develop a highly sophisticated
Long Range Surface to Air Missile system is in
progress.

4.4 **_Information_** **_Technology_** **_(IT):_**
Networking and e-enabled solutions are two key
thrust areas the Navy has identified in the field of
IT. A large number of IT applications were initiated
in the current year. These initiatives are aimed
at enhancing efficiency in the fields of
maintenance, health care management, human
resource and material management, which have
a direct bearing on resource planning and war
fighting capability.


-----

4.5 **_Decommissioning of Ships: During the_**
year, Indian Navy Ships SDB T-54, Amba, SDB
T-57 and Malpe were decommissioned after
several decades of glorious service to the Navy.

###### MAJOR EVENTS

4.6 Prime Minister’s Day at Sea: The Prime
Minister sailed with the Indian Naval Fleet off the

###### DEFENCE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Amphibious Floating Bridge developed by DRDO


-----

###### he DRDO has emerged as one of the premier scientific and technological organisations in the country with a mission

# T

###### to design, develop and lead to production of state-of-the-art weapon systems, platforms and allied equipment and also to provide combat support for meeting the current requirements of the Armed Forces.


8.1 Defence Research and Development
Organisation (DRDO) sprang from a humble
beginning in 1958 with an objective to provide
in-house capability for Ministry of Defence (MoD)
to manage and integrate science and technology
across the whole spectrum of its activities and
also to build up science and technology based
capability to improve performance of the existing
weapon systems and other imported equipment
and to avoid obsolescence. Later on, in 1970s, it
was involved in development of armaments and
ammunitions. During 1980s, thrust was given to
major programmes like development of guided
missiles, electronic warfare systems, aircraft,
communication systems, radars, sonars, etc. The
Department of Defence Research and
Development came into existence in 1980. Over
the years, it has grown up multi-directionally.
Now, the DRDO has emerged as one of the
premier scientific and technological organisations
in the country with a mission to design, develop
and produce state-of-the-art weapon systems,
platforms and allied equipment and also to provide
combat support for meeting the current
requirements of the Armed Forces. DRDO plays
significant roles, like providing scientific and
technological advice to the MoD in support of
defence policy; as evaluator of defence equipment
for the military operational requirements; and
generating new technological knowledge to be
transferred for development of state-of-the-art
weapon systems by the defence industries. The
Organisation also advises the Government to
make technical assessments of international


security threats and the military capabilities of both
current and potential adversaries.

###### ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE

8.2 DRDO has a mission-mode structure,
headed by the Scientific Adviser to Raksha Mantri
(SA to RM), who is also the Secretary, Department
of Defence Research & Development (R&D) and
Director General, Research and Development.
The SA to RM is assisted by the Chief Controllers
Naval Systems and Armaments & Combat
Engineering; Missiles & Strategic Systems;

Naval Systems; Combat Vehicles and
Engineering; Electronics and Computer Sciences;
Materials; Interaction with Services for Business;
International Cooperation; Technology
Acquisition; Missiles; Naval Research and
Development; Life Sciences; Civil Works and
Estates; and Technical Examination Cell. These
Directorates act as ‘single window’ to facilitate


-----

laboratories and establishments, functioning laboratories in improvement of their infrastructure,
under them, in obtaining approvals of new projects creation of new facilities, induction of manpower,
from the Government, facilitate in monitoring and answering Parliament Questions, coordinating
review of ongoing projects and also to co-ordinate with other ministries/departments, etc. and also

requirements in general and weapon systems in
particular. These are also administered and
funded by the DRDO. Gallium Arsenide Enabling
Technology Centre (GAETEC) at Hyderabad is a
foundry, set up for design, development and
fabrication of critical microwave components for
various programmes undertaken by DRDO and
Department of Space.

###### HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT (HRD)

8.5 DRDO has adopted a policy of dynamic
and systematic human resource development. A
Human Resource Consultative Body has been
constituted to take an integrated approach for


development of HRD related policies and
strategies for implementation in organisational
system. A Manpower Planning Board manages
the scientific, technical, administrative and allied
cadres. Manpower requirement in all categories
for various projects is reviewed periodically.
Rationalisation of cadre structure,
incentive schemes, training
policies, enhanced promotional
opportunities, exit interviews are
some of the mechanisms through
which the organisation has
endeavoured to ensure optimum
utilization of human resource, apart
from attracting and retaining best
available talents in the country. The
organisation has various schemes
for awarding scientists, engineers,
technical and administrative staff for
their path-breaking research and
excellence in performances.

8.6 Every year, scientists are
recruited through an annual
competitive examination at national
level called Scientist Entry Test (SET). In addition
to this, talents are also searched through campus
interview, scholarship schemes through
Aeronautic Research and Development Board
(ARDB) and Ph D scholars under Registration of
Student with Scholastic Aptitude (ROSSA).

8.7 Manpower Strength: DRDO is a project
based Organisation and follows a very dynamic
system of manpower planning. Authorised

14.1 ‘Defence Cooperation’ has now become an
important component in the conduct of a country’s
foreign policy and security affairs encompassing
all activities undertaken by the Defence Forces to
avoid hostilities, build and maintain trust, and make
significant contribution towards conflict prevention
and resolution. India is now engaged in a wide
range of activities with other friendly countries,
ranging from Chile and Brazil in the
Far-West to Japan and Korea in the
Far-East.

**_have changed_**

14.2 India has a long history of
defence cooperation with several

**_of exchange of_**

countries. Efforts are being made
to further strengthen its defence and
strategic cooperation with countries

**_of each other’s_**

like Russia, France, United States,
UK, Israel, South Africa, Germany
and countries in India’s
neighbourhood including those in

**_disasters, arms_**

Asia.  India has also growing

**_proliferation, etc._**

friendly ties including in the defence
field, with countries in the Gulf
Region, in Africa, Latin America and Europe.

14.3 Our cooperation with Russia in the
defence field is mutually beneficial and not
restricted to a buyer-seller relationship. It includes
joint research and development, training and
service to service contacts. The year saw
exchange of several high level visits including the
visit by Defence Secretary and the Services
Chiefs to Russia. The sixth meeting of the India

Russia Working Group on Military Technical
Cooperation and the Working Group on
Shipbuilding, Aviation and Land Systems was
held in New Delhi in December 2006. The Minister
level meeting of India-Russia Inter Governmental
Commission on Military Technical Cooperation
was also held on January 24, 2007 in New Delhi
wherein agreements in various
areas of cooperation were signed.
President of Russian Federation
was the Chief Guest for Republic
Day celebrations of India.

14.4 France has been one of
the major European states that
have sought to enhance
cooperation with India in the field
of defence. The French President
along with their Defence Minister
Mrs Michele Alliot Marie visited
India from February 19-21, 2006.
During the visit, both sides decided
to work together in the fields of
defence procurement, eradication
of piracy and terrorism, maritime surveillance, and
joint exercises. An Agreement in the field of
defence cooperation was also signed on February
20, 2006 between the two countries. A defence
delegation led by the Raksha Mantri visited
France from September 3-5, 2006 to discuss
defence and security issues with the French
Defence Minister Mrs Michele Alliot Marie and the
French Chief of Defence Staff, General Henri
Bentageat.


-----

14.5 India’s defence ties with the United States
have changed significantly as a result of exchange
of important visits and greater understanding of
each other’s perceptions and the need for
cooperation in tackling global issues like terrorism,
disasters, arms proliferation, etc. The

###### SUMMARY OF LATEST COMPTROLLER & AUDITOR GENERAL (C&AG) REPORT ON THE WORKING OF MINISTRY OF DEFENCE

 Report No. 4 of 2006: Union Government (Defence Services) Army and Ordnance Factories.


###### I. MINISTRY OF DEFENCE

**_Para 2.1_** **_Extra expenditure due to failure in_**
**_making use of option clause in time._**

Army HQ in April 1996 projected
requirement of engineering support
package for the repair of the Radio
sets procured in 1988 by exercising
option clause of a contract for
procurement of Radio sets concluded
in March 1996 with Electronics
Corporation of India Limited (ECIL).
The option clause though valid upto
March 1997 but the same was not
exercised by Ministry within validity
period. Ministry conveyed its decision
to exercise option clause to ECIL in
July 1999 but the same was not
accepted by ECIL. Ministry took more
than three years to reach a decision
on procurement of essential
maintenance spares for radio sets by
which time validity of option clause had
expired and spares had to be procured
at an additional expenditure of Rs.
4.49 crore, through a supply order
placed on ECIL in September 2002
besides, radio sets procured in 1988
remained without maintenance
support for more than a decade.

###### II. ARMY

**_Para 3.2_** **_Avoidable expenditure of Rs. 4.37_**
**_crore in transportation of atta._**


Headquarters, Northern Command
concluded two contracts for wheat
grinding for 2001-03 and 2003-05 with
a flour mill at Jammu at a distance of
320 Km from supply depot at Srinagar.
During 2001 to 2005, 50533.06 MT of
atta was transported from mill at
Jammu to supply depot Srinagar and
an amount of Rs. 4.37 crore was paid
towards transportation charges. Since
procurement rate of wheat ex-Food
Corporation of India was the same at
Srinagar and Jammu, if the contract
for grinding had been concluded at
Srinagar itself, transportation of atta
from Jammu to supply depot at
Srinagar could have been avoided.
Other Para military forces deployed in
the sector were availing of services of
local flour mills at Srinagar.

**_Para 3.4_** **_Infructuous expenditure due to_**
**_poor planning_**

Ministry placed three indents on
Bharat Electronics Ltd between March
1999 and March 2001 for supply of
2500 radio sets at a cost of Rs. 572.11
crore without taking into account the
post up-gradation requirement of
spares resulting in rendition of spares
worth Rs. 3.01 crore originally
procured as surplus.

**_Para 3.6_** **_Extra  expenditure on procurement_**
**_of expensive oil for a tank_**


-----

Army HQ was intimated by original
equipment manufacturer of a tank
(August 2002) that oil ‘A’ should not
be used for their operation in India and
only oil ‘B’ should be used. However,
MGO Branch/ Army HQ failed to
identify in time the correct oil to be
used in tanks resulted in procurement
of oil ‘A’ worth Rs. 80.94 lakh that was
not required. In order to utilize it, 10600
liters were diverted to another tank in
lieu of cheaper oil which was already
in use involving extra cost of Rs. 77.07
lakh.

**_Para 3.7_** **_Extra payment to a vendor due to_**
**_non-provision of specifications of_**
**_carrying box of radio set_**

Director General, Ordnance Services,
Army HQ placed two indents in
November 2001 and September 2002
on Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) for
procurement of 1074 and 500 sets of
sophisticated radio equipment without
mentioning specification of carrying
boxes of radio set in indents. BEL
supplied radio sets duly packed in
cheaper cardboard cartoon which
resulted in extra payment of Rs. 65.58
lakh to BEL.

**_Para 3.1_** **_Recoveries effected at the instance_**
**_of Audit_**

Based on audit observations, Army
units and formations recovered or
agreed to recover unauthorized,

payments in respect of release cases,
railway warrants, rent bills, terminal
gratuity, non-availing of high voltage


rebate on energy charges and towards
conservancy charges.

###### III. WORKS AND MILITARY ENGINEER SERVICES

**_Para 4.1_** **_Avoidable expenditure due to_**
**_wrong selection of site_**

Due to failure on the part of the Army
as well as Centre for Fire Environment
Safety to observe basic safety norms
for construction of explosive sheds
concerned, accommodation
constructed at a cost of Rs. 2.13 crore
for storing ammunition could not be
used for the purpose as it was located
near an Air Force Station.

**_Para 4.2_** **_Avoidable payment of surcharge_**
**_due to non-maintenance of the_**
**_stipulated average power factor_**

Due to delay in installation of shunt
capacitors required as per tariff
schedule of Jodhpur Vidyut Vitran
Nigam Limited resulted in avoidable
payment of surcharge of Rs. 1.77
crore.

**_Para 4.3_** **_Injudicious_** **_sanction_** **_for_**
**_upgradation and additional suits to_**
**_MES inspection bungalows_**

Disregarding meager utilization of
existing inspection bungalows at
Faizabad and Lucknow, Head

(November 2003/ March 2004) for
their upgradation and additional suites
of these inspection bungalows
incurring unjustified expenditure of Rs.
1.59 crore thereof.

**_Para 4.5_** **_Extra expenditure on unauthorized_**
**_specifications in works_**


-----

Head Quarters, Southern Command
ordered (July 2004) revision of
specification in ongoing works in
single living accommodation, kitchen,
dinning hall and toilets without the
approval from Government which
resulted in extra expenditure of Rs.
99.36 lakh.

###### IV. AIR FORCE & NAVY

**_i._** **_Acquisition of Executive Jets for_**
**_Communication Squadron_**

The Ministry acquired five Executive Jets
at a cost of Rs. 712.51 crore. The poor
usage of the aircraft sought to be replaced
did not justify the acquisition which was
made through a non-competitive process,
entailing acceptance of an exorbitant
amount of Rs. 126.90 crore for five aircraft
towards modification of interiors and in-flight
entertainment. (Para 2.1 of Report No. 5 of
2006) Air Force and Navy)

**_ii._** **_Procurement of Unmanned Aerial_**
**_Vehicles_**

Twelve Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
imported at a cost of Rs. 567 crore in the
wake of the Kargil Review Committee
recommendation could not be utilized due
to injudicious selection of operational sites
and inability of Navy to complete
infrastructure facilities in time for their
operations. (Para 2.2 of Report No. 5 of
2006) Air Force and Navy)

**_iii._** **_Acquisition of Missiles by IAF_**

The tender process adopted in conclusion
of a contract for import of missile at a cost
of Rs. 407.30 crore for Air Force lacked
competitiveness and transparency.
Ineffective negotiations resulted in
contracted missiles already Rs. 50.60 crore
more expensive than the more advanced


version of the same missile available with
the Air Force. (Para 2.3 of Report No. 5 of
2006) Air Force and Navy)

**_iv._** **_Parking of funds with Public Sector_**
**_Undertaking_**

Ministry advanced Rs. 995.70 crore to
Mazagaon Dock Limited between 1996 and
2002 without placing any orders to avoid
surrender of funds. Failure to recover
adequate financial compensation resulted
in a financial loss to the extent of Rs. 156.12
crore till March 2005. (Para 2.6 of Report
No. 5 of 2006) Air Force and Navy)

**_v._** **_Acquisition of Marine Pollution_**
**_Surveillance Capacity_**

Three Dornier aircraft costing Rs. 102 crore
received in March 2001 by the Coast Guard
for marine pollution surveillance were not
provided with vital Operational Role
Equipment due to improper handling by
Government. There was no assurance that
the equipment contracted after much delay
was appropriate. (Para 5.1 of Report No. 5
of 2006) Air Force and Navy)

**_vi._** **_Extra expenditure in purchase of_**
**_Navigation System_**

Ministry’s failure to take advantage of the
prices available under an option clause of
a contract within its validity period and
belated exercise of the option clause at
higher prices without inviting bids from other
vendors led to extra expenditure of Rs.
29.90 crore in import of 95 sets of
Navigational System for the Air Force. (Para
2.4 of Report No. 5 of 2006) Air Force and
Navy)

**_vii._** **_Procurement of one extra fast attack_**
**_craft_**

A vintage Extra Fast Attack Craft was
acquired at a cost of Rs. 33.56 crore citing


-----

urgent operational requirement of the Navy
through a process, which precluded
competition and lacked transparency.
Failure to negotiate an appropriate
depreciation resulted in loss of Rs. 4.16
crore. (Para 4.1 of Report No. 5 of 2006)
Air Force and Navy)

**_viii._** **_Irregular grant of allowances of DSC_**
**_personnel_**

DSC personnel engaged with the Air Force
formations in the North East were not
entitled to the counter insurgency allowance
and related concessions. Failure of internal
controls led to irregular payment of counter
insurgency allowance aggregating Rs. 3.51
crore. (Para 2.5 of Report No. 5 of 2006)
Air Force and Navy)

**_ix._** **_Import of spares at exorbitant prices_**

Avoiding internal controls at different stages
and taking decision on incorrect premises
by Naval HQ led to acceptance of higher
rate in import of spares. A more judicious
decision to place orders for specific items
on competitive basis would have yielded a
saving to the extent of Rs. 9 crore. (Para
4.3 of Report No. 5 of 2006) Air Force and
Navy)

**_x._** **_Non-commissioning_** **_of_** **_imported_**
**_equipment_**

Poor planning resulted in delay in
completion of works services for phase-I of
Service Support Centre for SU-30 aircraft
leading to non-commissioning of equipment
worth Rs. 53.95 crore since June/ October
2004. (Para 3.3 of Report No. 5 of 2006)
Air Force and Navy)

**_xi._** **_Acquisition of ready built flats for Coast_**
**_Guard_**

Although acquisition of ready built flats for
Coast Guard was simultaneously


processed alongwith Navy, Ministry did not
explore the possibility of waiver of interest
charges, exemption of stamp duty and
registration charges in respect of Coast
Guard as in the case of Navy resulting in
avoidable extra expenditure of Rs. 2.63
crore. (Para 5.2 of Report No. 5 of 2006)
Air Force and Navy)

**_xii._** **_Unauthorized construction of Officers’_**
**_Institute_**

Prime land valuing Rs. 74.24 lakh was
utilized to construct a transit
accommodation by Western Air Command
in IAF unauthorisdely under the
nomenclature of Officers’ Institute involving
irregular expenditure of Rs. 33.18 lakh.
(Para 3.2 of Report No. 5 of 2006) Air Force
and Navy)

**_xiii._** **_Procurement of spares for test rig_**

Delay in taking action in procurement of
spares for test rig by the Air Force at the
appropriate time led to excess expenditure
of about Rs. two crore. (Para 3.1 of Report
No. 5 of 2006) Air Force and Navy)

**_xiv._** **_Unnecessary import of stores under_**
**_special financial powers_**

Special financial powers delegated to Naval
HQ in the wake of Operation Parakram were
invoked for unnecessary purchase of
spares worth Rs. one crore for turbo
alternators for INS Virat even though the
ship was neither identified as front line ship,
nor there was adequate justification for their
procurement. (Para 4.2 of Report No. 5 of
2006) Air Force and Navy)

**_xv._** **_Recoveries at the instance of Audit_**

An aggregated amount of Rs. 4.98 crore
was recovered at the instance of Audit.

###### V. PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT

 Licensed manufacture of an aircraft

IAF procured 50 aircraft ‘A’ from a foreign
country between 1997 and 2004. The
Government approved licensed
manufacture of 140 aircraft ‘A’ by HAL in
2000. The project was expected to be
completed by 2017-18. The order for the
first block of 34 aircraft was placed on HAL
in December 2003.

Specification of vital air borne systems to be
integrated on the aircraft ‘A’ was not frozen
before entering into a contract for its licensed
manufacture. Delivery schedule of the licensed
manufacturing programme had to be
compressed to meet operational requirements
of IAF indicating inadequate planning for the
programme. The contract with the Original
Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for licensed
manufacture had several infirmities. The entire
license fee for manufacture of 140 aircraft till
2017-18 was paid upfront, in advance, without
any provision for reduction in case a lower
number were finally manufactured. The cost
of indigenous manufacture worked out to be
more than import cost. Besides, there have
been cost escalations, and in the absence of
binding provisions, the cost continues to rise.
Establishment of repair and overhaul facilities
were lagging behind schedule leading to
increased dependence on the OEM for repair.

(Chapter I of Performance Audit Report No. 4
of 2006)

###### Maintenance of an aircraft fleet in IAF

Performance Audit of the maintenance of
an aircraft ‘B’ in the Indian Air Force
revealed that despite executing appropriate
agreements with the OEM, establishment
of adequate repair and maintenance


facilities lagged way behind the induction
of aircraft, resulting in continued
dependence on the OEM for maintenance.

Performance of HAL was not optimal. HAL
was unable to meet the annual full-overhaul
tasks of engines. Even after completion of
facilities, the failure rate of HAL overhauled
engines was very high and the turn around
time taken for overhaul by HAL was higher
compared to engines overhauled by the
OEM. Base Repair Depot also utilized 36.34
percent and 47.73 percent more than the
standard manhours and fixed higher rates
than the one envisaged in the Detailed
Project Report for the overhaul of aircraft.
BRD also did not have a proper cost
accounting system and their cost estimates
were unreliable.

The sub-optimal performance by
maintenance agencies resulted in low
serviceability and aircraft flying efforts at
squadrons; serviceability status fluctuated
between 43 and 62 percent and there was
a shortfall in flying tasks ranging from 87.48
to 42.52 percent between 1997-98 and
2004-05.

The expectation that establishment of
overhaul facilities would bring about savings
in foreign exchange and turn around time
could not be achieved. As against the
assessed cost of overhaul of Rs. 4.15 crore
per engine the actual cost worked out to
Rs. 5.21 crore.

Poor product support from the OEM was a
recurring problem. Consequently, due to
non-availability of spares, HAL sent 1280
lines of aggregates abroad for repair
between 1998-99 and 2004-05. Likewise,
2223 lines of spares against 57 orders were
awaiting supplies at BRD as of July 2005.
This also led to cannibalization at all levels


-----

with adverse implications on flight safety.
There is an urgent need to use the lessons
learnt from the aircraft ‘B’ experience in
respect of ongoing and future induction.

(Chapter II of Performance Audit Report No.
4 of 2006)

###### Project management in Navy

Indian Navy conceived in 1980s three major
project for modernizing its infrastructure to
meet the growing demands of the Navy.
These projects are: a permanent Naval
Academy at Ezhimala, a new Naval Base
at Karwar and modernization of Naval
Hospital Asvini at Mumbai. There was steep
cost escalation for the Academy from Rs.
167 crore to Rs. 500 crore, for the Base from
Rs. 1,295 crore to Rs. 2,459 crore and for
the hospital from Rs. 93 crore to Rs. 137
crore. Poor estimation of costs at the design
stage, repeated revision of specifications
and scope of works, failure to cap variations
and inclusion of unfavorable provisions in
contracts contributed towards cost
escalation. The delay in the Academy and
the Hospital Projects was due to the
engagement of an architect firm as the
Project Consultant. The process followed
in the selection of the consultant was not
as per the standard best practices and the
inexperience of the consultant and their
substandard work only enhanced the
teething troubles.

There were serious delays in decision
making and implementation. Project
Management Bodies were ineffective in
ensuing adherence to the stipulated
schedules and cost. There was little
evidence of any pro-active problem solving
approach. The projects are still at various
stages of construction/ completion. As a
result, resource development activities are


stifled in the inadequate INS Mandovi, the
existing training establishment,
decongestion of Naval Dockyard, Mumbai
continues to be a distant dream, and a large
portion of Naval and other Service
personnel and their families do not yet have
state of the art medical facilities.

Located in coastal areas, the three projects
have significant environmental impact.
While the Project Authorities have provided
an assurance that environmental concerns
have been adequately addressed, the
Navy needs to make continuing efforts
towards protecting the fragile coastal
ecosystems of the area in which these
projects are located.

In the light of the deficiencies noticed in the
implementation of these three major
projects certain recommendations have
been made in the report for strengthening
management of critical and large
construction projects.

###### VI. ACQUISITION WING SECTT

**_Audit Report No.12 of 2006_**

Bharat Earth Movers Limited incurred
liquidated damages of Rs. 1.19 crore due
to avoidable delay in supply of Rope
Shovels to Coal India Limited beyond the
scheduled delivery period of April, 2003.
(Para 8.1.1)

Incorrect estimation of income and
consequential short payment of advance
income tax during 2000-01 to 2003-04 by
Bharat Electronics Limited in avoidable
expenditure of differential interest of Rs.
3.05 crore. (Para 8.2.1)


-----

Due to inordinate delay in indenting,
coordinating and executing and failure to
monitor the job, Garden Reach Shipbuilders
and Engineers Limited suffered and
avoidable loss of Rs.2.61 crore. (Para 8.3.1)

Failure of the internal audit/internal control
system in Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to
detect short billing of material resulted in
loss to the extent of Rs. 64.62 lakh. (Para
8.4.1)

Vingyan Industries Limited incurred an
avoidable loss of Rs. 1.42 crores due to
abnormal rejections of steel castings. (Para
8.5.1)

###### VII. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATION

**_Para 6.1_** **_Unfruitful expenditure of Rs. 65.24_**
**_lakh on augmentation of fire_**
**_fighting system._**

Due to failure in not considering
replacement of 16 year old hydrant
pipelines, the fire fighting system
augmented at a cost of Rs.65.24 lakh
at Proof and Experimental
Establishment Chandipur could not
sustain the required pressure.
Moreover, the sensitive establishment
remained exposed to serious fire
hazard for the last seven years.

###### VIII. ORDNANCE FACTORY ORGANISATION

**_Para 7.2_** **_Infructuous_** **_expenditure_** **_in_**
**_manufacture of mine clearing_**
**_vehicles._**

Bulk manufacture of charge line mine
clearing vehicles by Ordnance Factory
Chanda before resolving design
deficiencies led to infructuous


expenditure of Rs.3.89 crore towards
their manufacture.

**_Para 7.3 Excess consumption of raw_**
**_materials worth Rs. 1.91 crore_**

Ordnance Clothing Factory
Shahjahanpur revised the estimate of
yarn raw material used in manufacture
of vests upward so as to offset excess
consumption of yarn raw material
valued Rs.1.91 crores due to
inefficiency in production process.

**_Para 7.5_** **_Avoidable consumption of_**
**_cartridges._**

Due to failure of Rifle Factory Ishapore
to exercise proper control over
consumption of empty 5.56 mm ball
cartridges during pre-proof functioning
test coupled with their inability to
stabilize production process of a
weapon led to avoidable consumption
of cartridges worth Rs. 3.14 crore.

###### IX. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AUDIT

**_Computerized Inventory Control Project_**
**_in Central Ordnance Depot, Delhi._**

The Army Ordnance Corps with the network
of Central Ordnance Depots, field level
depots and ordnance units is responsible
for the inventory management of weapons,
ammunition, vehicles, equipment and stores
of the Army. Computerization of the
management of the huge inventory held by
the Army was a long felt need. The Ministry
accorded sanction in July 1994 for
implementation of the Computerized
Inventory Control Project (CICP) to be
completed by June 1999. The project was
planned to be implemented in a phased
manner with the objectives of bringing about
better asset visibility, assistance in reducing


-----

inventory holding and carrying costs,
provision of Management Information
System to users and management,
reduction of manual intervention and
reduction in manpower and related costs.

An audit scrutiny of the Project revealed that
the CICP, a conceptually good project, had
been very badly delayed and only one
Phase could be implemented. Presently,
the completion date of the entire project was
uncertain as the phase III was yet to be
sanctioned. This led to denial of full benefits
of computerization namely better asset
visibility, restricted wastage, on-line MIS for
efficient management, instance reaction to
operational requirements, better utilization
and down sizing of manpower. In addition,
one per cent saving, estimated at Rs. 500
crore as a consequence of reduction in total
inventory holding (Valuation 2002), could
not be achieved.

Further, not all the modules of the
implemented phase I were fully functional
and the Army was still dependent on manual
functions for important areas like provision
reviews. The database was incomplete to
a large extent. There were few inherent
design deficiencies in the software. Lack
of Business Process Reengineering had
rendered the application to be of limited use
in its present form. The entire application
was running in a security environment that
was far from satisfactory. (Chapter-IV of
Report No.3 of 2006 Army and Ordnance
Factories (Performance Audit)

**_Armoured Vehicle Group of Factories_**

The Armoured Vehicle Group of Factories
comprises of five ordnance factories under
the control of the Ordnance Factory Board,


which meet the requirement of the Army for
armoured vehicles, engines and their
components. Performance Audit of the
activities of the above Group of Factories
relating to the period April 2000 to March
2005 revealed delay of more than five years
in production and issue of Tank ‘X’ affecting
its induction schedule and modernization of
mechanized forces, sanctioning of
indigenous production of Tank ‘Z’ despite
non-freezing of the design resulting in delay
in obtaining components and subassemblies from various vendors and the
process of manufacture and assembly at
the Heavy Vehicle Factory, Avadi (HVF),
poor performance of the HVF in the
overhaul of tank ‘X’ coupled with delayed
release of tanks by the Army causing
backlog of the tanks to be overhauled
affecting operational readiness, annual
shortfall in production target of tank ‘X’ by
the HVF ranged between 20 to 100 percent,
payment of overtime allowance to the tune
of Rs. 58.46 crore by three out of five
factories despite the available man-hours
remaining underutilized, spill over in
production of Tanks, engines and
components valued at Rs. 1521.74 crore
during 2001-02 to 2004-05 resulting in
distorting of the unit value of production of
items manufacture and overstatement of the
value of production and issues to the tune
of Rs.1521.74 crore over the four year
period, failure of HVF in attending to repairs
promptly resulting in accumulation of
repairable arisings work Rs.91 crore of
which items work Rs.7 crore were rendered
beyond economical repair causing loss to
the exchequer. (Chapter-III of Report No. 3
