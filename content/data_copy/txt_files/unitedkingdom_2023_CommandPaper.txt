###### Ministerial
 Foreword

We did not plan on issuing a new Command
Paper just two years since the last, but we
have gone from a competitive age to a
contested and volatile world. Since March
2021, the threats and challenges we faced
have manifested themselves, as have many
of the technological advances predicted and
our need to adapt faster to them if we are to
continue outmatching our adversaries.

Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was not
simply an assault on a proud and sovereign
nation. It was also an attack on our values,
European security, and the open international
order on which stability and prosperity have
depended for over three quarters of a century.

We are proud of the role the UK is playing in
supporting Ukraine in this fight. They are not
only defending the international rules-based
system on our behalf, but in many ways they
are proving the way for warfare in the 2020s
– whole of nation, internationally partnered,
innovative, digitised and operating with
tempo, precision and range. In turn, we are
providing Ukraine with equipment, training
and political support. We have galvanised
European and international, governmental
and industrial partners to do likewise.
We are campaigning globally.

The return of major war to the continent of
Europe – alongside growing threats elsewhere
in the world – means we need to sharpen our
approach. We need to ensure our warfighting
capabilities are robust and credible to be able
to deter threats from manifesting in the first
place, but also to fight and win if they do. We
need to be able to defend the homeland and
make ourselves more resilient to all types of
shocks. We need to be able to sustain


operations today – with sufficient stockpiles
of munitions, and critical enablers – as well as
investing now in the battle-winning
capabilities of the future. We must address
increasingly complex and diverse threats, by
maximising our own growing but ultimately
finite resources, which necessitates ruthless
prioritisation and improved productivity.

In 2021 the MOD responded to the Integrated
Review by publishing “Defence in a
Competitive Age”, which emphasised the need
for Defence to become truly threat-focused,
modernised and sustainable. To seek out,
understand and counter threats every single
day. To invest in the capabilities to deter and
defeat them, both today and tomorrow. And to
match our ambitions with our resources so that
we can sustain ourselves in that endeavour.

The conclusions of that Command Paper
remain right – Russia was and is the greatest
threat to European security. China’s rapid
military modernisation and growing
assertiveness within the Indo-Pacific do pose
an increasing challenge.

We are convinced that our strategic
advantage comes from several key sources
which require that prioritisation. It is derived
foremost from our first-class people – our real
battle-winning capability – in whom we are
determined to invest: in their accommodation,
their skills, and their overall employment offer.

It is derived from our investment in cuttingedge future technologies, including digital
and data, and emerging scientific and
technological advances. It is derived from
our relationship with industry, which we must
continue to strengthen into a new alliance, as a


-----

genuine partnership to sustain our defence.
And it is derived from our productivity, an
ethos that is focused ruthlessly on the delivery
of real-world effect. Recognising that our
campaigning approach reaches in to every part
of the Defence enterprise – from the front line
to the back office.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has reinforced
the importance of international cooperation
and the strength of our alliances. Notably
NATO, but also the Five Eyes, the Joint
Expeditionary Force, the Northern Group,
and many more. They are at the heart of
intelligence-sharing, operational cooperation,
an integrated approach to deterrence, and
the delivery of battle-winning capabilities:
for example through the Global Combat Air
Programme (GCAP) and AUKUS.

The refreshed Integrated Review, published in
March of this year, was clear how we must
respond to deteriorating global security: shape
the global strategic environment, increase our
focus on deterrence and defence, address
vulnerabilities that leave our nation exposed,
and invest in the UK’s unique strengths.
Defence is central to all of those efforts.

After three decades of drawing the post-Cold
War ‘peace dividend’ this Prime Minister
reversed the trend and provided Defence an
additional £24 billion over four years, before
investing further in response to the war in
Ukraine and committing to increase spending
over the longer term to 2.5% of GDP, as the
fiscal and economic circumstances allow.
We must transform now to counter today’s
threats, but this ambitious trajectory also
enables our modernisation for the challenges
of the future.


We are grateful to the hundreds of individuals
and groups who contributed to the first
challenge phase of this Command Paper
Refresh – from academics, to serving
personnel and companies from across
industry – much of what we learnt from
you is encapsulated in this document.

In recognition of those lessons, the
increasingly challenging security context and
Defence’s contribution to all four pillars of the
IRR we are articulating a new and clear
purpose for Defence. Our mission is clear:
to protect the nation and help it prosper.

That does not just mean more ships, tanks
and jets – indeed in this document there are
deliberately no new commitments on
platforms at all – because on that we stand by
what we published in 2021. Instead, we focus
on how to drive the lessons of Ukraine into
our core business and to recover the
warfighting resilience needed to generate
credible conventional deterrence.

Delivering the reforms in this Command Paper
will ensure that we are able to do that – now
and in the years ahead.

###### Introduction

 Delivering on the Integrated Review Refresh – The Evolving Context and Our Strategic Approach


**1.** The refreshed Integrated Review (IRR)

published in March 2023 identified that the
transition into a multipolar, fragmented and
contested world had happened more quickly
and definitively than anticipated in the original
Integrated Review. In response to this
changing threat context, the IRR set out a
new approach through an updated strategic
framework delivered through four pillars:

**(a) Shape the international environment.**

Shaping, balancing, competing and
cooperating across the main arenas of
systemic competition, working with all who
support an open and stable international
order and the protection of global public
goods.

**(b) Deter, defend and compete across all**

**domains. Accelerating the ongoing shift to**
an integrated approach to deterrence and
defence, to counter both state threats and
transnational security challenges. NATO is
at the core of this effort, but we are clear
that – given the changing threat picture –
effective deterrence will mean working
through other groupings and beyond the
Euro-Atlantic theatre. Further, a renewed
emphasis on the concept of strategic
stability – establishing new frameworks
and building a new international security
architecture to manage systemic
competition and escalation in a multipolar
environment.

**(c) Address vulnerabilities through**

**resilience. Developing the UK’s approach**
to resilience, shifting to a long-term
campaign to address the vulnerabilities


that leave the UK exposed to crises and
hostile actors. This will strengthen the
UK’s deterrence by denial and ensure that
operational activity under pillar two can be
focused where it has the greatest impact.

**(d) Generate strategic advantage. Building**

on IR2021’s focus on strategic advantage
– the UK’s relative ability to achieve our
objectives compared to our competitors.
In a more contested environment, this is
indispensable to maintaining the UK’s
freedom of action, freedom from coercion
and our ability to cooperate with others
and is the underpinning for the other pillars
of the strategic framework.

**2.** The IRR recognised that the global

security environment required us both to act
now and plan for the long-term. Therefore, in
the Spring Budget the Government agreed
that the Ministry of Defence (MOD) would
receive a further £5 billion of additional
funding over two years – in addition to the
£24 billion received in cash terms (over four
years) in 2020. This means that for the first
time, the MOD’s budget is now more than
£50 billion a year – a clear sign of the
importance placed on our contribution to the
nation’s security and prosperity. Furthermore,
the Prime Minister has set out an aspiration
over the longer term to invest 2.5% of GDP
in Defence, as the fiscal and economic
circumstances allow.

**3.** As we have seen starkly over the last

sixteen months, the repercussions – and
costs – of responding after threats manifest
into conflict are immeasurably greater than if


-----

those threats are adequately deterred or
prevented in the first place. In this more
contested world, deterrence is more
important than ever, underpinned by the
capabilities and alliances that will enable
us to fight and win if needed. In short,
**hard power matters.**


###### Threats and challenges


**4.** The immediate threat to the Euro-Atlantic

region, and to the UK, has increased sharply
as a result of Russia’s actions. The world is
now witnessing a major war instigated by a
nuclear power, threatening to subjugate the
sovereignty of another state. But Russia’s
full-scale invasion of Ukraine, building on its
unlawful annexation of territories in 2014, is
not just a brutal and illegal armed attack on a
sovereign nation; it also poses the greatest
challenge to the open international order in
generations. Europe has not seen this scale
of conflict since the end of the Second
World War.

**5.** While Russia’s failures in Ukraine have

significantly weakened its land and guided
weapon capabilities, it retains capable nuclear
and strategic forces, and has the intent and
capacity to rebuild and regenerate. We have
witnessed the willingness of the Russian
government to resort to irresponsible nuclear
rhetoric, making the threat of nuclear
escalation greater than at any time since the
Cold War. Russia’s maritime and air forces
also remain largely intact, and the Russian
state continues to actively threaten the UK
and our allies below the threshold of conflict
around the world. Russia continues to
demonstrate its willingness recklessly to
ignore international norms, from its use of


Novichok on the streets of the UK in 2018,
to its large-scale use of mercenary forces in
Ukraine and elsewhere. And as Russia
becomes more isolated internationally as a
result of its actions, and its behaviour more
volatile, so the threats to the UK and our
interests will likely increase.

**6.** The IRR also set out that as we move to

a more contested world, systemic competition
continues to intensify, driving the deterioration
of the global security environment. China
poses an enduring and epoch-defining global
challenge to British interests – including
Defence interests – through its increasingly
assertive and coercive behaviour as it seeks
to rewrite the international order that has
provided stability and prosperity for
generations. While pursuing a programme of
accelerated military modernisation, China
continues to flex its economic and military
might to advance territorial claims in the
Indo-Pacific and expand its influence across
Europe, Africa and the Middle East, including
through the proliferation of Chinese weapon
systems. Despite previous Chinese claims of
its peaceful rise, China has refused to
renounce the use of force to achieve its
objectives with regard to Taiwan. Escalating
tensions in the Indo-Pacific, driven by China’s
actions, present a direct challenge to a region
that we believe should remain free and open
for the prosperity of all. However, as the IRR
set out, the UK does not accept that China’s
relationship with the UK, or its impact on the
international system, are set on a
predetermined course. While we will always
be clear-eyed about the risks of engagement,
we will work to convince China of the need for
it to play a responsible global role in keeping
with its status as a P5 power and a major
security player.


-----

**7.** Both Iran and North Korea will remain

volatile threats to security in their regions and
beyond. In the last two years, we have seen
both conduct destabilising activities across
their respective regions and seek to advance
their nuclear programmes, thereby
threatening global security. We judge that
these efforts will also continue.

**8.** The threat from non-state actors has not

diminished. Terrorist organisations still
aspire to attack the UK and our interests
abroad. The instability of regions such as the
Sahel, Lake Chad Basin and parts of the
Middle East, and countries such as
Afghanistan and Somalia, provide the space
for such groups to expand. Increasing global
access to information and technology has
also increased the threats posed by
hacktivists, single issue terrorists and more
amorphous online criminal movements.

**9.** Confronted by climate change, economic

challenges, the pace of technological change
and competition for food and raw materials,
states face increasingly complex and diverse
**security challenges. Competition between**
governments to adapt to changing
environments, increase their resilience, and
meet the basic needs of their populations
risks international relations becoming more
transactional at the expense of common
interests. Our ability to understand the impact
of climate change across Defence, and adapt
to it, is key to strategic advantage. A failure by
states to meet these needs risks fuelling
major increases in migration, the rise of
terrorism and conflict over resources.
Vulnerable groups will almost certainly be
disproportionately affected, posing additional
**human security challenges.**


**10.** One of the most important trends of the
last two years, however, has been the
increasing interconnectedness between
**regions and actors. In the wake of the illegal**
invasion of Ukraine, we have witnessed a
deepening of Russia’s partnership with China,
its growing cooperation with Iran, as well as
the provision of weapons by North Korea to
Russia in contravention of UN Security
Council Resolutions. This leads to a world
where the threats we face from actors
manifest and proliferate across multiple
regions, creating a more adversarial form of
geopolitics. The irresponsible use of cyber
capabilities, and of dis- and misinformation
promulgated through social media,
transcends geographic boundaries. This will
shape how citizens and governments
understand and respond to global events.
Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine has had
consequences across the world, precipitating
a refugee and energy crisis in Europe, as well
as threatening food supplies in some of the
most fragile parts of the globe. Coordination
and cooperation between state and non-state
actors is also growing. For example, we have
seen Russian mercenary groups fighting in
Ukraine, and pursuing Russian interests
through conducting destabilising activity in
Africa and the Levant.


**11.** Our national security is intrinsically linked
to the outcome of the war in Ukraine.
Although we must be careful not to rush to
definitive lessons from Russia’s illegal
invasion of Ukraine – the war is ongoing, the
situation is complex, and the lessons will be
profound – we must seize the opportunity to
gain insights and adapt now. Some of these


###### Lessons from Ukraine


-----

insights will be strategic, for example relating
to the art of deterrence, strategic stability, the
role of economic measures within a conflict,
and escalation management. Some of them
will be tactical, relating to a battlefield that –
with trench warfare – has disturbing echoes
of the early twentieth century, overlaid by
twenty-first century capabilities. Many of the
insights reinforce the journey we are already
on, but also indicate where we need to go
further or faster.

**12.** The events of the last two years have
underscored the centrality of NATO to our
national security. The unity of NATO has
held firm throughout the conflict; and our
**interoperability is part of our strength and**
our ability to deter and defend against threats.
The collective security provided by NATO
is our strongest bulwark against state
aggression, such that the sustainment of
the NATO alliance, in part through our own
leadership and increased contributions,
is a strategic priority for UK Defence.

**13.** The essential role of alliances and
**partnerships more generally is also clear**
from the last two years: our ability to invoke
alliances and partnerships around the globe to
protect UK territories and interests forms an
important part of our credibility in the eyes of
would-be aggressors. The interconnectedness
and indivisibility of different regional theatres
has also become more apparent than ever:
support for Ukraine has come from the IndoPacific as well as from the Euro-Atlantic; and
Atlantic-Pacific relationships have grown in
both depth and importance.

**14.** The war in Ukraine highlights the
importance of the credibility of our
**capabilities, both conventional and nuclear,**
on the earth or in space or cyberspace, to


deter threats against us. It affirms the
**modern western way of warfare: joint and**
all-domain, underpinned by data and
information, both open-source and highly
classified. It also emphasises the urgent
requirement to continue to modernise the
**force to keep pace with technological**
developments today, and to evolve to meet the
threats of the future. It reinforces the need to
understand and exploit the impact of digital
**capabilities, and invest in them now to enable**
greater precision, speed, lethality and mass.
There is a requirement for sufficient mass and
game-changing technology, with the two often
combined. Both our ability – through the
capabilities we possess and our skill at
employing them – and our will, demonstrably
and convincingly to defend our territories and
our Allies, are critical to our deterrent effect.

**15.** The value of adaptability at pace –
agility – on the battlefield has become clear.
We have learned that staying ahead of the
threat and gaining strategic advantage can be
achieved through novel and creative means,
exploiting technology and adapting weapons
systems, such as Uncrewed Air Systems,
during contact, rather than relying entirely on
an existing force package. This underscores
the requirement for a more agile acquisition
**process and an even stronger partnership**
**between government and industry, both**
**primes and small- and medium-sized**
**enterprises. The versatility of the whole UK**
Defence enterprise, with the flexibility to
respond to changing threats and adapt to
new technologies, must become its strength,
and will be critical to ensuring the enduring
credibility of the force.

**16.** A further reflection is on the critical
importance of effective sustainment of
operations – the ability of a force to stay in the


-----

fight, even as the duration and intensity of a
conflict grow. This highlights the need for
sufficient stockpiles and munitions,
underpinned by a resilient economic and
industrial base at home. It also reinforces the
critical role of logistical enablers, including the
ability to get the right equipment – and people
– to the right place at the speed of relevance.


through the Reserves: prevailing in war
requires a national effort.

**18.** Russia will also be learning lessons from
its experiences in Ukraine and seeking rapidly
to implement these at both the tactical and
operational level. China too will be observing
the conflict, and drawing conclusions,
including about the unity and staying power
of the UK and our allies and partners.


**17.** The resilience and fortitude of the of the UK and our allies and partners.
Ukrainian people has been inspirational,
and a reminder of the strength, stamina

###### Our Strategic Approach

and adaptability of the human spirit. This
re‑emphasises the need to provide our
**people with the skills and support** **19.** Events since the 2021 Defence Command
necessary to maximise their potential, to Paper (DCP21) have shown that we were right
unshackle them from excessive process, to make the commitments we did, and that our
and to strengthen the connection between efforts have been on the right track. We have
the Defence enterprise and society, including led the way in Europe on support for Ukraine’s

defence, galvanising others to follow suit. We
have remained a leading contributor to NATO,
consistently meeting our commitment to spend
at least 2% of GDP on Defence – recognising
the Defence Investment Pledge as a floor not a
ceiling. We have demonstrated our global reach
through activity on land, sea and air in the
South Atlantic, Caribbean, High North, across
Africa, the Middle East, the Caucasus and
Central Asia and right across the Indo-Pacific,
including the deployment of the Carrier Strike
Group in 2021. We have built stronger alliances
and partnerships, including bilaterally and
through NATO, the Five Eyes, and the tennation Joint Expeditionary Force. We have
maintained a hard military edge, not least
through our Special Forces, our nuclear
capabilities, and our cross-domain
conventional forces integrated with NATO –
all underpinned by exceptional intelligence
capabilities. But the changes in the context in
which we find ourselves require us now to go
Ukrainian troops receiving battlefield training in the UK further and faster.

-----

**20.** In support of the four pillars of the IRR, we have articulated a new, clear purpose for
Defence: to protect the nation, and to help it prosper. To deliver this, we will focus on
four priorities:

|What?|How?|
|---|---|
|Protect the UK, its Crown Dependencies, and its Overseas Territories, and contribute to the collective deterrence and defence of the Euro-Atlantic area: able to deter and, if necessary, defend against and defeat, attacks on the UK homeland (including our Overseas Territories) and our NATO Allies.|By modernising our strategic nuclear deterrent, delivering a credible warfighting force, enhancing our contribution to NATO, accelerating modernisation of the force, continuing to support Ukraine, and increasing our investment in homeland defence and national resilience.|
|Pursue a campaigning approach to counter the threats from state and non-state actors, wherever they manifest in the world, working in an integrated way with allies and partners to achieve focused and impactful results.|By embedding campaigning as the way Defence delivers its effect, integrating all the levers of defence power in a targeted approach, with allies and partners, and across Government, enabling forward deployment and persistent presence, and developing exportable expertise.|
|Promote our national interests globally, building influential relationships, and maintaining engagement and access.|By collaborating with our core network of democratic allies and partners, building deeper relationships with influential ‘middle‑ground powers’, investing in and exploiting our existing permanent presence, and maximising the benefit from pulsed deployments, defence diplomacy, capability collaboration and defence exports.|
|Secure strategic advantage, achieve greater economic and industrial resilience, and contribute to national prosperity.|By investing in our people, exploiting innovation in digital, data and science & technology, forging a closer relationship with industry, improving our acquisition processes, adopting an activist approach to defence exports, and maximising our productivity, enhancing readiness and lethality.|


-----

**21.** To meet the challenges head on, and to
seize the opportunities that emerge, we will
need to be:

**•** **Threat-led. This means being proactively**

focused on the threat from our adversaries,
able to deter – and if necessary, defend
against and defeat – attacks above and
below the threshold of conflict. We will be
optimised to fight, whilst able to operate
in lower-intensity scenarios to compete
effectively. We will embed a sustained,
campaigning approach that keeps pace
with the evolving threat context. In line
with the IRR, this means ‘think longterm; act now’. We will focus on the
lethality, availability and readiness of our
capabilities to meet the threat picture.

**•** **Adaptable. The ability to adapt at speed**

is a determining factor for prevailing
in conflict. In a volatile world, the
achievement of advantage over our
adversaries is an unending, iterative effort.
Therefore, the versatility of the UK Armed
Forces will be its strength – an evergreen force, with an agile mindset, always
adapting to stay ahead. Our people are at
the heart of this strategic advantage – and
we will recognise that in how we invest
in them: their commitment, ingenuity,
adaptability and drive make them the most
important asset we have.

**•** **Allied by Design. Our alliances and**

partnerships are critical to our security
and prosperity – whether through sharing
intelligence, operating alongside one
another, or building the next generation
of capabilities. While we will prioritise
our core relationships with our closest
allies and partners, we will also invest
in deepening relationships with other


partners across the world, many of whom
exert growing influence both in their own
regions and globally. We will be Allied by
Design and national by exception.

**•** **Integrated. To address the increasing**

range and complexity of threats globally, in
space, and in cyberspace, we will foster a
truly integrated approach to deterrence and
defence. This means enhancing integration
across all services and domains, across
Government, and with allies and partners,
and industry, as well as across regions,
and the spectrum of conflict.

**•** **Innovative. Modernisation is the key**

to our fighting edge. We will accelerate
the modernisation of our capabilities,
through innovation and experimentation.
We need to continue to prioritise research
and development, and science and
technology, working ever closer with
industry to achieve faster pull-through
of next-generation capabilities. Our
strategic advantage is maintained when
Government and industry are working
in lockstep. A common endeavour will
ensure clearer requirements, secure a
robust industrial base and resilient supply
chains, and enable faster development and
fielding of new capabilities.

**•** **Digitised. We will seize the game-changing**

opportunities offered by the digital
advances of recent years to maintain a
decisive advantage against our adversaries.
This will mean shifting our thinking to fully
integrate both steel and software, iteratively
developing – spiralling – our existing
capabilities to achieve battle-winning
advantage. This also requires us to invest
in enhancing the skills of our people, and
to take our Allies with us on the journey.


-----

###### A refreshed Defence Command Paper

**22.** In 2021, we responded to the original
Integrated Review with a Defence Command
Paper that set out, comprehensively, how we
would design and equip the force for the
decades ahead. Much of that is unchanged
by this Paper. We have been following the
lessons of Ukraine carefully as well as
measuring the success, or otherwise, of our
activities around the world. Where our
position in DCP21 has been vindicated, we
stand by it. Where we have seen that we must
move more quickly or do things differently
altogether, we have set out in this paper how
we intend to do so.

**23.** Our focus is drawn to how we meet such
a broad spectrum of threats, across the globe
and across all domains. Even with increased
budgets, we know we cannot just continue to
do more of the same.

**•** Our workforce needs are changing

quickly, and we must respond with a
**new employment model and skills**
**framework.**

**•** Technology is changing quickly, and we

must respond with a renewed focus on
**science and technology placing it at the**
heart of our force design and capability
development.

**•** The battlespace is changing quickly,

and so we must respond with a new
**partnership with industry and a focus on**
delivering rapidly upgradeable capability
more quickly.



**•** And the threat is changing quickly,

inescapably requiring us to do more,
and so we must be ruthless in seeking
**productivity gains to allow us to meet**
that demand.

**24.** With those necessities in mind, we have
inverted the traditional structure of the
Defence Command Paper. The transformation
of our organisation comes in the first part
because it recognises that whilst the Royal
Navy, Army, Royal Air Force, and Strategic
Command are at the tip of the spear, we
compete with our adversaries across the
whole of our enterprise. From the recruiter
on the high street, to the scientist in their
laboratory, to the procurement teams at
Defence Equipment and Support (DE&S), and
at every desk in every directorate across the
whole of the MOD and our agencies;
everybody in our organisation plays a part,
every day, in making sure that we are quicker
and better at everything we do than our
competitors and adversaries.

**25.** In the second part of the paper, we focus
on our strategic ambition and how we deliver
it through investment in our nuclear
enterprise; whilst with the ships, regiments
and squadrons in the conventional armed
forces beyond we make three broad changes.
Firstly, we re-emphasise our commitment to
NATO. Secondly, we invest initially not in
more fighting platforms but in the strategic
enablers, infrastructure and stockpiles needed
to make our capabilities resilient and credible;
for it is those things – not the inventory on
paper – that underpin real deterrence. And
thirdly, we bring greater coherence to our
global operations through a new Global
Response Force.


-----

###### IR2023 Strategic Framework


###### Defence’s Purpose:
 Protect the Nation and Help it Prosper


-----

**26.** We then set out a global campaigning
approach that brings together all levers of
Defence, in conjunction with wider
Government and others, and in an organised
and active way, to achieve our goals: from the
wide network of Defence Attachés, short-term
training teams, and joint exercises and
operations that develop bilateral relations with
friends and partners around the world; to our
determination to both protect our nation and
help it prosper through promoting UK
Defence exports. We draw out the importance
of our relationships around the world: from
new capability partnerships like the Global
Combat Air Programme (GCAP) and our plans
to build conventionally-armed, nuclearpowered submarines and share emerging
military technologies between Australia,
United Kingdom and United States (AUKUS);
to our support for regional security groupings
like the Joint Expeditionary Force, Dragon
Group, Accra Initiative or as a partner to
ASEAN. Finally, we set out the critical role
Defence will play in protecting the homeland
and in making the nation more resilient, from
policing UK airspace through to working with
other Government Departments to bolster our
economic security.

###### Part 1

### Securing and Maintaining our Strategic Advantage


-----

###### Chapter 1:

 Our People

**1.** Our people come first, both in this paper

and in all of our thinking as a Department
– because they are inescapably the
foundation on which our strategic advantage
is built. Regular, reservist or civil servant, they
are the most important asset we have. As
ever more autonomy and Artificial Intelligence
come into the workplace, their importance
does not diminish; instead, we would argue,
they become ever more critical.

**2.** Defence will always need courageous

people to do dangerous things; we cannot
see a future in which that is not required.
And so the contract between the nation and
its service personnel must always have at its
core that acknowledgement of the unlimited
liability that they accept in the course of their
duties. For that reason, more than any other,
we must force ourselves to be the best
employer that we can be and continue to
work with the rest of Government to ensure
service people, their families and our veterans
are looked after.

**3.** Service in our nation’s armed forces has

always been a fantastic vehicle for social
mobility, giving generations of people –
whatever their qualifications – the opportunity
to serve around the world, and over the
course of their careers to acquire skills,
expertise and rank that not only transform
their lives, but give new horizons to their
families.

**4.** In the next decade we must transform

our workforce to meet the ever-growing
demand for technical skills in the modern
battlespace but we must do this by upskilling


our current service personnel and enhancing
our training, education and apprenticeship
offer to those who are joining anew. We are
proud to recruit from every community in the
United Kingdom – we will continue to do so.

**5.** Moreover, we need to broaden our

appeal to attract people with skills and
experience acquired prior to joining and so
we must look at our career structures and
remuneration to reflect that not everyone
joining Defence is doing so in their late teens
or early twenties and in their first job.
Furthermore, once we have good people in
our organisation, we must do better at
retaining them. That is why the Secretary
of State for Defence commissioned the
independent Haythornthwaite Review –
the first complete look at the terms and
conditions, and incentivisation, of service in
our Armed Forces, since the Bett Review of
the 1990s.

**6.** The Haythornthwaite Review was laid

before Parliament on 19 June. We will
immediately focus on taking forward its
recommendations to modernise our offer
across the whole force. Such is the scale and
scope of the Review, we have identified three
key areas of the Review’s recommendations
to take forward as a priority: greater career
flexibility through a Spectrum of Service;
enhanced effectiveness of our offer by
adopting a Total Reward Approach; and the
digitalisation and simplification of our people
management system.

###### Career flexibility


**7.** We recognise that many young people

entering the workforce today take a different
view to how they will build their careers,
compared to the generations that have gone
before. They envisage careers that are flexible
and see themselves working in a number of
different professions, rather than progressing
within a single organisation. We will therefore
promote ‘zig-zag’ or ‘portfolio’ careers for
all our people who want them – embracing
greater opportunity for career mobility
between jobs in Defence and whatever other
employment they’d like to pursue elsewhere.


**8.** We are comfortable that our people will

flow in and out of Defence to reflect the
changing demands in their lives and their
personal priorities. Put simply, we would
rather a talented engineer served for six years
and then came back to us for ten more after
doing a few years of something different in
the meantime, than forcing them to leave the
armed forces altogether because we insist on
full unbroken commitments to service.
Serving the nation in our Navy, Army or Air
Force is a job opportunity unlike any other
and so we must have the confidence that if
we allow more flexibility in military career
management, we will end up with more of our


Armed Forces Day 2023


-----

people spending much more of their working
lives in uniform than is currently the case.

**9.** Defence is the largest employer in a

national security ecosystem that includes the
security agencies, the Defence industry, and
its wider supply chain. It is in the interests of
all that our people gain experience and further
their technical qualifications both during their
time in Defence and while working in the
wider defence and security sector. We believe
that by helping people in our most technically
demanding trades to gain experience across
the sector, we will unlock niche skills and
retain specialists for longer. Those in the
wider sector might also consider broadening
their own experience through employment in
Defence. This is not only to the advantage of
the Ministry of Defence but also rapidly
growing UK industries – like space, cyber
security, nuclear and advanced manufacturing
– which will contribute enormously to the
country’s future prosperity and security.

**10.** We will therefore offer a ‘Spectrum of
**Service’ that will enable us to be better at**
retaining and surging talent across the whole
force. This will mean increasing fluidity
between the military, the Civil Service and
industry, as well as between full- and
part‑time employment, through transforming
career structures and creating a continuum
between regular and reserve service. To do
this, we will progress towards a single Armed
**Forces’ Act, to remove the structural barriers**
that limit our ability to maximise our talent
across the whole force.

**11.** We must also revolutionise the way

**we recruit to ensure that our inflow better**
matches the needs of the services. We will
therefore increase recruitment into our Armed
Forces over the next two years and transition


to a transformational tri-Service recruitment
model. This model will be supportive of our
need to increase lateral entry into Defence for
those who are already well into their careers,
but also ensure that we continue to offer
employment to the widest pool of talent,
including to those who start with no
qualifications.

**12.** This flexibility of service across a whole
force will change the way we think about the
‘size’ of our Armed Forces. For too long,
headcount has wrongly been seen as a proxy
for outcomes with the size of the regular
forces taken as a totem of our national military
prowess. Over the decades ahead, the ships,
tanks and planes in our strike groups,
armoured brigades and combat air squadrons
will require ever fewer people but that will not
necessarily mean our workforce will be
smaller. We may have fewer people on the
front line but a much larger community of
specialists supporting them. As we learn more
from Ukraine about the changing nature of
modern battle and explore the opportunities
in AI and automation, we will maintain our
**force levels broadly at the levels**
**announced in DCP21.**

**13.** In line with the Haythornthwaite Review,

we will adopt a Total Reward Approach that
links organisational objectives with skills and
specific personnel goals. This approach,
which we will pilot through a selected
engineering cohort in 2024, will recognise that
the way we remunerate our people is often
much more than their core salary. Our offer to
our service personnel – including
accommodation, subsidised food, child
support, medical and dental care, and
pension – reflects a package that is worth
significantly more than salary alone, and in
many individual cases will eclipse that which


-----

would be on offer in the private sector. By
better targeting the financial and non-financial
reward levers available to Defence, we will be
able to offer a more compelling and
**competitive incentivisation package to**
those currently serving as well as to those we
seek to attract.

###### Transforming how we manage our people

**14.** In a digital-first world, we will make the
most of the opportunities offered by
**automation and Artificial Intelligence. We**
will both grow an adaptable and sustainable
workforce that can adjust quickly to evolving
demands, and harness modern technologies
to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness.
As a top priority, we will look to digitalise and
simplify our whole force people system,
exploiting modern technology, simplifying
existing policies and process, and removing
the barriers that prevent flexibility and
workforce agility and restrict access to talent.


our people in much more targeted and
efficient ways.

**16.** We will accelerate the delivery of the
Pan-Defence Skills Framework, through which
we are mapping out the skills needed for
each and every role in the entire Defence
enterprise and the force design of the future.
This skills-based approach will allow us to
better target our training and education,
recognising our responsibility to not only
attract people into the organisation who
already have the necessary skills and
expertise, but also to upskill those that we
recruit and, just as importantly, those who
are already in our workforce.

**17.** As a matter of priority, over the next

three years, we will address our most
**critical skills shortfalls, particularly in digital**
and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering
and Maths). As we invest in upskilling our own
people in these areas, as well as in nuclear,
**space, and cyber, we will also work more**
closely across Government, and with industry
and academia, to ensure that we are growing
those skills nationally. In partnership with
industry, our pool of engineers, cyber
specialists, data analysts and scientists, will
both be the digital warriors of the future and
will help underpin national growth and
prosperity.

**18.** We will maximise the use of new
initiatives, including digital training to upskill
both those entering the Defence enterprise
and those already in it, further developing the
Digital Skills for Defence (DS4D) project.
DS4D, funded to £19 million over three years,
and working closely with industry and
academia, will embark on an ambitious
pan‑Defence programme for all Defence staff
to transform their digital skills, through a

**15.** Defence has proved to be one of the

of society, providing equality of access to
employment and training irrespective of
background – providing powerful agency to
‘Levelling-Up’. We will place skills at the heart
of the way we access, plan and manage our
workforce, tailoring our approach so that we

Virtual Digital Skills Fusion Academy linked to
the Defence Academy. This will work
alongside world-leading organisations and
institutions to upskill over 65,000 leaders,
technically upskill 13,000 digital professionals
and raise the digital bar for the entire
250,000-strong workforce. Strategic industry
partners, including Amazon Web Services and
Microsoft, will assist. We will adopt a new
approach to reward, better recognising those
who bring tech talent to the organisation.
We will encourage greater fluidity and
**mobility between Government and industry**
for our most digitally able civil servants
and military personnel, opening new
opportunities for our national talent,
and supporting national prosperity.

**19.** There are over 100 apprenticeship
**schemes on offer within Defence, with over**
20,000 apprentices under training at any one
time. 57% of the schemes are STEM-related
and many are up to Degree-level equivalence.
The Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force
were ranked first, third and seventh
respectively in the UK’s top 100 apprentice
employers in 2023. We will build on these
foundations and offer even more placements
**and secondments to and from Defence, so**
that our people can deepen their specialisms
and skills-base. This will start through the
provision of learning credits and funding for
those undertaking qualifications in fields
where we are short of skills, and then extend
to providing other pathways to higher
education.


###### Supporting our service personnel and veterans

**20.** We recognise the invaluable contribution
**partners and families make to Service life**
and the critical supporting role they play in
sustaining operational capability. Andrew
Selous MP conducted an independent review
to understand the needs of Armed Forces’
families at the Government’s request.
Reflecting his ‘Living in our Shoes’ report,
a revised Armed Forces Families’ Strategy
has been launched. It establishes Defence’s
ten-year plan to drive modern, family-friendly
elements into people-related policies.

**21.** In September 2022, the Wraparound
Childcare initiative was launched; since then,
over 7,000 Service children have been
registered onto the scheme, with over
£3.5 million already claimed to support
families. By 2024, we will have expanded this
access to childcare for those working in
overseas locations. We will also launch the
**Defence Early Years strategy by March**
**2024, to increase capacity in childcare**
provision, serving Defence locations across
the UK. We are also determined to work with
others outside Defence – including the NHS
and Department for Education – to ensure
that Service children are provided with more
bespoke advice and support. In May 2022 the
MOD reached agreement with the Universities
and Colleges’ Admissions’ Service to adjust
its application process to better support
personnel, veterans and dependents entering
higher education.


-----

**22.** The provision of service
**accommodation is essential for the**
operational effectiveness of the Armed Forces
and a key component of the offer we provide
to our people. Whilst we have invested
considerably in subsidised accommodation
for our people, too many do not have the
standard of housing that they should
reasonably expect. Recognising this, in
October 2022 we published the Defence
Accommodation Strategy that set out an
enhanced accommodation offer for personnel,
their partners and their families. The strategy
establishes a new minimum standard for
Single Living Accommodation against which


the estate is now being assessed and
includes significant investment.

**23.** Defence remains on track to deliver
more modern and sustainable facilities for
the Armed Forces, including through the
wider Defence Estate Optimisation Portfolio.
To support the ongoing delivery of new
and refurbished military residential
accommodation and housing for over 40,000
soldiers, sailors, aviators and their families,
Defence will inject a further £400 million
**over the next two years to ensure that we**
provide the modern accommodation that our
service families deserve. As well as


Royal Navy Sailors working together


-----

contributing to Defence personnel retention
and effectiveness, the Defence Estate
Optimisation Portfolio will support the
Government’s ‘Levelling Up’ priority, creating
employment opportunities and providing
land for social housing.

**24.** We also recognise that our
**accommodation offer should reflect**
**contemporary needs, delivering our**
commitment to allocating accommodation
to personnel in long-term relationships on
the same basis as those who are married or
in a civil partnership. We will move away
from rank-based allocation of family
accommodation to a model that is needsbased. We will support home ownership
through the Forces Help to Buy scheme,
which has now been made permanent and
has already enabled over 28,000 Service
personnel to step onto the housing ladder.

**25.** Following a review into catering
provision, a new Catering Strategy has been
agreed across the Armed Forces. The
strategy puts the needs of personnel at the
heart of the provision, with healthier dining
choices available and delivered in a fashion
better aligned to modern-day living. Ahead of
new contracts in 2026, we are working with
industry providers to bring in as many aspects
of the new food provision as possible from
January 2024.

**26.** We want the UK to be a great place to
be a veteran. Defence has invested over
£40 million to digitise veterans’ welfare
services, pensions, and compensation
schemes. Over 10,000 organisations have
signed the Armed Forces Covenant,
recognising the value veterans bring to their
business and the nation’s economy. The new
Career Transition Partnership will enhance


the support we give to our personnel, so
that they transition successfully from the
Armed Forces.

**27.** With the Office of Veterans’ Affairs, we

are rolling out Veterans’ Recognition ID Cards
in 2023, and are reviewing the way in which
we provide services to our veterans: this
includes working with the NHS for tailored
support to veterans such as Op Courage,
which provides mental health support for
veterans, service leavers and reservists;
integrated personal commissioning for those
with complex physical health needs; and
veteran-friendly accredited GPs. Our
**veterans are a national asset and we will**
continue to champion their service and their
enduring value to society.


**28.** The War in Ukraine has reminded the
world that Reserves are essential both on
**and off the battlefield. Making the Armed**
Forces more capable and resilient, the
Reserves deliver both mass and access to
battle-winning specialist civilian capabilities
that Regular forces cannot readily generate
or sustain. They are also a crucial part of
Defence’s engagement with the nation.
Reservists must be recognised – at all levels
in Defence – as a vital part of the Defence
workforce and the introduction of the
Spectrum of Service will further enable their
utilisation and effectiveness.

**29.** To enhance the way they are supported
we will build on the Reserve Forces 30
recommendations, to address identified policy
and process frustrations, and to tackle the
cultural and resource issues our Reservists
face. This action will also seek to improve the


###### Harnessing the Whole Force


-----

structures and mobilisation processes needed
to generate the second- and third-echelon
forces that will reinforce and sustain
warfighting capabilities and protect the
homeland – our Strategic Reserve – as well
as ensuring we can make better use of
Reservists’ specialist civilian skills in Defence.

**30.** Defence is already an environment where
talent thrives and where careers are nurtured,
and we will make sure this remains the case.
Diverse teams are stronger, more innovative
and less prone to group-think. To ensure we
recruit and retain people with the skills we
need, we will champion inclusion across the
organisation’s breadth and depth, fostering
an environment where people at every level
are empowered and valued. We will continue
to diversify our workforce, including through
increased recruitment of women and ethnic
minorities. We will explore how we can better
recruit and support people with disabilities.

**31.** Considerable progress has been made in
delivering improvements for all our people, by
increasing confidence, transparency, flexible
working, and tackling unacceptable
behaviours through our zero tolerance
**policies (including in response to Sarah**
Atherton MP’s report ‘Protecting Those Who
Protect Us: Women in the Armed Forces
from Recruitment to Civilian Life’). We are
transforming our Service Justice and Service
Complaints’ systems to increase trust and
accountability. We remain ambitious,
however, to deliver more and accelerate
the pace of this change. The launch of our
Defence Race Action Plans will drive further
positive change for members of ethnic
minorities. We have commissioned Lord
Etherton’s report on the way LGBT people
were treated by Defence prior to 2000 and will


continue to work through his
recommendations.

**32.** The continued success of Defence is
underpinned by the calibre, professionalism
**and commitment of its Civil Servants –**
regardless of role, location or grade. This is
exemplified through the outstanding work our
Civil Servants have undertaken to support
Ukraine, across multiple lines of activity:
procurement, logistics, policy, capability
development, and finance, amongst many
others. Civil Servants are not only
fundamental to the strong performance of the
MOD as a Department of State and strategic
headquarters; across every part of Defence,
they are all focused on delivering the priorities
of the Government, and essential to
supporting the outputs of the Armed Forces.
A modern Civil Service is skilled, innovative,
ambitious, and determined to keep evolving
to adapt to a changing world. Within Defence
we remain committed to Civil Service reform
through the development of a ten-year reward
strategy for Civil Servants in Defence, the
introduction of improved long-term workforce
planning, and by modernising our approach to
the way we attract, recruit and retain talent.

###### Inspiring Youth and Cadets


**33.** Independent research conducted by the
University of Northampton has demonstrated
that the valuable life skills gained from the
cadet experience, including self-discipline,
confidence, and resilience, improve
employability and social mobility. The Ministry
of Defence sponsors five cadet forces: the
Sea Cadet Corps, the Volunteer Cadet Corps,
the Army Cadet Force, and the Air Training
Corps, all based in the community; and the
Combined Cadet Force based in schools.
There are over 135,000 young people and
nearly 26,000 adult volunteers in
approximately 3,500 cadet units across the


United Kingdom. Through the joint MOD and
Department for Education Cadet Expansion
Programme, work is progressing on the
Government’s ambition to increase the
**number of cadets in schools to 60,000 by**
April 2024, ensuring that more children in
state schools have the opportunities that have
long been a feature of the independent sector.
We will also partner with Further Education
Colleges across the nation to provide young
talent with clearly defined pathways into
**careers in Defence.**

###### Chapter 2:

 Transforming the Force through Science, Innovation and Technology


**1.** The global technology landscape is more

complex and dynamic than ever. We believe
that one of the main discriminators in both
global competition and future warfare will be
the ability to manage and harness technology.
Defence is therefore proudly at the forefront
of the Government’s ambition for the UK to
be a Science and Technology (S&T)
**Superpower and we embrace the important**
role we play within the UK S&T Framework,
which sets out the Government’s goals and
vision for S&T through to 2030.

**2.** We will embed the pursuit of strategic

**advantage through S&T in Defence,**


enhancing our ability to identify, exploit and
secure key emerging scientific and
technological developments, push the most
relevant technologies into operational
capability, and secure a range of military and
national benefits. Support to the National
**S&T Council (NSTC) will be at the heart of**
**our approach. We will contribute to the**
delivery of the NSTC’s goals, using a range
of Defence levers at our disposal; we will
prioritise investments and capabilities that
complement, rather than duplicate, wider
Government activity; and we will work with
the rest of Government to ensure that

-----

Defence can leverage the wider S&T
advantage generated by the UK S&T
Framework to deliver military advantage
and security.

**3.** Recognising that maintaining our

technological edge is as battle-winning as
anything in the force, we plan to invest
**significantly more than £6.6 billion in**
**advanced Research and Development**
**(R&D) to create and seize the opportunities**
presented by new and emerging technologies,
to enhance the military capabilities available
to the UK and our allies, and to help maintain
our strategic advantage.

**4.** The Defence S&T enterprise is the

bedrock of our R&D system. We will therefore
increase investment in our in-house
capabilities in those areas which are key to
evolving security challenges and future
technological advances, or which underpin
MOD’s ability to engage effectively with
external partners and suppliers. Among our
key priorities are the five critical
**technologies identified by NSTC:**

**(a) Artificial Intelligence. AI is a strategic**

priority for Defence, as set out in the
Defence AI Strategy, one of whose key
goals is the strengthening of the UK’s
defence and security AI ecosystem.
We will deliver innovative capabilities to
support current operations (primarily in
Command & Control and Intelligence) and
tools for greater organisational agility like
supply chain management. We will
increase investment in AI-enabled military
capability options, prioritising them in
Force Development and ‘balance of
investment’ exercises, and identifying
‘quick win’ capability enhancements and
new AI options in major programmes.


**(b) Engineering Biology. Taking synthetic**

biology concepts and translating them into
real-world solutions presents tremendous
opportunities for Defence, including
applications for future military capabilities.
We are therefore making targeted
investments, such as £2 million per year
over three years in the S&T programme,
to ensure that Defence is an early adopter.
This includes £12.5 million on Engineering
Biology applications of biofuels for
military aviation.

**(c) Future Telecommunications. Advanced**

electrical engineering is a priority S&T
capability for MOD, and we retain a strong
interest in the delivery of effective and
secure national digital infrastructure. We
will remain closely engaged with other
Government and national security
departments to support NSTC goals.

**(d) Semiconductors. Semiconductors are a**

foundational technology, critical to our
national prosperity and security. Defencespecific semiconductor technologies are
particularly critical to sensing, imaging,
weapons, countermeasures, and
communications applications. Defence,
as a major consumer of semiconductors
with market-shaping procurement power,
will work closely with the Department for
Science, Innovation & Technology (DSIT)
to deliver the outcomes set out in the
National Semiconductor Strategy.

**(e) Quantum Technologies. In 2022, Defence**

procured a quantum computer from British
quantum computer developer ORCA
Computing to develop future data
processing capabilities. We will remain at
the forefront of the quantum computing
revolution, challenging ourselves to be

amongst the first militaries to see, and
harness, its potential in the battlespace.
Alongside our interest in quantum
computing, we aspire to be early adopters
of quantum sensing, investing £30 million
over four years in Future Sensing and
already trialling prototypes on MOD
platforms. Defence has therefore already
signalled to industry that we are seeking a
role in building the national quantum
sensing ecosystem.

**5.** In addition, we will enhance our

capabilities in fields such as robotics, human
**augmentation, ChemBio, directed energy**
**weapons and advanced materials which**
will be critical to the delivery of military
capability and national security tasks.

**6.** Accordingly, we will reorganise our R&D,

S&T and innovation structures to create a
single joined-up system, reducing
bureaucracy, increasing our ability to push
S&T faster and more effectively into
capability, and developing a new integrated
science, innovation and technology strategy.
As part of this, we will develop a new system
for technology management, including a
more robust system integration capability to
assure our ability to access, integrate and
use cutting-edge technologies, and a stronger
approach to generating and modelling
options for the conversion of innovative ideas
and technologies into capability. We will
establish a technology feasibility and
deliverability scrutiny function, to give greater
assurance that we can deliver our most
ambitious programmes.

**7.** We will work more closely with allies and

**partners such as the US, Australia, France,**
Germany, Japan and Italy to develop
cutting‑edge capabilities. We will seize the


opportunities presented by the creation of
**NATO’s Defence Innovation Accelerator for**
**the North Atlantic (DIANA) – with its**
European headquarters in London, twinned
with a second in Tallinn – to improve the
collective capabilities of the whole Alliance.
Through better understanding our respective
R&D priorities, science and technology (S&T)
capabilities, and industrial bases, we will be
able to exploit ‘best in class’ capabilities as
well as nurturing sovereign strengths.


###### Building a national ecosystem


**8.** In support of the National S&T Council,

we will significantly increase our efforts to
**shape national technological and industrial**
**outcomes: our national prosperity, a resilient**
technological and industrial base, a sustained
supply chain, and our military capability, are
all mutually reinforcing. We will engage
extensively with national initiatives (including
on AI, Quantum, Engineering Biology and
Semiconductors programmes), contributing a
range of Defence levers in support of DSIT
and other departments.

**9.** We will strengthen our engagement

**with, and increase our investment in, the**
**UK’s world-class university sector and**
**industrial base. We already have strong**
foundations, and we have strengthened this
engagement in recent years. In 2021/22 Dstl
spent £354 million on extra-mural research
through a diverse supplier base of industrial
and academic partners; Dstl estimates that
up to 10,000 jobs are supported by the
programme funding that it puts out to such
partners. We have opened a new Dstl hub in
Newcastle to help spread Dstl’s geographic
reach and harness the brilliant minds of the


-----

scientists, engineers and academics to
develop cutting edge data science and AI to
support our national security. Dstl is
investigating opportunities for further S&T
hubs around the UK to access new suppliers
and alternative recruitment opportunities.

**10.** Dstl’s close relationship with industry is
already developing game-changing


technologies. For example, in collaboration
with a group of industry partners known as
the Dragonfire consortium, Dstl has
demonstrated a working prototype laser
system against a drone. They integrated a trial
weapon system with advanced command and
control, able to generate 50kW of power in a
laser, and target it with ultra-precise accuracy
and stability. The test-firing in November 2022
included a direct hit against a tethered drone
3.5km away. When further developed and
deployed, this system will give the UK Armed
Forces the capability to neutralise targets
without the need for ammunition.

**11.** We will build on these foundations to

**nurture a genuinely collaborative**
**ecosystem with the aspiration to create**
**one system for Defence S&T excellence –**
**Government, industry and academia.**
With wider Government, we will invest in an
assured, resilient, high-tech industrial base
and the supply chains that we need. We will
particularly nurture and invest in those sectors
where military requirements likely exceed
near-term civil demand, like quantum sensing,
or where there is an imperative for Defence
to be at the forefront, such as advanced
materials, cutting-edge space technologies or
cyber research. We will do so by co-creating
solutions with industry; acting as a ‘first
adopter’, pulling civilian tech through into
military systems, and teaming with the
Department for Business and Trade to
maximise the export potential.

**12.** Under the direction of the MOD’s Chief
Scientific Adviser, Dstl will enhance its external
engagement, developing new strategic
partnerships with key organisations. We will
build a trusted community of interest with
whom we will share more information about our
research priorities and interests, and our

-----

understanding of key technology-driven risks
and threats – bringing Defence Intelligence
more fully into our approach. We will work with
wider Government and institutions to enhance
the security of our research base, helping to
strike the right balance between the openness
required for academic excellence, innovation
and prosperity on the one hand, and preserving
national advantage through the security of most
advanced research on the other.

**13.** We will develop an ambitious new
**approach to the exploitation of intellectual**
**property (IP) generated by Defence S&T and**
other innovators, developing the
Government’s existing vehicle for spinning
out IP, Ploughshare Innovations Limited, and
promoting larger-scale commercialisation –
to accelerate military capability delivery (the
journey from prototype to mass produced and
in the hands of troops) as well as tech sector
growth and job creation.

**14.** We will involve industry – including the
existing Defence primes, non-traditional
primes, and small and medium-sized
enterprises – much more closely in our force
design and capability development
processes. Through doing this, we will bring
more focus to our innovation ecosystem, and
promote more rapid pull-through and
exploitation of the cutting-edge technologies
that are being created and close the gap
**between what industry develops and**
**what we require.**

**15.** We recognise the risk of vulnerabilities in
global supply chains and the additional
benefits to national resilience, security and
prosperity that could arise from an approach
that maximises the use of ‘home-grown’
technology. We will therefore develop options
**for more interventionist approaches**


required to secure sovereign capabilities and
accelerate novel military technologies. We will
also explore options to build our future
capability more deliberately around national
**strengths in S&T, while preserving an**
approach that is still fundamentally
challenge‑driven. In doing so, we will play a
more substantive role in sustaining and
**developing the health of our R&D**
**ecosystem and S&T industrial base.**

###### Preparing for the future through wargaming and analysis

**16.** Defence’s demand for analytical
wargaming is increasingly high. It helps us
constantly identify options to deliver better
capability, insert new technology, and
optimise the way we operate. In order to be
able to counter rapidly changing threats
cost-effectively, force variation and force
development wargaming and analysis must
routinely be part of the approach.

**17.** Dstl plans to increase the size of its team

and secure wargaming facilities to meet this
demand, as well as working with industry to
develop additional capability. The building
blocks of this capability are: people with the
right knowledge, skills and experience; tools,
including models and simulations;
infrastructure, both physical and IT; and
reliable, accurate, curated data to feed
the models.

**18.** Our wargaming and analysis, combined
with horizon-scanning technology, has
supported many of the conclusions of DCP23,
indicating that we will need to reprioritise to
create the headroom to innovate to counter


-----

future threats and provide mass effects;
invest in autonomous vehicles and systems,
and novel weapons – like directed energy and
hypersonics; connect command and control
with sensors, so our forces are joined up and
function as a system with full situational
awareness; ensure we are putting the required
investment into key enablers to ensure that
our forces are more capable, deployable and
sustainable; and change the way we operate
in order to get the best from these new
technologies and capabilities.

###### Learning from the centrality of science and technology in our support of Ukraine

**19.** Analysis, including wargaming, will
continue to be a key tool in developing new
tactics and ways of operating. Indeed, we’ve
seen the power of the most sophisticated
wargaming models over the last fifteen
months as the UK, alongside other donors,
has played a leading role in wargaming the
various options for the Ukrainian Armed
Forces as they have planned their operations.
These technologies and methods will need to
become an ever more integral part of the way
the UK military both develops our force
design and capability, as well as the way we
plan our operations.

**20.** Amongst many more sensitive
contributions, Dstl used its depth of scientific
knowledge on camouflage, concealment and
deception techniques to provide novel and
innovative solutions to improve the
survivability of the M270 Multi-Launch Rocket
System (MLRS) gifted by the UK. Using its
extensive materials expertise, Dstl developed
bespoke and readily available armour


protection solutions for the Challenger 2 main
battle tanks, to provide additional protection
from specific Russian threats. And Dstl
technical expertise enabled the Ukrainian
Armed Forces to mount and integrate the
UK-gifted Starstreak short-range air-defence
system on to a number of Ukrainian armoured
fighting vehicles.

**21.** Battle-winning advantage has not just
achieved by expensive and exquisite
capabilities. It can also be delivered by
judiciously combining the truly high-tech
**with the low-cost, the off-the-shelf, the**
inventive, and the cheap – where these can
be deployed rapidly to solve an operational
challenge: the £100 solution defeating the
£100 million threat. As well as exploiting the
most cutting-edge science and technology,
Dstl has also identified highly innovative ways
of using a variety of materials that are readily
available in Ukraine – such as roofing
insulation – that can be combined to achieve
unique battle-winning effects against Russian
capabilities that have cost hundreds of
millions of pounds to develop.

**22.** This is not about adding a few good
ideas alongside our conventional capabilities
nor doing Defence on the cheap. To prepare
for the battlespace of the future and sustain
strategic advantage, we must embrace
technological change as we transform the
force but also not miss the opportunity to use
the inexpensive and low-tech to deceive,
disrupt and even defeat the technology of our
adversaries. Our mass comes not just from
**the ships, tanks and planes in our**
**inventory but from the innovative systems**
**we wrap around them and the cunning of**
**those that operate them.**


-----

###### From Platform-centric to Technology-centric

**23.** We must therefore think differently about
the Armed Forces themselves. To stay at the
cutting edge, we need to move decisively
away from a platform-centric approach in
favour of a focus on the military effects we are
seeking to achieve. Through a technology**centric approach we will achieve an**
acceleration in battlefield decision making,
greater mass, increased productivity in the
force and, most importantly, significantly
more lethality.

**24.** In those areas where we do continue to
require platforms, we will increasingly procure
based on a clear technology strategy,
driving more innovative and future-proofed
solutions. We will prioritise the ability to
upgrade and evolve through-life rather than
see platforms that were highly integrated at
the point of design becoming technologically
obsolete whilst still relatively new from an
automotive perspective. We will typically
achieve this through open architectures, rapid
software updates, and hardware modularity.
Across major programmes, we will ensure
much stronger technological feasibility and
deliverability assessments within our scrutiny
and approvals processes.

**25.** As we develop the future force, amongst
many other technologies, quantum sensors
will revolutionise our intelligence-gathering
capabilities; advanced materials with new
physical properties will open fresh possibilities
for the design and build of our systems;
and directed energy weapons such as
**high‑power lasers will form the basis of**
capabilities that deliver protection against
new threats like drone swarms. As technology


becomes more sophisticated, we also need to
think about our people; human
**augmentation technologies will help them**
overcome the environment and the adversary.
All these capabilities will be delivered safely,
ethically, and responsibly, in line with the
values of the society we serve.

**26.** **Autonomous vehicles will increasingly**
perform a variety of functions, from last-mile
resupply and logistics, to uncrewed wingmen
flying as part of a system around our combat
jets. Small cheap drones will increase our
intelligence coverage and provide new
options for delivering effects. Smart
**networks and sensors will feed sophisticated**
decision-support software, enabling faster
decision-making. Software – not least in its
power to make old technology new – will keep
our capabilities at the cutting edge, giving us
a decisive edge in the battlespace of the
future.

**27.** We will look to the future, investing in

and exploiting emerging technologies,
including through advanced Research and
Development (R&D), horizon scanning and
ongoing exploration and exploitation of


Autonomous vehicle trials as part of
Army’s Future Soldier programme


-----

‘generation after next’ capabilities. Crucially,
our strategic advantage will not just come
from new ideas, but from the speed at which
we push technology through our system –
inventing, prototyping, delivering and scaling
new capabilities. We will regard our
underlying S&T capabilities and the R&D
system which delivers more rapid solutions
as an important Defence capability in its own
right and place it right at the heart of the
Defence enterprise.

###### The full exploitation of Digital and Data

**28.** Over the last year, the Armed Forces of
Ukraine have shown the game-changing
impact of the most advanced intelligence,
surveillance and targeting software ever
deployed. We have witnessed how
communications infrastructure, digitisation
of data, and increasing automation and
autonomy are vital for data security,


information operations, communications,
targeting, interoperability, and lethality.
The war in Ukraine has also given us a stark
reminder of the need to adapt rapidly and
**innovate constantly in war, whether by**
creating new capabilities or adapting existing
ones. The dynamic combination of new
capabilities, growing interconnectedness,
and an expanding data environment calls
for a digital approach at the heart of
**defence and deterrence.**

**29.** Recognising that data-centricity and digital
agility are increasingly important elements of
our deterrence posture, we will reshape policy,
structures, and skills to exploit the benefits of
rapid digital change. This represents a
fundamental shift in thinking, whereby data and
digital technologies are no longer just ‘enablers’
but the cornerstone of our approach to
deterrence. Data-driven capabilities such as
analysis, automation and autonomy will deliver
exponential gains in mass, speed and
precision, with their compound benefits being
increased lethality, mobility, and sustainability.
They also promise significant productivity
gains; generative AI tools alone will enable
faster delivery of tasks from the most mundane,
like drafting correspondence, to the mission
critical production of code to update vital
battlefield software.

**30.** We will therefore see digital capabilities
as a transformative component of the
defence enterprise and will invest in them
immediately in order to become a truly
digitised force with data exploitation at its
heart, keeping pace with the rapid rate of
technological change. In so doing, we will
also work closely with Allies across NATO to
enhance our interoperability and the collective
capability of the Alliance. The power of digital
technologies and data will strengthen our


Data Servers providing an operational
data science environment


-----

deterrence, our resilience, and our national
prosperity. Creating and exploiting new digital
technologies, upskilling our people, and


working as a single enterprise with industry,
will underpin our whole mission: both
protecting our nation and helping it prosper.


-----

**31.** The MOD will accelerate delivery of its
**own digital transformation – what we call**
the Digital Backbone – including by investing
in a classified version of the cloud. We have
already delivered the early stages of digital
modernisation: evolving the MOD
communications systems and cloud
architecture to enable game-changing
data‑led analysis and decision-making across
Defence. We have set up the Digital Foundry,
a grouping of digital teams within Defence to
pioneer new ways to exploit data, harness AI,
and share and scale new ideas. We have also
established the Digital Exploitation for
Defence (DX4D) programme to provide a
guiding light for how we accelerate the use of
digital technology to be more effective in both
the battlespace and the business space.
We will further invest in upgrading our
systems and developing tools so that we can
**maximise the use of our data in support of**
our decision-making. We know that it is no
longer optional: high-quality, accessible
**data is a critical component of our**
**fighting power.**

###### Climate Change and Sustainability

**32.** Defence is already being impacted by
**climate change. We must face the reality of**
operating in a harsher climate and adapt
accordingly, enhancing both our capabilities
and our operational advantage. Defence is
also committed to playing its part in meeting
the Government’s ambitions for greater
sustainability and resilience, including targets
for Net Zero. These two objectives –
contributing to achieving Net Zero and being
more effective – are not mutually exclusive, as
highlighted in Defence’s recent Sustainable


Support Strategy. We will move from a model
of sustaining at reach, to one which is
designed for self-sustainment. In this way,
environmental technologies will give us the
means for a revolution in how we operate
and fight.

**33.** This is only the start of a shift towards
a sustainable mindset. Climate change will
impact how we operate, who we operate with,
and how Defence functions. We have begun
to show how Defence can harness innovation
to deliver this ambition. The RAF are leading
the way with the first Sustainable Aviation
**Fuel (SAF): in a ground-breaking trial flight in**
November 2022, a Voyager flew on 100%
SAF; and in another global first, the RAF
has since conducted air-to-air refuelling of
Typhoon using a blend of SAF and traditional
fuel. The Army has initiated a large-scale
**solar farm programme to reduce its**
emissions, create efficiencies and ensure
future energy resilience. The Royal Navy’s
cutting-edge catalytic systems are also
reducing nitrous oxide emissions from our
new maritime patrol vessels. Furthermore,
the buildings on the defence estate are being
designed to be more flexible, efficient, more
resilient to ensure we are adapting to, and
mitigating the impact of, climate change.

###### Chapter 3:

 Our Relationship with Industry


**1.** There are three key lessons reinforced by

the war in Ukraine that we must urgently apply
to the way we deliver capability to our Armed
Forces. Firstly, and most importantly, the pace
of innovation across the battlespace is
accelerating and cannot credibly be met
through conventional – often decades-long –
acquisition programmes and platform
upgrades. As a rule, we must buy simpler
platforms more quickly and design into them
the capacity to upgrade at speed – and not just
with the original prime contractor. Secondly,
we must partner with industry, exploring
together advances in technology and what
they mean for UK defence capability, being
willing to share risk and recognising the
importance of our defence industrial base in
our national security. Thirdly, time matters.
Waiting for 100% will almost certainly take too
long. We must force ourselves to accept
solutions that are ‘good enough’ and that can
be in the hands of our service personnel in the
timeframe needed to maintain our edge over
our adversaries and competitors.

**2.** Integration between Government and

industry is fundamental to sustaining the
fighting force, developing and exploiting new
technologies, and producing the equipment
needed at the speed of relevance. A common
endeavour which places industry at the heart
of the Defence Enterprise – recognising our
industrial base as an essential component of
our national security – will help maintain our
strategic advantage: it will underpin clearer
requirement-setting, more resilient supply
chains, faster development and fielding of
new capabilities, and a more activist
approach to exports (as set out in more


detail in Chapter 6). An effective Defence
Enterprise – comprising both Government and
industry – and a strong national economy will
be mutually reinforcing.

**3.** Significant progress has been made in

the past two years, since the publication of
the Defence and Security Industrial
**Strategy (DSIS) alongside the DCP in 2021:**
for example, the MOD has published its future
pipeline of work through the Equipment Plan,
Defence Capability Framework, Acquisition
Pipelines, and sector strategies such as the
Land Industrial Strategy and Defence Space
Strategy. We must now deliver on the
implementation of these strategies.

**4.** Progress over the last two years in

national shipbuilding is a prime example of
the successful adaptation of our approach.

-----

The National Shipbuilding Strategy Refresh
set out the Government and industry’s vision
for a globally successful, innovative and
sustainable UK shipbuilding enterprise.
As one of the major customers of the UK
shipbuilding enterprise, Defence has a pivotal
role to play in supporting the Defence
Secretary, in his role as Shipbuilding Tsar, to
achieve this vision. The National Shipbuilding
Office wants to see sustainable growth within
the UK shipbuilding sector, built upon a mix
of Government, commercial and export
orders. In the National Shipbuilding Strategy
Refresh, we committed to maintaining a
continuous shipbuilding pipeline. This will
provide a baseline of stability for the UK’s
naval shipbuilding industry, which remains a
strategic asset for ensuring the operational
independence of the Royal Navy.


**5.** However, we need to further transform

our relationship with industry – forging a new
**alliance – to create an environment that**
generates a shared sense of national
**endeavour. Industry is, and must feel, part**
of the Defence Enterprise. This must also be
visible: being in perfect lockstep with a
resilient industrial base will underpin our
**credibility as a fighting force, demonstrate**
**our dependability as an ally, and deter our**
**adversaries. An energised industrial base**
working more closely with the MOD will also
increase the UK’s national resilience and
ability to absorb strategic shocks.
Our relationship with industry will not just be
with the traditional primes: we will also be
open and welcoming for small- and
**medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and**
those outside of the Defence sector to better
collaborate with the MOD.

###### Defence and Industry: ‘A New Alliance’

**6.** We will engage much earlier in

**strategic conversations with industry.**
We will move beyond the traditional
customer-supplier relationship, developing
**long-term strategic alignment that not**
only delivers the capabilities we require now,
but binds the MOD and industry into a joint
**endeavour that can sustain the nation in**
times of conflict. This will require a collective
effort that combines the expertise of the
whole Defence enterprise: military, civilian,
and industrial. This new alliance will require
senior Defence leaders to take the time to
develop enduring relationships with key
industry executives, deliberately and regularly
sharing insights and information. We will
adopt an inclusive and transparent approach
which overcomes commercial sensitivities
when working both with Defence industrial
sector and adjacent commercial industries.
We will be clear about our planning
assumptions and our evolving requirements.
And through this collaborative approach,
we will transparently share risk, with a clear
focus on strategic outcomes.

**7.** An alliance built on transparency and

trust will mean that together we can better
understand long-term strategic challenges
and identify solutions to issues such as the
availability of critical skills, diversification
**and** **resilience within the supply chain,**
and productivity.

**8.** We will involve industry at all levels

earlier in the military capability development
processes. We will address issues related to
levels of security classification so that
industrial partners can better understand the


threats we are seeking to address and the
problems we are seeking to solve. We will
continue to improve visibility of the MOD’s
long-term planning to inform industry’s future
plans and investment. We will work to ensure
we have a collaborative technical
environment, operating at secret levels of
classification, to share information with
industry in a much more dynamic way.

**9.** We will be open to harnessing the best

ideas, from wherever they come. Strategic
suppliers are not measured by their size.
We will identify the sub-contractors and
**SMEs that are of strategic importance to**
Defence – including those based overseas –
and treat them as such. By involving industry
systematically, including through the Defence
Suppliers Forum, we will make it easier for
UK-based companies to access Defence
earlier, and in doing so broaden the base of
SMEs and technology businesses that work
with Defence. We recognise the strength of
SMEs in disruptive creativity and innovation:
we will therefore launch a new supplier
development programme that recognises
the importance of SMEs more generally and
that enables more of them to participate in
MOD projects.

**10.** We will work with industry and the City to
ensure that funding markets understand
more clearly the critical need for our
world‑class UK suppliers to gain access to
third-party revenue and financial services so
that defence suppliers are not disadvantaged.
This approach will help ensure that the UK
remains a base of choice for innovative and
trusted suppliers.

**11.** We will also work more closely with the

**private equity and venture capital**
**community, building on our existing**


-----

relationships through the National Security
Strategic Investment Fund (NSSIF) and
nascent NATO Innovation Fund (NIF) to attract
private investment and grow new national
security and defence companies. We will also
work closely with HM Treasury to set out the
Government’s position that there is no
inherent conflict between ESG (environment,
social and governance) financial principles
and investment in defence and security
companies. The Government is clear that
private investment in the UK defence industry
is both essential to our national security and
can also have economic, environmental and
social benefits. Misapplication of ESG
principles could compromise that important
private investment.


importance of iterative development. To
achieve this, we will build greater agility into
our processes for prioritising and allocating
resources. This means building in the
**financial headroom to respond to changing**
needs, enabling us to iteratively develop – or
**‘spiral’ – our capabilities. We will increasingly**
declare ceiling costs to industry for new
capabilities – ensuring money is available to
increase defence outputs today, while capacity
is kept in our budgets to incrementally develop
and exploit new innovative solutions.

**14.** We will also build on our positive

experiences of Type 31 and Boxer acquisition
by seeking to acquire core platforms that are
modular by design, making spiral development
and adaptation simpler and quicker. We will
work with our allies and industrial base to
ensure that we do not get locked into closed
systems – especially avoiding vendor lock-in –
that act as a barrier to spiral insertion of new
capabilities and functionalities: we must ensure
that we can update our capabilities in line with
the pace of the threat environment. Our
contracting approaches will also adapt to
support this way of working.

###### Robust and Resilient Supply Chains

**15.** We have a funded programme underway
to replenish and augment our stockpiles of
munitions, spares, and operational supplies.
But as well as increasing current stocks,
we must have an assured way of replenishing
rapidly when needed in times of conflict,
ramping up activity to meet the operational
demand. Our supply chains need to be
resilient to disruption, to ensure the UK
has assured access to key materials,


###### Spiral development


**12.** Increasing the pace of innovation across
the battlespace is not just about systems and
processes; it is also about mindset. Part of
this is about underscoring that capability is
never “done”; it must constantly adapt to the
**changing environment in which we operate.**
Instead of defining the exact force structure
we want, or the precise capabilities we need,
we need instead to build our ability to adapt
**rapidly. Our responsiveness to changes in**
technology and threat will dictate whether
we maintain a strategic advantage: we must
therefore rapidly incorporate feedback from
end-users and exploit emerging technology
effectively. We need to build on existing
**capability, incrementally increasing**
**its effect.**

**13.** We will reform our acquisition paradigm
from one focused on specifying exact
requirements to one that acknowledges the


-----

components, and critical technology. We will
expand and exploit the functionality of our
Supply Chain Resilience tools to understand
where the fragilities in our supply chains are,
and provide clearer direction to industry.

**16.** With industry, we will kickstart an honest
**assessment of industrial capability,**
**capacity, and sustainment. Within Defence,**
we will be clear about our sovereign
**requirements – in particular for munitions,**
complex weapons, and uncrewed systems
– through multi-year commitments if possible,
in order to help provide a more predictable
demand signal to industry. At the earliest
possible stage in the project life cycle,
we will help identify where there are similar
requirements in civilian and export markets.

**17.** We will explore ways to incentivise

industry to increase productivity through
**investment in digitisation, automation and**
**skills. Specifically, we will work with industry**
to harness the advantage of digitising every
part of the acquisition system, including
procurement, design, test and evaluation,
manufacture and in-service support. There
will at times be a requirement for generation
of mass, when industry’s manufacturing
capacity and in-service support will be
particularly important. In such cases, we will
programme for continuous capability
development and a pipeline approach to
acquisition that maintains production lines for
longer, and avoids skills fade.

**18.** There will also be cases where we have
an essential national security requirement for
certain industrial capabilities to be available
‘onshore’ within the UK. Where this is the
case, we will ensure that they are maintained,
potentially through a combination of MOD
orders, exports and civil demand. This will


also enhance domestic resilience. However,
many defence supply chains are global in
nature, and so we will also work with our
closest international partners (NATO, EU,
Five Eyes and the G7) to improve our supply
chains’ collective resilience, including through
‘friendshoring’. We will continue to use the
National Technology Industrial Base to create
opportunities for UK industry to work more
effectively with industrial bases across our
Five Eyes partners.

**19.** More widely, we will need to work ever

**more closely with international partners to**
increase sustainable global capacity and speed
of procurement: coordinating our demands of
industry; improving standardisation,
interoperability and interchangeability;
prioritising open architectures, aligning
technical requirements and exploring mutual
recognition of accreditation; and addressing
other barriers to international industrial
cooperation. Having led the way on the creation
of the initiative, the MOD supports the
development of NATO’s Defence Production
Action Plan (DPAP), which will increase allied
standardisation and interoperability in key
munitions, and will reduce barriers to industrial
cooperation between Allies. We will also seek
international agreements to host cloud-based
collaborative environments that enable the
MOD to work more seamlessly with UK
industry, partner governments, and industries in
other nations, at higher security classifications.

**20.** Our experience of COVID demonstrated
the strength of having an adaptable industrial
base – with factories able to shift production
lines to meet new and emerging demands.
Given the evolving security environment, we will
now explore options that incentivise industrial
partners to prioritise national security needs
(defence, energy, homeland security and


-----

emergency preparedness) ahead of commercial
requests in their production planning. Such
flexibility would make a significant difference
in a time of national emergency.


with the objectives of senior defence, industry
and political leadership. To secure strategic
advantage, we must scale this model more
aggressively to meet Defence’s needs.

**22.** Whilst our acquisition system must
enable consistent delivery of capability to
agreed parameters – of time, cost and
performance – we will put growing value on
**time: driving pace is critical – even if it forces**
us to increase our risk tolerance elsewhere.
Our ambition is to reduce radically the
average time from the identification of a
military need to contract placement, and from
contract placement to delivery to the
front‑line. This has been realised recently
through the Army’s procurement of the Mobile
Fires Platform Archer. Further, Defence is
leveraging new technologies and methods of
procurement to adapt at pace, with a number
of Royal Navy projects – ASW Spearhead,
NavyX, Fleet Solid Support and Maritime
Offensive Surface Strike – receiving
recognition at the recent Defence Acquisition
and Project Delivery Awards for delivering
complex programmes.


###### Acquisition Reform


**21.** To outmatch the threats that we face
today, and may face in the future, we need
radically to reform our approach to
acquisition, in a way that complements our
new alliance with industry. The experience of
Ukraine has reminded us that accepting 80%
can deliver effective and robust capability into
the hands of the users today. Waiting for
100% – the exquisite solution – may mean
losing strategic advantage. We must therefore
drive greater pace and agility into how we
acquire military capability for the front line,
including by prioritising timely delivery over
**perfection. We have demonstrated through**
our support to Ukraine that we can acquire
and deliver capabilities at incredible speed
when funding and risk appetite are aligned

-----

**23.** We intend to go further, and set a
**maximum five-year commitment for**
**acquisition programmes, with a maximum**
three-year commitment for digital
programmes. Given that the MOD procures a
wide range of equipment, goods and services,
we will tailor our approach to reflect the risk
and complexity of each programme, ensuring
that we are proportionate in the approach
we take. For example, we recognise that
some of our more exceptional programmes –
those on the Government Major Projects
Portfolio – will out of necessity take longer.
But even with these, we will challenge teams
to identify approaches that could generate
useable capability faster.

**24.** We will set our acquisition
**programmes up for success by conducting**
thorough front-end planning to ensure that
there is strategic alignment amongst all
stakeholders around outcomes and risk
appetite. Early engagement across subject
matter experts, including industry, will ensure
that the full range of options is considered,
informed by what the market can deliver for
the funding available. Where appropriate we
will consider the implications for both exports
and national growth. Within the MOD, we will
**reinforce the role of technical experts,**
including in cost estimating and science and
technology, ensuring that their voices are
heard in these early discussions and
strengthening key aspects of assurance to
identify issues early.

**25.** In this early engagement, we will be clear
on our specific requirements, particularly
relating to integration, while leaving room for
the market to provide innovative solutions.
For a range of capabilities, like uncrewed
aerial systems (UAS) and counter-UAS, the
MOD will define (and own) the operating


environment, such as the architectural design
and data standardisation; in effect, declaring
**‘Defence kite marks’ in each case. This will**
enable industry to incorporate software
solutions with agility and ensure integration,
adapting more efficiently to meet a rapidly
evolving threat. The new Integration Design
**Authority will work with allies and across the**
defence industrial sector to create open
standards for our operating systems and
protocols, as we have already demonstrated
with the Land CEMA architecture and
Pyramid Open Avionics architecture.
Defence Equipment & Support and Strategic
Command will take responsibility for ensuring
industry contracts deliver against these
standards and that integration into the
defence ‘system of systems’ is demonstrated
before completion of delivery into service.

**26.** We will improve delivery
**professionalism. Our major programmes must**
be led by individuals with the depth of
knowledge and experience required to deliver
some of the most complex projects across
government. To achieve this, we will build a
**cadre of professionally qualified SROs and**
Programme Directors, and mandate
Infrastructure and Projects Authority
accreditation. We will incentivise SROs and key
officials to remain in post across a programme,
with full-time SROs on major projects.

**27.** We will take a thematic approach to

capability development, moving away from the
current dominant domain-centric architecture.
This will force us to integrate capability by
design, across domains, to meet the full
breadth of an increasingly sophisticated threat.
We will work with industry to develop this more
thematic approach.

###### Chapter 4:

 Productivity: Creating a Campaigning Department


**1.** The need to compete effectively in a

more contested world means Defence must
deliver more, at an accelerating pace. As
budgets are finite, this can only be achieved
by aggressively driving productivity across the
Defence Enterprise – around the world and at
home. In order to be truly competitive and to
deliver even greater effect, the Department
must be strategy-led, threat-informed,
**outcome-focused, and data-enabled.**
We will apply best-practice techniques to
deliver an organisation which is aligned,
**mission-focused, leaner and more**
**productive. We have already made material**
changes, including to the way our Head
Office operates, and we have started to
apply processes to optimise the Defence
**Operating Model.**


that we better protect the nation and help
it prosper.

**3.** **Effective deterrence avoids costly**

**conflicts and the human and economic costs**
they bring. Increasing productivity in
**Defence is about getting more from our**
**assets – whether people or equipment –**
improving our ability to deter our adversaries
and strengthen our partnerships. Putting more
ships to sea, planes in air and people around
the globe to operate in contested areas
imposes costs on our adversaries, and
ultimately – and crucially – reduce costs to
ourselves.

**4.** Productivity is also about minimising

**time when those assets are unavailable,**
through better equipment support, by data
exploitation, and reinforced by our new
alliance with industry. This will prevent costs
rising and avoid extended, unplanned periods
of unavailability.


###### Increasing Productivity


**2.** The Government recently launched a

review of public sector productivity in order to
drive more outputs and cost prevention
across public services. Defence has a vital
role to play in this drive to improve
productivity, not only within Government but
also across the nation, and will engage
positively with that programme of work.
We are already reforming the way we work to
**remove organisational and bureaucratic**
**layers that are no longer fit for purpose and**
will drive towards a more productive
Department. Our change in approach will
ensure we generate a greater return from the
important capabilities we have invested in so


**5.** Risk aversion – one of the consequences

of a period of relative peace and stability
– makes us less agile and less competitive
than we need to be. In some areas, the fear
of failure, litigation or embarrassment has
created a culture that ends up compounding
operational risk, slowing the pace of delivery
and eroding our strategic advantage.
We must proactively manage our risk, rather
than allowing our activity to be restricted by
existing regulation and guidelines. Across
both our capability development and


###### Being in more places at once


-----

operations, we will take a much more
**sophisticated approach to managing risk,**
ensuring that we strike a sensible balance
**between appropriate mitigation and**
**seizing opportunity. We will look to every**
corner of the organisation to make us more
competitive and overcome institutional inertia.

**6.** We recognise that increasingly our

people will operate in small teams all over
the world, facing varying degrees of threat.
At the highest end, we will continue to
resource those teams with the full military
enablement that their operating environment
requires, and will invest in those enablers, to
allow us to maintain many more concurrent
points of presence, even in high threat
environments. However, we also recognise
that in working with partners globally, we will
often be in lower threat environments, where
we can, and will, empower our people to be


**able to live and operate alongside the**
**partner force, and to be enabled by them.**

###### More ready, more lethal, more integrated

**7.** The operational productivity of the force

– ensuring greater levels of lethality and
**readiness – is essential given the threats we**
face. As well as exploiting new technology to
this end, we have established a dedicated
programme to increase our operational
**productivity across the enterprise, focusing**
on increasing the readiness of our assets.
Defence is already well set, with access to
some of the very best military capabilities that
exist. However, our studies have shown that
we can get more out of them by rebalancing
investment in their availability and


Next Generation Protector RG Mk 1 UAV will offer increased
flexibility, longer range and enhanced data links


-----

sustainment. In the first wave of projects, we
are focused on maximising the return on our
investment in the new Type 31 frigate, our
Typhoon aircraft and our Challenger 2 tanks
– as well as setting ourselves up for bringing
Challenger 3 into service.

**8.** We will explore innovative ways to

increase our ability to generate the force
elements required to deliver strategic effects
around the world, at the right time, at the right
intensity and for as long as we need to: we
will remove barriers to readiness and make
cross-cutting changes that target bureaucracy
and inefficiency to grow availability, capability
and sustainment. We will foster an
**environment that instils a relentless focus**
**on the delivery of real-world impact,**
sharing examples of good practice at all
levels. We will give senior individuals in each
Command the specific responsibility of
increasing productivity within their
organisations within a tight timescale, by
giving them the data, tools and empowerment
they need to increase Defence outputs.

**9.** Across our single Services, the

transformation of our workforce will continue
at pace, as military strength is focussed on
the frontline and niche skills, while we digitise
and civilianise our headquarters functions; we
must extract the maximum efficiency from
technology within our administration.
Transformation is radically reshaping our
**training environment to meet the future.**
Training will be less reliant on physical estate
and more virtual, tailored to the needs of an
individual – not one size fits all. We will
continue to review the Armed Forces’
respective training structures, ensuring that
the most talented personnel coming up the
ranks have the opportunity to accelerate their


path to operating on the frontline, supported
by highly skilled technicians.

**10.** Redefining how Defence integrates and
understands value is central to increasing our
productivity and matching the pace of
change. The Integration Design Authority
**(IDA) will champion the fact that value is not**
derived solely from physical characteristics;
rather value comes from the degree to which
concepts and capabilities are integrated and
how adaptable they are to change. This will
drive Defence towards a software, not
hardware-defined approach; and to valuing
systems-of-systems above platforms. The
principal role of the IDA will be to optimise UK
Defence integration: it will do so by taking a
Portfolio-level view of Defence on behalf of
Head Office and beginning to offer Integration
as a Service for Defence, providing the
reference framework for Defence to make
informed decisions regarding capability
choices.

**11.** The Defence Support Functional Plan

(DSFP) is also driving transformation across
Defence’s enablers. The DSFP identifies,
synchronises and governs the principal
activities required across the Defence Support
Enterprise to deliver Support Advantage as a
vital enabler of Operational Advantage for our
Armed Forces. The DSFP focuses on
improvements to availability, resilience,
modernisation, and data-led decision making.

###### Embracing digital, automation and information

**12.** We will seek to harness AI and digital
capabilities to replace repetitive tasks across
Defence. We will increase investment in


-----

AI-enabled military capability, prioritising AI
options in Force Development and ‘balance of
investment’ exercises. We will identify ‘quick
win’ capability enhancements and new
dedicated AI options within major
programmes. We will also seek opportunities
**for greater efficiency and effectiveness in**
**‘back office’ functions through AI. We will**
**increase the use of digitisation, technology**
**and data in order to streamline processes,**
unshackle our people, and speed up decisionmaking.

**13.** We will put exploitation of data at the
heart of our approach, developing a coherent
digital architecture across the defence
enterprise to integrate all the levers at our
disposal. We will operate more dynamically
within the international information
**environment and improve the coordination of**
Defence strategic communications
activities. We will make more sophisticated
use of information to explain our approach,
to build coalitions, to change the behaviours
of our adversaries, and to influence a wide
range of audiences.

###### Working with the regulatory authorities

**14.** We will also need to work differently to
maximise the opportunities presented by
novel and emerging technologies. To
underpin the necessary increase in
experimentation, we will bring our regulators
into the innovation process much earlier.
Allowing the regulators to help shape new
capabilities will mean that they are assured
by design and introduced into service
more quickly.


**15.** We will work with the relevant regulatory
authorities – for example the Military
**Aviation Authority in relation to drone**
**technology – to enable us to test,**
experiment, and innovate within legal bounds,
ensuring appropriately-owned levels of risk
and accountability. We will also involve the
Defence Safety Authority at early stages of
the capability development process in order
to unlock safe and environmentally
responsible capability.


**16.** We will review the way we use our wider
infrastructure, with dispersal, resilience and
physical hardening – as well as effective cyber
security – central to any future estate plan.
We will develop a detailed infrastructure plan
that will propose an estate that is focused on
both people and military capability, more
resilient, better aligned with the future
operating environment, and that connects our
domestic and overseas estates. We will invest
in the Defence Estate to mitigate the risk of
asset failure or attack. We will also invest to
ensure we have sufficient critical assets to
**enable dispersal and regeneration and will**
lead the NATO working group supporting the
development and validation of the NATO
Layered Resilience Concept (LRC). The LRC
will clarify the military aspects of resilience
and support NATO’s military authorities to
build military resilience and support civil
resilience.

**17.** The Defence Estate Optimisation

Portfolio (DEO), our £5.1 billion main estate
transformation programme covering 80
projects in the UK, is on track to deliver both
accommodation and training facilities for


###### Infrastructure


-----

65,000 personnel and will also enable core
capability across Defence. Specifically, under
DEO, we will increase our investment in
**technical infrastructure critical to delivering**
our capabilities including the Future
Commando Force and Carrier Strike Group;
special operations; fast jet training; Future
Soldier; Cyber warfare; ISTAR and Defence
Intelligence. DEO will also create job
opportunities across the UK supporting the
Government’s ambition in Levelling Up and
national growth. DEO is leading change in
how Defence contracts its infrastructure by
creating stable work pipelines for industry
contractors and speeding up delivery.

**18.** Continued infrastructure investment
at Devonport will support the creation of a
Submarine Deep Maintenance Centre of
Excellence, creating and sustaining jobs and
local prosperity. In Scotland, infrastructure
development continues at RAF Lossiemouth
where the E7 Wedgetail will join the Typhoon
fast jet squadrons and the P-8A force as part
of the UK’s on-going commitment to NATO to
enable a safe, secure and peaceful Arctic
region, whilst also ensuring on-going
economic investment in Scotland.

**19.** Recognising that there is no easy
sanctuary from long-range precision
weapons, Agile Combat Employment (ACE)
will use agile and adaptable basing options to
protect assets, increase survivability and grow
operational resilience. ACE will enable the
RAF to generate air power at a time and place
that enables political choice.

**20.** But we most go further. We will develop
a detailed infrastructure plan that will propose
an estate that is focused on both people and
military capability, resilient to threat,
underpinned, for the first time, by an


evidence-based twenty-year infrastructure
plan, aligned with the future operating
environment, and linking both domestic
and overseas estates.

###### A leaner, more effective organisation

**21.** We need to shift our organisational
culture away from the peace-time mentality
allowed by the post-Cold War dividend.
We must live and operate as we would fight.
The way we do our business must foster
collaboration and deliberately break down
siloes. We need to empower individuals,
within the parameters of clear overall direction
and supported by robust accountability,
rather than pushing decisions up the chain.
We want our staff to be creative and to
seize opportunities where they arise. Our
structures, processes, and ways of working
must give us an edge, not hold us back.
We need to increase our productivity and our
outputs, and identify innovative, creative
solutions that enable us to have greater
impact in the world. This requires a shift in
our culture and ethos, encouraging greater
empowerment and better balancing of risk
and reward. It also requires organisational
change – the creation of a Campaigning
Department.

**22.** Much has changed in the decade since
Lord Levene published his Defence Reform
recommendations. We need to be more
dynamic in how we respond to the evolving
threat environment – and we also need to
better integrate our activities and capabilities
in support of our campaigning approach.
Therefore, we have already launched the
process of redesigning the overall Defence


-----

Operating Model, which is considering the
**appropriate future model for integrated**
**delivery. This redesign is using techniques**
well proven to be effective in multiple industry
sectors. We are involving a wide crosssection of colleagues across the Defence
Enterprise to ensure we have a deep
understanding of the practical realities.
The process will focus on deliberately
reducing the number of hand-offs and
associated bureaucracy, and replace multiple
superficial assurance checks with fewer that
are more in depth.

**23.** Over the next twelve to eighteen months,
we will achieve an effective balance between
centralised direction and the empowerment
and freedoms that enable all parts of Defence
to operate with necessary speed and agility,
ensuring our Department is best organised
for delivery. We will also pursue greater
productivity across the Department through
the digitisation of our HR processes and
upskilling of talent (as outlined in Chapter 1).

**24.** Part of this work will consider whether
we have the right numbers of people with the
right skills across the organisation, including
at senior ranks and grades. We will prioritise
delivering greater impact in the real world by
ensuring our staff are more skilled and
capable, and by better supporting and
empowering them.

###### Building on the momentum of Head Office Reform

**25.** In the last two years, we have made
significant changes that are already having
an impact, reforming the Head Office so that
it is both an effective strategic military


headquarters and a high-performing
Department of State. We will continue to
deliver an ambitious set of reforms across the
organisation, accelerating the progress we
have made since DCP21.

**26.** Since the invasion of Ukraine, we have
strengthened the Defence Intelligence
organisation. It pioneered the rapid
declassification of intelligence assessment,
releasing it into the public domain through
traditional and social media channels and
seizing the opportunity to publicly discredit
Russian disinformation campaigns. We
transferred leadership of the Global Defence
**Network to Strategic Command, improving**
coherence of our global “sense, understand
and influence” function. In doing so, we also
delivered an immediate uplift in classified
communications capabilities in critical
overseas posts, with more to follow.

**27.** In 2021, we established the Secretary

**of State’s Office of Net Assessment and**
**Challenge (SONAC). SONAC has helped to**
ensure robust analysis and challenge is
brought to the fore in decision-making,
including relating to the war in Ukraine,
conducted numerous red-team events across
major defence strategy and policy areas, and
produced a series of net assessments to help
inform the Department’s longer-term thinking.
SONAC has also led the process to bring
external thinking into the Department to
inform DCP23.

**28.** The establishment in 2022 of a new
**Strategic Hub, sitting at the centre of the**
Department, has helped the MOD to be
clearer about its priorities, more articulate in
its strategy and plans, and more rigorous in
evaluating outcomes. It will also drive a focus
on delivering our strategy, identifying and


-----

###### The functions of Head Office


solving impediments to delivery, and holding
the rest of the enterprise to account. As a
Department, we must be responsive,
adaptable, and able to act at speed – but also


to ensure our actions are nested within a
long-term strategy that drives lasting change
in the world.


-----

**29.** DCP21 highlighted the need for ‘a
mindset that is based on continuous
campaigning, seeing all activity as part of an
overall operational design’. In addition to work
to develop and embed that campaigning
mindset, both in the institution and in
individuals, we have also established four
actor-centric campaign teams. The teams
combine policy and military expertise, have
a mandate to engage across Whitehall, and
report directly to Ministers as required. They
are taking a data-centric approach, using
digital tools to enhance integration, timely
decision-making and evaluation. As outlined
in Chapter 6, we will embed **campaigning**
**as the way Defence delivers its effect,**
continue to build the campaign teams’
capabilities, and consider where best they
should be located in order to be able to
integrate all the levers of defence and wider
governmental power.


**30.** The reforms undertaken in the last two
years provide greater clarity over the function
of the Head Office, and how its activity is
coordinated and sequenced to direct and
support the rest of the organisation.
A modernised Head Office, clearer in its role,
will be more effective in both responding to
current events and in formulating and
delivering long-term strategy.

**31.** Underpinning the effectiveness of these
reforms will be a refreshed approach to
**security and resilience within the MOD.**
In the new threat environment, security and
safety must change from being a corporate
output to being an operational enabler.
Resilience must change from being viewed
as a ‘continuity of business’ issue, to being
an operational one. Both security and
resilience will therefore be embedded into
our critical functions with appropriate
leadership and resource.

###### Part 2

### Our Operational Ambition


-----

###### Chapter 5:

 Deterrence and Defence: Our Ability to Fight and Win


**1.** Defence’s core business is to deter and

defend against the threats to our security, to
roll them back where necessary, and to adapt
to them as they evolve. The fundamental
mission of UK Defence is the protection of
the UK, the Crown Dependencies, and our
Overseas Territories, as well as our NATO
Allies.

**2.** The contested security environment

requires us to become expert once again in the
art of deterrence: not just a concept belonging


to the Cold War, but one that we live and
breathe every day. In a volatile, complex and
ambiguous security environment, we must
embody a fully integrated approach to
deterrence and defence – including across
domains, across the spectrum of competition,
across government, and with allies and
partners – exploiting all the levers of state
power. We need to be credible at deterrence
by punishment, and deterrence by denial, both
at home and overseas. Our adversaries must
have no doubts about our ability and


UK troops taking part in Exercise

-----

**willingness to fight, and to win. Our ability to**
deter is therefore dependent on balanced and
credible capabilities – across sea, land, air,
space and cyberspace – and a clearly
communicated willingness to use them in the
place and at a time of our choosing.

**3.** The Euro-Atlantic region will remain our

clear priority and will continue to receive more
investment and attract more activity than any
other region. It is our home region and UK
national security, and the security of the wider
region, are inextricably linked. We will
therefore develop a force that is optimised to
war-fight in the Euro-Atlantic and in defence
of our homeland.


**4.** However, we cannot limit our ambitions

there. Instability in, and threats emanating
from, other regions around the world will have
an impact on both the UK homeland and our
interests globally. Our adversaries are not
contained to their own regions but will
compete with us everywhere for influence.
Similarly, the UK’s interest continues to be
challenged by non-state threats like terrorism,
piracy, and organised crime. We need to be
**able to compete, challenge and contest**
**threats globally. We need also to be ready**
**to seize opportunities; this requires**
**persistent forward presence not only in**
**Europe but across the globe.**


-----

###### Nuclear


**5.** As set out in the IRR, the foundational

component of an integrated approach to
deterrence and defence remains a minimum
**credible, independent UK nuclear**
**deterrent, assigned to the defence of NATO.**
The UK’s nuclear deterrent works every hour
of every day to guarantee our security and
that of our NATO Allies. It deters the most
extreme threats to our national security and
way of life and allows us to take the actions
required to maintain regional and global
security and stability free from the threat
of nuclear coercion.

**6.** The erosion of arms control,

disarmament and non-proliferation
architecture has negatively impacted strategic
stability. We now face a much broader range
**of strategic risks and pathways to**
**escalation, driven in part by rapid**
developments in science and technology,
and by expanding competition in the newer
domains of space and cyber. These are all
exacerbated by Russia’s repeated violations
of its treaty commitments, and the pace and
scale with which China is expanding its
nuclear and conventional arsenals, as well as
efforts by Iran and North Korea to advance
their own nuclear programmes.

**7.** These risks, as well as Russia’s

irresponsible nuclear rhetoric in the context of
its illegal war against Ukraine, have
underscored the need to maintain our own
nuclear deterrent beyond the life of the
current system to provide a credible,
independent, and capable nuclear deterrent
– as the ultimate guarantor of our security and
that of our NATO Allies – for as long as it is
needed.


**8.** We have therefore committed to a

**one‑in-two-generations programme of**
**modernisation of our nuclear forces,**
underpinned by long-term investment. In
2016, Parliament voted to renew our nuclear
deterrent and replace the Vanguard Class
submarines with four new Dreadnought Class
submarines. The programme remains on track
for the First of Class to enter service in the
early 2030s. To ensure we maintain an
effective deterrent throughout the commission
of the Dreadnought Class, we will also
**replace our existing nuclear warhead. Both**
the Dreadnought Class submarines, and the
UK’s replacement warheads are being
designed and constructed in the UK and
represent some of the most advanced
systems ever built. Their development
employs world-leading and cutting-edge
technology to deliver a formidable capability,
directly supporting tens of thousands of jobs
across the country and investing billions of
pounds into the UK economy.

**9.** In recognition of the centrality of our

nuclear deterrent, Defence has received an
additional £3 billion over the next two years,
and a further £6 billion over the subsequent
three years, which will be invested across the
defence nuclear enterprise. This is in addition
to our current levels of investment. This will
support the construction of industrial
**infrastructure, the modernisation of our**
**manufacturing and maintenance capacity**
to improve submarine availability and increase
resilience, the growth of our graduate and
apprentice nuclear skills **programmes, and**
the sustainment of in-service submarines.
We will continue to increase the capacity and
capability of our nuclear enterprise over the
coming decades. Specific investments in dry
docks and ship lifts at Faslane and Devonport
will increase resilience over the coming years.


-----

**10.** The success of the nuclear enterprise
remains a truly national endeavour. We will
proactively look for opportunities to enhance
cross-government cooperation to deliver the
UK’s defence nuclear enterprise, including
exploiting suitable opportunities for
collaboration on skills, capability, R&D, and
infrastructure, ensuring a coherent demand
signal to industry and academia. We will
publish a Defence Nuclear Strategy to set out
the recapitalisation programmes necessary
to strengthen and build resilience in UK
capabilities and provide an updated approach
to people and specialist skills.


###### Credible Warfighting Capabilities

**11.** The deterrent effect of UK Defence

comes not just from our nuclear capabilities,
but also from the credibility of our
**conventional warfighting capabilities**
**across all domains. As set out in the IRR,**
these forces must be sufficiently capable to
deter potential adversaries from engaging in
conflict, and to fight and win if deterrence
fails. It is these credible warfighting
capabilities that also make the UK a reliable
and highly capable ally within NATO.


Aboard a Texan T1 training aircraft


-----

**12.** As the battlespace evolves, it is essential
that Defence ensures the currency of its
**warfighting capabilities, across all domains.**
The war in Ukraine has increased the urgency
of our programme of modernisation and
**mobilisation, in particular for those force**
elements most likely to be decisive in future
conflicts. We will address shortfalls in
capabilities where a less contested and less
volatile world meant we were able to take
greater risk. Intelligence, Surveillance, Target
Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR)
capabilities, as well as Electronic Warfare
capabilities (which can provide or negate
asymmetric advantage), signals intelligence
and cyber, will grow in importance.

**13.** Our ability to deter will continue to be
underpinned by the lethality of our Forces.
The Royal Navy continues to develop lethality
to complement its carrier and amphibious
strike capabilities. The Naval Strike Missile
capability has been bought at pace and ships
are already being fitted to receive this
capability that allows precision strike on land
and at sea. The Army will also enhance its
deep fire capabilities, allowing the Army to
counter and hit precise targets deeper,
harder, faster and with greater accuracy.
The RAF is continuing to evolve and innovate,
including counter-UAS technology and initial
Swarming Drones capabilities.


###### Stockpiles and enablers


**14.** Our lethality will only be sustained through

investment in our stockpiles and enablers. The
war in Ukraine has demonstrated the need for
**sufficient stockpiles of munitions to sustain**
**maritime, air and land operations – a**
requirement further heightened by the gifting of


our own stocks to the Armed Forces of
Ukraine. Replenishing – and augmenting –
these stockpiles will demonstrate our
heightened readiness and credibility to deter
threats and defend the nation and our Allies.
We will therefore invest an additional
£2.5 billion in our munitions and stockpiles
through the coming decade, on top of the
increased investments committed at the
Autumn Statement and Spring Budget. We will
continue to review our holdings of all essential
expendable items, and will invest in such
capabilities as complex weapons, general
munitions, and operational spares stocks to
meet the needs of sustained operations.

**15.** Following the recent uplift in the Defence
budget, we will also increase our investment
in the resilience and readiness of the UK’s
**munitions infrastructure, including storage**
facilities (whether in the UK or overseas as
part of a multinational initiative) and the
enterprise that underpins them. We will work
with industry to make supply chains more
resilient and reliable, providing Defence with
an assured means of replenishing quickly
when needed, keeping pace with our
adversaries, and surging to meet
operational demand.

**16.** The provision of enablers is an
**essential component of the effectiveness**
**of our Armed Forces and underpins our**
credibility as a warfighting force – and
therefore our deterrence. High-intensity
combat operations with peer or near-peer
adversaries would put far greater pressure on
our enablers than we have seen for decades,
particularly the capabilities and the workforce.
It is therefore incumbent that all of our Single
Services prioritise investment in these
networks. A resilient Defence Support
Network is vital to achieving operational


-----

advantage and provides the ability to
transition effectively between competition,
crisis and conflict in a contested environment.

**17.** We will continue to invest in counter
**CBRN forces, ensuring the UK maintains**
political and military freedom of action despite
the presence, threat or use of CBRN
materials. This will enable us to continue
countering proliferation, supporting UK
homeland resilience against CBRN threats, as
well as maintaining our contingent capability
to operate overseas. We will continue to
support NATO’s efforts to improve its
preparedness to deter and defend against a
CBRN incident and to ensure that the Alliance
is best equipped to fight and prevail in a
CBRN threat environment, both today and in
the future. We will also invest more in our
**medical capabilities and stockpiles as critical**
enablers in the sustainment of operations.

**18.** We are re-investing in key areas such as
**Strategic Lift and the Strategic Base to**
improve our resilience, readiness, availability,
capability and sustainability. Assured access
or control of necessary Air, Sea and Land
Strategic Lift requires investment to enable
the deployment, sustainment, reaggregation
and recovery of forces particularly when
transitioning to crisis. The Strategic Base
requires both secondary and alternate Air
and Sea Ports of Embarkation, the
re‑establishment of military rail capability and
investment in mission-critical equipment.
Such investment will help us uphold our
global ambitions, strengthen our international
alliances, and increase interoperability
with partners.

**19.** A common logistic picture will underpin
the effectiveness of the Defence Support
Network. This will be enabled by an efficient,


resilient, and assured digital backbone able
to cohere the abundance of data and
information systems used across Defence.
We will invest in interoperable information
systems, resilient to cyber threats, to increase
data-sharing and integration with allies and
partners, particularly through NATO as it
moves towards a collective logistics
approach.

###### Space and cyber – new domains and key enablers

**20.** The space domain is increasingly critical
to Defence, and the war in Ukraine has served
to reinforce this. Space capabilities are key
**enablers in multi-domain operations,**
supporting Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance, communications,
navigation, timing, global Command and
Control, and missile warning. We can also
use space to deliver effects in support of
operations around the globe. As such, space
affords us operational advantage against
**potential adversaries; moreover, we depend**
on it for national resilience and our way of life.
We must protect and defend the UK’s
interests in and through space, and the
Defence Space Strategy (DSS), published in
2022, sets out a framework for doing so.

**21.** Since the DSS was published, UK Space

Command has developed at pace. It is now
delivering the £1.5 billion Defence Space
Portfolio of innovative and resilient space
capabilities and services. Alongside this,
Strategic Command continues to deliver the
£5 billion programme for the next generation
**of Skynet secure satellite communications.**
We have broadened and deepened
relationships with key allies and partners:


-----

multilaterally through NATO and the Combined
Space Operations Initiative (Five Eyes, France
and Germany); and bilaterally through new
agreements with Australia, Japan, Republic of
Korea, and the US (US Space Command and
US Space Force). The MOD has supported UK
efforts through the UN to advance discussions
on norms of responsible behaviours in
**space, which aim to reduce the risk of**
miscalculation. Aligned to this, the UK has
committed not to conduct destructive tests of
Direct Ascent Anti-Satellite Missiles.

**22.** The space domain is increasingly
contested, with the pace of technological
change increasingly rapid. The UK must act
fast to deliver space capabilities if we are to
secure operational advantage. UK Space
Command will improve our understanding
of the domain through enhanced Space
**Domain Awareness. The new Joint**
Commercial Operations concept will fuse
commercial and military data sources,
leveraging AI and Machine Learning, while we
continue to contribute to our allies’ Space
Situational Network. We will better integrate
across Government and with industry through
the accelerated delivery of a National Space
Operations Centre. We will prioritise the
development of new ‘Space Control’
capabilities that allow us to sustain freedom
of action by generating carefully calibrated
effects. We will also explore our launch
capabilities to diversify our ability to project
presence in the space domain. This will offer
political choice in support of integrated
response options. Finally, but no less
fundamentally, Defence is growing a skilled
**space workforce. We will introduce active**
career management for space specialists and
will continue delivery of a Space Academy, in
partnership with industry and academia, to
provide the high-quality training needed


across Defence at all levels. To date, 650
personnel have already been trained.

**23.** Defence will be a global leader in cyber,
ready to compete constantly, and fight when
the threshold of armed conflict is exceeded,
while remaining resilient to cyber threats.
Established in 2020, the National Cyber
**Force (NCF) is a partnership between defence**
and intelligence – including the MOD, GCHQ,
SIS and Dstl – which carries out cyber
operations on a daily basis to protect against
threats to the UK, further the UK’s foreign
policy, support military operations, and prevent
serious crime. In April 2023, the publication of
the report ‘NCF: Responsible Cyber Power in
Practice’ delivered on the commitment in the
IRR to be as transparent as possible about the
NCF’s cyber capabilities and provide clarity on
how the UK acts as a responsible and
democratic cyber power.

**24.** Central to the NCF’s approach is the
‘doctrine of cognitive effect’ – using
techniques that have the potential to sow
distrust, decrease morale, and weaken our
adversaries’ abilities to plan and conduct
their activities effectively. This can include
preventing terrorist groups from publishing
pieces of extremist media online or making it
harder for states to use the internet to spread
disinformation by affecting their perception of
the operating environment.

**25.** The NCF’s work is covert and we
therefore do not reveal details of individual
operations. However, despite the necessary
level of secrecy, in line with our commitment
to being a responsible cyber actor, we can
confirm that over the last three years the NCF
has delivered operations to:

**•** protect military deployments overseas;


-----

**•** disrupt terrorist groups;

**•** counter sophisticated, stealthy and
continuous cyber threats; and

**•** counter state disinformation campaigns.

**26.** Over the coming years we will expand
the capacity and reach of the NCF to keep
pace with adversaries and ensure that
**offensive cyber capabilities are fit for**
**future conflicts and deliver greatest effect as**
an integrated part of the force. Many of our
capabilities in this area cannot be disclosed
publicly. We remain committed to the
establishment and expansion of the NCF in
Salmesbury, Lancashire.

**27.** Defence Digital continues to drive

forward the cyber security protections for our
people and systems to protect, detect,
respond and recover from cyber events, and
deliver defensive cyber operations, including
beyond our networks where necessary.
Our ability to both learn from events and hunt
forward to find threats will generate strategic
advantage for our personnel and partners in
conflict. This involves close collaboration with
our cross-government partners, including the
National Cyber Security Centre, and our
international partners, in particular through
Five Eyes and NATO.


bedrock of Euro-Atlantic security and the
cornerstone of UK defence.

**29.** As the IRR sets out, the UK’s
**commitment to NATO is ironclad and**
unwavering. We have consistently exceeded
NATO’s Defence Investment Pledge to spend
2% of GDP on defence and have set a new
national aspiration over the longer term to
invest 2.5% of GDP on defence, as the fiscal
and economic circumstances allow. We offer
the Alliance the full spectrum of defence
capabilities, including by declaring our
Continuous at Sea Nuclear Deterrent to the
Alliance as well as our offensive cyber
capabilities through the National Cyber Force.
Our Armed Forces participate in every NATO
operation and mission and provide over 1,000
personnel to NATO’s Command and Force
Structures, including the 4* Deputy Supreme
Allied Commander Europe.

**30.** The Alliance has responded to a more
dangerous world with solidarity and resolve.
NATO’s unity has held firm throughout the
war in Ukraine. Allies have not and will not be
deterred from providing Ukraine with practical
and political support for the long term.
Finland’s accession to the Alliance in April
2023, with Sweden to follow, further
strengthens NATO and bolsters our security.

**31.** NATO has also accelerated its most
**radical transformation since the Cold War.**
Through the 2022 Strategic Concept and
implementation of the Concept for the
Deterrence and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic
Area, NATO is hardening against the threats it
faces today and getting ready for the threats
of tomorrow. The Alliance has a new
generation of warfighting plans, which will be
backed up by more high-readiness forces, a
modernised military alert system, more pre

###### NATO


**28.** **Our commitment to Article 5 of the**
**North Atlantic Treaty, backed up by**
**modern, credible forces, is the most**
**powerful deterrent against aggression.**
NATO gives us a competitive advantage over
our adversaries through the solidarity of 31
nations and the multiplying effect of
interoperable forces. NATO will remain the


-----

positioned equipment, and a command and
force structure that will allow it to respond
faster to all threats. We will be ready to play a
key part in NATO’s Regional and Operational
and Strategic Plans.

**32.** The UK has been at the heart of this
transformation and will maintain its leading
position in the decade ahead. As NATO
transforms, so will the UK’s contribution,
underscored by our commitment to integration
and interoperability. We will make a
**comprehensive force commitment to the**
**Alliance through a substantial offer to the new**
NATO Force Model (NFM). As the Alliance
looks to welcome in two new members, the UK
will also lead the collaboration amongst Allies
to shape a revised Control and Command
**structure, with a specific focus on Northern**
**Europe – the regional area of greatest**
importance to our homeland defence. We will
continue to promote interoperability with Allies
through adoption of NATO standards, uniform
systems, and collaboration. We will continue to
work closely with NATO as it evolves its
doctrine for employing capabilities in cyber
and space, and we will champion further
investment in NATO’s digital transformation to
further enable multi-domain, data-enabled
operations.

**33.** The Royal Navy will continue to provide
the most comprehensive maritime
contribution to NATO warfighting capability of
any European Navy, routinely declaring
Carrier, Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and
Littoral Strike capabilities with their enablers
to the Alliance’s maritime forces. UK capital
ships will continue to operate as NATO
flagships and we will be highly visible in NATO
maritime activity in the High North, Baltic and
Mediterranean Seas and the Atlantic Ocean.


**34.** The Army will continue to lead the
multinational Enhanced Forward Presence
Battlegroup in Estonia and will provide the
land component of the Very High Readiness
Joint Taskforce in 2023 and, in 2024, the land
component of the inaugural Allied Reaction
Force. Whilst maintaining our warfighting
Division, the Army will also offer to strengthen,
with Allies, the UK-led Allied Rapid Reaction
Corps as a strategic reserve for NATO’s
land forces.

**35.** The Royal Air Force continues to conduct
NATO air patrols over Poland, Romania and
Estonia. It will also provide to NATO its
significant intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance capabilities, Air-to-Air
refuelling and modern strategic transport
fleets, as well as its highly capable fourth
and fifth-generation combat aircraft.

###### The Joint Expeditionary Force and the Northern Group

**36.** To achieve our ability to deter, defend
and compete, the IRR also emphasises that
the UK will need to work beyond NATO
through minilateral formats. Our commitment
to the defence of Northern Europe is also
demonstrated through our operationalisation
of the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) – for
which the UK is the Framework Nation. The
JEF has proved to be an effective tool for
enhancing the security of the North Atlantic,
High North and Baltic Sea region, and for
providing support to participant nations as we
have done during Finland and Sweden’s
NATO accession process. The JEF will
continue to work in full complementarity with
NATO to provide an additional tier of defence,
security and stability. The Northern Group is


-----

another valuable forum in which its members
– committed to maintaining security and
stability in the Northern European region and
the wider continent, as well as strengthening
transatlantic bonds – come together for


discussions on defence and security matters.
We will continue to prioritise our leadership of
both the JEF and the Northern Group,
promoting ongoing close cooperation and
interoperability.


-----

We will continue to be a leading provider of military equipment to Ukraine. This year our
support will again total some £2.3 billion, including over 360,000 rounds of heavy artillery
ammunition; hundreds of millions of pounds’ worth of strategic UAS; and hundreds of
additional air defence missiles

In summer 2022, the UK, working closely with international partners, established the
International Fund for Ukraine (IFU) – a funding mechanism that uses contributions from
international partners to procure priority military assistance at pace. Contributions of more
than £770 million have been made to the IFU. These will ensure the continued supply of
military support – lethal and non-lethal – to Ukraine through 2023 and beyond. In early
2023, the UK, alongside our international partners, agreed the first IFU capability package.
The package included vital capabilities in the form of air defence, uncrewed air systems,
maritime intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and spare parts for equipment,
including Ukraine’s tanks. A number of capability packages will be agreed through a
second Urgent Bidding Round; the first of these packages, which focused on air defence,
was agreed in June 2023.

Building on the success of Operation ORBITAL, the UK – alongside a growing number of
international partners – continues to deliver a major training operation for Ukrainian forces
under Operation INTERFLEX. Working with up to nine partner nations, this operation is
providing high-calibre training at sites across the UK – including for Challenger 2 and AS90
crews. More than 18,000 Ukrainian personnel have been trained under this programme, with
the ambition for up to 20,000 in 2023 alone. We will conduct more specialised and collective
training, including in the maritime domain and, with international partners, we will roll out a
programme of basic training to develop the Ukrainian fighter jet pilots of the future.

We are ensuring the support we are providing now, and the planning for longer-term
support, considers our potential role in any post-conflict scenario. Ukraine will require safe
skies, seas and borders, with strong Armed Forces, to maintain a stable and prosperous
state. We are working with Ukraine and international allies and partners on how we will
achieve that. We will provide support and advanced capabilities that meet NATO
standards that will allow Ukraine the space and time to recover, reassure its people and
convince Russia that it is not in their interests to continue or resume the fight.

All of this is to ensure that Ukraine has what it needs now, and in the future, to defend its
sovereignty, rebuild its economy, give confidence to its people to return home, encourage
private sector investment, and become a member of NATO. We will continue to work
closely with the FCDO so that the diplomatic and military levers are synchronised to
support Ukraine in achieving success on the battlefield and protecting its people – and to
help President Zelenskyy secure a just settlement and lasting peace.

###### Chapter 6:

 Campaigning and Global Competition


**1.** Defence will always be required to

operate across the world to safeguard our
interests and those of our allies. Actors who
challenge our interests in one region,
invariably challenge us the world over.

**2.** Nor are they just challenging the UK.

We have witnessed the willingness of actors
to use all the levers of state power, including
violence and coercion, to achieve a dominant
role and destabilise the open international
order which upholds global society. They
undermine the sovereignty and autonomy
of nations, create instability, threaten trade,
and challenge human security.

**3.** Our campaigning approach drives the

way we respond to these challenges in the
Euro-Atlantic and around the world. Whilst
we have set out in the previous chapter our
re-investment in our warfighting force through
the lens of its contribution principally to
NATO, that force still underpins our hardpower projection in the world beyond as well.
Our aircraft carriers, for example, have been
both committed to NATO in the last twentyfour months as well as deployed into the
Indo-Pacific to contribute to other UK foreign
policy aims in that region.

###### What is a campaigning approach?

**4.** Given the changing threat picture, we will

now evolve DCP21’s commitment to
persistent engagement into a global
**campaigning approach against the threats**


from state and non-state actors. Our
approach will be enabled by a dedicated
budget, allowing us to respond rapidly and
seize opportunities as they emerge. Taken
together, this dedicated operate budget, a
campaigning mindset that makes use of all
the levers of Defence, an increased focus on
productivity (as set out in Chapter 4), and our
development of teams of ‘exportable
expertise’, will enable us – by 2030 – to
double the effect that we seek to achieve in
the world.

**5.** Focused on threat actors, and the

impediments they present to the UK achieving
its national security objectives, campaigning
is an organised and active way to achieve our
goals. A campaigning approach brings
together all the levers of Defence – not only
military, but also informational, economic and
defence diplomatic – in conjunction with
wider Government, elements of the private
sector, and with our allies and partners, to
address the most pressing security threats
we face. It is representative of our integrated
approach to deterrence.

**6.** Our approach demands that Defence

considers the broadest context, recognises
how activities complement each other, and
resources activity that contributes to
campaign objectives. It is focused on outputs
rather than inputs and appreciates that
training and trading are intrinsically linked,
that intelligence and capability collaboration
are as much part of the tapestry of effect as
operational partnering.


-----

**7.** Campaigning recognises that every

Defence action has communicative effect.
Everything we do, or do not do,
communicates a message that will be
perceived differently by a multitude of target
audiences, be they friendly, neutral, or hostile;
both at home and abroad. Campaigning
advances the national interests by using
Defence as a means of communication to
influence the attitudes, beliefs and behaviours
of audiences.


###### How do we campaign?


**8.** Campaigning runs through Defence, from

the strategic level, through the operational, to
tactical delivery. Defence’s levers are broad:
our people – civil servants and service
personnel; our culture and ethos – inclusive,
diverse and dynamic; our world-leading
technology and cutting-edge capability –
more lethal, integrated and dynamic than ever
before; our global network of Defence
sections and hubs and our ability to project
force; our integration with industry; and our
allies and partners, with whom we train and
partner, from whom we learn, and to whom
we export. To succeed, we will bring to bear
all the levers of Defence together into our
campaigning mindset. Our campaigns will be
the embodiment of multi-domain
**integration.**

**9.** The Global Operate Programme drives

our approach, setting the demand signal for
our campaigns. It describes the effects we will
achieve using all the levers of Defence and
how we will work with the rest of Government
and our allies and partners to address the
impediments to our national security and
achieve our strategic outcomes. It offers


choice of action, choice of message and
choice of partners in addressing the
challenges. The Global Operate Programme
will orchestrate between campaigns,
balancing weight of effort, maximising impact
and delivering meaningful effect.

**10.** Our approach will be focused on tailored
campaigns which help us deter, defend and
compete to address the most significant
threats we face. Campaign teams
orchestrate and cohere Defence activity so
that we are more effective than the sum of our
parts. Able to draw on thematic and
geographic expertise, campaign teams
leverage all our capabilities to challenge
malign activity across regions and domains.
They look long-term, planning to shape
activity in the future as well as set
requirements for capability development and
balance of investment choices. They ensure
we are addressing the most acute issues now
and safeguarding against emerging and
potential risks in the future.

**11.** Our campaigning approach will be

underpinned by data and digitisation.
**Data‑driven strategic campaigning will**
enhance our decision-making, enable mission
command, inform trends and opportunities
and allow Defence to think long term but act
now. It allows Defence to attain better
understanding, insight and foresight,
assimilating and presenting data to
maximise effect.


**12.** The ability to ‘get there first’ – whether
because we are present already, or because
we can deploy rapidly – is an important part of
our deterrence posture both in Europe and


###### Global Response Force


-----

beyond as the global security environment has
evolved from competitive to contested. We
need a force that is able to respond globally, at
pace, drawing on capabilities across all five
domains, and cohering our global outputs, in
order to deliver Defence’s mission.

**13.** We will therefore create a Defence
**Global Response Force (GRF), bringing**
together our deployed and high-readiness
forces, and drawing on capabilities from
across Defence in all domains. It will be
optimised for rapid, global effect to respond
to crisis, project force and campaign
constantly. As an all-domain task force, it will
deliver flexible responses and strategic choice
to deal with challenges that emerge,
anywhere in the world.


###### Persistent Presence


**14.** To campaign effectively, forward
deployment and persistent presence remain
important, helping us to understand the
global security environment, sense emergent
threats and opportunities, be poised to act,
and learn lessons and adapt our approach.
Our persistent presence is an integral aspect
of our deterrence by denial and contributes
to the UK’s ability to project soft power.
Our campaigning levers and activities
outlined below will help us better to
anticipate, prevent, reduce, and resolve
conflicts.

**15.** With the transfer of leadership of the
**Integrated** **Global Defence Network to**
Strategic Command, we can further exploit
the power of combinations, integrating
overseas bases, Defence Attachés, loan
service and liaison posts, and alumni
networks, all enabled by improved
connectivity and data exploitation. This
network of ‘people, places and tech’ will
provide an advantage that helps us to protect
the nation at reach in both the Euro-Atlantic
and Indo-Pacific, as well as Africa, the Gulf
and other critical regions, through enhanced
relationships and an improved ability to
sense and understand.


**16.** Our Defence Attachés are currently
based on 89 separate UK Embassy platforms,
and accredited in 136 different countries.
We aim to grow our global network of British
Defence Staffs and Defence Attachés steadily
as resources become available and in line
with Government and Defence objectives.
Six new Defence Attaché locations have been
opened in around the last twelve months.
We will further professionalise and
operationalise the network to establish a
clearly defined career stream for Service
Personnel and create a talent pipeline that
equips our network with the skills needed for
global campaigning. We will deliver targeted

‘prosperity’ training to our Defence Attachés
to strengthen the capability in this area of
defence section work.

**17.** We will continue to invest in our Global

**Hubs in Cyprus, Gibraltar, Germany, Oman**
and Kenya. We have dedicated naval facilities
in Bahrain and are developing a defence
strategic hub in Oman: these provide a
platform from which we can project assets
and increase training operations with partners
across the Indian Ocean with greater
frequency. Our strategic hub in Kenya
provides a regional anchor for training and
capacity-building across the region,
underpinning our commitment to tackling
collective threats such as terrorism in the
Horn of Africa region. These hubs, and our
other overseas bases and support facilities,
provide a Defence presence in important
parts of the world. They act as a springboard
for Defence to project globally, provide vital
access for our own forces, Government
partners and our allies, and are essential to
our being able to combat current and future
threats. Investment in our hubs will enable
Defence to support next-generation
capabilities across all five domains.

**18.** We will continue to maintain a presence
in the Overseas Territories, from maintaining a
garrison in the Falkland Islands in the South
Atlantic, to the permanent deployment of
ships to the Caribbean and Indo-Pacific,
deterring threats to the Overseas Territories
and through providing humanitarian and
disaster relief (HADR) when required.


**19.** The UK, the fifth-largest financial
contributor to UN peacekeeping, plays a
leading role in the UN and reform efforts:
by funding policy development, placing
personnel in positions of influence, and
lobbying to draw contributions from others.
This is partially achieved through our own
deployments; the UK contributes around 285
Defence personnel to UN peacekeeping,
across seven individual missions. This
includes the provision of 260 personnel to the
peacekeeping mission in Cyprus (UNFICYP),
playing a crucial role in maintaining the
island’s stability; and ten in Somalia. From
2020 to early 2023, the UK also contributed a
250-strong Long Range Reconnaissance
Group to the peacekeeping mission in Mali
(MINUSMA). This significantly enhanced our
reputation for in-theatre performance and
improved MINUSMA’s overall delivery,
demonstrating proof-of-concept for our vision
of proactive peacekeeping.

**20.** The UK is also renowned for the training
it provides to other nations’ peacekeepers,
covering both pre-deployment training and
niche, high-impact capacity-building in areas
such as counter-IED, medical, and
peacekeeping intelligence. 10,000
peacekeepers a year receive training through
the British Peace Support Team (Africa),
based in Kenya. The UK is now looking to
enhance its training offer, including through
looking at the possibility of British trainers
following partners’ troops into theatre to
provide continued mentorship; work to
develop a pilot is ongoing.


###### Peace-keeping


-----

###### Building our partners’ capacity and resilience

**21.** Terrorist organisations – including Al

Shabaab and Daesh – remain a serious
concern across the peripheries of the EuroAtlantic region, particularly in Africa and the
Levant. Our ability to work with and alongside
regional partners is critical to deterring and
countering such actors and helping to support
regional stability. Our world-leading defence
**education, training and capacity-building**
**offer to our partners across the world is a**
significant contribution to the UK’s soft power:
it builds, strengthens and sustains long-lasting
partnerships; it improves interoperability and
integration from the strategic level to the
tactical; and it boosts our partners’ resilience,
and helps them to deter, defend and compete
in their own regions. This better equips them to
protect their nations from extremist groups and
other pernicious influences, reducing the risk to
British interests overseas.

**22.** In Africa, we will support the African voice
on security matters including by championing
the mantra of African-led solutions to African
problems. We will work with the international
community and the United Nations to burdenshare, and to promote democracy and an open
and stable international system. To demonstrate
our continued commitment to West African
security, we will support our partners’ efforts to
bring stability to the Sahel region and the littoral
states. We will continue to build maritime
security partnerships across the Gulf of Guinea,
we will enhance our bilateral relationship with
**Ghana, and we will deepen cooperation with**
**Nigeria. Our strategic hub in Kenya provides a**
regional anchor for training and capacitybuilding across the region, underpinning our


commitment to tackling shared threats such as
terrorism emanating from Somalia and the wider
Horn of Africa region.

**23.** Although there remains an important role
for bilateral relationships, we will also remain
committed to both multilateralism and
‘minilateralism’. Bilateral partnerships can
generate even more value when combined,
and when issues are seen through a wider
strategic and regional lens. We will therefore
work to help to shore up the foundations of
regional institutions critical to long-term
stability such as the African Union and
**Regional Economic Communities. We will**
champion multilateralism to foster greater
engagement with a range of partners, as
shown through our support for the Accra
Initiative – the African-led solution to address
the spread of violence from the Sahel.
Our growing number of important
partnerships will provide a basis for
cooperation that can lead to practical,
regional solutions to complex problems.

**24.** Given the continued risk posed by terrorist
organisations and state proxies in North
**Africa, we will also continue to recognise the**
strategic importance of our partners there,
particularly Egypt, Morocco and Algeria.

**25.** Our commitment to supporting the
**resilience and security of sovereign states is**
pertinent whether the threat comes from terrorist
organisations or from state actors. In the EuroAtlantic, Russia has already shown a brazen
willingness to challenge the sovereignty of its
neighbours in the Balkans and Caucasus, such
as Moldova and Georgia. We are actively
supporting countries in the Western Balkans
region – a strategically important region for
European security – to make progress toward
democratic values and greater Euro-Atlantic

###### Levers of Defence


-----

integration, including by building resilience in
their defence and security institutions. We will
continue our commitment to KFOR, the NATO
mission in Kosovo, and will continue to provide
bilateral defence assistance to Bosnia and
**Herzegovina’s Armed Forces. We acknowledge**
the importance of the EUFOR peace stabilisation
mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina and will
explore how we can best support this initiative.
We will continue to build our partnerships with
NATO Allies in the region such as Albania,
Montenegro and North Macedonia.

**26.** Defence will continue to play an integral
part in both policy and delivery of the Conflict
Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) as it
evolves into the UK Integrated Security
**Fund (ISF). In line with the IRR’s priorities,**
we will continue to capitalise on opportunities
under the Fund to tackle conflict, instability
and insecurity overseas, including from
state‑based, hybrid, and transnational threats.
These efforts will be integrated across
Government to achieve most effect.

**27.** There are many areas where UK Defence

has expertise that is widely regarded around
the world, and where our advice is often
sought. This includes areas such as cyber,
science and technology, academic and
conceptual thinking, and strategy
development. In all these fields, we will
deliberately develop exportable expertise:
civil servants, military officials and other
experts chosen, trained and ready to deploy
to impart their skills, knowledge and
experience, as well as learn lessons from our
partners, and share best practice. We will
therefore stand-up three dedicated teams
of deployable experts to support partners.
Initially teams will provide cyber expertise,
capability guidance, and defence strategy
and planning advice. This will enable Defence


to generate and proactively share strategic
advantage with our partners around the world.


###### Defence Exports


**28.** Defence exports, and international
capability collaboration more generally,
offer far greater benefits than simple income
generation for defence companies. Defence
exports can also contribute to:

**•** Furthering the strategic policy objectives
of Government, including by building and
strengthening long-term security alliances
and partnerships; denying political and
economic opportunities to adversaries
and competitors; and improving regional
stability and the maintenance of an
international open order.

**•** Real-terms benefit for MOD through:
burden-sharing and co-developing
with international partners; maintaining
production lines and skills onshore;
increasing inward investment in R&D,
S&T, innovation, and new capabilities; and
gaining access to others’ expertise.

**•** Building a resilient UK defence industry
that has a diverse set of customers and
products; is resilient to the withdrawal or
underperformance of any single actor;
is able to invest in its UK workforce in
response to changing requirements;
and has capacity for surge production,
responsive to rapid changes in demand.
Faster acquisition processes will drive
speed to market and boost exportability;
in turn, boosting exportability will maximise
aggregate demand and restore industrial
output; in turn this will aid stockpile
replenishment: both ours and our Allies’.


-----

**29.** We are determined to uphold our global
reputation as one of the premier producers
of defence capabilities and equipment,
underpinned by our skilled workforce, and our
world-leading S&T development sectors and
infrastructure. We will continue to attract
companies based overseas to invest in, or
move parts of their businesses to, the UK.
We will also continue to integrate our approach
to exports with international cooperation, joint
initiatives, and foreign investment.

**30.** To increase defence exports, we will:

**•** Take a long-term approach to exports
markets, recognising that defence exports
require persistent, strategic engagement,
often over many years. We will also take a
more active approach to the sustainment
and upgrade opportunities arising from
significant export sales. These opportunities
provide not just a further revenue-driving
opportunity, but also the potential to
cement long-term strategic relationships
with overseas partners – particularly where
the Royal Navy, British Army and the Royal
Air Force are traditionally the reference
navy, army or air force.

**•** Put a premium on exportability in capability
development and selection by making it an
intrinsic factor in the acquisition process.
From the outset, exportability of the
capability in question will be assessed and,
where there is potential, shared at this early
stage with the Department for Business
and Trade. We will require capability
sponsors to factor in exportability and an
assessment of market opportunities at
key programmatic decision points. We will
introduce a mentality of ‘procure to export’,
while ensuring appropriate technology
protection. Putting greater priority on


exportability will not simply include our
major export programmes, but encompass
high-volume, low-margin capabilities as
well: ‘competing for inventory’. In short,
exportability will become part of the DNA of
our acquisition process.

**•** Adopt an activist approach to exports.
We will develop the mechanisms across
the whole of Government to support this,
including the re-establishment of a Defence
Exports Inter-Ministerial Group to drive
priorities and sustain senior engagement –
drawing on Ministers, senior officials and
trade envoys – on key campaigns. We will
work with UK Defence and Security Exports
(UKDSE) to coordinate resources across
Government, bringing them in earlier and
sharing data, so that UKDSE knowledge of
global market opportunities and relevant
requirements support exportability
considerations.

**•** Exploit UK strengths in the Defence
Technology sector, including Electronic
Warfare and counter-UAS. We will intensify
support to key export campaigns where
there is a clear global market opportunity,
including innovative UK companies whose
products may not be in the MOD’s own
inventory.

**•** Accelerate the delivery of Governmentto-Government frameworks for key allies
and partners to support both capability
collaboration and exports. In some cases,
these will require enduring Defence
Partnership Offices, to oversee the delivery
of strategic capability partnerships.
We will establish a new office to cohere
cross‑Government priorities and best
practice, connecting defence exports
opportunities with wider strategic objectives.


-----

###### Chapter 7:

 Strength through our Partnerships


**1.** The UK is unlikely to act alone in an

interconnected world. A cooperative
approach is therefore needed to effectively
and sustainably counter malign threats and
support global stability, through mutually
supportive burden-sharing: the previous
chapter highlighted our much-valued
partnerships in Africa, the Levant and
elsewhere. The UK is recognised for its role
as a convening power and the strength of our
Defence Network is valued by our allies and
partners. The UK’s global relationships
provide opportunities to shape and influence
the strategic environment. Through our
posture and our persistent presence around
the world, we have a deterrent effect,
contesting the space that our adversaries
would otherwise seek to fill, and are better
placed to seize opportunities.

**2.** A wide range of relationships and

dialogue – including with those who may
threaten our interests – will help build
strategic stability, transparency and better
mutual understanding. This will support routes
for de-escalation when required, and a
refreshed approach (developed alongside
the FCDO) to arms control and counterproliferation that complements our
deterrence and defence posture.

###### Euro-Atlantic Allies and Partners

**3.** Seamless interoperability with our closest

allies – notably through the auspices of NATO
– has a force-multiplying effect. The US is, and


will remain, the UK’s pre-eminent bilateral
partner for security, defence, and foreign
policy. The combined strength of our
relationship is not only critical to the security of
the UK, but also of the wider Euro-Atlantic, and
the world. In line with the Atlantic Declaration
announced in June 2023, we will maintain our
cooperation with our most important ally, so
that it remains the deepest, broadest and
most-advanced of any two countries in the
world. We will continue to host vital USAF
capabilities on UK territory. We will continue
to deepen our partnerships across domains,
on operations, through joint partnerships on
research and development, and in nextgeneration space and cyber capabilities. We
recognise that the US is world-leading in many
areas, but to remain ahead of our adversaries,
our combined joint strength is even greater.

**4.** **France is the UK’s closest European ally.**

The Lancaster House Agreement of 2010
established an enduring foundation for our
cooperation, exemplified through the creation
of the UK-France Combined Joint
Expeditionary Force (CJEF). We will work
closely in promoting international security and
tackling shared challenges, including by
harnessing the full potential to deliver effects
through the CJEF. At the March 2023 UKFrance Summit, we committed to further
enhancing our existing bilateral and multilateral
military integration, particularly through our
joint land exercises through NATO. Building on
our collaboration in the Euro-Atlantic, we will
explore opportunities for France and the
United Kingdom to demonstrate for the first
time the sequencing of more persistent
European Carrier Strike Group presence in the


-----

Credit NATO


Indo-Pacific. We will explore the increased
development of joint military capabilities
collaboration, with an emphasis on
interoperability and exploiting new areas of
science and technology. We will also enhance
industrial cooperation through a closer
relationship on industrial strategy. We will
continue our strategic dialogue, covering
almost all areas of policy, to ensure alignment.
We will also explore ways to enhance
cooperation with the US and France together
– as NATO Allies and Permanent Members of
the UN Security Council – in the P3 format.

**5.** We remain committed to all our JEF

**Partners (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland,**
Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway,
and Sweden). As shown by the bilateral
security guarantees signed with Finland and
**Sweden last year, we will continue to stand**
side by side with our closest friends in
defence of our shared values and our
collective security. We have deepened our


partnership with Norway – a vital partner
committed to protecting the North Sea
against Russian aggression – in the maritime
domain, including on joint anti-submarine
warfare capabilities and in the protection of
sub-surface critical national infrastructure.

**6.** Our commitment to our Baltic partners, on

the Eastern flank of the Alliance, remains
unwavering. We have a particularly close
partnership with Estonia, through our
enhanced Forward Presence (eFP). On 8
November 2022, we signed a Defence
Roadmap which sets out our joint plan to
implement the commitments for the forward
defence of Estonia that the UK made at the
NATO Madrid Summit.

**7.** In the High North, our goal remains to

maintain the historic norms of low tension and
high co-operation, but we are ready to respond
to the changing regional dynamics arising from
receding sea ice, which is bringing with it


-----

heightened competition and militarisation of
the region. We are committed to protecting our
Critical National Infrastructure and our other
national interests, to ensuring our freedom to
navigate and operate across the wider region,
to reinforcing the open international system,
particularly UNCLOS, and to contesting malign
and destabilising behaviours.

**8.** **Germany remains one of our closest**

like-minded allies. We continue to share a
common vision to jointly play a leading role in
NATO, particularly in supporting NATO’s
Eastern flank. This has been realised recently
through our joint Baltic Air Policing operations.
We will also continue to further strengthen our
defence industrial partnership, particularly in
the Land domain, where the joint development
of Boxer is a prime example of equipment
capability collaboration. We welcome
Germany’s commitment to increase its
Defence spending and will support Germany
as it delivers its increased investment in its
Armed Forces. To that end, we will pursue a
renewed joint vision statement over the next
year and will look increasingly to partner with
Germany on operational deployments.

**9.** The UK-Poland relationship is as strong

as it has ever been. Building on the
foundations provided by the 2017 UK-Poland
Defence Treaty and our shared membership
of NATO and the Northern Group, over the
past 18 months we have worked closely in
our delivery of military support and training to
the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Poland has
provided generous support and hosting to a
number of UK operations in its territory and
we have deepened our industrial relationship,
for example through the recent £1.88 billion
Pilica+ contract for short-range Ground
Based Air Defence (GBAD). Over the coming
year we will codify our relationship to reaffirm


our joint approach to Ukraine, to ensure
progress on capability projects such as the
Future Common Missile and the AH140
Miecznik frigate programme, and to facilitate
further deployments and exercises.

**10.** **Türkiye is a crucial partner for the UK, as**

well as a regional power of growing importance,
sitting at the cross-roads of three continents,
an important NATO Ally, and an influential G20
member. We will commit to strengthening our
strong and enduring Defence relationship. We
will also pursue increased industrial
collaboration, particularly within the Air domain.
We recognise the vital role Türkiye plays in
upholding security in the Black Sea, including
through the Montreux Convention.

**11.** We will also deepen our strategic dialogue

with the wider Mediterranean neighbourhood,
as part of our commitment to NATO’s 360°
**approach to deterrence and defence. We**
enjoy long-standing relationships with Spain,
**Portugal and Greece, and are committed to**
working together as Allies and through NATO,
including by identifying new areas for bilateral
defence cooperation now that the UK has left
the EU, for example through the Joint Vision
Statement which the Defence Secretary
recently signed with Greece. Our relationship
with the Republic of Cyprus remains critical.
We will continue to invest in the Sovereign
Base Areas, Cyprus, a key node enabling
global reach and from which we will continue to
provide a forward presence in the strategically
important Eastern Mediterranean. With Italy,
we will encourage further development of
collaborative operational and defence industry
partnerships. This is exemplified by our historic
and ongoing cooperation in the combat air and
weapons sector, recently demonstrated by the
launch of our partnership with Japan on the
next generation of Combat Aircraft under the


-----

trilateral Global Combat Air Programme
**(GCAP).**

**12.** We will continue to support close
cooperation and coherence between NATO
**and the** **EU: there will be areas where the**
strengths and different tools of both
organisations need to be combined. For
example, we support the need to explore
complementary approaches to hybrid threats
and resilience, space, cyberspace and
maritime security. We welcome the new Joint
Declaration on NATO-EU Cooperation, signed
in January, that included specific
commitments to work together more closely
on geostrategic competition, resilience,
emerging and disruptive technologies, and
foreign information interference. It remains
important that the Joint Declaration
recognised the need for European defence to
be complementary to, and interoperable with,
NATO – and that it called for the fullest
possible involvement of non-EU NATO Allies
in EU initiatives and vice-versa. We will need
this close cooperation in order to protect
long-term European security, particularly
when developing and procuring defence
technologies to replenish our stocks as we
continue to support Ukraine.

**13.** The new Windsor Framework creates a
foundation for stronger UK-EU relations.
The UK will use the new momentum in the
relationship to develop forms of direct
cooperation, as we already intend to do
through the PESCO project on military
mobility. We welcome the opportunity to
support EU initiatives and operations in the
future, particularly where this complements
existing operations the UK participates in.
We will explore opportunities for increased
co-operation, co-ordination, and
complementary activity with the EU.


###### Atlantic-Pacific Partnerships: Five Eyes, AUKUS, GCAP

**14.** The IRR highlighted the potency of

‘Atlantic-Pacific’ partnerships, based on a
shared view that the prosperity and security of
the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific are
inextricably linked. Defence partnerships that
span the regions are particularly important in a
challenging threat environment. Across the
Atlantic-Pacific, the UK has partners with
whom it can share, bilaterally and multilaterally,
the most sensitive intelligence – most notably
through the Five Eyes construct – and with
whom it can jointly develop new technological
solutions and scientific developments,
capitalising on each nation’s expertise.
The new AUKUS and GCAP partnerships
exemplify our commitment to deepening the
**relationships between the Euro-Atlantic**
**and Indo-Pacific regions, and to facing the**
threats of the future together.

**15.** The Five Eyes partnership exemplifies the
deep trust, mutual commitment and shared
values of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the
UK, and the US. The UK will work across the
full breadth of our shared agendas to develop
the partnership further. Our relationships with
such like-minded partners form a platform for
increased strategic collaboration, intelligencesharing, capability development and
operational coordination.

**16.** The landmark AUKUS Partnership,
representing unprecedented cooperation on
nuclear-powered submarines and other
advanced capabilities, demonstrates the
closeness of the relationship between the UK,
US and Australia. Under the auspices of this
trilateral partnership, we will deliver
**SSN‑AUKUS, a conventionally-armed,**


-----

RAF Typhoon fighter jets arrive in Australia for Exercise PITCH BLACK


nuclear-powered submarine that will be built
and operated by both Australia and the UK.
This is based on the UK’s next-generation
design for a nuclear-powered submarine
(SSN) that incorporates technology from all
three nations, including cutting-edge US
submarine technologies. The wider AUKUS
Partnership also provides a unique
opportunity to share expertise and build
resilience with both the US and Australia.
With a focus on the acceleration of near-term
delivery of capabilities to meet our militaries’
operational requirements, including in areas
such as AI, cyber, hypersonics and counterhypersonics, and undersea warfare, AUKUS is
driving technological progress and improving
interoperability with our closest partners. This
will help us to maintain our technological and
military edge in an increasingly contested and
unstable strategic environment.

**17.** AUKUS offers many distinct advantages.

First and foremost, it bolsters our warfighting


**capability. It will give us the ability to deter**
future threats across all domains. SSN-AUKUS
will deter threats in the underwater
battlespace, protect our nuclear deterrent and
our vital sea lines of communication, and fulfil
a range of military tasks, including anti-surface
and anti-submarine warfare, land attack and
intelligence gathering. Second, AUKUS will
enhance our interoperability – ensuring that
three like-minded nations with shared interests
on the global stage can work together even
more closely. SSN AUKUS will be a truly global
capability. Not just capable of operating in the
Indo-Pacific, our capabilities will strengthen
our contribution to NATO in Europe, and it will
enable us to operate in the High North where
the impact of climate change is opening new
military and commercial shipping access to the
North Atlantic. Third, AUKUS will help us share
**research and development across a portfolio**
of joint advanced military capabilities. Industrial
collaboration provides access to some of the
most advanced technology on the planet, while


-----

also allowing us to integrate our supply chains
and provide greater resilience at a time of
growing costs and inflationary pressures.

**18.** The Royal Navy will train **submariners**
**from the Royal Australian Navy, jointly crew**
UK SSNs, and increase the number of
deployments in the region in future years –
building on the visit to Australia by HMS
Astute in 2021. For the UK, the logic of
evolving our current SSN replacement
programme to SSN-AUKUS is clear.
Our design, combined with US technology,
will create a truly world-leading platform that
the Royal Navy will use to build our capability
in the Atlantic as well as further the UK’s
objectives around the world.

**19.** We will work with our industry
**partners to ensure that we are ready to seize**
the additional opportunities of AUKUS,
building on the recent investment we have
made in our submarine delivery. This will
deliver thousands of jobs in the United
Kingdom. In particular, Rolls-Royce UK will
build the nuclear reactors for all of Australia’s
submarines. As part of this, Australia will
make a proportionate financial investment
into our submarine industrial base.
Our partnership also delivers on our
commitment to setting the highest nuclear
non-proliferation standards.

**20.** The Global Combat Air Programme
**(GCAP) is a new partnership, announced by**
the Prime Minister in December 2022, between
the UK, Japan and Italy, that brings East and
West together to develop a new Combat
Aircraft. This next-generation combat air
capability, due to take to the skies by 2035,
aims to harness next-generation technologies
to deliver cutting-edge sensors, weapons and
data systems. It is being designed to ensure


our ability to protect our interests and allies
and partners, to retain control of the air, and to
conduct crucial missions in contested
environments, integrated with forces across
air, land and sea, and interoperable with our
F-35 fleet and allied aircraft.

**21.** GCAP aims to stay at the cutting-edge

of advancements in defence technology –
outpacing and outmanoeuvring our adversaries.
Therefore, we are designing a capability with
truly twenty-first century characteristics,
including open systems architecture to allow
rapid upgrade, machine learning to support
human operators, and digital networks linking
forces across air, land and sea to ensure
operational advantage and augment our overall
capabilities. The aircraft, which will start to
replace the Typhoon from 2035, will provide the
backbone of the RAF fighter force and sit at the
centre of a wider system of capabilities,
including next-generation weapons systems
and uncrewed aerial systems.

**22.** The programme aims to harness the
combined strength of our countries’ defence
industries, sharing expertise and costs and
delivering at pace. It is supporting highly
skilled jobs in all three countries, with over
2,800 people working on it in the UK alone,
acting as a launch pad and a ladder for
careers in highly skilled roles such as software
engineering. It will contribute to the UK’s
world-class combat air sector, which employs
more than 40,000 people directly and in the
supply chain. It is strengthening our sovereign
industrial base and driving innovation through
large-scale investment in R&D, with MOD
having invested well over £1 billion to date,
with hundreds of millions more from industry.
Together, we are investing in advanced
industrial technologies such as digital design
and additive manufacturing, as seen at BAE

System’s Factory of the Future in Lancashire.
The impact is being felt across the country,
with key combat air hubs in the north-west,
south-west and Edinburgh, making an
important contribution to Levelling Up.

**23.** GCAP also plays a key role in
supporting the UK’s wider strategic aims. It is
strengthening Atlantic-Pacific links, deepening
collaboration between key partners, and
seeks to deliver a shared capability reinforcing
security in both regions. GCAP, like AUKUS,
is a multi-decade endeavour with partners
who share our assessment of the international
environment and will help to preserve an open
and stable international order.


European nation, building on our many ties,
both historic and contemporary, and driven by
our economic ambition as the world’s sixth
largest economy: half of all global growth is
expected to come from this region between
now and 2050. Historic connections in the
**Middle East and Africa, including through the**
Commonwealth, require us to maintain our ties,
deepen cooperation and seek opportunities for
closer partnerships; the threats from terrorism in
those regions, and the destabilising behaviour
of some state actors, also mean we need to
continue to work closely in support of our
partners’ own capacity and regional resilience.
We continue to recognise the importance of
strategic dialogue with partners in Latin
**America, notably Brazil, Chile and Uruguay,**
as well as the Caribbean, particularly in support
of the defence and security of our Overseas
Territories. We will continue to support our
partners in the South Pacific and South
**Atlantic, and will support the delivery of the**
Government’s Small Island Developing States


###### The world beyond


**24.** The IRR set the United Kingdom the goal
of establishing the broadest and most
integrated presence in the Indo-Pacific of any


-----

(SIDS) strategy through delivering programmes
combatting illegal fishing and providing support
in response to climate change.


###### Indo-Pacific


**25.** We support the vision for a free and open
Indo-Pacific, in line with our values and the
values of many of our partners, and our
position as a permanent member of the United
Nations Security Council. The ‘tilt’ to the IndoPacific has been a whole-of-government effort,
requiring an alignment of our defence activity
to our diplomatic, commercial, industrial and
technological strengths as part of a cohered
approach to the region. We have more than
delivered on the defence commitments we
made to the tilt. Since 2021, we have:

**•** Increased our persistent presence in the
region. We have deployed two Offshore
Patrol Vessels to the Indo-Pacific on a
permanent basis. In their first year of
operation, they enforced UN sanctions
against North Korea, worked with the
Fijian government to combat illegal fishing,
delivered Covid vaccines to Pitcairn, and


provided humanitarian assistance to Tonga
following the January 2022 Tsunami.

**•** Demonstrated our hard-power reach to
the region through the deployment of the
aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth and
her Carrier Strike Group in 2021. This was
a journey of 55,000 nautical miles which
stretched from the Eastern Atlantic to Japan
and back, and involved UK military and
diplomatic engagement with more than forty
nations, including the first ever tri-service
military exercises between the UK and
India. The Carrier Strike Group will return
to the Indo-Pacific in 2025, representing
the UK’s commitment to exercise the best
capabilities our Armed Forces have to offer
alongside partners in the region.

**•** Expanded our engagement across the
region. This has been achieved through an
expanded network of Defence Attachés, as
well as regular deployments and training
visits, including the participation of Typhoon
aircraft in Exercise Pitch Black in Australia in
2022 and the Army’s exercises in Australia,
Republic of Korea and with Five Power
Defence Arrangements (FPDA) partners.

-----

**26.** We will now maintain the progress we
have made, putting the tilt on to a long-term,
**strategic, sustainable footing, including**
**through delivering on our campaigning**
**approach: strengthening our presence,**
deepening our partnerships, robustly
defending international norms and values, and
helping grow regional resilience. In his visit to
Singapore in June 2023, the Defence Secretary
restated our commitment to promoting
prosperity and stability in the region.

**27.** Our existing military footprint includes

our base in the British Indian Ocean Territory,
the British Army presence in Nepal and
Brunei, British Defence Staffs in Singapore
and Australia, and a network of attachés
across the region.

**28.** We will work to enhance the resilience
and capabilities of key partners through
training and military exercises. This will
include pulsed deployments of both
equipment and people to the region. The
Littoral Response Group will be ready to
periodically deploy to the Indo Pacific from
later this year. In June 2023, the Defence
Secretary reinforced that, given upholding the
open international order requires a collective
effort, we will deepen our investment in
**regional groupings, including the Five Power**
Defence Arrangements (FPDA), ASEAN
(we have applied to join the Defence
Ministers’ Meeting Plus) and the Five Eyes
partnership. We also remain committed to
supporting the strengthening of NATO’s
relationships with its partners in the region.

**29.** We will also strengthen our bilateral
**cooperation with partners in the region,**
including through industrial collaboration,
continuing to provide a spectrum of capabilities


and valued expertise that complements those
of our other allies and partners.

**30.** **Australia and New Zealand are**
amongst the UK’s closest and longeststanding partners, bound together through
shared history and values, as well as through
the Commonwealth and the Five Eyes
partnership, and now – for Australia – AUKUS.
The UK will work closely with both countries
across the full breadth of our shared agendas.

**31.** **Japan is one of our closest security**

partners in the Indo-Pacific, with a shared
approach to security challenges and a
commitment to an open international order.
Building on the deepened capability and
technological cooperation through GCAP,
and the recently signed Hiroshima Accord, the
Reciprocal Access Agreement with Japan will
allow our forces to deploy to one another’s
countries for large scale exercises and
operations. Underpinned by a commitment to
interoperability, under the Reciprocal Access
Agreement we will develop an ambitious
programme of larger, more frequent, complex,
and practical joint exercises and planning,
including through the future deployment of the
UK’s Carrier Strike Group to the Indo-Pacific.
Recent agreements with Japan represent a
generational opportunity to deepen our
strategic relationship across a spectrum of
areas. We will reinforce our current defence
governance structure, including through
establishing a new high level defence dialogue,
to ensure that we pursue all opportunities to
strengthen defence cooperation.

**32.** **India is a key partner and growing our**
relationship will remain a significant component
of our engagement in the region. We intend to
work together in the Western Indian Ocean and
we also recognise the important role India has


-----

to play on the global stage. We will seek to
deepen industrial partnerships, move capability
collaboration to new levels, and explore shared
export opportunities, building on the UK-India
2030 Roadmap.

**33.** We will also pursue deeper bilateral
defence relationships with other countries in
the region. This will include the Republic of
**Korea and Indonesia, with whom we have**
Defence Roadmaps, Singapore, Vietnam and
**Pakistan. And we will talk to China about**
peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and the
need for China to play a responsible global role.


###### The Middle East


**34.** The Middle East reflects a nexus point for
Defence’s priority campaigns. It is critical to
Euro-Atlantic security and prosperity, not
least as a result of the region’s importance to
global energy supplies, and given Iran’s
destabilising behaviour. Maintaining an
enduring presence in the Gulf will underpin
our long-term commitment to the Middle East;
through our presence there, we will also be
able to place our engagement in the IndoPacific on a long-term strategic footing. We
have strong relationships with each of the six
countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council,
and will continue to develop these strategic
**partnerships – bilaterally and as a group – to**
help make the region safer and more secure,
including through enhanced dialogue,
increased interoperability through exercises
and training, and greater defence industrial
capability cooperation. Through the Dragon
**Group we will convene the military Chiefs of**
Staff from the six GCC countries, Iraq,
Jordan, and Egypt, to develop a shared
understanding of regional security issues.


**35.** Our long-standing relationship with
**Saudi Arabia will be enhanced through the**
UK-Saudi Defence Cooperation Plan, as well
as the commitment to develop a future
combat air partnership, delivering a futurefacing partnership anchored in industrial
cooperation and bound together through
shared capability development and increased
interoperability. The UK-Oman relationship is
deep and historic, underscored by our
sizeable contingent of Loan Service personnel
and the development of a defence strategic
hub which provides a world-class training
facility and reach into the Western Indian
Ocean. Our relationship with Qatar will
continue to grow through our Memorandum
of Understanding and our two joint air
squadrons – the only such joint squadrons in
the world – as well as by expanding the
relationship in the Land domain. We will
continue working with Bahrain – not least
given the presence of a key naval support
facility and our leading role in the multinational
Combined Maritime Forces – the United Arab
**Emirates, and Kuwait to protect our shared**
interests and develop our capabilities: we
remain bound together by military
cooperation, energy partnerships, trade and
investment, and our people-to-people links.

**36.** We will also continue to deepen our
relationships in the Levant. Israel will remain
a key regional – and broader geopolitical
– actor, and we will continue to develop our
bilateral defence relationship. We will maintain
our commitment to Operation INHERENT
RESOLVE and the NATO Mission Iraq (NMI),
a non-combat advisory and capacity-building
mission, supporting Iraq’s sovereignty and
territorial integrity. Our enduring relationship
with Jordan will also be deepened, including
through our Loan Service and deployed
training teams.

###### Chapter 8:

 Strategic Resilience


**1.** Defence has a critical part to play in

protecting the homeland, and in making the
nation more resilient. This includes bringing to
bear core capabilities that only Defence can
access, for example, to defend our airspace
and to protect sub-surface and onshore
critical national infrastructure. It also requires
close integration with the rest of Government
in areas such as cyber defence, economic
security, and responding to the challenge of
climate change.

**2.** **Prevailing in war is a national effort,**

involving not just Defence, but all of
Government, our industrial base, and our
population. Our strategic resilience comes
in part from our ability to mobilise at scale
our military resources in a time of crisis in
response to threats to our homeland.
Our Reserves, with specialist skills and unique
connections, will be at the heart of this effort,
forming the core of the second- and thirdechelon forces that will reinforce and sustain
warfighting capabilities and protect the
homeland. The Strategic Reserve – built
around the ex-regular reserve forces – will
add further depth of capability, able to
generate previously unassigned surge
capacity and wider access to expertise in time
of crisis or national emergency.

**3.** Our strategic resilience will also draw on

our transformed partnership with industry
in creation of a more resilient, reliable and
adaptable industrial base – as set out in
Chapter 3; and through our engagement with
close partners including Finland and Sweden,
from whom we can adapt Total and
**Comprehensive Defence models. It will**


also come from work led elsewhere in
Government, but to which we will lend
our support, for example in Defending
**Democracy and countering mis-**
**and disinformation.**

**4.** Given the deteriorating security situation,

our need to strengthen our resilience and
protect critical national infrastructure is
increasing. We will work with our partners
across Government to plan and test how
**we would better identify vulnerabilities,**
**and exercise our systems, to secure and**
**defend the homeland in times of war.**
By taking steps now, we will strengthen our
preparedness, and enhance our deterrence
for the future. Our national resilience extends
across the whole of the United Kingdom and
we will continue to engage closely with all the
Devolved Administrations on Defence
matters.


###### Civil Contingencies


**5.** The UK’s Armed Forces form an integral

part of the Government’s effort to counter the
threat from terrorism and other emergent
crises – at home as well as overseas. The
Army and Navy provides explosive ordnance
**disposal teams across the country to help**
safely dispose of conventional munitions and
improvised explosive devices. The Army also
contributes 2,600 personnel at two-day
readiness to support homeland resilience,
including specialist capabilities and armed
police backfill under Op TEMPERER, with
further support available from other Services,


-----

to provide support to the Police in the event
of a terrorist incident which goes beyond their
capacity or capability for response.

**6.** We will continue to support the civil

**authorities more generally and will hold**
forces at high levels of readiness to respond
to a wide range of national events and crises.
The COVID-19 pandemic saw the UK’s Armed
Forces provided an unprecedented level of
support to domestic departments. However,
the deterioration in the international security
environment means that it is of paramount
importance that Defence focuses on its core
role of ensuring the national security of the
UK. To enable this, it will be important to
ensure that the support Defence provides
domestically is limited to tasks that only
Defence can perform.


**7.** The RAF continues to work alongside

other Services, partners across Government
and NATO, to protect our skies, space and
seas from the increasingly frequent activities
undertaken by Russian aircraft, satellites,
ships and submarines. Only Defence can
**police UK airspace through providing 24/7**
Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) Typhoon aircraft,
supported by Voyager air-to-air refuelling
aircraft and the Air Surveillance and Control
System. P8 Poseidon maritime air patrols also
protect UK waters, both above and below the
surface, covering hundreds of square miles in
a single mission. In the five-year period to
April 2023, UK QRA has been scrambled on
seventeen occasions to intercept Russian
long-range aviation patrols and in response
to sixteen other UK air security incidents.
The RAF will continue to develop its counter

UAS programme to provide fixed-site defence
to deployed forces and defence-critical sites.

**8.** Our anti-submarine and sea-bed warfare

capability has been enhanced with the rapid
procurement of multi-role ocean surveillance
(MROS) vessels, the in-progress build of Type
26 global combat ships, and a suite of
uncrewed systems: these will further enhance
**protection of the undersea and seabed**
**infrastructure that is essential to the UK’s**
economic and energy security. The two
dedicated MROS vessels – the first of which
will join the fleet in summer 2023 – will operate
cutting-edge remote and autonomous offboard
systems for underwater surveillance and
seabed warfare, vital to our national security.

**9.** We will continue to collect and process

**vast amounts of data covering the maritime**
domain around our shores. We will use a
growing variety of highly capable collection
capabilities and situational awareness


systems, including surveillance software,
coastal radar, aviation operations, spacebased reconnaissance, and government
vessels to provide up-to-date, accurate
information to senior leaders. As the
development of autonomous and remote
technology continues, there is a need to
ensure that this technology is introduced to
the marine environment safely without
compromising our wider national security.

**10.** The challenge of protecting ourselves
against attack from the skies, both overseas
and at home, is at its most acute for over
thirty years – as evidenced in the war in
Ukraine. To counter these threats, we will step
up our efforts to deliver an Integrated Air
**and Missile Defence approach. Doing so will**
provide a major contribution to homeland
defence and national resilience. As the lead
service for Integrated Air and Missile Defence,
the RAF will promote the use of advanced


-----

ground-based, airborne, at sea and spacebased sensors, and an extensive range of air
and missile capabilities, including counterUAS, to detect, protect and defend the UK.

**11.** We will modernise our approach to air

and missile defence, both for our own forces
and through integration with Allies. In addition


to our maritime Sea Viper Evolution Ballistic
**Missile Defence (BMD) programme and our**
voluntary commitment to contribute a UK
BMD Radar to enhance the protection of
NATO, we will also explore ways to build
upon our offer to the Alliance, especially as
we continue to invest in next-generation
capabilities on Land, in the Air and at Sea.

**12.** We will continue to invest in the most
**cutting-edge technology, including the Sky**
Sabre air defence system, through
collaboration within AUKUS, and with R&D
channelled through the UK’s Missile Defence
Centre into the detection and interception
**technologies of the future. We will also work**
to boost our ability to eliminate threats before
they are launched through more targeted
approaches to counter-proliferation, and by
continuing to develop our own offensive
capabilities. We will also increase our
resilience across Defence by improving the
**mobility and dispersibility of our forces,**
continuing to update and replace our radar
**network, exploring development of a suite of**
sensors, and moving away from fixed sites to
having a more distributed – and therefore
resilient – network across the homeland.


**13.** There are also many areas where Defence
will act in support of the rest of Government
**in building our national and homeland**
**resilience. Given our experience of the**
pandemic, cyber-attacks, and Russia’s malign
manipulation of energy supplies, Defence will
support a wider Governmental effort to better
anticipate, assess, prevent, mitigate, respond
to, and recover from risks. We will work with
other Government Departments to implement
the 2022 Resilience Strategy, which sets out
the Government’s plan to strengthen the
underpinning systems and capabilities for
resilience. In doing so, we will support the
Government’s push towards protective
and preparatory action (‘security through
resilience’) – building our deterrence by denial.

###### Economic Security


**14.** The IRR reaffirmed that Economic
Security is a key lever in systemic competition
between states. During recent years, we, and
our key allies, have seen the emergence of an
increasingly sophisticated and evolving set of
economic security threats from hostile states
– with significant implications for Defence.
Since publication of DCP21, Defence has built
an enhanced capability to identify and
**mitigate a range of economic security**
**risks. A large part of this is focused on**
support to the Government’s National
Security and Investment Act 2021, ensuring
that investment in Defence-relevant
**sectors of the economy is screened in a**
timely way, with potential risks to our national
security identified and mitigated.

**15.** Recent work has identified that the range
of threats extends beyond attempts to
acquire sensitive Defence-related technology
and capability. Risks exist through the
targeted use by hostile states of research
**collaboration, employment of defence and**
**technical experts from the UK, and the use**
**of business partnerships and technical**
support contracts that include the transfer
of specialist defence knowledge. This
knowledge transfer can be used to boost
the military capabilities of our adversaries
and undermine our effectiveness. The civilmilitary fusion strategy employed by some
adversaries highlights that the risks to
Defence extend beyond the immediate
defence industrial base. We will reconfigure
our capability within Defence to allow us to
contribute to addressing the full range of
potential threats. Defence’s activities in this
area form part of the Government’s overall


response to economic-based threats and
complement other work in Defence to protect
against physical threats, espionage and
cyber-attacks that may be used in
conjunction with economic threats.

**16.** The MOD will also continue to support
wider Government efforts to shape the G7’s
economic security agenda and contribute to
policy development on access to critical
**materials. Confidence in the robustness of**
our supply chains and the protection of our
**capabilities is essential for future cooperation**
with allies and to ensure that UK companies
can maintain access to the defence and
security programmes of other states. Defence
is strengthening collaboration and
information-sharing with our closest allies to
this end, including through the multi-national
defence National Technology and Industrial
Base (NTIB) forum, which is working to
promote increased cooperation in supply
**chain security, access to critical materials,**
**and information sharing on trans-national**
**economic security threats.**

**17.** An integrated approach to deterrence

and defence requires us to develop new
levers to adapt to the changing threat
environment, and integrate existing levers,
including our economic capabilities. We will
work collaboratively with other departments
to implement an integrated approach to
**economic statecraft across Government.**
We will use our experience of scenariomodelling and wargaming to inform the
way economic statecraft activities are
orchestrated, as part of a wider, evidencedriven approach to deterrence. This will
include the development of a new analytical
framework and supporting tools to embed
economic statecraft principles into the
planning and execution of Defence activities.
