_The Czech Republic and its armed forces are two notions that are inseparably linked with each other._
_The country in the heart of Europe, and an institution that is essential for defence of its territory and_
_protection of its population. In past and in present…_

_The publication you are now browsing through describes the most important milestones in the development_
_of the Czech statehood; gradual changes from the dawn of its history up to the present times. It also_
_reminds numerous cultural and historical monuments created by generations of our forefathers: ancient_
_towns, Gothic and Renaissance castles, jewels of folk architecture, collections of museums and art galleries._
_Many of them are so unique and significant that they have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage_
_List as monuments of outstanding value to humanity, of importance that reaches far beyond the limits of_
_our territory._

_The latest chapter in the history of our nation starts in November 1989. The totalitarian regime in_
_Czechoslovakia gave way, and a perspective of essential changes opened for our country, a way to restoration_
_of a sovereign democratic nation. Key economic reforms and a reform of the state administration have_
_become a point of departure for our return to the family of European democratic nations. By gradual_
_integration into the European structures, the Czech Republic has confirmed its fidelity to democratic_
_traditions of the pre-war “First Republic” and the period between the wars. Its admission to the structures_
_representing the framework of European and world democracy and security – to NATO in March 1999 and_
_to the European Union in May 2004 – has been a convincing proof of that commitment._

_Our armed forces and their core – the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic – have gone through an_
_equally essential and profound change. The Czech Republic’s accession to the North Atlantic Alliance_
_has opened new opportunities in providing security of our country, as in case of threat we can now rely_
_on the assistance of the Alliance member countries. At the same time, NATO membership has enabled_
_us to embark on an essential reform of the armed forces, a reform based on a full professionalisation._
_As a result, the conscripts, an inseparable part of our armed forces for decades, have been replaced by_
_professional soldiers as of 1 January 2005._

_Implementation of the reform of the armed forces has been currently focused on the achievement of initial_
_operational capabilities of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic. It means to train, prepare and test the_
_units of a brigade task force to be ready for operational employment by 31 December 2006. After that date,_
_the reform process is going to continue; it will result in forces with capabilities in all respects comparable_
_to those of the armed forces of other NATO countries, and with a structure, armament, equipment, level of_
_preparedness and personnel numbers corresponding to realistic possibilities of the Czech Republic by 2012._

_The aim is to have mobile, modern and efficient armed forces, capable of effectively supporting the Czech_
_Republic’s security interests by having an adequate and balanced capability to comprehensively meet the_
_tasks ensuing both from the Czech Republic’s Constitution and other laws and from our NATO and EU_
_membership._

The present-day Czech Republic, as one of the two succession states of the Czech and Slovak Federative
Republic, emerged on 1 January 1993 (the other newly established country being the Slovak Republic).
Historically it resumes the tradition of the Czechoslovak Republic. It consists of the historical lands of
Bohemia, Moravia and the south-eastern part of Silesia. The peaceful division of the Czech and Slovak
Federative Republic and the fact that friendly relations have been preserved between populations
of both succession states went down in European history, particularly in the context of disintegration of
the former Yugoslavia and the follow-up events in the Balkans, as an important example of a civilised
resolution of a nationality dispute.
The Czech Republic is an independent, united state based on the principles of democracy and the rule
of law. Its capital is Prague (other major towns are Brno, Ostrava, Plzeň, Liberec, Hradec Králové, České
Budějovice, Pardubice etc.)

##### STHE CZECH REPUBLIC'S MEMBERSHIP IN IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS

###### The United Nations (UN)

The Czech Republic as a newly independent country has been continuing the previous long-time activities
of the Czechoslovak Republic in the UN. The Czechoslovak Republic was one of the 51 founding members
of the UN since 24 October 1945.
The Czech Republic was admitted as a full member of the UN at the renewed 47th session of the
General Assembly on 19 January 1993 and thus became the 179th full member of the organisation. The
unanimous admission of the Czech Republic was an expression of trust and support to the new country.
The first important achievements of the Czech Republic included its appointment as an elected member
of the Security Council (29 October 1993), its election into the International Law Committee (until 1997)
and the Committee on Information (from 1994).
The Czech Republic assumed membership in place of the Czechoslovak Federal Republic in the Committee
on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), the Committee on Decolonisation, the Special Committee
on the UN Charter, and in other UN committees and bodies. Within the activities of the Economic and
Social Council it was elected for the period from 1993 to 1995 to the Statistical Committee, Human
Rights Committee, Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) including its regional authority for Europe,
Commission on Sustainable Development and Commission for Transnational Corporations. It is also the
member of the Trade and Development Council under the authority of the UN Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD).
During the existence of the independent Czech Republic, Czech activities within the UN peacekeeping
operations in various parts of the world have increased. Czech soldiers have been participating in
observer missions and Czech military contingents take part in peacekeeping operations.
The Czech Republic is doing well in the UN, which is also proven by the fact that the UN Information
Centre in Prague has continued to operate. In its current position it can fulfil its tasks at a higher level
not only in the Czech Republic, but also throughout Central and Eastern Europe.
The election of the UN General Assembly Chairman on 8 July 2002 was another prominent success of
Czech diplomacy and evidence of the Czech Republic’s prestige in the UN. For the first time in the history
of the Czech Republic and former Czechoslovakia, a Czech candidate was elected chairman. Taking part
in the UN will always be an inseparable part of Czech foreign policy, since the UN remains – despite the
criticism its activities sometimes evoke – the backbone of the world’s multilateral diplomacy.

###### The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation

1999 was a historic year for the Czech Republic. The climactic moment of this year occurred on 12 March,
when the seven-year effort to integrate into the transatlantic security structures was crowned at the
Harry Truman Library in Independence, Missouri – the Czech Republic has become a full member of the
North Atlantic Alliance. The Czech Republic’s accession to NATO had been one of the main strategic aims
of its foreign policy. The event demonstrated the Czech Republic’s clear intention of being incorporated
into the Euro-Atlantic community of democratic countries and take part in its development.


11


-----

By joining NATO, the Czech Republic, for the first time in its history going as far back as the founding
of Czechoslovakia, has become part of a functioning system of collective defence. The new alliance has
changed the system of its relationships with the rest of the world and significantly widened the horizon
of Czech interests – ranging from crisis management within Europe to the global context. After more
than six years of its NATO membership, the Czech Republic is considered an active and responsible
member. NATO membership has resulted in further growth of the Czech Republic’s international prestige
and its foreign policy opportunities.
After its accession to NATO, the Czech Republic has strengthened its responsibility for enforcing
and defending the values shared by the countries of the Alliance. It has considerably increased the
participation of its military contingents in foreign peacekeeping missions. Among others, Czech soldiers
have participated in European missions – SFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina, AFOR in Albania and KFOR
in Kosovo – and also in NATO-led international peacekeeping operations (Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan). The
activities of military contingents of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic (ACR) abroad and Czech
soldiers in observer missions has been consistently highly appreciated by the highest representatives
of NATO.
The fact that the Czech Republic has been considered a full-fledged member of NATO was proven in 2002
when it was the first of the new NATO countries to host a NATO summit. It is very important for the Czech
Republic that the Prague Summit proceedings concerning future development and transformation of NATO
have confirmed the correctness of the main directions of the reform of the Czech Republic’s armed forces.
The aim of the reform of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic, as stated in the Concept of Development
of the Professional Armed Forces of the Czech Republic and Mobilisation of the Armed Forces of the
Czech Republic by 2010, is to ensure full integration into NATO military structures and to fully meet all
tasks resulting from its commitments towards the Alliance.

###### The European Union

On 1 May 2004, the Czech Republic became a member of the European Union. The Union, which stands
out for sustainable development of Europe based on a balanced economic growth and price stability,
highly competitive social market economy aiming for full employment and social progress, with a high
level of protection and improvement of the environment. In relations with the surrounding world,


12


-----

the EU advocates and promotes its values and interests. It contributes to peace, security, sustainable
development of the planet, to solidarity and mutual respect between nations, defence of human rights,
and adherence to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
Admission to the EU was preceded by ten years of strenuous negotiations and a number of adjustments
to reach compatibility with the EU in the economic, political and legal areas. During the accession talks,
the Czech Republic managed to assert a balanced compromise and to protect legitimate Czech interests
in important issues.
However, the Czech state does not intend to simply enjoy the benefits resulting from its EU membership
and assert its legitimate interests. It also intends to actively contribute to the formation of European
politics, to the strengthening of the EU as a whole, i.e. to thoroughly fulfil all the economic, military
and other commitments resulting from EU membership.
By joining NATO and the EU, the Czech Republic has institutionally resumed its position among
democratic and free nations that share the same essential values and the European cultural, historical
and religious heritage.
Europe has always been characterised by its cultural, religious and philosophical diversity. It was
this particular diversity that has ensured its strength. It was here that the recognition of human
dignity and respect for individual liberty and natural rights was born. Even today the strength of the
integrated Europe is based on respect for diversity of its members and gives them a strong unifying
momentum. Without suppressing their individuality, it creates conditions for their cultural, economic
and political development.
The Czech Republic is not worried about losing its identity by joining the EU. Our identity has strong
roots. Cooperation with democratic countries within the EU is more effective and advantageous and
does not threaten the existence of our specific traditions. The admission to the EU even influenced the
new Security Strategy of the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic’s strategic interests include, among
other things, keeping strong transatlantic links within NATO, building a strategic partnership between
NATO and the EU, and also a complementary development of NATO and EU defence capabilities.

###### • • • • •

Even though the Czech Republic is located in a secure environment, has good relations with neighbouring
countries and is a member of the UN, NATO and the EU, globally the security situation has changed for
the worse as a result of a number of factors – the onset of terrorism, threat of asymmetric warfare, the
efforts of dictator and other ideologically intolerant regimes to obtain weapons of mass destruction,
the threat of proliferation, etc. The problems of nationalistic and religious fundamentalism, religious
intolerance, instability of various regions, particularly the Middle East, have also remained topical.
Indeed, the world is not safe. On the contrary. In this light, the importance of the Czech Republic’s
stable position in the community of democratic countries is even more obvious.

### HISTORICAL MILESTONES
##### IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CZECH NATIONHOOD

The Czech state has a tradition of more than 1000 years and its territorial borders have changed many
times. However, the historical territories have always been in central Europe – in the Czech basin surrounded
with boundary mountains. The most important populations in the Czech basin in 4th century included
Celts, particularly the tribe of Boii who gave this territory its ancient name of Boiohaemum, which later
became Bohemia. Only as late as by the end of 5th century Slavonic tribes settled in central Europe, and
it was the tribe of Czechs that gave the country its new name.

###### BOHEMIA UNDER THE PŘEMYSL DYNASTY

The core around which the first Czech state formed on the territory of the Great Moravia was the
principality of the Přemysl dynasty in central and western Bohemia since early 9th century. In the second
half of that century, Bořivoj, a member of the Přemysl family, gained the supreme authority on these
territories. He moved from Levý Hradec at the lower course of the Vltava river to a fortified settlement
in the area of the today’s Prague. Prague thus became the centre of the emerging Czech state, and it has
remained to be the capital regardless of the changing forms of the Czech state entity.
At the end of the 9th century, the Czech tribes left the alliance of the Great Moravian Empire which was
subsequently disrupted by Hungarian raiders before 908. The process of the Czech tribes’ unification under
the rule of the Přemysl dynasty started, which crystallised in the emergence of the Czech state. In contacts
with its neighbours, particularly the German Empire, the Czech state under the Přemysl dynasty gradually
becomes an important factor in central European power relations.
Under Boleslav I in the first half of the 10th century, money started to be coined, which meant a significant
economic development of the country. Also in this period, the first convent was built, consecrated to
St George. The rule of his son Boleslav II in the second half of the century has been associated with the
foundation of the Prague Bishopric in 973 and the monastery in Břevnov later in 993. In this way, spiritual
centres were being created that were simultaneously the cradle of culture and education of the emerging
state.

**_Czech state in 10th and 11th centuries_**

In the late 10th century, tensions became acute between the Přemysl dynasty and the princely house of
Slavník, whose dominion (particularly in eastern Bohemia) was the last obstacle to a complete unification
of the Czech state. In 995, in order to strengthen the bonds of the political entity and to enhance its
position in international relations, Boleslav II undertook an armed raid against Libice, the residence of the
Slavník family, which resulted in a total annihilation of the Slavník power. The process of unification of
the tribes on the Czech territory under the Přemysl dynasty was thus completed.
At the turn of the 10th century the Přemysl state went through a serious crisis that culminated in
Boleslav II being expulsed from the country in 1002. For a short time, the Polish ruler Boleslav the Brave
took over Bohemia and Moravia in 1003. A period of internal strife, upheaval and a weakening power of the
Přemysl dynasty set in, which was used by the Germans and Polish for interventions into the development
of Bohemia and Moravia. The man of personality to bring a recovery of power of the Czech state was
Prince Břetislav I (1035-1055). He inherited Moravia together with Bohemia from his father Oldřich, and
by a campaign against Poland in 1039 and courageous resistance to the raids of the Roman King Henry III
to Bohemia he enhanced the importance of the Czech ruler in Central European region. Moreover,
Břetislav I issued the first laws regulating the status of Czech prince’s subjects.
Further consolidation of the Czech state’s position in Central Europe came under the rule of Vratislav II
(1061-1092), son of Břetislav I, who became the first Czech king. He was crowned in 1085; the title, though,
was bestowed upon him only and did not apply to his successors. He obtained the kingship for having
helped Emperor Henry IV in his struggle against the pope. Under his rule, the Vyšehrad Chapter was
established. Its provosts were serving as chancellors by the sovereign’s side. Moreover, the second bishopric
in the Czech lands was founded in Olomouc.
After Vratislav’s death, the Czech lands were again weakened by strife among individual members of
the Přemysl family. The first man to distinguish himself in succesion of rather mediocre rulers was
only Soběslav I (1125-1140). He was able to withstand the German brunt in the Battle of Chlumec in
1126, and he intervened in disputes on the succession to the Hungarian and even the imperial throne.
Through both military power and clever diplomacy he ensured the stability of the Czech state and
was also able to gain a due respect in neighbouring countries. His nephew and successor Vladislav II
(1140-1172) was himself a warrior of note. He took part e.g. in the second crusade (1147-1149), and for his help
to Emperor Frederic I Barbarossa in his campaign to Italy he was given a hereditary royal title in 1158.
After 1168, though, relations between the Czech king and the emperor have extremely deteriorated, and
in 1173 Vladislav II renounced the throne. New strife broke out among members of the much-ramified
Přemysl family, many a time influenced by interventions of the powerful Emperor Frederic. Not only did
he deny Vladislav’s successors the right to the royal title, but he also made every effort to break the
Czech state. He decided on the establishment of the Margraviate of Moravia, independent of Bohemia and
subordinated directly to the Empire (1182), and he promoted the bishop of Prague to an imperial prince
(1187). After many peripeteias, it was only under the rule of Přemysl Otakar I (1197-1230) that the final
re-unification of the Czech state was achieved.
Přemysl Otakar I became famous for his excellent diplomatic skills. He cleverly used the disputes over the
imperial throne, in which he actively intervened, to resolve the constitutional situation in Bohemia. In 1198

_approximate extent_

_in Hungary 1305-1306_

document confirmed the hereditary royal

EGERLAND title of the Czech sovereign for the king’s

LUSATIA POLAND oldest son, and the right of the kings to

appoint the bishops. Moreover, the territory

SILESIA of the Czech state was taken for indivisible,

and Roman rulers were to bestow Bohemia

BOHEMIA
MORAVIA in fief only to a king accepted in that land.

The king was given the title of an Elector,

AUSTRIA authorising him to elect the king of the so
called Roman (German) Empire. Based on the

STYRIA HUNGARY Golden Bull, the Czech king was an important
CARINTHIA political agent in Europe of that time.

After Přemysl’s death in 1230, the

CARNIOLA governance over the Czech state was taken

over by his son Wenceslas I (Václav I). In
1241 he became deputy of the Emperor
Frederic II in the empire. He was succeeded by his son, Prince Přemysl Otakar II (1253-1278). Through his
marriage with Margaret of Babenberg, much older than him, in 1252 he gained Lower and Upper Austria
and Styria, and in 1269 he inherited Carinthia and Carniola (the today’s Slovenia) and other territories
from his cousin Ulrich of Sponnheim; he also added the region of Cheb (Egerland) to his kingdom.
Under Přemysl Otakar II, the Czech state extended as far as the Adriatic Sea; the legend on the Czech
king’s royal seal enumerated 9 countries governed by him. When in spring of 1272 the imperial throne
became vacant, Přemysl Otakar II felt strong enough to pretend to it. However, German feudal lords
did not favour a strong ruler and in 1273, without Přemysl’s knowing, they elected an originally
unimportant Swiss count Rudolf of Habsburg for their king.
A coalition of the newly elected Roman king, the Hungarian sovereign and a number of imperial princes
emerged against Přemysl Otakar II. Moreover, the Czech king’s position was undermined by his own
rebellious noblemen. In 1276 Přemysl Otakar II had to give up an overwhelming majority of earlier
territorial gains in favour of Rudolf Habsburg, and on 26 August 1278 he was defeated and killed in an
attempt to retaliate in the Battle of Marchfeld.
For five years after Přemysl’s death, the Czech lands were administered by Prince Otto Brandenburg in his
capacity as the guardian of the infant Wenceslas II, son of Přemysl Otakar II. A substantial part of Moravia
came under the temporary administration of Rudolf Habsburg. After the accession of the young Wenceslas
to the throne in 1283, the country was effectively ruled by the powerful Czech feudal lord Záviš of
Falkenstein, husband of the Dowager Queen, before he was captured by royalists and, in 1290, executed.
King Wenceslas II then ruled until 1305. In spite of his relative youth he managed to renew the power
of the Bohemian kingdom; he cleverly used the vacancy at the Polish throne, and by his marriage with
Eliška Rejčka (Richenza) in 1300 he acquired the Polish crown and, temporarily, even the Hungarian
throne for his son. Under his rule, silver mining began to flourish, and Prague groschen started to be
coined. Wenceslas II established a mining law, fairly advanced for his time, and only the opposition
of the pope prevented the establishment of a university in Prague. After his sudden death, his son
Wenceslas III (1305-1306), seventeen years old, acceded to the throne.
King Wenceslas III tried to follow his father’s steps. As the first important action he was preparing
a campaign against Poland. Before he crossed the Czech border, though, he was murdered in Olomouc
on 4 August 1306. By his death, the Přemysl dynasty, which had been at the head of the Czech state
from the very beginning, ended on the spear-side. The ambitious Přemysl family has ensured the Czech
state a firm position within the political system of the Central European region.

###### THE CLIMAX AND CRISIS OF THE CZECH STATEHOOD

After a great deal of political intrigue from the part of the Roman King Albrecht, Rudolf Habsburg (the
former Duke of Austria) was installed on the Czech throne. His reign, though, was a short one (1306-1307).

A weak rule of Henry of Carinthia followed (1307- **_Czech state in 14th century_**
1310), a sovereign without authority who was unable
to prevent the internal decay of the country.
In 1310, John (Jan) of Luxembourg, son of the
Roman emperor, husband of Eliška, sister of the
last ruler of Přemysl dynasty, entered the country in
decline. For this warrior king-knight, the Bohemian
kingdom became first and foremost an economic BRANDENBURG
base. Moreover, King John was using it for his war
POLAND

fighting and diplomatic activities. He managed LUSATIA
to add the region of Cheb (1322) to his kingdom,
and a major part of Silesia. Since 1333, King John’s

SAXONY

successor, his son Charles (Karel) also began to SILESIA
participate in the administration of the Bohemian
Kingdom; in the following year, Charles obtained the
title of Margrave of Moravia. In 1346, he became BOHEMIA
Roman and Bohemian king, and since 1355 he ruled MORAVIA
as Charles IV, the Roman Emperor.
In his politics, Charles IV of Luxembourg consciously HUNGARY

BAVARIA

acknowledged the Přemysl roots. The newly flourishing AUSTRIA
Bohemian Kingdom became the centre of the Holy Roman Empire. That is why he gained the archbishopric
for Prague (1344), and founded a university in his royal city (7 April 1348), the oldest institution of higher
learning east of the Rhine and north of the Alps. Charles University has been an important centre of
education in Central Europe up to the present day.
St Wenceslas Crown, whose fabrication was commanded by Charles IV, has become a symbol of the Czech state.
A notion of the Lands of the Czech Crown emerged, encompassing the Kingdom of Bohemia, Margraviate of
Moravia, the Duchies and Principalities of Silesia and the territory of Upper and Lower Lusatia (the regions
of Bautzen, Görlitz and Cottbus). Moreover, Brandenburg came into Charles’s possession in 1373.
By the Golden Bull of 1356, a document which made the Czech ruler foremost among the electors of
the emperor, Charles IV strengthened the Czech kings’ position towards the empire. In 1361, Charles’s
spouse Anna of Schweidnitz gave him son Wenceslas, whom he had crowned Czech king as a two-year
old boy in 1363. Later, in 1376, he enforced his election for Roman king.
Between 12th and 14th centuries – i.e. both under the Přemysl dynasty (particularly Vladislav II,
Přemysl Otakar I and his grandson Přemysl Otakar II) and later under the Luxembourgs (particularly the
Czech King and Roman Emperor Charles IV) – the Bohemian and Moravian lands enjoy a considerable
political, economic and cultural bloom. The Czech state became internally consolidated, economically
strong, and it took a prominent position among central European countries. Simultaneously, it also
occupied the largest area ever in its history.
An acute religious and political strife at the turn of the 14th century has thrown the Czech lands into
a deep social crisis. An attempt to find the way out came in the form of a religiously, nationally and
socially motivated movement – the Hussitism – that went through 3 stages of development:
In the first period (1402-1419) it focused on criticism of the church, as formulated by the reformist
scholars of the Prague University headed by Jan Hus. The popular character of the Hussite movement
evolved after the riots over the sale of indulgences (1412), and particularly after the Ecclesiastic Council
of Constance, which found certain articles of Jan Hus’s teaching heretical. By a verdict of the Council,
Hus was condemned to death and burned at the stake in Constance on 6 July 1415. Hus’s death
strengthened the reformist movement in the Czech lands.
In the second period (1419-1436), the developments spilled over into the Hussite revolution. Its end was
marked by the defeat of the radical streams of the Hussite movement – the Taborites and Orphans – in
the Battle of Lipany on 30 May 1434. Now it was the moderates, particularly the Praguers, who took
the initiative in the country. In 1436, they managed to enforce the key results of the Hussite revolution
by having negotiated the so-called Compact (an agreement between the Hussites and representatives
of the Council of Basle that proclaimed peace between the Hussite Czechs and Moravians and other
Christian nations). The territorial integrity of the original Lands of the Czech Crown was formally
preserved during the Hussite Wars. In spite of the immense heroism of the Hussite troops that were
facing superior enemy forces (particularly the crusaders led by Sigismund of Luxembourg), devastating
wars had an immense impact on the country’s economy.

-----

The final period (1436-1485) was characterised by the struggle over the Compact; while the Catholics
were striving for its abolition, the Hussites wanted to enhance both its contents and application.
It was only under George of Poděbrady, the “Hussite king” elected by the Czech nobility (for the first
and the last time) from its ranks in February 1458, that the situation in the country became stabilised.
In order to be recognised by Rome, the new king had to swear a secret oath of allegiance to the pope.
King George was a master of diplomatic compromises, though, and this was but one of them. The
Holy See was ill-disposed towards George of Poděbrady; moreover, he had to struggle bitterly with the
Hungarians and his own domestic nobility. He strove to prevent possible isolation by proposing an antiTurkish coalition. In 1464, assisted by his counsellors, he developed a project of an alliance of Christian
kings, which was in certain regards ahead of its time and some of its features bore a resemblance to
the today’s United Nations.

###### BOHEMIA OF THE ESTATES AND CONSOLIDATION OF THE HABSBURG POWER

King George died on 22 March 1471. He left the Czech lands in the same state of internal disequilibrium as
they were at the time when he assumed their administration. The danger of division of the Lands of the
Czech Crown was averted by the accession of Vladislav Jagello (1471), who moreover became Hungarian
king in 1490. Under the Jagello dynasty, who had chosen Buda for their seat, the shaping of a Bohemia
of Estates was being completed. It was characterised by an increasing power of the Land Diets, with
a significant role of higher and lower nobility, towns and clergy. After Vladislav’s death in 1516, both
Czech and Hungarian crown went to his son Louis Jagello, ten years old at the time. The nobility didn’t
accept that the country be administrated by royal vice-regents during the time of his minority, and they
elected a Council of Regents, which further escalated the already fairly rooted superiority of the Estates
over the royal authority.
In 1526, the Habsburgs gained the Czech Crown and the Lands of the Czech Crown became part of the
Habsburg empire. Already in early 1547 the first resistance of the estates against the emerging Habsburg
centralisation and absolutism started. However, it was defeated and resulted in weakening of the power of
the non-Catholic nobility and towns. Following another unsuccessful revolt of the Czech Estates between
1618 and 1620 (an impulse to it provided the so-called Prague Defenestration on 23 May 1618, and it ended
by a defeat of the insurgent Estates

**_Emergence of the Habsburg monarchy – 1526_** in the Battle of the White Mountain

in 1620) and the following Thirty

started. The weakening of the Czech

Another dramatic restriction of
the Czech kingdom’s powers came
particularly in the period of the
enlightened, but at the same time
centralist and Germanizing rulers Maria Theresa (1740-1780), under whose rule the St Wenceslas Crown
lost a major part of Silesia and the whole region of Klodzko, and her son Joseph II (1780-1790).
Maria Theresa’s reforms even abolished the Bohemian Chancellery at Court in Prague in 1749; on the other
hand, they have regulated statutory labour, introduced obligatory school attendance etc. Other, even
more radical reforms were carried out by her successor Joseph II, who abolished serfdom, issued the Edict
of Toleration in 1781, emancipated Jewish inhabitants, restricted the power of the church in favour of
that of the state and abolished the majority of monasteries. The centralisation of the monarchical power
combined with Germanisation generated a counter-movement of the aristocracy advocating the privileges
of estates and lands. Joseph 's successor Leopold II (1790-1792) gave in to the nobility and had himself
crowned Czech king (simultaneously he was Roman emperor and Hungarian king).

###### THE PROCESS OF NATIONAL REVIVAL

The period of the turn of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century is known as the Czech
National Revival. In its early stages, this process brought an awakening of the Czech nationalism which
manifested itself particularly in the field of language and science. With the revolution in 1848-1949,
Czechs entered the political scene as well. Besides the radical democrats, another dominating stream were
particularly the liberals.
The completion of the industrial revolution in the Austro-Hungarian confederation of states deepened
the existing status and social differences. Emancipation efforts and civil society brought a new political
differentiation – there were the so-called Old Czechs and Young Czechs. The Old Czechs were claiming
autonomy within the Habsburg monarchy for the Czech lands, whereas the Young Czechs had more
radical requirements consisting in democratisation of the election system, support for Czech education,
participation in the land and monarchy-wide forums.
The Jubilee Trade Fair in Prague (1891) confirmed the maturity of the Czech nation. The process of
differentiation of its political scene continued. Czech politicians participated in promoting the universal
and equal suffrage in the monarchy. The Czech nation’s emancipation influenced the regime of the Austrian
Empire. In that period, both the Czech Lands and the Austria-Hungary as a whole went through a complex
process of transformation of the old structures of aristocracy and estates into a modern civil society.
It was under the rule of members of the Habsburg-Lotharingian dynasty – Francis I (1792-1835),
Ferdinand V (1835-1848), and Francis Joseph I (1848-1916).
At the outbreak of the World War One in summer 1914, the Czech nation was fully developed in cultural,
political and economical respect, with all attributes of a nation on a high European level, except for an
independent state.

###### CZECHOSLOVAK UNITS IN WORLD WAR ONE: FIGHTING FOR INDEPENDENCE ABROAD

For the Czech and Slovak nations, the World War One meant a qualitatively new situation. A real hope
emerged to escape from the bondage of three centuries of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy and finally
to realise the most daring aspirations for establishment of an independent country.
The national campaign for independence had two major streams. The first was the foreign one, where the
cause of national liberation was taken up by T. G. Masaryk, M. R. Štefánik and E. Beneš, politicians living
in exile. They did not consider an autonomy of individual countries within the framework of a reformed
or federalised Habsburg monarchy. Instead, they insisted on a full disintegration of Austria-Hungary and
on creation of a single Czech and Slovak state, to be established as a result of a military defeat of the
Central Powers by the Allies assisted by foreign units of the future Czechoslovakia as well.
The second stream was domestic resistance. This was headed by leaders of political parties – Švehla,
Klofáč, Šmeral, Kramář, Rašín and others – and some other interest organisations (e.g. Sokol). Under the
influence of Masaryk ’s group, the originally heterogeneous domestic resistance became united, and on
13 July 1918, the Czechoslovak National Committee was established in Prague as the supreme political
authority that assumed the leadership of the revolution. The National Committee was in touch with the
exile resistance and was making arrangements for the establishment of an independent state.
As a result of T. G. Masaryk ’s and other representatives’ of the Czechoslovak National Council intensive
diplomatic activities, Czechoslovakia was recognised as a state already before it was effectively
established. A significant contribution to this development was also made by Czechoslovak foreign
troops represented by legions formed on territories of other states.
The first military formations fighting by the side of the Allies were formed by Czech compatriots living
in France and in the imperial Russia. Within the French army, a unit – the so-called “Nazdar” Company
– in the strength of almost 300 men was established already by the end of 1914.
On 11 October 1914 (on 28 September according to the old Russian calendar, i.e. on the day consecrated
to St Wenceslas, the Czech national patron saint), our first foreign unit on the territory of the imperial
Russia, the Czech Retinue, took the oath of allegiance. It was formed by Czech compatriots living in
Russia and in Ukraine and it had over 1100 men. After the February Revolution in Russia in 1917, a more
extensive recruitment of volunteers for the Czechoslovak Army was allowed; thousands of prisoners of
war and fellow countrymen dispersed all over the vast area from Petersburg to Central Asia and Siberia
started coming to recruitment centres. As a result, Czechoslovak units in Russia had almost 38,500
men by the end of 1917. On 9 October 1917, the Czechoslovak corps in Russia was established from
existing divisions. In the course of 1918, the strength of the Corps grew to almost 61,000. Czechoslovak

legionnaires fought many stern battles during the time
they spent on the front. The most important of them
include the victorious battle of Zborov (on 2 July 1917), and
the rear-guard action at Bakhmatch in Ukraine (in March
1918). After the October Revolution in 1917, Czechoslovak
legionnaires were doing their best to keep neutrality and
refrain from intervening in Russia’s internal strife. Part of
them were successfully transferred to the western front
in France; the rest had to go the way full of hardship and
combat through the Volga region over the Urals and Siberia
to Vladivostok. By the end of September 1920, they could
finally return aboard ships to the already independent
Czechoslovakia. Over 4000 legionnaires died in fighting for
the independent Czechoslovak republic.
In the first three years of the war, about 600 Czechs served
in various components of the French Army. By the end of
1917, the numbers of volunteers had grown to the strength
of a Czechoslovak brigade in France. It was particularly due
to the transfer of the legionnaires from Russia and the
arrival of American compatriots (2500 persons), a company
of prisoners of war from Romania, Czech officers from the
Serbian Army, and Austro-Hungarian prisoners from the
Serbian front. Czech legionnaires fought successfully at
Arras, Champagne and at Argonne near Terron, where they
were operating by the end of the war. During spring 1919,
about 9600 volunteers from the brigade came back home.
About 650 Czechoslovak soldiers were killed on the French
front.
Moreover, about a thousand of Czechs and Slovaks (half
of them officers) were operating in the Serbian Corps
of volunteers, which was engaged in fights in Dobrudja
(August 1916) and on the Thessaloniki front (1917); from
there they were transferred to France and Italy following
an intervention of the Czech National Council in Paris.
On the Italian territory the government had no understanding for the liberation efforts of the Austrian Slavs,
including naturally the Czechs and Slovaks, for a long
time. Only as late as in January 1917 the first Czechoslovak
scout units could be formed. In spring 1918, a Czechoslovak
division was established, followed by a Czechoslovak Army
Corps set up in December, which also started enlisting
Czechs and Slovaks in prisoner camps. Its strength achieved
some 20,000 soldiers. Czechoslovak legionnaires were highly
successful as scouts with the Italian Army; they took part
in heavy fights on the Piave River and at Doss Alto. After
the armistice was signed, the so-called landwehr battalions
were formed that have reached a strength of about
60,000 Czechoslovak volunteers. About 350 Czechoslovak
legionnaires died on the Italian front.
The decision to join the legions was an act of an immense
courage on the part of the Czech and Slovak patriots. All
of them were risking their lives; in case they were taken
prisoners they would be dealt with as traitors, and should
the Entente be defeated, they risked permanent exile. In spite
of that, tens of thousands of men joined the legions and
over 5000 of them had given their lives for an independent
Czechoslovak Republic to be established.

###### EMERGENCE OF THE INDEPENDENT CZECHOSLOVAK STATE AND ITS FURTHER DEVELOPMENT

A favourable situation towards the end of the World War One in autumn 1918, combined with the
defeat and disintegration of the Habsburg monarchy, but also with the will of the Czech nation to
create its own independent state, manifested in open political and military resistance, resulted in the
emergence of an independent state of Czechs and Slovaks – the Czechoslovak Republic – on 28 October
1918. Its existence was definitively recognised by post-war peace agreements.

_The first official symbols of the Czech state proclaimed in September 1918_

By proclamation of the Czechoslovak Republic (unifying the historical Czech lands with parts of the
Hungarian kingdom – Slovakia and Subcarpathian Ruthenia), the former subordination to the monarchy
was replaced by a republic. Compared to the former monarchy, the newly created independent republic
was a state with much wider civil, social and national rights. What remained complex, though, was
the national arrangement. In compliance with the idea of “Czechoslovakism” of that time, the Czechs
and Slovaks formed one nation numbering 8.8 million inhabitants (i.e. 66.9 per cent of population).
Moreover, there were 3.2 million Germans, 800 thousand Hungarians, 450 thousand Ukrainians and
over 100 thousand Poles. The rich variety along with different levels of economic development of the
areas inhabited prevailingly by national minorities resulted in the emergence of nationalist tendencies
and movements.
The republic had a relatively advanced industry and agriculture with a high degree of monopolisation
in all sectors of economy. The first decade of its existence was characterised by an almost continuous
economic growth and top achievements in many branches of industry. In 1920s and 1930s, the republic
was afflicted by the Great Depression which spread across the world. Since the country was focused

particularly on exports, the impact of the crisis was deeper and lasted longer than in other European
countries. In foreign politics, the Czechoslovak Republic was oriented on France and the Great Britain.
Further democratic development of the independent Czechoslovakia was forcefully interrupted by the
Munich agreement and subsequent occupation by the Fascist Germany. In 1938, separatist movement of
the German minority living in Czech border regions, supported by the Nazi Germany, led to the Munich
agreement and concession of the so-called Sudetenland to Germany. In March 1939 Hitler occupied
even the rest of territory, creating the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (1939-1945). Almost
simultaneously, a separate state was created on the territory of Slovakia that was totally dependent on
Germany. The territory of Subcarpathian Ruthenia, autonomous at that time, was fully occupied by the
pro-fascist Horthy’s Hungary.
The occupants managed to gain only a small part of the Czech nation for active collaboration; before long,
a number of resistance organisations started operating. Majority of Czechs and part of democratically
minded Slovaks never put up with the German occupation and they started leaving abroad to fight for
freedom and restoration of Czechoslovakia.

###### CZECHOSLOVAK MILITARY UNITS IN WORLD WAR TWO

In the initial stages of occupation by German troops and following the outbreak of the World War Two
(on 1 September 1939), the most important Czechoslovak resistance centres were established in France,
Great Britain, the United States of America, Poland, and in Yugoslavia. The struggle for the liberation of
Czechoslovakia was headed by Dr. E. Beneš, the last President of the pre-Munich Republic (1935-1938). In
1940, an exile government was established in London.
The first “Czechoslovak Foreign Military Group” was established in Poland. Shortly after that, the French
government allocated 4000 posts in its Foreign Legion and in its overseas forces for Czechoslovak soldiers.
Moreover, part of airmen was also included into the French colonial air force. Only the outbreak of the
Second World War made it possible to organise Czechoslovak armed forces directly on the French territory.
On 15 January 1940, the First Czechoslovak Division was constituted in the strength of 3500 men, and
by the end of May its numbers grew to 11,405. In the same period, about 50 Czechoslovak pilots were
re-trained for French aircraft types. These men scored altogether 166 victories in the French skies during
May and June, in spite of a considerable overall superiority of the German Luftwaffe. Czechoslovak ground
troops were employed in the fights on the Grand Morin river and in rear-guard action on the Seine and
Loire. After French capitulation, Czechoslovak soldiers made an organised retreat to the port of Sete, and
on 26 June1940 they were evacuated from there by allied vessels via Gibraltar to Great Britain.
The Czech and Slovak patriots who escaped from their occupied country by the southern route gathered
in Syria and Lebanon, later in Palestine, where the 11th “Eastern” Czechoslovak Infantry Battalion was
formed in December 1940. From May 1941, the Battalion fought in Syria, and by the end of the year it was
deployed to reinforce the defences of Tobruk against German and Italian troops. In May 1942, the Battalion
was transformed to the Czechoslovak 200th “Eastern” Light Anti-aircraft Regiment, which was deployed in
defence of Alexandria, Haifa and later once again Tobruk. After the allied victory over Marshall Rommel’s
troops in Africa, the regiment was transferred to England, and on 11 August 1943 it was incorporated
into the Independent Armoured Brigade.
In Great Britain, the 1st Czechoslovak Combined Brigade was formed on 12 August 1940; it was re-aligned
as of 1 July 1941 to become the 1st Czechoslovak Independent Brigade, and as of 1 September 1949, after
the arrival of the Czechoslovak units from the Middle East and Africa, it was extended to the Czechoslovak
Independent Armoured Brigade. In early September 1944 the brigade was transferred to France; it took
up combat position at Dunkirk and till the end of the war in Europe participated in the siege of a much
stronger German force protected by three defence lines and a flooded area.
Czechoslovak airmen in England were incorporated directly into the Royal Air Force’s Volunteer Reserve.
Within its framework, the 310th Czechoslovak Fighter Squadron and 311th Bomber Squadron were formed

on 12 July 1940; in early October, the 312th Fighter Squadron began its combat
activities, and in May 1941 the 313th Czechoslovak Fighter Squadron was
established. A year later, the Czechoslovak Fighter Wing was created when all
fighter squadrons were combined into one force. Some 1000 Czechoslovak airmen
took part in the Battle of Britain. They also participated in the raid on Dieppe in
August 1942, they provided air support for the invasion troops in July 1944, and
for some of them their active duty ended as late as on 4 June 1945.
Between August 1940 and May 1945, Czechoslovak airmen carried out more
than 40,000 combat sorties; they destroyed over 300 German aircraft, sank
several ships and submarines and dropped over a million kilograms of bombs
on targets of war importance. Six years of war took a heavy toll on the
Czechoslovak air force. More than 500 of its members were killed.
Czechoslovak military resistance on the territory of the Soviet Union first found
its expression in the establishment of the 1st Czechoslovak Independent Field
Battalion in 1942. The unit fought its first engagement at Sokolovo in March
1943, then it was re-organised and completed to form the 1st Czechoslovak
Independent Brigade that has distinguished itself during the liberation of Kiev
and in fights of Byelaya Tserekev and Zhashkov. In the course of 1944, with the
numbers of volunteers from the liberated territories growing, a build-up of the 1st
Czechoslovak Army Corps started. It included the 1st Czechoslovak Independent
Air Force Regiment and the 2nd Czechoslovak Independent Airborne Brigade
as well, both of them later deployed to help the Slovak National Uprising that _A Czechoslovak Captain_

_with the insignia of an R.A.F._

started in late August 1944. Czech and Slovak soldiers serving in these two units _Flight Lieutenant, 1944_
were the first regular soldiers to start open fight on their home territory. The
Czechoslovak Army Corps was engaged in heavy fights during the Dukla Pass Operation in the Carpathian
Mountains, and from January 1945 its main forces pursued German units retreating from the eastern
Slovakia. In early May, soldiers of the 1st Czechoslovak Army Corps advanced as far as to Moravia.
With the front coming nearer, the May Uprising of the Czech people broke out as a result of the organised
domestic resistance and hatred of the population towards German occupiers. The core of the uprising was
in Prague, where the fighters on barricades faced heavily armed and well-trained Nazi soldiers.
Members of both the Czechoslovak foreign military resistance and the domestic resistance had gone through
prolonged and heavy struggles before the final victory over Hitler’s fascism could be achieved. Thousands
of them gave their lives for the liberation of their native country, tens of thousands were injured. Some
233,000 inhabitants of Czechoslovakia died in jails and concentration camps of the Nazi Germany.

###### CZECHOSLOVAKIA BETWEEN 1945 AND 1989

Complete liberation of the Czechoslovak Republic from German fascism in May of 1945 was not only a matter
of the Allies’ military operations but also a subject of political interest of great powers. In particular the
then Soviet Union was pursuing territorial and political ends, the underlying goal of its liberation efforts
being the enlargement of its sphere of influence on further development in Czechoslovakia.
After the war, Czechoslovakia was re-established, but already without the Subcarpathian Ruthenia
(based on a Czechoslovak-Soviet agreement of 29 June 1945, the region, under the name of Subcarpathian
Ukraine, was included in the Ukrainian SSR.) Moreover, based on the so-called Beneš decrees, about
3 million ethnic Germans were transferred from the country. In the first year after the war, as a result
of Czechoslovak diplomacy’s efforts, Czechoslovakia has become one of the founding members of the
United Nations Organisation (UN was founded on 24 September 1945).
However, the Communist coup in February 1948 put an end to further after-war democratic development
of Czechoslovakia. All attributes of a parliamentary and democratic country were removed and CPC
dictatorship in political, economic and cultural life of the Czechoslovak society was implemented. The
republic became a component of the Soviet power block, and the Communist party introduced a regime
that was mechanically copying the experience of building of socialism in the Soviet Union in totally
different conditions of the Czechoslovak state. In fabricated political processes between 1949 and 1957,
many opposition members and church dignitaries were sentenced to long terms in prison or executed.
Gradually, the industry and trade were nationalised and a forced collectivisation of agriculture started.
Basic rights, freedoms and religious beliefs of citizens were suppressed, culture and art were dominated by
Communist ideology. In 1949, the republic became a member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance,
a political and economic organisation; and in 1955 it joined the military-political Warsaw Pact.
Between 1960-1990, the country’s official name was the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The 1960s
brought certain reforms and a partial relaxation, particularly in the area of culture and social life. The
democratisation efforts culminated in the so-called Prague Spring in 1968; however, a direct military
intervention of Warsaw Pact armies in August 1968 and the subsequent Soviet occupation put an end
to it. On 27 October 1968, the National Assembly passed the Act on Federation: Czechoslovakia became
a federation consisting of two equal republics, the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist
Republic. However, the Act became valid as of 1 January 1969, in a totally different political situation.
An era known as “normalisation” began. This entailed a consolidation of one-party (Communist)
governance, and growth of chronic problems in the society. In mid-1980s, under the influence of the
reform movement in the Soviet Union, certain efforts were being made even in the CSSR to reform while
maintain the power monopoly of the Communist party. The internal political tensions of many years
have resulted in an open rally of the broadest masses of population against the regime in November
1989. The Communist representation, deprived of its foreign support, gave in to the pressure of protests
and demonstrations and handed over to the opposition. A prospect of essential changes based on the
principles of freedom, democracy and humanism opened for the society.

###### TRANSITION TO A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY AND EMERGENCE OF TWO SOVEREIGN STATES

The revolutionary events of November 1989 resulted in a collapse of the totalitarian regime in
Czechoslovakia. As early as in December 1989, the leading role of the CPC and the monopoly of the
official Marxist-Leninist ideology were abolished, and a prominent member of the dissent, Václav Havel,
was elected for president. In the following year, parliamentary democracy was gradually re-established,
free elections took place, and the name of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic was changed to the Czech
and Slovak Federative Republic (CSFR).

_State coat of arms of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic_

The first free election of 1990, which became in fact an anti-Communist referendum, has brought to
power two broadly based civic movements – the Civic Forum in the Czech Republic and the Public against
Violence in Slovakia (46 per cent of votes compared with something less than 14 per cent for the CPC).
Besides starting the economic reforms (with the aim of fully re-establishing the market economy), the most
significant enterprises of this “non-political” representation included the adoption of the Constitutional Act
No. 23/1991, which has made the Bill of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms a part of the Czechoslovak
law, and the establishment of the Czechoslovak Constitutional Court. Moreover, the reform of the state
administration began.
As for the foreign-political orientation of the state, there was a fundamental change that was aimed
at resuming the pre-war republic’s standing and democratic traditions in order to “return to Europe”.
However, before it was possible to start the integration in European political, economic and security
structures, it was necessary to get rid of the dependence on the Soviet Union. In this area, the new
Czechoslovak diplomacy was doing fairly well. Already in late February 1990, an Agreement on the
departure of the Soviet troops from the territory of the CSFR was signed in Moscow on the highest
political level. Based on it, a gradual withdrawal of the Soviet troops started; it was definitively
completed in June 1991. Shortly after that, the Warsaw Pact was abolished on 1 July 1991.
Simultaneously, CSFR foreign policy launched considerable efforts to become involved in activities of
bodies forming the framework of European democracy and security – the Council of Europe, CSCE/OSCE,
EC/EU, WEU and NATO.
Since 1991, Czechoslovak foreign and domestic policy was increasingly hampered by disputes over Czech
and Slovak and federal competencies within the common state. After parliamentary elections in 1992,
proposals to create a con-federation submitted by Slovak representation resulted in Czechoslovakia’s
division into two independent states. As a result, as of 1 January 1993, the Czech Republic and the
Slovak Republic went their own way as two sovereign states.

### HISTORICAL MONUMENTS
##### WITNESSES OF RICH HISTORY

The Czech Republic is rich in cultural and historical monuments that are the evidence of its diverse
and eventful history – ancient towns, majestic Gothic castles and churches, Renaissance chateaus,
monasteries, folk architecture and interesting technical and industrial constructions. The total number
of registered immovable monuments exceeds 40,000 (196 of which are National Cultural Monuments),
and there are over 800,000 registered movable artistic objects.
The most beautiful and unique historical monuments are listed in the UNESCO List of World Cultural
Heritage. Currently it includes 12 Czech historical monuments – the historical cores of Prague, Telč and
Kutná Hora, the medieval town of Český Krumlov, the Pilgrimage Church of St John Nepomuk at Zelená
Hora (near Žďár nad Sázavou), the Jewish ghetto and St Prokopius basilica in Třebíč, the Lednice–Valtice
chateau and natural park in Southern Moravia, the Archbishop Chateau in Kroměříž with its gardens,
the village of Holašovice in Southern Bohemia, the Renaissance chateau in Litomyšl, the Holy Trinity
Column in Olomouc and the Tugendhat Villa designed by Mies van der Rohe in Brno.
Other remarkable sights include the Gothic castle of Karlštejn, the Romantic castle of Hluboká and
many more historically interesting towns, castles and chateaus. The most visited towns are undoubtedly
Prague and Český Krumlov.

### 30 JUNE – THE CZECH REPUBLIC'S ARMED FORCES DAY

Since 2002, the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic celebrate the Day of the Armed Forces commemorating
an event following the recognition of Czechoslovak claims for independence by the Allied powers in
1918. On 30 June 1918, a military parade of the Czechoslovak foreign resistance units took place at
Darney, France, in which both regiments of the Czechoslovak infantry brigade in France (about 6000
soldiers) took part. They were respectively the 21st Czechoslovak rifle regiment formed in January 1918
in Cognac with volunteers from Russia, Romania, the USA, Italy, the French Foreign Legion and POWs
from Serbia, and the 22nd Czechoslovak rifle regiment formed on 20 May 1918 in Jarnac from detached
sections of the 21st regiment.
The concentration of the brigade at Darney was mainly due to its planned departure for the front. However,
it was suggested to take advantage of the situation and organise a ceremony including presentation of
a flag to the 21st Czechoslovak rifle regiment and a parade of the whole brigade.
Besides Edvard Beneš and representatives of the Czechoslovak National Council, the French President,
members of the French government and representatives of the Allied armies were present at the parade.
At this occasion, French President Raymond Poincaré presented the 21st regiment a flag made according
to a design by the great Czech painter František Kupka, donated by the city of Paris. In his speech to the
Czechoslovak legionnaires, the French president appreciated their patriotism and emphasised the fact that
they did not hesitate when they “were to choose between law and violence, truth and lie, and between
light and darkness”. The legionnaires’ choir sang a patriotic song “Bývali Čechové” and all the legionnaires
spontaneously joined in.
This was followed by an oath that also stated: “In the name of our national honor we swear to fight
by the side of our allies against all our enemies until our Czech and Slovak countries join into an
independent Czechoslovak state…”
The ceremony was ended by a march of all the brigade members. It left a deep impression on all present
– the Chief Commander of the Czechoslovak Army Pierre Janin even issued a special order in which he
congratulated the brigade on the parade’s excellence.
Afterwards, the soldiers left to fight on the front in northeastern France. There they participated in
heavy fighting in September and October 1918 and distinguished themselves particularly at Terron
(21st regiment) and Chestres (22nd regiment).
To commemorate the oath at Darney, in 1938 a memorial was erected there at the parade site. It was destroyed
by the Nazis in 1940, but in 1968 was restored thanks to contributions from Czechoslovak expatriates.


-----

The Day of the Armed Forces is celebrated not only by soldiers but also by the public – including children
accompanied by their parents. Many military units and facilities organise Open Days and other events
presenting military training and daily routines of the soldiers to the public. The biggest event at this
occasion is a two-day presentation that takes place at Vypich in Prague, called The Army for Children and
Young Adults; its programme includes presentation of military equipment and training. In 2005, a fully
professional army presented itself to the public for the first time. The expositions of a temporary military
camp contained many points of interest to satisfy admirers of military equipment. For example, a shooting
range simulator generated much larger interest than it could accommodate. A similar situation occurred
in case of competitions of various military specialties. The attention of the public was also captured by
demonstrations of dog handling, MUSADO martial arts, military police operations, paratrooper jumps, etc.
Last but not least, all participants were invited to taste a proper military goulash.

## HE RMED ORCES
# T A F
## OF THE ZECH EPUBLIC
# C R

The essential mission of the armed forces is to prepare for defence of the Czech Republic and to defend
it against an outside attack. Simultaneously they meet other tasks that arise from collective defence
commitments the Czech Republic has assumed as a signatory of international agreements. To that purpose
they develop their capabilities, including build-up of units integrated in NATO Response Force (NRF). They
continuously ensure active participation in NATINADS (NATO Integrated Air Defence System) and the
capability to host, if necessary, the Allied forces on domestic territory. Within the framework of the Czech
Republic’s participation in developing European Union’s European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), the
armed forces of the Czech Republic are involved in development of EU military capabilities, including rapid
reaction forces, that are being built as compatible with and complementary to NATO forces.
The above key missions of the armed forces follow from the obligation to participate in ensuring
the Czech Republic’s security interests that are as a whole defined in the Czech Republic’s Security
Strategy:

- vital interests – ensuring the Czech Republic’s existence, its sovereignty, territorial integrity and
political independence; defence of democracy and state of law, protection of basic human rights and
freedoms of its inhabitants;

- strategic interests – security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area; keeping UN’s global stabilisation
role and increasing its effectiveness; a firm transatlantic link within NATO and building of strategic
partnership between NATO and EU; complementary development of NATO and EU defence capabilities;
development of OSCE role in prevention of armed conflicts; stabilisation and democratisation; fighting
international terrorism; reduction of the risks related to WMD proliferation, including their carriers;
elimination of organised crime and illegal migration; support to regional cooperation; ensuring the CR’s
economic security; strengthening domestic defence industry competitiveness, and ensuring adequate
level of reserves; propagation of freedom and democracy and principles of law;

- other important interests – prevention and readiness in relation to unpredictable natural, ecological
and industrial disasters and accidents; environmental protection; awareness of possible global climatic
changes, food and water shortage, lack of industrial potential and energy etc.

###### The Czech Republic's military defence builds on three pillars

**1st pillar – defence of domestic territory, including mobilisation arrangements; also included is**
operational preparation of the national territory, assistance to the Police of the Czech
Republic and the Integrated Rescue System; and readiness to host, in case of necessity, Allied
forces on the territory of the Czech Republic
**2nd pillar – protection and defence of the Czech Republic’s air space, especially through active participation**
in NATINADS;
**3rd pillar – capability to participate in NATO and EU operations by fully trained and equipped mobile forces,**
including employment of earmarked forces, depending on the character and scope of the crisis, in
NATO-led and EU-led operations and operations of ad hoc coalitions (“coalitions of the willing”).


43


-----

The conceptual framework for the armed forces to meet the military tasks of national defence, commitments
of collective defence of the NATO countries, and participation in NATO, EU and coalition-led operations
is defined by the basic security document, The Military Strategy of the Czech Republic, which is a set of
key principles of ensuring the Czech Republic’s defence and principles of build-up and employment of the
armed forces. The document also says that together with the armed forces, the armed security corps,
rescue corps and emergency services also participate in ensuring the defence tasks in cooperation with the
government, regional and municipal authorities, and other corporations and natural persons.

### THE REFORM OF THE ARMED FORCES
##### OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC

In order to meet the new defence strategy of the Czech Republic it is
necessary that the armed forces gradually and systematically achieve the
requested level of operational capabilities. This requirement has necessitated
a radical reform of the armed forces.
The goals of the reform and missions of the armed forces of the Czech
Republic are primarily based on the current security situation and
prognoses of its development. It is true that the Czech Republic is situated
in a favourable security environment (good neighbourly relations, NATO
and EU membership), however, the security situation on the global level
has deteriorated. The proliferation threat and terrorist attacks at the
beginning of the 21st century testify to the fact that in the future these
factors are not going to work locally and in an isolated way but in a global
and coordinated manner.
Therefore, the political and military ambition of the Czech Republic to
cover the risks consists in ensuring a full-strength participation in Article 5 common defence operations,
and ensuring a full-scale meeting of the tasks ensuing from the Constitution of the Czech Republic and
other laws. The Armed Forces of the Czech Republic have to be reformed so that they have operational
capabilities that will ensure practical realisation of these goals with a high level of effectiveness.
The reform of the armed forces consists in a change of the hitherto applied principles in the social,
economic, control and, last but not least, organisational areas. It is a long-term process that is expected
to result in the armed forces that are in all respects comparable with those of the other NATO member
countries, with a structure, equipment, armament and personnel numbers corresponding to the Czech
Republic’s realistic possibilities.
The armed forces’ operational capabilities will primarily mean an availability of forces and assets necessary
to meet the tasks in operations; effectiveness of the command and control system, communication,
information, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; transportability by strategic transport assets
in the full area of possible operations; effectiveness of combat deployment and reconnaissance; long-term
sustainability of the forces in the area of deployment; effective protection of the forces deployed and
their resistance against enemy attacks. Stress will be laid on achieving a high degree of interoperability
with NATO forces and assets.
The achievement of the required level of the above-mentioned key capabilities of the armed forces of the
Czech Republic is going to be planned in two subsequent stages. The target state of the first stage is
defined as the achievement of the initial operational capabilities of the armed forces of the Czech Republic
by 31 December 2006. It will include building and achievement of readiness of one mechanised brigade and
units of artillery, air defence, helicopter air force, reconnaissance, EW, NBC, engineer, logistic, medical and
police support necessary to form a brigade task force. In this stage, conscription duty has already been
abolished (by the end of 2004); the armed forces of the Czech Republic are now fully professional, and
a number of significant modernisation projects of development and construction are being implemented.
The target state of the second stage will be the achievement of the target operational capabilities of the
armed forces of the Czech Republic. The exact term when it is to be achieved has not been set, regarding
the fact that it depends on real development of budgetary possibilities after 2006 and beyond. It will be
detailed in the process of the Czech Republic’s defence planning. The preliminary intention is to achieve
the target operational capabilities in the horizon of 2010-2012.
The process of achieving the requested level of operational capabilities continues according to the
schedule. The process of build-up of the armed forces includes the Medium-term plan of activities
and development of the defence department and Programs of development of the armed forces. These
documents are intended to “balance” a purposeful and cost-effective utilisation of the allocated resources
to achieve the requested operational capabilities so that the armed forces of the Czech republic are
developed in compliance with the principles defined by the Concept of development of the professional
Armed Forces of the Czech Republic and mobilisation of the armed forces of the Czech Republic.


-----

The overall expenditures allocated in the national budget for the Ministry of Defence in separate years
have been determined in the amount that guarantees the coverage of expenditures necessary for the
Concept to be implemented. The expenditures for the period 2004 to 2006 have been allocated in the form
of a medium-term framework of expenditures in relation to the reform of public finance (see table).

**Year** **2004** **2005** **2006** **2007** **2008** **2009** **2010**

**CZK billion** **50.7** **52.9** **58.4** **61.3** **64.2** **67.4** **70.3**

The expenditures stated in the table after 2006 reflect a minimum level of funds indispensable for
implementation of the goals defined by the Concept. In order to maintain the principle of a development
sustainable over a long period, an optimal distribution of the funds is as follows: 50 per cent personnel
(mandatory expenditures), 20 to 25 per cent investment and 25 to 30 per cent current and related
expenditures of the defence department. Besides other things, these facts also define certain limits as
to the personnel numbers of the military; the target figure should not exceed 35,000 personnel.

### MODERNISATION PROJECTS
##### OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES

The armed forces’ material assets consist of weapons, weapon systems,
military equipment, material and infrastructure. A state-of-the-art equipment,
armament and high-quality logistic support is a precondition to achieving
the requested key military capabilities that are defined by the reform of the
armed forces of the Czech Republic.
The required operational capabilities defined in the form of programs
including requirements for strategic acquisitions of military materiel are
materialised in the process of armament. The medium-term plan of activities
and development of the defence department is a basic tool facilitating the
fulfilment of goals defined in the Concept of the development of the Armed
Forces of the Czech Republic and mobilisation of the armed forces of the
Czech Republic adjusted to a changed framework of funding.
The process of armament is closely connected with defence planning and
requirements of harmonisation with the NATO and EU trends in the area of armament, communication
information systems and infrastructure. The armament strategy is expressed in the form of modernisation
**projects. The most important of them in the area of armament and equipment include:**

- renewal of personal weapons and equipment of soldiers based on experience from deployment on
international missions;

- replacement of technologically obsolete equipment and material in the light of current development
trends;

- purchase and unification of a medium off-road truck, a more extensive application of containarisation;

- re-armament of mechanised troops with wheeled armoured carriers;

- modernisation of armament and equipment intended for joint forces’ support units (particularly for
the NBC troops);

- modernisation and purchase of assets for airport, operational and communication support related to
operation of the newly acquired air equipment;

- implementation of key projects related to individual services and department-wide projects (stressing
passive surveillance systems, communication infrastructure, military, chemical, biological and medical
specialisations, development of military science and theory and requirements placed on a soldier of
the 21st century).

Key priorities in the area of infrastructure include:

- construction and modernisation of centres, bases (Čáslav, Náměšť nad Oslavou, Bechyně, Jince, Žatec,
Přáslavice), laboratories and training grounds in the area of chemical and biological protection, and
facilities in the area of passive surveillance systems;

- development and modernisation of ground forces’ training areas and facilities for professional soldiers’
basic training;

- development and modernisation of facilities of air space protection that are part of NATINADS, and to
ensure projects that are being implemented within the framework of NSIP (NATO Security Investment
Programme);

- construction of buildings and facilities for command and control, and accommodation facilities for
soldiers, as defined in the Concept implementation schedule.

###### Key projects of armament of individual services

✓Acquisition of the JAS-39 Gripen supersonic fighter aircraft
The aim of the project is to ensure the continuity of the Czech Republic’s air space protection by
supersonic aircraft capable of operating under all weather conditions, day and night, in cooperation
with other NATO services. The first aircraft have been delivered in April 2005, and since 1 July 2005 they
are meeting the tasks within NATINADS.

_Mi-171Š_

_JAS-39 Gripen_ _T-72M4 CZ_

✓Re-armament of the ACR with armoured carriers
The aim of the project is to re-equip two mechanised battalions and selected special units of the
brigade with new wheeled combat vehicles and wheeled armoured personnel carriers to meet the
tasks of prevention and elimination of crises in national, and particularly in Allied extent in Article 5
operations and beyond. The deliveries are planned for 2007 to 2012, including related assets necessary
for education, training and logistic support.
✓Modernisation of the T-72M4 CZ main battle tank
The aim of modernisation is to achieve combat parameters and manufacture qualities on the level of
a 3rd to 4th generation tank. The modernisation is more cost-effective compared to purchase of new
tanks of that generation. The tanks have been delivered to the ACR since 2004; by 2006 their number
will grow to 30 (3 of them with command equipment). The contract includes delivery of educational
and training assets and logistic support.
✓Acquisition of the L-159 system
The aim of the project was to equip the tactical air force with the L-159 subsonic aircraft including
necessary systems that would enable it to carry out combat activities under all weather conditions,
day and night, and that would be compatible with NATO weapon systems and armaments, and with
interoperability assets for communication and data transmission. Within the framework of the project,
the concept of introduction of simulation equipment in service with the ACR is being implemented, in
coordination with the newly introduced weapon systems.
✓Modernisation of helicopter aviation
The aim of the project is to ensure interoperability in meeting joint combat tasks and rescue activities
with armies of NATO member countries. To achieve this, 16 Mi-171Š helicopters and up to 10 Mi-24V
(Mi-35) helicopters are to be acquired between 2003 and 2006 within the framework of the Russian
debt settlement.
✓ARTHUR (Artillery Hunting Radar)
The aim of the project is to equip the ACR with highly mobile and state-of-the-art weapon locating and
fire control assets enabling early warning and location of enemy artillery fire. Within the framework of
modernisation of ACR artillery it was decided to purchase 3 pieces of radar and one simulator between
2005 and 2008; operational use in ACR is planned from 2007.

**NATO Security Investment Programme (NSIP)**

Besides budgetary finance, other (non-budgetary) funds, particularly those of NATO and the European
Union, are also used for providing necessary resources for the armed forces. The Czech Republic has
joined NSIP as of 12 March 1999 (accession to NATO). The NATO Security Investment Programme is
intended for joint funding of the defence infrastructure necessary for deployment and training of
NATO forces on the territories of individual member nations and, when appropriate, in other areas of
operation. The programme provides for joint funding of stationary facilities like airports, communication
and information systems, headquarters, pipelines and fuel depots, radar and navigation assets, support
auxiliary facilities etc. Moreover, it also enables funding of activities like exercises, training and support
(logistics). A jointly funded NATO infrastructure on the territory of a member country can also be used
in favour of the given member country.

In the Czech Republic, a total of about CZK 6.15 billion has been envisaged for NSIP by the end of 2008.
From that amount, CZK 2.5 billion is to come from CR budget, CZK 3.65 billion from NATO funds. These
funds will be used for projects focused on development of jointly exploited allied infrastructure, i.e.
HNS-related (host nation support) projects and those intended for completion of the NATO Integrated
Air Defence System.

Participation in NSIP is executed through so-called Capability Packages. There are three groups of
projects:

- Package No. 1 deals with acquisition of two backbone 3D long-range radars. These will significantly
influence the quality of information on CR airspace and, as a result, its defence and security.

- Package No. 2 concerns NATINADS.

- Package No. 3 deals with the development of HNS infrastructure, i.e. defence infrastructure necessary
for hosting NATO troops on the territory of the Czech Republic in case of a crisis, including support for
their operational deployment. The projects include particularly completion of the air bases at Čáslav
and Náměšť nad Oslavou to comply with NATO minimum military requirements.

### THE ARMED FORCES' PEACETIME STRUCTURE

The key subject of implementation of our nation’s defence goals are the armed forces of the Czech
Republic in general (in the sense used in current legislation) and its core – the Armed Forces of the
Czech Republic (denoting the Armed Forces proper, or ACR). Besides the ACR, the armed forces also
include the Military Office of the President of the Republic, and the Castle Guards.

**Structure of the armed forces of the Czech Republic**

**Armed Forces** **Military Office**
**of the Czech Republic** **of the President** **Castle Guards**
**(ACR)** **of the Republic**

The aim of the reform of the armed forces is to achieve that the ACR is a compact, balanced and
efficient part of the Allied forces. This must be equally reflected in its peacetime structure. The wartime
structure of the ACR will be based on the scenario of its employment within the framework of an
Article 5 operation in case of a direct threat to the Czech Republic’s territory.
The Czech Republic is committed to development of such a military potential that is able, in cooperation
with the Allies, to respond to any crisis, both military and non-military, threatening the national
interests and those of the Alliance on domestic, Allied or, if appropriate, some other territory.

###### THE MILITARY OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE CASTLE GUARDS

**The Military Office of the President of the Republic is a military formation of the armed forces of the**
Czech Republic that is responsible for tasks related to the exercise of the authority of the President of
the Republic as the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces and for the control of the Castle Guards.
The Military Office is headed by a chief that is appointed and recalled by the President. The Chief of the
Military Office is directly subordinated to the President.

_Appointment of generals at the Prague Castle on 28 October 2005_

Since 22 December 2004, the Castle Guards have been a fully professional component of the armed forces
of the Czech Republic. Its servicemen fulfil standard duties of professional soldiers. The key parts of
the Castle Guards’ organisational structure are two guard battalions, a support company and the Castle
Guards Band.

The Castle Guards provide for ceremonies involving the President of the Republic that are defined by the
Constitution of the Czech Republic and other acts, particularly appointments of:

- the Prime Minister and other members of government,

- president, vice-presidents and judges of the Constitutional Court,

- governor, vice-governors and other members of the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank,

- president and vice-presidents of the Supreme Court,

- judges,

- chairman and vice-chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Commission,

- rectors of universities,

- generals and their promotions,

- chairman and inspectors of the Office for Personal Data Protection.

Moreover, the Castle Guards arrange and perform military honours during visits of heads of state, heads
of diplomatic missions, parliamentarians, prime ministers, ministers of foreign affairs, EU and NATO
representatives etc. to the President of the Republic.
The Castle Guards are also in charge of external protection and defence of the Prague Castle, the
Castle of Lány and other buildings that become a temporary residence of the President and his guests.
Simultaneously they also meet the tasks related to representation of the Office of the President of the
Republic in public.

### DEFENCE DEPARTMENT

The Defence Department involves the Ministry of Defence, the Joint Forces, Support and Training Forces,
Military Police, Military Intelligence, administrative authorities established under respective laws, state
enterprises and allowance organisations established by the Ministry of Defence, and other subjects
whose activities and utilisation specifically distinguish them from other forces.


-----

###### MINISTRY OF DEFENCE

The Ministry of Defence is the central authority of the state administration for ensuring
the defence of the Czech Republic; it controls the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic
and administers military regions. As the authority for ensuring the national defence, it
participates in development of a strategy for the national military defence policy, prepares
a concept for operations planning of the national territory, suggests necessary defence measures to the
Government of the Czech Republic, the Security Council of the Czech Republic, and the President of the
Czech Republic.
In addition to other duties related to the country’s defence, it ensures fulfilment of the Czech Republic’s
commitments resulting from international military and political security documents that were assigned
into its sphere of competence by the resolution of the Government of the Czech Republic. Within the
framework of the European security structures it organises cooperation with the armed forces of other
countries.

###### MILITARY POLICE

The Military Police (MP) was established on 21 January 1991. Within the scope defined by
the law they are responsible for police protection of the armed forces, military facilities,
military material and other state property controlled by the Ministry of Defence of the
Czech Republic. The Military Police is fully professional. They focus on prevention of
serious illegal activities, phenomena and events, and pay increased attention to the issues of drugs,
protection of weapons, ammunition and explosives. Besides prevention, which is considered to be one
of the crucial activities to decrease criminal activities in the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic, their
tasks include criminal prosecution.
The Military Police is headed by a chief, who is directly subordinated to the Minister of Defence of the
Czech Republic. The organisational structure of the Military Police is based on the territorial principle.
It consists of several commands located in garrisons in Prague, Stará Boleslav, Tábor and Olomouc.

-----

**Military Police Main Headquarters in Prague is an authority responsible for development of the concept**
and for control of the police protection of the armed forces, military facilities, military material and
other government property within the competence of the Ministry of Defence. It has the role of superior
authority in relation to territorial commands. Military Police units organise and provide coordination
with the bodies of the Ministry of Defence, law-enforcement bodies, state administration and selfadministration authorities, and other authorities within the territory assigned for the police protection
by the Military Police. The MP officers are assigned directly to military units and currently they also
serve in ACR military contingents in missions on the territory of Iraq and in the Balkans.
While the Military Police officers deployed on missions in the Balkans rotate every six months, the turn
of duty of MP contingents operating in Iraq in the structure of the Multinational Forces (MNF) is three
months.
The main tasks of the Czech Military Police officers in the Operation KFOR (in Kosovo) and ALTHEA (in
Bosnia and Herzegovina) missions consist in police protection of the locally operating ACR contingents.
In Iraq, they also supervise the activities of the Iraqi police personnel, help with their training and
prepare instructors of the Iraqi Police.

-----

**Service of Detection and Documentation of Criminal Activities** is methodologically controlled by
a department of the Main Headquarters of the Military Police. The executive component for detection
of cases of serious economic and organised crime is the Special Department of the Main Headquarters
of the Military Police. A specialised office for criminological investigation is a section of criminological
techniques and expertise. The responsibilities of the Service of Detection and Documentation of Criminal
Activities also include the activities of the Military Police EOD service.

**Traffic, Disciplinary and Protection Service (TDPS) is methodologically controlled by a department**
of the Main Headquarters of the Military Police that bears the same name. On the level of individual
MP headquarters there are TDPS sections, sections of protection of buildings, emergency sections and
specific sections of the MP Protective Service Command Prague, like the section of protection and escort,
section of personnel protection and section of aircraft protection. There is also an independent section
tasked with protection of the minister of defence and a special section of the Special Operations Unit of
the Military Police Prague. In selected garrisons there are TDPS branch offices and task groups.
Members of both Traffic, Disciplinary and Protection Service and the Service of Detection and
Documentation of Criminal Activities often use dogs. The Military Police has both guard dogs and those
trained for special work, like detection of arms, ammunitions and drugs.


-----

The Military Police also includes specialised workplaces that are in charge of specific technical activities
– like criminological techniques and expertise, analytical and information office, automation of control,
office for selection, training and education of military police officers, logistic support.
The command staff and police work is supported by a Military Police information system that is operated
with the MP Main Headquarters and subordinated formations. It provides an independent information
flow from subordinated formations via MP Headquarters to the defence minister.

_Graduation ceremony at the Military Police Technical School at Vyškov_

**The Military Police Technical School at the Military Academy at Vyškov provides comprehensive**
technical education of professional soldiers for positions with the Military Police. The school not only
provides education in basic, technical and specialised courses for personnel appointed to posts within
the structure of the Military Police; it is also in charge of development of reserves earmarked for
fulfilling Military Police tasks during crises or at the time of a conflict.
The contents of practical police training of professional soldiers as future MP members is adequate to
that of the training of future police officers at police high schools of the Police of the Czech Republic. The
school’s graduates, when they retire from the military, are fully adaptable for activities in formations
of the Police of the Czech Republic, in the Integrated Rescue System and in state administration bodies,
particularly in public administration.
The Military Police Technical School at the Military Academy at Vyškov provides training particularly
in the following areas: detection and documentation of criminal activities, traffic, disciplinary and
protective service, special physical training and special firearms training. The school also actively

### FULLY PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES

Since 1 January 2005 the Czech Republic has fully professional armed forces. The last conscripts left the
military on 22 December 2004. The conscript duty and civilian duty have been abolished by a Military Act
amendment passed by the House of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic on 24 September
2004 and by the Senate on 4 November 2004. As stipulated by the current legislation, military duty will
be required only in situations of a threat to national security or state of war.
In the context of the recent extensive reform of the armed forces the proportion of professional soldiers
and conscripts had gradually changed in favour of the former: in 2003 for the first time the professional
soldiers outnumbered conscripts serving in the armed forces. After the abolition of the conscript duty,
the reduction of personnel numbers has continued. The target numbers are 26,200 soldiers and 8800
civilian employees in 2008. As of 1 January 2006, the ACR had 39,084 personnel (23,092 professional
soldiers, 15,992 civilian employees).

**Numbers of conscripts (in the last years before abolition of the conscript duty)**

**Year** **Conscript duty** **Substitutional duty** **Total**

1999 33,023 1 178 34,201

2000 26,212 1 181 27,393

2001 22,503 1 117 23,620

2002 21,218 1 094 22,312

2003 9 971 636 10,607

2004 1 596 116 1 712

With the gradual implementation of the reform there is also a structural change in the ranks corps, i.e.
reduction of personnel in the Officer Corps and civilian personnel, and an increase of numbers in the
Sergeant and Warrant Officer Corps.

**Envisaged composition of the corps of ranks: 10 to 25 per cent Officers, 25 to 35 per cent Warrant**
Officers, 40 to 60 per cent Sergeants.

|Year|Conscript duty|Substitutional duty|Total|

The current ACR is being built on the principle of effective sufficiency that ensues from the real
impact of the Czech Republic’s full-fledged NATO and EU membership. Due to their new structure,
mobility, modernisation and a larger space for training, the armed forces will maintain or increase
their preparedness and combat value of individual military components even with significantly lower
personnel numbers.


-----

### JOINT FORCES

They are designed to establish, develop, rotate and disband the task forces intended
for tactical or operational and tactical tasks on the territory of the Czech Republic and
beyond, and for other tasks on the territory of the Czech Republic that are defined by
law. They consist of the Joint Forces Command, formations and units of ground forces,
formations and units of the air force, and support formations, units and facilities.


**Joint Forces Command**


**Ground Forces** **Air Force** **Support Units**

**The Joint Forces Command is in charge of planning and control of development, preparation, training**
and earmarking of subordinated forces and assets for task forces in order to support military political
ambitions of the Czech Republic, and it meets tasks to that purpose. It is located at Olomouc, a city of
a rich military tradition that ranks among the most important centres in the Czech Republic.
The Joint Forces are a co-organiser of the event called “BAHNA”, or The Joint Forces Day, which has been
held at the military training ground at Strašice every year since 1990. The “BAHNA” has become one of
the largest ACR presentations in the public.

Both mechanised battalions are characterised by a high degree of readiness, mobility and fire power,
capability of quick transfers (including partial air transportation), and capability of meeting special tasks.
This is reflected in their structure, in which the individual elements are integrated in three basic groups:
a combat component, combat support component, and a logistic and medical support component.
An airborne mechanised battalion is a unit intended for tactical tasks (including those of a special
character) within the mechanised brigade’s battle structure or independently; with its high mobility,
it is the main expeditionary force of the mechanised troops. It is characterised by a high degree of
readiness, capability of air transfers and capability of meeting special tasks by airdrops on parachutes
or from helicopters. It is earmarked for NATO rapid reaction forces.
A communications company provides for a permanent communication of the brigade commander
and staff with the superior level of command and subordinated units, using radio and telephone
communication assets.
An operations platoon of the command provides a permanent support of the brigade command both in
peacetime and in combat conditions, using light Land Rover vehicles and Tatra trucks.

**Currently the brigade operates the following equipment:**
Infantry fighting vehicle (BVP-2), 9K 111 anti-tank missile complex, AGS-17 grenade launcher, 82mm
mortar (model 52), off-road Land Rover DEFENDER etc.

###### 13th Artillery Brigade

It is a basic asset of the ground forces intended for destruction of enemy forces on ground.
Artillery and mortar units’ activities are an inherent part of a multi-service combat and
one of prerequisites of success in combat. Its tasks consist in fighting the enemy artillery,
providing direct and general fire support to combat forces by fire destruction of the enemy, in non-lethal
fire with demonstration, psychological or other effects limiting enemy activities, and in using special
smoke or illuminating ammunition (incendiary, blinding). It carries out reconnaissance in the zone
of activities and passes its results for further exploitation. The brigade’s units ensure the traditional
presentation of the Armed Forces at the annual “BAHNA” event with a high degree of professionalism.

**Organisational structure**

of important facilities in national responsibility following activation of the readiness system, and it
monitors the air space in the no-fly zone and immediate surroundings of the Dukovany nuclear power
station.

**Organisational structure**
The command is divided into the air base staff and separate sections, groups and services whose task
is to provide technical and administrative support to the following individual components of the air
base:

**• The tactical squadron meets the tasks of air force training, pilot development and ensuring the**
operability and combat capability of air equipment and special systems.

**• The command support squadron concentrates ground personnel experts for the air operation proper**
of the base; it provides services for air rescue service, civilian aircraft and aircraft in distress.

**• The combat support squadron is divided into flights. A Forward Air Controllers flight is in charge of**
development and training of TACPs (Tactical Air Control Party). A SAR/CSAR flight consists of a search
and rescue group and CSAR groups.

**• The logistic support squadron provides the air base’s daily routine operation by maintaining permanent**
service availability of take-off and landing surfaces for air traffic and providing technical assets
necessary to prepare the aircraft for take-off.
The main type of air equipment in service with the base is the L-39ZA Albatros two-seater subsonic jet

### SUPPORT AND TRAINING FORCES

They are intended particularly for providing personnel, financial, logistic, medical veterinary,
communication and information support to all components within the competence of the
Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic and, within the framework of HNS (host nation
support) tasks, to Allied forces deployed temporarily on the Czech territory. Moreover,
they are in charge of cooperation with civilian territorial administration authorities and
both corporate and physical persons on the territory of the Czech Republic or, if appropriate, beyond
this territory. They are also in charge of development of ACR doctrine system and of training and
professional development of active and reserve soldiers.
The above tasks are met both in peacetime and in situations of threat to national security or at war.
From the very definition, the Support and Training Forces are an element of territorial character;
therefore, as a rule – with the exception of assigned elements –, they operate in stationary facilities. The
largest annual presentation of the forces for the public is the Support and Training Forces’ Day known
as “CIHELNA” that takes place in Králíky fortification area every year since 1999.
In 2005, transformation of logistic support was underway within the Support and Training Forces. All
logistics bases have been re-organised to new organisation structures.

###### SUPPORT AND TRAINING FORCES COMMAND

It is in charge of planning and control of development of individual subordinated directorates and
independent units. In cooperation with them it organises and provides comprehensive support to
all components within the competence of the Ministry of Defence, and it participates in HNS tasks.
Therefore, the Support and Training Forces Command is not a classic example of an element intended
for tactical operation command; the commander, staff and heads of individual directorates are rather
managers of human, material or financial resources and services for the needs of the military. The
command, via subordinated regional financial bodies, also manages the complex system of financial
flows within the MoD competence, including accounting, financial reporting, and performance of tax
liabilities. The Support and Training Forces Command is located at Stará Boleslav.

acts. After disbandment of territorial military administrations, the Regional Military Commands have
assumed their tasks in the area of registration of citizens liable to conscript duty, records on ACR
mobilisation reserves, mobilisation recruitment and crisis management.
As of 1 January 2006, recruitment centres, formerly subordinated to the Recruitment and
Professionalisation Agency, have been integrated in the structures of the Regional Military Commands.
Each Regional Military Command is headed by a director.
On the territory of the Czech Republic there are 14 Regional Military Commands; they are directly
subordinated to the Support and Training Forces Command. They are tasked with providing protection
of the given territory and coordinating tasks related to crisis management within the given area of

###### Active Reserve of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic

The Active Reserve is being created under the Act 585/2004 Coll., on conscription (Defence Act). It is
used particularly for replenishment of the armed forces in situation of national threat, state of war, or
following non-military crises and emergency situations – particularly in order to provide assistance to
population in the aftermath of natural and environmental disasters.
Officially, the Active Reserve has been established as of 1 January 2004, based on the needs of the Armed
Forces of the Czech Republic and the interest of reserve soldiers in serving in its units. However, prior
to its establishment, so-called “voluntary military exercises” were being held since 1999 with the aim
of reserves’ refresher training.
Under the Defence Act amendment currently in force, a Czech citizen (man, woman, regular reserve
soldier) aged 18 to 60 can submit a written application to a relevant Regional Military Command
according to his/her place of residence, expressing his/her wish to voluntarily assume the military
duty and to join the Active Reserve. Other conditions and criteria necessary for a citizen to qualify for
the Active Reserve include his/her health fitness, integrity, a need on the part of the armed forces, and
signing of a contract on joining the Active Reserve. The contract is concluded between the citizen and
the Regional Military Command for 3 years. The contract also specifies the military unit for which the
soldier is being trained, his service position, the extent of military exercises and his/her preliminary
consent to being called up to professional military service for two years.

**Active Reserve Training**
Since 2005, the training has been organised in duration of up to 3 weeks. Reserve members who signed
their contract after 1 January 2005 and have not passed basic or substitution duty will go through basic
training of up to 8 weeks in training centres of the Training and Doctrines Directorate.
Training of assigned Sergeants, Warrant Officers and Officers takes place at the Military Academy
Vyškov and in assigned units. Training is organised particularly in field and it follows a methodological
subsequence. The first week is focused on specialty training in training centres of the Training and
Doctrines Directorate. The next two weeks are spent in a military training area (Libavá, Hradiště,
Boletice), the first week being focused on individual and squad training, second on platoon training.
Members of infantry squads go through a two-week specialty field training in some of the military
regions’ training facilities.

State administration on the territory of a Military Region is executed by a Regional Office headed by
a chief. Economic exploitation of the region is fully in competence of the Military Forests and Farms of
the Czech Republic, a state enterprise, and the head of the Regional Office.
Military Forests and Farms of the Czech Republic is a state-owned enterprise that is in charge of the
regions’ landscape, and it deals with economic activities that are to contribute to environmental and
biological balance on the territory of the Military Region in compliance with the needs of military
training.
On the territory of the Military Regions there are defined training areas including equipment and
support for field training of ACR, Police of the Czech Republic, the Integrated Rescue System, and, if
necessary, Allied armies. The training areas play a significant role within the framework of tactical and
operational training of troops, that is why they usually extend on vast areas almost inaccessible to the
public. The landscape of all military regions is characterised by vast forests and special training surfaces
(tank, infantry and artillery shooting ranges, grounds intended for training in combat vehicle handling,
water and engineer training grounds etc.) The forests, on one hand, fulfil a role of a protective shield in
order not to endanger the population; on the other they serve for training of soldiers in field conditions
and for camouflage of military facilities that are subject to a certain degree of classification.
The operational capability of training facilities in Military Regions is maintained by service centres that
are subordinated to the Training and Doctrine Directorate. These centres are also in charge of developing
schedules in order to fully use the capacity of the training facilities during the year.

### ACR ENGAGEMENT IN MULTINATIONAL
##### OPERATIONS, OBSERVER MISSIONS AND INTERNATIONAL MILITARY STRUCTURES

Czech soldiers’ participation in peacekeeping missions has a tradition of many years. Its beginnings date
back to late 1990 and it has continued ever since. In 2005, the year when the Armed Forces of the Czech
Republic have become fully professional, ACR personnel participated in five foreign operations on the
territories of Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iraq, Kosovo and Pakistan. In total, 1822 soldiers
have been deployed on international missions.


-----

###### ISAF Mission – Afghanistan

Two ACR contingents were deployed on this mission in
2005. The first of them, in strength of up to 20 personnel,
was stationed at the Kabul International Airport. Its main
element consisted of an Explosive Ordnance Detachment
(EOD) with the tasks of ordnance reconnaissance and
disposal of unexploded ordnance and booby traps.
Another element was the METEO Group that provided meteorological
service to the air traffic control personnel. The second ACR contingent
of 50 personnel was deployed at Fayzabad in north-eastern region of
Afghanistan; its soldiers were primarily in charge of guarding the base,
patrolling within the assigned areas of responsibility and protecting
the personnel of the provincial reconstruction team while meeting their
tasks outside the base. Czech soldiers also fulfilled the tasks related to
the national elections that were held there at that time.
Czech military professionals were engaged in an anti-terrorist operation
on the territory of Afghanistan as early as in April 2004; a special force’s contingent included in the
Special Forces CJTF structure operated there, meeting particularly reconnaissance tasks.
Currently Czech soldiers are included in units operating at Kabul International Airport and in the
Fayzabad area.

###### Operation ALTHEA (EUFOR) – Bosnia and Herzegovina

In 2005, the ACR contributed a contingent consisting
of soldiers stationed at EUFOR Headquarters (Sarajevo),
NATO Forces HQ (Sarajevo), and a joint Czech-Austrian
Guard Company at the EAGLE BASE (Tuzla). From April
to mid-December 2005, the contingent was enhanced by
a helicopter unit (2x Mi-17). The main tasks of the Czech soldiers include
guarding and protecting the Multinational Task Force North (MNTF N) Headquarters. The contingent is
in strength of 90 personnel.
The ACR contingent has been part of EU-led military peacekeeping forces since December 2004.

###### Operations MNF-I and NTM-I – Iraq

In the operations on Iraqi territory, the ACR
contributed a Military Police contingent of
100 personnel. Czech military policemen,
integrated in the force structure of the
Multinational Division Southeast (MND
SE), were stationed at Shaiba Base located
in the province of Basra. Their key tasks included training the Iraqi police
personnel at the Az-Zubayr Police Academy and Shaiba Base; training the
instructors of Iraqi police stations and the personnel of the Iraqi traffic
police and border police. Moreover, Czech soldiers were engaged in escorting,
protecting and guarding tasks as well as providing police support to MND
SE. Until the end of 2005, the contingent also included a field surgery
team of six; they were operating within the framework of the British
field hospital. From March 2005, the contingent was reinforced by six ACR
personnel who were sent to Baghdad to meet tasks within the Multinational Security Transition Command
in Iraq (MNSTC-I) and the NATO Training Mission in Iraq (NTM-I). The key task of NTM-I is to train selected
groups of commanders, provide assistance in building the police academy and the Training Education and
Doctrine Centre (TEDC), and help developing Iraqi security structures.
Czech military police officers have been operating in Iraq since December 2003. Already 8 MP contingents
have rotated there since then, having trained hundreds of Iraqi policemen in various technical courses.

###### Operation JOINT ENTERPRISE OPERATION (KFOR) – Kosovo

In the first half of 2005, the ACR sent a contingent of
up to 400 personnel to the operation. In addition to
the mechanised company, the ACR was also represented
by soldiers assigned to KFOR HQ, Headquarters of the
Multinational Brigade Centre – MNB (C), to Pristina
Airport, to the Multinational Transport Company and
the Military Police Multinational Company. As of 31 July 2005, the Czech
Republic assumed the role of the MNB (C) lead nation after Finland.
For the first time in the modern history of our armed forces, a Czech
officer became commander of a multinational brigade. Simultaneously,
the number of soldiers in the Czech contingent was increased to 500.
Czech soldiers have been stationed at the following three bases: Šajkovac,
Gazala Lines and Camp Ville. The ACR area of responsibility covers 966
square kilometres. The key tasks assigned to Czech soldiers include
ensuring secure environment in their area of responsibility, guarding and
monitoring the 112 km long provincial border between Kosovo and Serbia.
Czech soldiers have been operating in this mission since July 1999, first in strength of a reconnaissance
company, later an enhanced recce company, and between 2002 and 2005 within the framework of
a Czech-Slovak battalion.

###### Humanitarian mission – Pakistan

Between 1 November 2005 and 10 January 2006, the ACR has engaged
in the humanitarian aid effort to clear the aftermath of a disastrous
earthquake in Pakistan with a contingent of 30 personnel (11 doctors, 14
medics and a support team of five). Czech specialists were incorporated
into a Dutch field hospital operating in the Bagh region, 100 km northeast of Islamabad.
During their mission of ten weeks, Czech medical team has treated over 3000 patients, performed about
60 operations and assisted to 11 deliveries. The mission was conducted under the auspices of NATO.

###### Participation in observer missions

Military observers – monitors – have also been contributing to the Czech Republic’s
good reputation abroad. In 2005, 17 ACR military observers were engaged in six UN
and OSCE missions taking place in Georgia, Ethiopia-Eritrea, Congo, Kosovo, Liberia and
Sierra Leone.

###### Czech soldiers in multinational structures

In 2005, 170 members of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic have
served on international military staffs of individual NATO commands.
In order to meet the requirements for the 5th rotation
of the NATO Response Force (NRF), the ACR earmarked
an ad hoc NBC task force in strength of 35 personnel,
which has been incorporated into the NRF six-month
rotation system as of 1 July 2005.
An ACR CIMIC unit that has been earmarked for the 6th NRF rotation has achieved full
operational capabilities by 10 January 2006 and it has been included into the six-month
turn of readiness. It operates within the structure of the NATO multinational task force under British
command and it is capable of deployment anywhere across the world. In case of deployment, the unit’s
key task is to implement the civilian aspects of peace agreements and to support normal functioning
of municipal authorities in given areas of operation.

### MILITARY DECORATIONS

Since 1997, in addition to state orders and medals, military decorations can be awarded to honour
acts of merit and military-related achievements in security, humanitarian and other efforts of both
international and national character in support of democracy and peace.
Military decorations are awarded by the Minister of Defence of the Czech Republic; he confers them
on the occasion of national holidays on 8 May and 28 October. In justified cases, he can present the
decorations even on other occasions.

The highest military decoration is the Cross of Merit of the Minister of Defence of the Czech Republic.
The minister awards it to soldiers in active service and to civilian employees of military administration
who deserve recognition for bravery and courage, for successful command in combat, and for merits in
combat activities, for exemplary military leadership and excellent fulfilment of service or work duties,
for exemplary representation of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic, and for other significant
achievements related to the defence department and its development. He can also award it to other
citizens of the Czech Republic and foreign nationals for their significant cooperation with the defence
department, efforts made to ensure the combat capability and readiness of the Armed Forces of the
Czech Republic, and accomplishing tasks in favour of ACR.
The Cross of Merit has three classes, the first being the highest. The 1st class is made of metal in colour
of gold, 2nd class of silver-coloured metal, and the 3rd class of bronze-coloured metal. The ribbons of
individual classes are differentiated by a Cross of Merit miniature minted in metal in colour of the
respective class.

Other military departmental decorations are medals. The Medal For Injury is awarded by the minister to
soldiers in active service who have sustained, not by their own fault, serious injuries in fulfilling their


-----

duties. The Medal can also be awarded to civilian employees
of the military administration under the same terms as
to soldiers in active service, if the injury occurred during
performance of particularly important work assignments.
The medal For Injury is made of bronze.

The Medal For Service Abroad is awarded by the minister
to soldiers in active service and to civilian employees of
the military administration for successful accomplishment
of tasks in United Nations peacekeeping forces, in other
international military corps or in peace and humanitarian
missions of the international community, or for
a significant contribution to these tasks. The Medal can
also be awarded to members of the armed forces of foreign
nations and to other persons for significant cooperation
efforts and activities with the ACR and the Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic in the abovementioned activities.
The Medal For Service Abroad is made of bronze.

The Medal of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic is awarded by the minister to career soldiers
for achieving very good results in professional activities depending on their service time. Only regular
service since 1 January 1993 is being taken into account for purposes of service duration necessary for
being awarded the Medal.
The ACR Medal has three classes, the first being the highest. The 1st class is awarded for 15 years of
service and is made of gold-coloured metal. The 2nd class, awarded for 10 years of service, is made of
silver-coloured metal, the 3rd class, for 5 years of service, is made of bronze-coloured metal. On the ribbon
of the ACR Medal of the 1st class is the symbol of “XV”, on the ribbon of the 2nd class the “X” and on the
3rd class ribbon the “V”. The symbols are made of metal corresponding with the class of the medal.

With the military decorations, the holders receive a certificate attesting to the fact that the specific
decoration has been conferred on them. At festive occasions, the decoration is worn on the uniform
(left) in natura, otherwise in ribbons. The military departmental decorations are not state decorations
in the sense of the Act No. 157/1994, on State Decorations of the Czech Republic.

###### On historical map works

_P. 21 – A map of Bohemia by Nicolas Claudianus is the first map of the territorial entity in Central Europe. It is oriented with_
_south at top; its pictorial part allegorically illustrates the conflicting religious and political situation in the then Bohemian_
_Kingdom. The map has neither graphic nor ratio scale, and no coordinate frame; an approximate scale is 1 : 650 000._

_Pp. 22 and 23 – A map by Paul Aretin has served for more than a century; it was published in just several editions. The author_
_took into account not only topography, mountains and rivers, but he attempted to record even the territorial division of the_
_country. The map’s decorativeness is underlined by figural motives – 12 figures in period costumes._

_P. 24 – A map by Jan Criginger is the second separate map of Bohemia; it was published by Abraham Ortel in Antwerp. The_
_map has no coordinate frame, but it is already oriented with north at top. Its approximate scale is 1 : 683 500 and it contains_
_292 settlements, main rivers and other bodies of water, and also the Říp mountain._

_The map by Paul Fabricius is the oldest map of Moravia. Originally it was drawn in a 1 : 288 000 scale, in quite a detailed_
_manner. The author even conducted astronomical measurements from 1568. This version was published in 1595, again by_
_Abraham Ortel in Antwerp. The map includes a Latin legend, a scale, and a coordinate frame._

_The map from 17th century is made after the Paul Aretin map from 1619 with the orientation towards North. It contains_
_settlements, main waters, signs of a relief shown by hillocks, vegetation, borders of Bohemia and the then administrative_
_division into regions. The map has guide lines of a coordinate frame, it is decorated with a two-headed imperial eagle and_
_a two-tailed Bohemian lion._

_An engraving of the map by Jan Amos Komenský (Comenius) was made for the then Dutch atlases. It has a rich informative_
_contents; it defines the scale and coordinates frame, the terrain is shown by hillocks. It contains almost 500 settlements_
_differentiated according to their importance. Its scale is about 1 : 470 000._

_P. 25 – A map of the Austrian monarchy, created by Karl Czoernig, Freiherr von Czernhausen, was produced and published in_
_Vienna based on the results of the activities of the Statistics Office between 1829 and1853 (Czoernig was its head). Different_
_colours stand for individual nationalities settled on the territory of the monarchy._

_A general synoptical map of Bohemia and Moravia from a late 19th century atlas. It shows the historical lands of the Czech_
_state in a 1 : 750 000 scale. It indicates the boundaries of the state and lands, settlements, important roads and railways_
_and water bodies. The terrain is marked by hatching._
