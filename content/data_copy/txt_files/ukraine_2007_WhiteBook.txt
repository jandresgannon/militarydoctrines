#### THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE –
 SUPREME COMMANDER
 IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED
 FORCES OF UKRAINE ON
 STABILITY OF NATIONAL
 DEFENCE POLICY

As Supreme Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine I welcome the
tradition of the annual edition of the “White Book” – the report to society and the
international community on the state and future direction of developing the Armed
Forces.

The development trends of the Nation in the context of key global and regional

challenges brings us to the conclusion on the need to ensure at the highest modern level
the defence of the national interests of Ukraine.

There are no other alternatives to creating modern, combat-effective, highly

professional Armed Forces capable of reacting timely and adequately to all presentday challenges.

That is the highest priority task for all State agencies and our entire society. Its

resolution requires an integrated approach and comprehensive assessment, and what is
most important – endorsing qualitatively new approaches and even new mentalities.

The professionalism of Ukraine’s Service personnel, their high level of training

and responsibility have been highly valuated by our partners, with whom we have
conducted joint activities in the “Partnership for Peace” framework, and participated
in international operations to provide peace and security.

The adaptation of national military policy to modern international realities continues.

In that context the accession of Ukraine to the South East European Defence Ministerial
Multinational Peacekeeping Force is a significant milestone. That occurrence proves
that we are on the right track. I see that decision as the first specific step in achieving
our strategic objective – full integration to the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance, as
the collective security mechanism. That objective is defined by the national military
doctrine. That course is irreversible.

Hard work lies ahead. I stipulate the activation of coordinated cooperation between

all State agencies in achieving significant progress in the issues that affect Armed
Forces combat capabilities leading to the full security of our citizens.

We have to create all the conditions that make the conscript in-take in 2009 the last

one in Ukraine’s history.

A whole set of problems is to be resolved concerning financing of Armed Forces’

requirements and, in particular, requirements related to transition to contract-based
professional Armed Forces. That will be one of the priorities during the review of the
State Budget 2008 and developing the State Budget 2009.


-----

It is necessary to resolve the issue of re-equipping the Armed Forces with

qualitatively new armament and military equipment in the shortest time, to meet the
highest modern standards.

It is necessary to do everything possible to re-new the prestige of military service in

society and to make that service just and attractive. All Service individuals, from soldier
to general, has to feel the State and society care for them.

Only in such a way can we sustain and enhance the traditionally high level of public

trust to the Armed Forces.

I am confident that through the coordinated efforts of the President, Cabinet of

Ministers, Supreme Rada, we shall definitely achieve success.

All the issues related with defence sector reform, taking the national military to

the professional basis and fulfilling the State Programme of Ukraine Armed Forces
Development will remain in my constant and strict control.

From the very bottom of my heart I wish you all happiness, harmony and health, and

new achievements in the noble art of serving Ukrainian people.

President of Ukraine, Supreme Commander in Chief

of the Armed Forces of Ukraine

Victor YUSHCHENKO

##### OPENING ADDRESS
 OF THE DEFENCE MINISTER
 OF UKRAINE

Adhering to the principles of consistency and comprehensiveness of informing the
public of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Ministry of Defence presents the third
annual edition on life, activities and challenges of the Ukrainian military – White Book
_2007 – continuing the tradition in previous editions. For the Ukrainian Armed Forces_
the past year was intensive, full of important and specific activities, with fulfilled and
unfulfilled outcomes. The planned work continued on preparing the Armed Forces to
fulfil the missions according to the Strategic Campaign Plan. The number and quality
of combat training activities increased – field training and live-firing of Land Force
units, total flying-hours of the Air Force and Army Aviation pilots, periods at sea of
Naval ships. During “Artery - 2007” (an Operational Support and Logistic Exercise)
for the first time the system of comprehensive support to the Land Force, Air Force
and Navy activities was deployed. That Exercise brought to the logical completion the
regular annual forces training cycle, that was announced as the “Year of Improving
the Operational and Logistics Support and Supply of the Armed Forces increasing the
level of Fire and Explosive Safety and Security of Bases, Arsenals and Storages”. The
full-scale participation in the anti-terrorist operation “Active Endeavour” started in
2007. Corvettes “Ternopil” and “Lutsk” fulfilled their missions during three-month
periods in the Mediterranean; the frigate “Hetman Sagaydachnyy” will join the
Operation next year. The Defence Ministry established projects to create new systems
of armament and modernizing key ones in operation. The planned professionalization
of the Armed Forces and transition to all-volunteer contract manning continues as
planned. In 2007 the Armed Forces abolished mess-duties for enlisted, conscripted
soldiers received comfortable footwear, and battle-dress uniforms – from enlisted to
generals – was produced from the same quality fabrics.

The role of the Armed Forces in ensuring the internal security of the nation is further

increasing. Ukrainian Service personnel are taking part in liquidation of the after-effects
of natural and man-made emergencies and disasters, providing real assistance to civilian
agencies and the public in general. Considering the social importance of these tasks, the
system of reacting and responding to non-military emergencies was improved, the new
format of civil-military relations was also established.

Thus, further steps in creating a modern military of European standards were made

in 2007. A military that is open to society, adequate to the current threats and challenges,
with clear and understandable missions.


-----

At the same time, ensuring national defence capabilities, beside military, comprise

many political, economic, social and legal aspects. That is why at the certain stage of
military reform the specific, “civilian” issues come to the front: optimizing forms and
mechanisms of Armed Forces financing; modernizing the economic basis of the military
environment; and, introducing effective management methods. Finally, to develop a
clear agenda of transformation that is people-centred – when providing to personnel
designated standards of working and living becomes a strong factor facilitating the
success of reforms.

In the light of such realities, we develop plans for the future and set new tasks for

ourselves.

The work on further optimisation of Defence Ministry and General Staff structures

and the harmonisation of activities will be continued. General Staff will be in charge
of purely military matters, the most important of which is optimising forces strength,
increasing professionalism, and defining modern types of arms and military equipment
for the Armed Forces 2011 Model. The main efforts of the Defence Ministry will be
concentrated on comprehensive support to Armed Forces’ requirements, forces activities
and resolving the block of social-economic problems that accumulated over recent
years.

Society demands the creation of professional Armed Forces within three years.

Today the line of many thousands of personnel expecting housing is one of the major
obstacles to that transition. Resolution of that issue is an unconditional priority of the
Defence Ministry in the short term.

Separate and special attention is paid to the military-patriotic education of the

Nation`s defenders. Our objective – to support the choices of boys and girls beginning
from school-age, to direct and motivate them for professional military service.

The situation in the Armed Forces and its development is the fundamental issue of

the national policy of ensuring the safety in the military sphere. The recently formed
Government will do everything so that each Service individual feels dignity.

Ukrainian society respects its Armed Forces. Both political leaders and personally

the President of Ukraine as Supreme Commander in Chief pay priority attention to the
challenges faced by the military. That is why they provide the Defence Ministry with
the confidence that reforms energetically pursued, would find corresponding support in
the legislative and executive agencies. Through our joint efforts we shall provide the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Nation.

 OF UKRAINE IN 2007

was the second year of implementation of the State Programme of Development of the

### 2007 Armed Forces of Ukraine for 2006-2011 (hereinafter – the State Programme), aimed

at forming a modern and professional armed forces capable to perform missions in defence
of sovereignty and inviolability of Ukraine as well as significantly contribute to international global and
regional security.

Implementation of the tasks set in the State Programme was in accordance with the key documents

that stipulate activities of the Armed Forces – the Strategic Concept of Employment of the Armed Forces
of Ukraine (2006), the Decree of the President of Ukraine “On the Strategy of National Security of Ukraine”
(2007), – together with the experience and perspectives of international military cooperation.

Special attention was paid to the comprehensive support of the Forces, 2007 was named “Year of

Improvement of Operational and Logistic Support of the Armed Forces, Raising the Level of Forces
Security and Explosive and Fire Safety of Arsenals, Bases and Depots”.


IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE STATE
PROGRAMME OF
DEVELOPMENT OF
THE ARMED FORCES


The two years of implementation of the State Programme have resulted in in-depth
systematic changes aimed at achieving a new quality of military service’s introduction
of European standards of military command and control, and creation of modern
armed forces in Ukraine, adapted to new security challenges and ready for designated
missions and participation in international military cooperation.

The bulk of efforts of the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and the General Staff (GS)

were streamlined to professionalization of the Armed Forces, introduction of service
in the military reserve, reaching optimal indices in the organization and strength
of functional structures of the Armed Forces as well as their designated level of
training.

Professionalization
of the Armed Forces

Professionalization of the Armed Forces is a complex process that stipulates,
primarily: contract personnel manning; provision for high-level training of the officer
corps; creation of professional sergeants corps; proper level of forces training and
their equipping with corresponding weapons and equipment; provision of welfare
guarantees to Service personnel and their family.

The following are the main results in the implementation of the State Programme

for the professionalization of the Armed Forces.

**Contract Personnel Manning. Despite the obstacles of insufficient competition**

and the image of professional military service in the national employment market
the plans for contract personnel manning were met in 2006 (94%); and, in 2007
(101.8%).

**Measures taken to raise the favourable image of contract military service:**

the pay of Service personnel in the first contract was increased almost twice as high

in 2007; Service personnel in second and subsequent contracts were entitled to the
possibility of receiving free higher education in higher military education institutions;
free meals during discharge of duties as well as service housing.

A clear indication in the growth of contract military service prestige is the doubling

of the number of university-degree contract Service personnel – from 6.6% (2006)
to 13.4% (2007). In general, 1 in 7 contract Service personnel has either completed
higher education or beyond.

Contract service in the military reserve was introduced: its legal basis was

established; in 2007 an experiment to train more than 1,000 reservists was a success
(Figure 1.1); thus, there is confidence to believe that by 2011 the tasks set in the
State Programme for the manning of the reserve of the Armed Forces will be fully
accomplished.

**Formation of quality Officer Corps. The Armed Forces is undergoing the**

introduction of a personnel management system that would provide for: an individual
approach in personnel policy; maximum reduction of subjectivity in making personnelrelated decisions; and, efficient career management. The Requirements for a Service
Position as well as the Register of Positions that Require Knowledge and Use of
Foreign Languages were adopted. The main element of personnel management is the
evaluation of officers’ performance, measuring their personal level and the level of
readiness of their subordinate units to perform designated missions.

The principle of continuous education of officers during discharge of duties

was introduced. It is being implemented in the system of course training for Tactical,
Operational-Tactical and Operational-Strategic levels; annually, nearly 2,200 officers
increase their education at such courses.

Separate attention is being paid to retaining officers who possess peacekeeping

experience, educated and trained in leading overseas military education institutions,
as well as those officers who have been trained for Operational-Strategic and
Operational-Tactical levels: in 2007, 100% of the graduates of Operational-Strategic
and 90% of graduates of Operational-Tactical levels were appointed to positions that
require the corresponding level of education; the outflow of officers with peacekeeping
experience, overseas training or young officers has been reduced by 45%, compared
to 2006.

The structure of the Officer Corps was improved: the strength of the general

officer corps was stabilized; gradual optimization is also carried out for the ratio
of junior and senior officers; and, all officers were transferred to contract military
service.

Everyday life of the Officer Corps sees the introduction of **military team**

**principles: officer assemblies assumed a more decisive role; the tradition of**
officer ballroom receptions was started; a new moral environment of responsibility,
mutual assistance, adherence to principles of officer honour and dignity is being
established.

**Raising the quality of Forces Training. Since 2006, on the adoption of the**

Strategic Concept of Employment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine combat training
has gained real content. Today it aims to provide for readiness to perform a specific
mission in situations stipulated by that Concept. Combat unit mission statements (up to
regimental level) were developed on the basis of the Strategic Concept. These specify
tasks for combat employment and combat training of units. In 2007 the Principles of
Training and Employment of the Armed Forces were also implemented.

Main attention is paid to training of formations and units designated for combined

task forces, as well as to the intensity of combat training, which in 2007 increased on
average 10-15% (Figure 1.2).

chapter 1


SUMMARY OF DEVELOPMENTOF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE IN 2007

The results of the military exercises conducted in 2007 prove that the readiness

of designated formations and units to perform designated missions is fully supported,
while some issues of organization and provision of comprehensive support of combined
task forces have been developed.

**Welfare guarantees to Service Personnel and their Family. Provision of welfare**

guarantees is an integral component of professionalization of the Armed Forces since
they play a major part in determining the competetive value of professional military
service in the employment market. MOD took certain steps in this direction during
2006-2007.

Since 1 May 2007 the level of pay for different categories of Service personnel

was raised by 25% to 145%; since 1 January 2008, by 12% to 15% (correspondingly,
since 1 January 2008 pensions for retired Service personnel are to be re-calculated,
their value to increase by 38% to 70%, depending on position and rank); the structure
of pay was reorganized - the net weight of basic types of pay has increased 60% to
70% (from 20% in 2003); the negative ratio was cancelled in financial and social
security support of Armed Forces Service personnel compared to other uniformed
services of the State; and, the principles of transparency were introduced and strictly
adhered to in registering and allocating housing.

During 2005-2007, 12,6 thousand apartments were built or acquired for Service

personnel. However, the problem of housing remains the most urgent one, while its
solution requires the combined efforts of central and local administrations.

A system of social and professional adaptation of retired or Service personnel to

be released because of Armed Forces’ downsizing was introduced. In particular, 1,835
Service personnel underwent professional re-training in 2007.

**Logistic Support and provision of Weapons and Equipment are integral**

components to maintaining the proper level of combat readiness. The provision of
the Armed Forces with weapons and equipment was through a priority-based approach
determined by the State Programme of Development of Weapons and Equipment to
2015.

In 2007 actual funding under budget programmes of provision of weapons and

equipment increased almost three-fold compared to previous years, and reached
UAH 682 million. Such an amount of funding is higher than the indices of previous
years but is still insufficient to form a complete and proper Defence Order to meet
the requirements of the Armed Forces.

Being financially restrained MOD and GS focused

their main efforts to maintaining the combat readiness
of available weapons and equipment through their
modernization and prolongation of service life. An
organization and technology basis was created to
modernize and prolong the service life of aircraft:
An-24, An-26, An-30, MiG-29, Su-24, Su-25, Su-27,
L-39, S-300; Buck M1 anti-aircraft missile systems;
and, tanks and light armoured vehicles. The newly
introduced system of state procurement through a
Single Tender Committee prevents the spread of
finances, provides for raising the level of transparency
and control over the procurement process, while
increasing the efficiency of budget spending.

The Armed Forces continuously increase the scope of materials and services

support through wider involvement of the private sector. Such an approach promotes
increases in quality, in particular, for meals and housing support, and cost-efficiencies
in releasing the Armed Forces from non-core functions.

Improvement of Command
and Control System


chapter 1


During 2006-2007 the command and control system of the Armed Forces has come
very close to the standards set by the State Programme. Optimization of the C[2 ]bodies
was based on functional survey results and taking account of leading European and
NATO armed forces standards. The following has been achieved in this sphere.

**Functions and powers were legally regulated and distributed between MOD**

**and GS. The structure of the GS is attaining the HQ standards of NATO Member-**
States’ armed forces; and proportional representation of Services in the GS command
has been introduced.

Transition from a multi-level operational control system to a more optimal tri
level system was made: GS – Joint Operational Command (JOC) – Army Corps,
Air Command, Naval Operations Centre, and Coastal Defence Centre. Creating the
JOC enabled the regulation of C[2] system for peacekeeping contingents and Armed
Forces personnel; from 2008 it is to assume C[2] functions over the employment of
all combined task forces of the Armed Forces both in Ukraine and overseas. JOC
readiness to perform such missions was reaffirmed in practice during command-post
training in September 2007 and Command-Post Exercise Artery-2007.

Command and control bodies of the Army Corps

were transferred to a new organic structure, similar to
NATO standards; the optimization of organizational
structures in large units and units is nearing
completion.

**Creation of Territorial Directorates is also**

nearing completion – these new C[2] bodies will fulfil
missions to organize territorial defence, mobilization
readiness and Reserves training.

Creation of the **Single Automated Command**

**and Control System of the Armed Forces is also**
underway. Since 2006 its framework is used to develop
the Single Administrative and Economic Processes
Control System, the full adoption of which will provide
for a qualitatively higher level in planning day-today activities of the Armed Forces, accounting and

maximum cost-efficiency while enabling real-time decision-making at all levels of
command and control.

Optimization of Organization
and Strength of the Armed Forces

Improvement of the Armed Forces organization was according to the force and means
requirements to fulfil missions designated in the Strategic Concept and stipulated by
Ukraine’s participation in international military cooperation and support of global
and regional security.

During 2006-2007 reasonable ratios between the Services as well as between

combat and support units were achieved. 2007 saw the beginning of the creation of
**a separate Armed Service – Special Operations Forces, and a new C[2] body – the**
Special Operations Forces Command: in particular, main missions of the Command
were set as well as determining its status and organization; Special Operations
Forces will be equipped with state-of-the-art weapons and equipment with training
focussing on skills to act in unfamiliar environments under harsh counter-intelligence
conditions.


-----

chapter 1


SUMMARY OF DEVELOPMENTOF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE IN 2007

The strength of the Armed Forces was reduced according to the numbers determined

by the State Programme and corresponding laws of Ukraine. At the end of 2007 it was
200 thousand personnel including 152 thousand Service personnel.

Release of the Armed Forces
from Non-Core Functions

During 2006-2007 MOD, GS and the Armed Forces were significantly released
from non-core functions enabling them to focus on performing core missions,
largely increasing cost-efficiencies, reducing surplus support system elements
through, in particular, introducing outsourcing mechanisms – delegating some
functions of service supplies provision to civilian bodies, including private sector
ones.

Thus, in order to release the MOD from the tasks of

selling surplus military equipment a State Department
for Surplus Equipment and Lands was created in 2006 –
with a governmental body assigned to that task.

Army Corps were released from the tasks of reducing

large units which are not to be in the structure of the
Armed Forces in 2011, through assigning such missions
to operational commands and territorial commands;
units were released from functions to account and store
surplus movable equipment by creating the Centre
of Accounting of Surplus and Written-Off Military
Equipment of the Armed Forces.

2007 resulted in completing the transfer for

providing meals in the Armed Forces to commercial
organizations; the principle of outsourcing is used for
78% of POLs; transition began to maintain cantonments

by commercial organizations while security of military facilities (excluding weapons
and ammunition stores) will be provided by corresponding structures of the State
Guard Service under the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The main tasks of the State
Programme of Development of the Armed Forces for 2006-2011 and the level of their
accomplishment at the end of 2007 are shown in Table 1.1.

Vocational Safety of Military
Service and Military Activities

An absolute priority for the MOD and GS is preserving life and health
of personnel, providing a safe working environment, detecting and eliminating
pre-conditions for crime, complying with law and order, respecting every service
individual – his or her dignity, rights and freedoms. After 2006-2007 the following
has resulted.

A new system of prevention and detection of crimes was implemented under

which Commanders are interested in detection and not concealment of crimes – this
measure resulted in an increase in certain statistics but facilitated the real eradication
of crimes and the creation of the conditions for their prevention; the procedure was


**Table 1.2. Losses of personnel of the Armed Forces during discharge**
of duties


introduced for the daily monitoring of compliance with
the Disciplinary Statute; and, military law enforcement
bodies work in close coordination with other law
enforcement agencies.

The level of personnel losses during discharge

of duties was significantly reduced. Thus, the ratio
of personnel losses to 1,000 Service personnel was
reduced from 0.21 (2005) to 0.13 (2007) (Table 1.2).

At the same time the number of losses from traffic accidents increased, which prevented
the achievement of the overall reduction losses indices: both in 2005 and 2007 –
it is 0.6.

**Level of survivability of arsenals, bases and depots has been improved. Close**

teamwork with local administrations was set up and mechanisms of joint reaction to
emergencies were developed; technical equipment at storage facilities is gradually
improving; implementing plans for disposal of surplus stores resulted in downsizing
these facilities. An achievement in 2007 was the first year without explosions at
munitions stores.

**New medical support system was introduced.** In 2006 a Programme

of Medical Support of the Armed Forces for 2006-2011 was developed and introduced.

It provides for creating a network of medical
installations, united by a centralized command.

According to the Programme five regional military

medical clinic centres were created under the territorial
principle. In 2007 they were provided with modern
medical equipment and necessary medicines.

The above centres include five military mobile

hospitals. Their readiness to perform missions is
proved not only by exercises but also in participation
in natural and man-made disaster relief operations
and the provision of real medical aid to civilian
populations.

The level of manning of the medical service,

military medics’ theoretical awareness and practical
skills and the provision of equipment enables it to fully
perform its designated missions.

New Format of Civil-Military
Relations

Ukraine’s Armed Forces continuously attains features of openness and
transparency in its activities, and control by society. Thus since 2005 _The White_
_Book is published annually; MOD organized the Public Council; the circulation_
of military periodicals has significantly increased, and the level and content of
public information on day-to-day life and challenges of the Armed Forces have
improved.

Service personnel provide more and more assistance to civilian agencies and local

administrations in natural and man-made disaster relief operations. As a rule, these
events involve deployment of military medical services to provide local populations
with medical aid, conduct medical inspections and treatment, including surgeries if
necessary.

In particular, in 2007 the Armed Forces including medical services took part in

relief operations after nine major natural disasters and man-made catastrophes in
various regions of Ukraine. Due to the experience gained and social significance of
such activities the tasks of disaster relief are included in unit mission statements and
taken into account in forces training.

FUNDING
THE ARMED FORCES


The main challenge in implementing the State Programme of Development of the
Armed Forces is resource limitations: imbalances in the amount of funding, stipulated
in the Programme itself, according to the indices approved by the laws on the State
Budget, to that actually received.

Thus, the approval, by the Law of Ukraine, of expenditure for 2007 of

UAH **9.13 billion** rather than UAH **10.3 billion** stipulated by the State
Programme made it impossible to fully implement measures determined in the
Programme (Annex 1).

Limited resource support had a negative effect in executing nearly all main measures

stipulated by the State Programme, namely it:

  - prevented full implementation of planned forces combat training plans;

  - slowed down the process of adoption of the Armed Forces Single Automated

Command and Control System as well as stationary and mobile digital integrated
communications networks;

  - made it impossible to gradually substitute certain items of weapons through

procurement of new and modernization of items in planned amounts, refreshing
of emergency rations, implementing disposal plans, reforming arsenals, bases
and depots where surplus and out-of-service weapons and equipment are
stored;

  - reduced the pace of transfer of housing, clothing and other types of support to

civilian organisations;

  - slowed down contract manning of the Armed Forces through low competitiveness

of professional military service in the national employment market.

Total amount of funding that had not been allocated to the State Programme of

Development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2006-2007 is more than UAH 4 billion.
If such a trend continues, the Armed Forces may fail to receive nearly UAH 10.5 billion
or 14.2% of the UAH 73.4 billion stipulated by the Programme.[1]

The issue of full and timely funding of the measures under the State Programme

of Development of the Armed Forces remained a priority in MOD consultations
with the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economics and the Committee of the
Verkhovna Rada for National Security and Defence. This resulted in a reduction
of the portion in the MOD Special Fund of expenditure from the State Budget
of Ukraine from **22.3% (2006) to 15.8% (2007) - thus reducing the dependence**
of implementing the State Programme of Development of the Armed Forces on
economic activity.

**In general, during 2006-2007 the measures stipulated in the State Programme**

**of Development of the Armed Forces were mainly fulfilled. The amount of**
**fulfilment affirms that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are approaching the standards**
**set for 2011. Combat organization of the forces, their level of combat readiness**

### Das the urgent need to raise the level of operational and logistic support of the Armed Forces 2007 was

named the “Year of Improvement of Operational and Logistic Support of the Armed Forces, Raising the
Level of Forces Safety and Explosive and Fire Safety of Arsenals, Bases and Depots”.

The main areas of reform of the comprehensive support system during the year have been the following:

changing the structures of operational and logistic support; providing the Armed Forces with weapons
and equipment; disposal of surplus weapons, equipment and ammunition; provision of survivability of
depots of weapon, ammunition and materiel; improvement of medical support; prevention of traumatism
in the Armed Forces; release of the Armed Forces from non-core functions.

A summary of fulfilment of the scheduled tasks proves that positive results have been achieved in

almost all areas of development of the comprehensive support system, and new qualitative and quantitative
indices have been reached.


CHANGES IN
STRUCTURES OF
OPERATIONAL AND
LOGISTIC SUPPORT


Since 2005 the Armed Forces have been forming a new, modern model of
comprehensive support that has two components (subsystems) – operational and
logistic support (Figure 2.1). The goal of changes in these subsystems is raising their
flexibility and versatility to correspond to modern force requirements and NATO
standards.

Structural changes in the logistic support were adopted within the framework of

the agreed directions of reform of the subsystem (Annex 2). The following measures
were taken during the year to improve the structures of operational and logistic
support:

  - structure of arsenals, bases and depots as well as the register of military support

units that will remain in the Armed Forces 2011 were determined;

  - arsenals, bases and depots that are not included in the combat organization of

the Armed Forces 2011 were transferred to operational commands for their
further disbandment (during 2006-2011 disbandment will total 72 military
units and operational and logistic support facilities);

  - creation of joint logistic support centres continues; the centres will be assigned

the missions to support formations and units by territorial principle regardless
of subordination; due to the peculiarities of the formations in the territory of
Ukraine it is planned to create six joint supply centres – in Kyiv, Vynnitsya,
Lviv, Odesa, Simferopol, and Kharkiv.

Improvement of the operational support subsystem aimed at providing better equipment for special services, renewal of

special military equipment, improvement of training and readiness of the personnel to perform designated missions, release
from surplus infrastructure as well as creation of favourable conditions for better inter-service interoperability and coordination
of actions.

**Logistic support is a system of measures of command and control bodies and special services in all types of operations**

(combat) and day-to-day activities of the Armed Forces, conducted in order to provide their forces with equipment, ammunition,
raising the efficiency and reliability of vehicles, its rapid renewal (repairs) after damages, meeting material, transportation, welfare
and other needs of the forces thus maintaining their readiness to perform their designated combat or day-to-day missions.

Command-Post Exercise _Artery-2007 became the conclusive measure to_

check forces combat readiness and capabilities of operational and logistic support
structures.

The number of forces involved in Command-Post Exercise _Artery-2007 was_

three times as large as Command-Post Exercise Clear Sky-2006. During the Exercise
theoretical provisions of the new principles of training and employment of the
Armed Forces were tested in practice – primarily, in employment and comprehensive
support of combined task forces, current status, capabilities and level of training of
JRRF units, operational and logistic support units were checked, together with their
capability to comprehensively perform designated missions.

During Artery-2007 certain measures of operational and logistic support were

determined for the first time in the Armed Forces.

Practical training tasks were fully accomplished. The command staff and

subordinate personnel acquired practical skills in decision-making and planning of
combat and interoperability with other Armed Services of the Armed Forces. All units
were positively evaluated after live firing, missile launches, exercises and training
(Figure 2.2).

1 In a broad sense the notion of logistics embraces all aspects of combat and day-to-day support of the troops: development, acquisition, supply, storing,
transportation, evacuation and disposal of weapons, ammunition and materiel; transportation of personnel; acquisition, construction, exploitation, repairing
and disposal of military facilities; procurement or provision of services; medical and sanitary support.

PROVISION OF
WEAPONS AND
EQUIPMENT


Provision of the Armed Forces with weapons and equipment is an inherent component
of military-technical policy of the State to maintain a sufficient level of forces combat
readiness.

In 2007 actual funding under budget programmes of re-equipping, as compared

to previous years, increased three times and reached UAH 682 million. Such an
amount exceeds the funding indices of previous years, but is still insufficient to
form a full Defence Order that would correspond to the requirements of the Armed
Forces.

Provision of the Armed Forces with weapons and equipment was implemented

on a priority-based approach, determined in the State Programme of Development of
Weapons and Equipment to 2015, namely:

  - Design of corvette-type combat vessel;

  - Development of a multi-functional missile system;

  - Creation and procurement of state-of-the-art high-precision weapons;

  - Research of modernization of combat aircraft and helicopters;

  - Prolongation of service life of missiles and artillery, aerial weapons, mines and

torpedoes;

  - Acquisition of new and modernized weapons and equipment developed by the

defence industry of Ukraine and adopted by the Armed Forces – in particular,
radars for air defence troops;

  - Acquisition of digital communication means.

Main measures of provision of the Armed Forces with weapons and equipment in

2007 are indicated in Annex 3.

During the year the Armed Forces adopted 24 new weapons and equipment.

They were developed according to international and NATO standards – in order to
provide for compatibility with weapons and equipment of Partner-States’ armed
forces.

The Armed Forces acquired more than 15 thousand weapon and equipment items.

The service life was prolonged of 39 weapons and equipment. Creation of new as
well as the modernization and prolongation of the service life of available weapons
and equipment continues.

30 weapons and equipment are in the phase of design, research manufacture

and preliminary testing. The State testing of An-70 military transportation
aircraft continues. Prepared for State testing are: an air-to-air missile; highprecision artillery munitions; a man-portable air defence system; a dynamic

armour protection system; a high-precision air bomb;
a 30-mm gun; BTR-70Di APC; BRDM-2Di armoured
reconnaissance vehicle; BMP-1 IFV with _Shturm_
combat module; an armoured repair and evacuation
vehicle on T-84 chassis; and, a single-module active
protection for armour.

**In 2007 re-equipping the Armed Forces was**

**complicated by the lack of financial resources.**
**Under such circumstances acquisition of new**
**weapons and equipment in sufficient amounts was**
**impossible. Thus the main efforts of MOD and GS**
**in 2007 were concentrated on maintaining combat**
**readiness of weapons and equipment through their**
**modernization and prolonging service life.**

DISPOSAL OF
SURPLUS AND
OUT-OF-SERVICE
EQUIPMENT AND
MATERIEL


Disposal of surplus and out-of-service stores of weapons, equipment, ammunition
and materiel is an important component of the measures to prevent the risks of their
uncontrolled dissemination and safety to the people and the environment.

Currently the Armed Forces possess more than 16 thousand tonnes of

components of liquid propellants (melange) and nearly 760 thousand tonnes of
surplus ammunition, of which 480 thousand tonnes have expired their storage terms
and must be disposed.

During the year 18.5 thousand tonnes of ammunition were withdrawn from

arsenals, bases and depots, with 15.6 thousand tonnes disposed. The withdrawn
ammunition was transferred to the Ministry of Industrial Policy and the National
Space Agency of Ukraine who presented the State Order for the disposal[2].

Disposal of surplus ammunition is funded mainly from the State Budget. The

allocated funding provided for 15 contracts to be signed to dispose of 22 thousand
tonnes of ammunition.

The total ammunition disposed during 1999-2007 is given in Table 2.1.

Available Ukrainian industrial capacity allows disposal of 140 thousand tonnes

of missiles and ammunition annually, although the technological basis is limited to
certain types only (Annex 2).

Due to the absence of technology in Ukraine to dispose of ammunition containing

specific explosives as well as illuminating and smoke ammunition, naval and air
ammunition, MOD is interested in widening foreign technical aid and investments to
develop such technology.

In 2007 assistance in disposing was provided by international organizations,

primarily by NATO, EU and OSCE as well as individual countries. Thus, in the
framework of the project to destroy surplus ammunition, small arms and light
weapons, more than 108 thousand pieces of small arms were disposed[3].

In addition, under the initiative of MOD together with the Ministry of Foreign

Affairs and the Office of OSCE Project Coordinator a project was prepared to dispose
of surplus components of liquid propellant during two or three years in Ukraine.
Currently, the corresponding documents are for consideration by the Cabinet of
Ministers and the preparation for an open international tender is underway. Both
national and international enterprises and joint ventures plan to participate in the
tender and, in particular, a Ukrainian-Polish Consortium “Eco Technologies”
(Kyiv).

PROVISION OF
SURVIVABILITY,
EXPLOSIVE AND FIRE
SAFETY OF ARSENALS,
BASES AND DEPOTS


While a large number of arsenals, bases and depots are overloaded with surplus
weapons, missiles and ammunition, the provision of survivability of these facilities
proves to be an extremely complex task and requires a systematic approach as
determined in the Programme of Provision of Survivability and Explosion and Fire
Safety of Arsenals, Bases and Depots of Weapons, Missiles and Ammunition of the
Armed Forces of Ukraine for 1995-2015.[4]

The main focus of the Programme is achieving sufficient level of survivability,

explosive and fire safety as well as reliability of function, ecologic and human security
of arsenals, bases and depots of weapons, missiles and ammunition.

During 1999-2004 the funding of the Programme

was not full (44% of plan on average). Beginning from
2005 the situation improved (80% of plan); however
the funding remains insufficient (Figure 2.3).

During the year efforts were concentrated on such

tasks as:

- raising the level of protection of stocks of weapons,

missiles and ammunition (equipping warehouses with
technical facilities and perimeter security means,
installation of fire alarms and automatic fire extinguisher
systems, and construction of fire protection facilities);

- continuing construction of shelters for weapons,

missiles and ammunition (fallouts of warehouses,
construction of new shelters);

- reconstructing and developing infrastructure

(constructing and repairing road network, railways,


heating and water supply routes);

                 - creating a control system for quality and technical condition of weapons, missiles

and ammunition (capital construction and laboratory
equipment).

**Improvement of funding of the Programme of**

**possibility to significantly increase in 2005-2007 the**
**level of survivability of arsenals, bases and depots of**
**the Armed Forces, together with the level of storage**
**security for weapons, missiles and ammunition.**
**At the same time, the accumulated amount of problems**
**requires both an increase of funding and coordination**
**of implementation of the Programme with the plans**
**for disposal and reduction of the infrastructure of the**
**Armed Forces.**

DEVELOPMENT OF
MEDICAL SUPPORT
SYSTEM


Nearly 1.2 million people are entitled to medical support by the Armed Forces,
including almost 326 thousand Reserve and retired Service personnel, who are entitled
to free of charge medical treatment in MOD military medical institutions.

Under the Programme of Development of Armed Forces Medical Support System

for 2006-2011 a network of military medical institutions was created according to
the territorial principle: the Main Military Medical Clinic Centre (Kyiv) and five
regional military medical clinical centres that are command and control bodies
for the medical service, and are responsible for territorial zones of responsibility,
(Figure 2.4, Annex 2), with corresponding military medical institutions subordinate
to the centres.

In 2007 the reform was completed of military recreation centres into centres of

medical rehabilitation and recreation treatment. This resulted in creating specialized
departments according to clinical profiles and climate and natural treatment
factors – for treatment, medical rehabilitation and recreation of Service and retired
personnel.


**Figure 2.4. Medical Support of the Armed Forces according to territorial principle**


During 2007 military treatment institutions provided inpatient care to 37 thousand MOD pensioners; more than 403
thousand out-patient addresses were registered.


Daily 4 - 4.5 thousand patients, including 2.5 - 3 thousand
Service personnel receive in-patient care in military hospitals
and medical bodies of military units.

Under the reform in Armed Forces medical support special attention was paid to

creating military mobile hospitals within regional military medical clinic centres.
They are supplied with corresponding equipment and are ready to provide medical
aid at short notice, in particular, victims of natural and man-made disasters or a
terrorist act. In 2007 military mobile hospitals took part in medical support of
_Artery-2007 Exercise as well as Exercises for explosion and fire safety at artillery_
bases and depots.

**The medical support system performs its functions, embracing not only Service**

**personnel, but also MOD pensioners and the civilian population. Reforming the**
**medical service enables it to increase its effectiveness.**

Prevention of Traumatism and Losses
in the Armed Forces

Prevention of accidents, adherence to norms and rules of military activities
are the main areas for preventing traumatism and losses of Armed Forces
personnel.

In 2007, 16 main events took place aimed at preserving life and health of

personnel, including training seminars with State labour control bodies’ employees
and management of vocation security services of the Armed Forces; and, training of
command and engineer personnel of the Armed Forces. 570 units and 920 technical
facilities were inspected and a week of vocational security to commemorate the
Global Vocational Security Day was held.

Measures taken by the MOD leadership facilitates continuous reduction of

traumatism of service and civilian personnel discharging their duties. In 2005-2007
the number of losses was reduced (Figure 2.5). However, if solutions to a range of
social problems in 2005-2006 resulted in the reduction of the number of suicides by
half compared to 2002-2003; the number of losses after traffic accidents continues
to increase.

**During recent years due to the efficiency of measures in vocational security**

**and state control over vocational security as well as exploitation of higher risk**
**facilities the number of injuries and losses of personnel of the Armed Forces**
**continues to reduce. At the same time, prevention of losses of the Armed Forces’**
**personnel remains one of the priority missions of the MOD, GS, and commanders**
**at all levels.**

RELEASE OF THE
ARMED FORCES
FROM NON-CORE
FUNCTIONS


Abuse Of Personel Suicide Traffic accidents Other accidents

One of the priority missions of MOD and GS in 2007 was introducting new approaches
to the provision of materiel and services on a commercial basis.

By the end of the year the provision of meals for all Armed Forces Service

personnel with the right to free meals was by small and medium-sized businesses.
This releases military personnel from a range of administrative works and duties
in messing facilities, enabling commanders to concentrate on combat training of
personnel and reducing vehicle resources and fuel consumption for foodstuffs
delivery.

In order to maintain housing in the cantonments, the _Ukrspetsnaladka MOD_

State Enterprise was created with branches in the cantonments of Makariv,
Novograd-Volynsky, Feodosia, and Yavoriv. This practice will be expanded to other
cantonments.

Transition was made to transfer military facilities (excluding weapons and

ammunition stores) to the security of bodies of the State Guard Service of the
Ministry of Internal Affairs and commercial firms, which may lead to reducing the
Armed Forces strength involved in performing these functions, and thus reducing
maintenance expenses.

At the same time the involvement of various types of organizations in the support

of the Armed Forces requires improving the organization and procedures of acquisition
of goods, works and services.

For this purpose MOD created a Single Tender Committee in June 2007, in

accordance with the Law “On acquisition of goods, works and services for public
funds” and on the basis of a decision taken by the MOD Board. This enables

better transparency and strict adherence to economic and legal principles of
acquisition, rational spending of public funds, increase the control at all stages of
acquisition, and concentration of information of centralized procurement in a single
body.

**MOD and GS bring active efforts to release the Armed Forces from non-core**

**functions. At the end of 2007, these activities mainly embraced meals provision,**
**housing and military facilities’ security. This provides for significant savings**
**of human, material and financial resources. MOD takes measures to involve**
**commerce in the provision of services to the Armed Forces.**


**The system of operational and logistic support of the Armed Forces fulfils**

**the functions of maintaining the forces ready for efficient performance of**
**designated missions. The lack of budget funding is somewhat compensated by**
**skilful planning and organizational measures.**

**Command-Post Exercise** **_Artery-2007 proved that the Armed Forces’_**

**operational and logistic support system is combat-capable, and its structures can**
**organize and provide comprehensive support of forces during their operational**
**deployment and employment. In future it is planned to complete transition to a**
**new supply system of forces according to the territorial principle that would be**
**best adapted to modern requirements of the market economy and fully meets the**
**requirements of the Armed Forces.**

**The practice proved that the areas of improvement and development of**

**operational and logistic support system correspond with the modern requirements**

During this year the main attention was on the systematic transition of the command and control

system to a three-level structure, balancing processes of structural improvement and reducing the Armed
Forces with priority development to functional structures, first being the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces
(JRRF). There was also a decision to create a new functional structure, namely the Special Operation
Forces.


IMPROVEMENT OF
COMMAND AND
CONTROL SYSTEM


The basis of command and control of the Armed Forces 2009 will be the re-organized
system of command and control elements with a distinct three-level distribution
of functions: GS – Joint Operational Command – Army Corps, Air Command (in
perspective – Control and Warning Centre), Naval Operations Centre, Coastal Defence
Troops Centre (figure 3.1).

Strategic Command and Control


Results from the 2007 Functional Review of structural units of MOD Central Office,
GS and other command and control bodies permitted:

  - more clearly defined objectives, organization and structure of MOD, GS and


other command and control bodies;

- specifying the distribution of powers between MOD and GS



               - re-distributing functions between MOD structural units and GS.

The analysis of GS functions and respective command and control lines of the

Armed Forces proved that it is necessary to establish in the GS structure the Main
Finance and Economy Directorate in order to ensure fulfilment of its missions.

MOD and GS structures in 2007 are shown in Annex 4.

During the year the principle of proportional representation of Services

was consolidated in appointing GS command personnel. Naval Forces Flag
officers were assigned to positions of Deputy Chief of the General Staff (MajorGeneral V.O. Ageev) and Chief of Main Operational Directorate (Rear Admiral
S.V. Kabanenko).

The establishment of the Single Automated Command and Control System was

continued. The gradual transfer of communication and automation system to digital
transmission and processing of information, automation of command and control
processes took place in the framework of this system.

Currently 20% of signal centres of command and control bodies are connected to

the Armed Forces digital integrated communications network through implementing
modern digital technologies.

Creation of the single administrative and economic processes control system of the

Armed Forces was launched in the MOD Central Office. This system is to become a
component of the Single Automated Command and Control System. Its pilot project is
currently in use, encompassing five spheres of activities (Figure 3.2) and all command
and control levels – from MOD to military units. Testing of the first line of the system
started in December 2007.

chapter 3


In 2007 the creation of a comprehensive system of strategic planning was being

continued in the framework of improvement of MOD command and control processes.
With the purpose of bringing the content of planning in accordance with current
conditions of development of the Armed Forces, legislative and legal provisions of
strategic planning were developed, long-term, mid-term and short-term documents came
into effect, and the respective chain of command and control bodies were created.

Next steps in improving the planning system will be the combination of strategic

planning processes of the Armed Forces’ employment in a single cycle, as well as their
development and budget planning (Figure 3.3).

Requirements of the Strategic Concept of the Armed Forces’ employment, previously

balanced with defence resources, are the starting data for two planning processes: in
GS – strategic employment of the Armed Forces and obtaining the possibilities to carry
out all designated missions; in MOD – formation (specification) of the State Programme
of Development of the Armed Forces, aimed at the provision of these possibilities.

The final result is achievement of necessary capabilities of the Armed Forces under

any scenario of their employment, as well as distribution of available resources to
provide for day-to-day activities and development of the Armed Forces.

**The above mentioned activities enable balancing the structures of MOD and GS,**

Operational and Operational-Tactical Command and Control

In 2007 improvement of command and control bodies at Operational and OperationalTactical levels was aimed at the centralization and quality improvement of command
and control and thus raising formations’ and units’ combat effectiveness.

Activities involved:

               - optimizing functions and organization of command and control bodies;

               - specifying provisions on Operational Commands, Air Commands, Territorial

Directorates to independent assigned functions and objectives’ performance;

             - reorganizing Army Corps’ command and control bodies to a uniformed

organizational structure.

_Land Force Command has initiated the establishment of the West and South territorial_

directorates, with the following major functions: organization of territorial defence,
accounting and generating mobilization resources, as well as disbandment of military
units that are not part of the future organization of the Armed Forces.

_Air Force Command has defined the structure of the Command, Control And Warning_

Centres (CCAC), responsible for the operational command and control of the Forces and
coordination with the Joint Operational Command. The automated command and control
system of the aviation and air defence of the Armed Forces continued to develop,
together with their adaptation to corresponding NATO standards.

_Naval Force Command concentrated its main efforts to improving the military_

command and control structure, enhancing its alert capabilities and quality of function,
restoring stationary command posts’ combat effectiveness and modernizing mobile
command posts’ equipment, providing command-post vehicles with state-of-the-art
systems and automation means. It has completed the establishment of the Coastal
Defence Troops Centre and Maritime Operations Centre (on the basis of a mixed-type
squadron), responsible for operational command and control of forces and coordination
with the Joint Operational Command.

Naval Force Command operational staff’s work-stations were equipped with

modern means of communications and automation on protected command posts, mobile
command post of the Coastal Defence Troops Centre, an onboard command-post of the
Maritime Operations Centre, on Donbas command ship.

_Joint Operational Command has completed the establishment of the Peacekeeping_

Operations Centre, deployed the communications and information support system while
measures to hand over the command and control functions of peacekeeping contingents to the
Command were finalized.After military exercises and planning of tasks forces’operations and
their command and control in 2007, there were specified functions and interoperability issues
of the Joint Operational Command and the Armed Services Commands.

The organization structure of Joint Operational Command at the end of 2007 is

shown in Annex 4.

The regulations concerning functions and organization structure of Operational and

_Air Command have been specified. An important mission for operational commands was to_
increase survivability and explosive and fire safety of arsenals, bases and depots.

The Territorial Directorate has worked out new regulatory provisions and specified

its main functions and missions on mobilization control as well as organization
and establishment of the territorial defence and coordination with central and local
administrations.

**The improvement of the command and control bodies of the Forces at**

**the Operational and Operational-Tactical level is aimed at their structural**
**transformation, increasing efficiency and bringing the command and control system**
**to NATO standards. Changes in the command and control bodies were implemented**

During 2007, JOC conducted operational planning for combined task forces

employment in crisis situations, and executed direct command and control over these
forces, as well as the means, designated to participate in counter-terrorism operations
and disaster, accident and man-made relief operations.

The structural bodies of JOC and their function are fully compatible and interoperable

with NATO staffs.

**The transfer of command and control over peacekeeping contingents of the**

**Armed Forces to the three-level system and assurance of their full compatibility**
**with NATO standards contributes to increasing capabilities and efficiency of the**
**command and control system and peacekeeping contingents’ deployment.**

In 2007, structural optimization of the Armed Forces was organized according to
the missions stated in the Strategic Concept of Employment of the Armed Forces,
taking into account the requirements in resources required for their fulfilment. The
overall structure of the Armed Forces underwent no major changes.

The main attention of MOD and GS was paid to the structural optimization of

command and control bodies, military units and raising JRRF combat effectiveness, in
particular, its main component – the Immediate Reaction Forces.

The structure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2007 is shown in Annex 4.

In order to create favourable conditions for the successful accomplishment of special

activities aimed at prevention and resolution of armed conflicts, and support of the
combined task forces in the operations of the Armed Forces and its counter-terrorism
activities. Establishment of the Special Operations Forces and a new command and
control body – Special Operation Forces Command (SOFC) was initiated in 2007. The
status and structure of these forces and the major missions of SOFC in time of peace
and during crises has been determined.

Reduction of the Armed Forces was conducted according to the indices determined

by the Law of Ukraine “On the numerical strength of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for
2007”. The reduction totalled 21,000 personnel, including 13,000 Service personnel.
At the end of 2007, the total strength of the Armed Forces was 200,000 personnel,
including 152,000 Service personnel. The changes of the Armed Forces’ strength are
shown in Annex 6.

One of the major objectives of the organizational

activities was to initiate the gradual transfer of the
forces to the structure, and mastering the organizational
procedures and implementation, similar to the standards
of NATO Member-States’ Armed Forces.

In 2007, an airmobile brigade with an assigned army

aviation regiment was created in the Land Force to meet
this objective. Immediate command and control over the
brigade is executed by the Land Force Command. Two
Territorial Directorates were created in the structure of
the operational commands. A typical structure of the
Army Corps, taking account of NATO standards and
procedures in the organization of employment was
introduced. The command and control bodies of one
airmobile brigade, two mechanized brigades, an army

aviation regiment and an engineer corps regiment assumed the J-structure.

The structure of Land Force at the end of 2007 is shown in Annex 4.

The Air Force implemented the following:

               - one attack aviation brigade, five fighter aviation brigades and one bomber and

reconnaissance aviation brigade were transformed into the aviation brigades
of tactical aviation;

               - transportation aviation brigades were transformed;

               - one anti-aircraft artillery regiment was re-deployed;

              - education and training centre of the Kharkiv Air Forces’ University was

disbanded, while the Scientific Centre of the Kharkiv Air Forces’ University
is about to be created on the basis of the Joint Research and Development
Institute of the Armed Forces;

             - transformation of the Air Commands into Command, Control and Warning

Centres (CCWC) is still in progress.

The structure of the Air Force at the end of 2007 is shown in Annex 4.

The _Naval Force conducted activities, aimed at the structural improvement_

of command and control bodies. The centralization process of the Directorate of
Logistics according to the territorial principle is in progress. The establishment of the
Naval Logistics Centre has been initiated.

The structure of the Naval Force at the end of 2007 is shown in Annex 4.

orces training to fulfil designated missions remains an unconditional priority of Armed Forces’ activity.

### FThe level of training is the index of combat effectiveness of the Forces, and a key component of

public confidence in the Armed Forces, as well as Ukraine’s authority in the sphere of international
security.

In 2007 improvement of the level of training of command and control bodies, military units, military

education institutions and organizations was conducted with reference to their future development, and
enrichment of the content of combat and operational training with specific tasks designated in the related
mission statements taken into consideration.

The main efforts and resources were aimed at achieving planned augmentation of the Joint Rapid

Reaction Forces’ combat effectiveness, learning by the forces of methods and techniques to fulfil the
tasks designated in the Principles of Training and Employment of the Armed Forces, and to enable
comprehensive support to joint operations.

Possibilities of international military cooperation have been widely used to enhance the level of Armed

Forces combat effectiveness.


FORCES TRAINING
SYSTEM: GENERAL
APPROACHES AND
CHALLENGES


During 2005-2007 approaches to combat training of the Forces have experienced
crucial changes in its organization, content and character, evaluation criteria of
military formations and units readiness to perform designated missions.

From an organizational point of view training of Forces was structured so that

there was a certain set of military formations and units ready to fulfill designated
tasks at all times. For this purpose training of Forces is conducted in the framework
of two training cycles equal in time, but different in timing and coordinated with
periods of drafting and retirement from military service (the first cycle is October December and the second April - June).

**Content and character of the training was brought in line with tasks designated**

in the Strategic Concept of Employment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. For this
goal in 2006-2007 the Principles of Training and Employment of the Armed Forces of
Ukraine have been developed and adopted based on the Strategic Concept. It provided
combat traning with real content and aimed at specific results.

Specialized training for different military personnel categories: peacekeeping

units and Missions personnel; contract Service personnel (sergeants’ training);
Reserve Service personnel (training started in 2007); and conscript Service
personnel.

To focus the activity of commanders and all military personnel on combat training

a number of measures was initiated to release them from non-core functions (meals
provision, maintenance and guarding cantonments). To increase combat training
effectiveness, opportunities of Ukraine’s participation in international exercises,
peacekeeping missions and international programmes, namely, Partnership for
Peace, International Military Education and Training, as well as capabilities of
Individual Partnership Programme between Ukraine and NATO have been widely
used.

At the same time the lack of funding is still the main challenge to adequate

Forces training. During 2005-2007 the element of funds received for training
purposes has been gradually decreased compared to the planned indices (Figure
4.1). A certain increase in financing in absolute numbers did not compensate a
rise in the cost of material resources required for the Armed Forces. First of all,
it concerns POLs necessary for conducting exercises with the use of weapons and
equipment.

Thus, in 2007 first of all, the main efforts in combat training of Forces were

focused on qualitative training of military units of the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces


**Table 4.1.Financing of Armed Forces Training (in UAH mln)**


(JRRF), formations designated for participation in an
experiment with contract manning, skills and readiness
for tasks of Air Defence Stand-by Forces and Immediate
Reaction Forces.

Besides, a package of measures was initiated with

the aim of development of the material and technical
basis of Armed Forces training. It will permit

qualitative indices up to the level that will enable the Forces to conduct full scale
training according to modern standards. Namely, the following measures have been
introduced:

  - up-to-date training equipment, laser firing simulators, studying and training

equipment based on computer technologies (Annex 5);

  - a priority task has been accomplished to optimize the system of exercise/

training ranges (to decrease the number of Army training ranges).
A specialized training centre of the Land Force was founded at Zhitomir
Combined Arms Training Range; an international centre for peacekeeping
and security started to function at Yavoriv Combined Arms Training
Range.

In 2007 Armed Forces training was carried out with measures envisaged

with plans of Forces training in mind, and in compliance with the division of
command and control bodies and military units according to their functional
structure.

A substantial share in this field of military activities was effected in 2007. For the

first time, the following activities were conducted in the Armed Forces:

  - computer training with Forces and training for search and rescue support;

  - bilateral tactical and command and staff training of Land Force and Air

Force;

  - brigade computer training with a mechanized brigade from 8 [th] Army

Corps;

  - Command-Post Exercese of airmobile and Army aviation units with practical

combined actions.

Results of Forces training in 2007 training year show that it became possible to reach
a higher level of field, air and sea-going training of personnel on the whole, to ensure
readiness of military units and formations to accomplish designated tasks, to work
out questions of organization and comprehensive support of combined arms Forces
activities.

The level of military command and control bodies

cohesion of the Armed Forces has been improved.
In the past year nearly 40 different activities were
carried out to master the issues of participation in
information and psychological, special operations
and specific actions related to anti-terrorist
operations and natural and man-made disaster relief
operations.

The necessary level of cohesion and efficiency in

the work of commanders and staffs on organization
of combat activities in the field, the planned
accomplishment of a set of tasks in accordance with
the goals and tasks of the Armed Forces employment
was achieved.

In total there were conducted: 6 battalion and

15 company tactical exercises; 11 flight and tactical

exercises of air squadrons; more than 100 platoon-level live firing; and some 480
squad-level live firing. The aim of those exercises was to increase the readiness
level to conduct tasks designated for formations and units, including the ability
of JRRF to participate in peacekeeping operations with formed unit authorized
strengths.

The Forces training plans and programmes have been accomplished in

2007 to the following extent: Land Force (92%), Air Force (98%) and Naval Force
(84%).

In particular, the intensity of combat training has increased 10% - 15% in the Land

_Force. The army aviation achieved more than the planned target for training. Namely,_
the results were two times higher in live firing against ground targets. The planned
flying hours target (20 hours and 34 minutes) for Main Defence Forces crews was not
only achieved but exceeded. The level of training was increased in the Air Defence
units equipped with the Osa-AKM anti-aircraft missile system and Tunguska antiaircraft gun and missile system. Bilateral, methodical, computer exercises and joint
command and staff exercises of army aviation and air mobile military units enabled
increasing combat training effectiveness.

The _Air Force increased the number of launches of aviation guided missiles_

4 times. Practical launches and firing conducted by anti-aircraft missile units at
_Ashuluk Range in Russia, air-to-air missile launches, and bombings conducted by_
aviation crews at the Chauda Range were successful.

OF FORCES TRAINING


The Naval Force successfully launched Termit anti-vessel missiles from ship
based and coastal anti-ship missile systems. It resulted in a decision to prolong
these missiles. Compared to 2006 the average sea-going ship time has increased by
1.5 times in JRRF and in the Main Defence Forces (1.3 times). In total it exceeded
the planned target by almost 17%.

At the same time, the most effective types of training, envisaging participation

of military formations and units at full strength, were not fulfilled due to the low
financing of the Armed Forces training programme.

The level of combat units’ effectiveness has been significantly increased through
employing the best international experience in organizing and conducting combat
training activities with Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel participating in
international exercises, (Annex 7). In 2007 Armed Forces’ representatives and
units participated in 17 multinational military exercises that were carried out in the
framework of multilateral cooperation, NATO Partnership for Peace Programme
and NATO exercises open to Partners. (Large-scale exercises are shown in
figure 4.2).

Taking into consideration the international standards necessary for the Armed

Forces of all the Alliance Partner-States, training of peacekeeping units’ personnel
participating in international military cooperation was conducted according to
separate plans, taking account of future specific tasks.

Training continued of Armed Forces units designated in accordance

with the Partnership for Peace Programme Planning and Review Process.

#### TRANSITION TO PROFESSIONAL

rofessionalisation is one of the main constituent parts of creating in Ukraine high-quality, mobile, well
### Parmed, fully equipped and efficient Armed Forces.

The results of experiments on staffing troops with contract Service personnel, providing moral and

material incentives to join the military service on a contract basis, enhancing the processes of contract
Service personnel selection and training makes it possible, having financial preconditions, to increase the
pace of transition of the Armed Forces to manning on a contract basis from 2008.


UPGRADING OF
PERSONNEL POLICY


New approaches to personnel policy, determined in The Armed Forces’ Personnel
_Policy Concept 2007, stipulate, in particular the implementation of a centralized_
system of personnel resource management, introducing career management
mechanisms, professional training and social provision, and adaptation to civilian
life in the case of retirement[1].

Implementation of personnel resource management

Centralized personnel resource management is oriented towards each Service
person’s career and administration and, on one side, substantially enhances the role of
commanders in evaluating their subordinates` performances, and on the other side –
provides objective control. Implementation of that system stipulates the centralization
of personnel resource command and control, personalization and automated recordkeeping.

**Centralization of personnel command and control is achieved by assembling**

all personnel management mechanisms (personnel evaluation, assignments, rotation,
terms for military ranks, and service in position etc) in personnel/staff centres of
specific Service, or in one joint centre common to all Services of the Armed Forces.

**Personalization and automated personnel record-keeping is carried out by**

introducing integrated individual and position accounting of Armed Forces` personnel
and statistical analysis of personnel policy supported by an Information Analysis
Centre (ІАС) “Personnel”. ІАС accumulates control all levels: GS Main Personnel
Directorate, Service Commands, Operational Commands and Territorial Directorate,
HQs of military units and sub-units.

In 2007 an Experiment was conducted analyzing the principles of a centralized

system of personnel management and possibilities for its implementation in the
Armed Forces. An Armed Forces (MOD & GS) Personnel Centre and a Land Force
Personnel Centre were formed, their structures, functions and objectives were
determined (Annex 8), the work of Commissions on the selection of candidates to
fill the positions has started.

At the end of the year, in Personnel Centres in selected Armed Forces command

and control (C2) systems and military units taking part in the Experiment, automated


1 Concept approved by the order of the Minister of Defence

TRANSITION T O P R O F E S S I O N A L A R M E D F O R C E S

workstations and a local area network were deployed and put into operation. As well
as conducting research exploitation of ІАС “Personnel”.

The unified distributed database of individual and position personnel accounting

was created in the Armed Forces Personnel Centre, and information support of the
command and control system is carried out using statistical registration forms.

The results of the Experiment revealed, that already at the end of 2007,

appointments to the positions within the nomenclature of the Minister of Defence and
the Chief of the General Staff were based on the ranking principle. Thus, according to
the specified criteria, the system (automatically updated) submitted for consideration
at least three candidates from the pool of candidates.

In general, more than 1,000 staff appointments were made within the Experiment.

The manning of “experimental” military command and control elements, units and
institutions has increased by 4.9%.

The Experiment clearly demonstrated the advantages of a centralized system

of personnel management over the present nomenclature system. That is why, in
2008 it is planned to establish an Air Force Personnel Centre and a Navy Personnel
Centre.

**Implementing a centralized system of personnel management would allow to**

**apply a personal approach, to guarantee transparency and openness in personnel**
**appointments, to have promotion on the basis of objective evaluation of each**
**Service person’s performance. The main principle of this system is to balance**
**individual and Service interests.**

SYSTEM OF MANNING
THE ARMED FORCES
WITH CONTRACT
SERVICE PERSONNEL


The State Programme of Development of the Armed Forces defines their transition to
a professional model 2010. Thus, staffing the Armed Forces with Service and Reserve
personnel is gradually transferring to professional Service personnel.

Manning the Armed Forces with contract Service personnel

By the end of 2007, the number of Service personnel on contract in the ranks of

Privates, Sergeants and Master Sergeants is 47% of the total. This is 9% higher than
the previous year. (Figure 5.1).

Meanwhile, to accomplish the perspectives of the State Programme the growth

rate of contracted Service personnel during the next 3 years might equal 13% to 18%.
Therefore, the competitiveness of military service must be enhanced in the national
employment market, first of all, providing citizens with incentives to join military
service (Annex 8).

During recent years the Armed Forces were able to implement activities with the

aim of improving selection, training and social support of contract Service personnel,
in particular:

                     - a new version of the Law of Ukraine “On Military

Duty and Military Service” (2006) was approved,
determining more simplified procedures for enlistment
and adding some more categories of citizens who may
enter contract service.

                    - “Regulations concerning the territorial centre of

manning the Armed Forces with contract Service
personnel” defines the tasks of selecting citizens for
military service on a contract basis in the ranks of
Privates, Sergeants and Master Sergeants; for military
service in the Armed Forces Reserve; and, entering
MOD military high schools (or military departments
in civilian higher education institutions)[2].

                     - The Action Plan for forming and developing

Armed Forces professional NCO personnel in 2007
2010 is being fulfilled, it comprises measures on: forming and introducing
transparent and efficient system of sergeants` promotion; a new criteria system
for objective evaluation of Service personnel’s skills; working out the system
of multilevel training of Sergeants; enhancing the prestige of Sergeant; and
optimal ratio of Privates to Sergeants[3];

  - Preparing the draft “Regulations Concerning the Procedures of Military

Service in the Armed Forces of Ukraine” [4] is being completed. The draft
defines a new approach to manning the Armed Forces with contract Service
personnel, the main issues concerning military service in the Reserve, and
their rights and duties;

the situation has slightly improved.
(Figure 5.3);

Perceptible is the increase in the

proportion of contract Service personnel
who have completed secondary and
higher education, to total contract
personnel (Figure 5.4). This could be
an indicator of the enhancement of
social prestige and competitiveness
of professional military service in the
national employment market.


Results of the manning experiment of designated military
units with contract Service personnel

In 2007 the Experiment on the transition of units of the Armed Forces to completely
professional Armed Forces continued. The number of units and formations
participating in the Experiment has increased from 4 to 15. At the end of the year, 9
of them were manned between 85% to 100% with contract Service personnel, (Figure
5.5), and that enables them to realize fuller value from combat training.

**Generally, the Experiment on the transition of the Armed Forces to the**

**principle of contract manning is efficient. Its intermediate results, at the same**
**time, reveal that the quantity of candidate selection, as well as housing and**
**payment to contract Service personnel are the most problematic.**

Training contract
Service personnel

Among the main objectives of increasing the professionalism of the Armed Forces are:
training contract Service personnel, forming the professional Sergeant Corps, capable
to be in charge of training subordinate personnel and become the basis of professional
Armed Forces. The system of multilevel training (retraining) of Sergeants and Master
Sergeants – is being formed for that purpose. (Figure 5.6).

(by 30 Nov 2008).

To improve the education level of contract Service personnel and to make

military contract service more prestigious, in 2006 free (funded from MOD
budget) higher basic education was introduced for contract Service personnel.
Four higher military education institutions were involved in this project, namely:
Military Institute of Telecommunication Systems of the National Technical
University of Ukraine ”KPI”; Korolev Zhytomyr Military Institute of the National
Aviation University; Nakhimov Sevastopol Naval Institute; and, Kharkiv Air
Force University.

300 contract Service personnel can enter those education institutions yearly.

Candidates are selected from contract Privates, Sergeants and Master Sergeants who

By the end of 2007, 419 contract Service personnel are receiving higher

education.

From February 2007 training began for contract NCO at US military education

institutions within the _International Military Education and Training (IMET)_
Programme. Seven received trained.

Contract Service in the Military Reserve

According to the State Programme of Development of the Armed Forces, beginning
in 2008, the Armed Forces will transition to the double principle of staffing Forces
according to the war-time model with both assigned Reservists and those subject

to military service. The Plan to amend legislative,
regulatory and legal acts was developed relating
to: standardization of service in the Armed Forces
Reserves; determining Reservists’ status; their
training; simplifying procedures and increasing the
level of their financial support; and, providing the
Armed Forces with military trained resources

Appropriate regulatory and legal foundations

were established during 2006-2007 that stipulated
experimental service in the military Reserve from 1
March 2007. It was planned to involve 1,200 Reservists,
including 472 officers. The plan was completed to
86.5% – 1,038 contract Service personnel, including
367 Officer-Reservists.

By the end of 2011 the Armed Forces plan to

cost will be 22.7 Million Hrn. To attract citizens to
reserve service, the Minister of Defence designated
increasing pay to Reservists in 2008 by 50% and
per diem provision up to 50% of that determined
legally.

The results of the Experiment confirmed the

right choice of transition strategy to best world
manning standards, revealed appropriate ways,
forms and methods of introducing Reserve service,
and challenges, as well. The ability of the defence
administration only is not always sufficient to solve
them. In this case, the Verhovna Rada, the President

CAREER
MANAGEMENT OF
THE OFFICER CORPS


Management of Officers’ careers is aimed at the efficient implementation of their
professional skills in the interest of military service, as well as providing the Armed
Forces with timely, experienced and well-trained personnel. The approaches to officer
manning and managing their careers have been changing substantially during the
considerable reductions in personnel numbers and transition to professional Armed
Forces.

Implementation of new approaches to manning
and career management of the Officer Corps

Manning and management of Officers’ careers starts from the qualitative evaluation of
personnel, developing the “Personnel Pool” and effective employment. The structural
chain “Service – Evaluation - “Personnel Pool” (training) - Service” has to become
the foundation of officers’ careers.

Typical algorithms are being developed in the centralized

system of personnel management for career management. The
algorithms give the possibility to propose options of service
for the officer – from the initial one to the highest possible
one.

An obligatory stipulation for career progression to be

appointed to higher positions is relevant course training,
according to the education level and professional skills
required of service positions. Promotion is through evaluating
the officer, listing the officer in the relevant “Personnel Pool”
and then appointing to the position that corresponds to personal
and professional characteristics.

Certification of Positions

During 2007, aiming to improve the objectivity of the new officers’ appraisal system,
the evaluation criteria was improved taking account of the aspects of officers’
performance to be evaluated in positions.

Each position sets specific requirements for candidates (qualification requirements:

age, education, assessment of performance in previous position etc.). Experience
in different appointments (command, staff, technical) is the most important
requirement.

A standardized description of service positions (the “Passport”) has been introduced

to sustain transparency and objectivity in selection and assignment. (Annex 8).

Special procedures to establish the “Personnel Pool” were developed for key

officers’ positions. They are based on the new algorithm of candidates being assessed
by the Certification Commission.

Officer Rotation

The centralized system of staff management stipulates control over the rotation
of officers. Rotation is the regular process of changing officers’ duties through
assignments to relevant positions, with the aim of more efficient use, raising
qualifications, extending service profile and gaining broader experience.

In order to provide optimal career progression and service rotation for all types

of position, rotation schemes are being developed. They draw out possible ways of
moving officers to equivalent positions and the terms of service. Rotation to positions
of different profiles is the most complicated procedure in officers’ career management
(Annex 8). Effective implementation of the rotation procedure demands resolving
some social challenges, as well as psychological and professional ones

The sys tem of state servicemen training, implemented in the Ministry of Defence

of Ukraine, uses the ability of other higher military and civil educational institutions
of Ukraine, also as training of those specialist in another countries. For example,
10 persons have been trained in National academy of state management and another
29 in other countries.

Language training

Taking into account active participation of Ukraine in providing of international

and regional security, the perspective of joining NATO, consistent implementation of
language training of Military management bodies and all Armed Forces has even more
significance.

From 2005 the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine taking actions towards the

organization of the process of foreign language training (the prior language is English,
due to the fact the it has become a language of international intercourse) by the
personnel of the Ministry of Defence, General Staff, other military management bodies,
also as servicemen of regular troops, and those formations who are participating in

With the view to improve the system of military education and preparation of

personnel, and to bring it to accordance with the new tasks and modern structure of the
Armed Forces of Ukraine, during 2007 all the measures provided positive results in
optimization of the network of research institions, along with higher military educational
establishments. Those measures also provided integration of military institutes with
civil higher educational establishments, and made a firm intention to achieve European
standards.


**The professionalization of Armed Forces are considered by the Ministry of**

**Defence and General Staff much wider, than just forming a contract-based service.**
**It is also about manning the Armed Forces with trained, morally strong citizens,**
**who are conscious about the peculiarities of military service, and which are ready**
**to perform their duties on defending the country from military threats. To achieve**
**this, there are personnel maintenance services, military education and science**
**are toiling. Besides, to create professional army it is necessary to equip it with**
**modern armament and machinery, and absolute adherence of high social security**
**standards of Service personnel.**

#### SOCIAL GUARANTEES

 AS A CONSTITUENT

 OF PROFESSIONALISATION

 OF THE ARMED FORCES

upporting the competitiveness of a military career in the employment market is an integral part of

### Sprofessionalization of the Armed Forces. Consequently, unconditional adherence to social guarantees

for Service personnel and their family is required. These social guarantees mean financial support and
other kinds of support appropriate to conditions of military service to attract both qualified military personnel
and youths who are educated and aware of military service conditions.

In general, the State can only expect and demand effective performance from Service personnel if

appropriate social guarantees are fully provided.

At the same time, this issue is connected to some acute problems that cannot be solved by the MOD

alone. Allotment of social guarantees for Service personnel and their family is a national issue, therefore
joint efforts of legislative and executive agencies as well as local authorities are necessary.


SALARIES AND
PENSIONS


The inadequate salary level and its distorted structure create two main problems:

Essential improvements to salaries and their

increase were introduced in 2007[1].

At the initial stage, salaries were raised due to

additional payments. According to approved normative
documents, salaries for all categories of Service
personnel were increased between 30% to 70% on
average and for junior officers were increased nearly
double[2] (Figure 6.1).

Salaries of contract Service personnel were

increased by 1.1 to 1.5 times depending on
Position Pay and uninterrupted military service.
Consequently, monthly payment to Service personnel
in the first contract is approximately UAH 900
on average or UAH 1,050 including 20% benefit
for service in JRRF. To some extent, this increase
benefits competitiveness of a military career in the
employment market.

According to data from the State Statistics Committee, the average salary in

July 2007 was approximately UAH 1,280, the minimum wage was UAH 1,018
(Ternopil region), the maximum wage was UAH 2,374 (Kyiv). Hence, the current
level of salaries favours competitiveness of contract military service in one
region, Ternopil, (figure 6.2), and presumably in regions with high unemployment
rates.

Necessary legal prerequisites have been created for

the second stage of increasing salary[3]. From 1 January
2008 the salary composition will be changed due to
increasing Position Pay and canceling ineffective
additional payments that do not have a stimulating
effect (Main Pay element will be between 60%
to 70%).

The fulfillment of this task is expected in 2008.

Rank payments are expected to be increased after
1 January 2009.

Increasing Service personnel salary has led to

corresponding increases in pension support. After
1 January 2008 pension support for former Service
personnel will be re-assessed. Pension support

will be increased depending on the position and rank between 38% to 70 % on
average.

INSURANCE,
BENEFITS AND
COMPENSATION


**Salary for all categories of Service personnel was increased in 2007. The new**

**principle of salary increase was implemented. In future, salary will be increased**
**in terms of Position Pay, rank pay and long-service pay. No new payments types**
**will be introduced.**

**At the same time, increasing salary for contract Service personnel is essential**

**for a professional military career to be competitive in the national employment**
**market.**

One of the main problems of proper social protection was the imbalance of insurance
and pension support for Service personnel compared to other State uniformed
agencies. In 2007 measures were undertaken to unify assignment and level of social
protection for all state military formations and law enforcement agencies.

The unitary approach concerning compensation in case of in-service disablement

or death initiated by the President for all state military formations in 2007. The
law entered into force effecting a single compensation for mutilation or death of
Service personnel, citizens liable for call-up and Reservists who engaged in training,
their complies with compensation in other security, defence and law enforcement
agencies[4].

The practice started in 1995 of re-considering and abolishing benefits, compensation

and guarantees in the laws on State Budget of Ukraine continues. In July 2007 the
Constitutional Court of Ukraine declared such practice unconstitutional[5]. Despite this,
the Law on State Budget of Ukraine 2008 decreases considerably the implementation
of certain Articles of Statutes in force which provided certain benefits and/or payment
support for Service personnel.


HOUSING MOD is striving to provide Service personnel with appropriate accommodation.

Despite the fact that during 2005-2007 almost 12,600
apartments were constructed or bought by MOD for
Service personnel and this issue has been considered by
the supreme executive authorities[6] the problems with
housing are far from being solved and the situation
even deteriorates.

At the beginning of 2007, there were 51,500

Service personnel waiting for accommodation, of which
12,400 (24%) were retired Service personnel, and
20,000 (39%) were waiting more than 10 years.

The situation is due to three reasons. Firstly,

limited financing of housing construction and
purchase of accommodation for Service personnel

4 Law of Ukraine “On changes to some legislative acts concerning social protection of Service personnel, citizens liable for call-up and Reservists who are
called up for training (or control) and special exercises” November 3, 2006 introduces changes to the Article 16 of Law of Ukraine “On social and legal
protection of Service personnel and their family members”. Thus, in case of death of Service personnel one time payment is assigned which equals 10-year
allowance according to last position but is less than 100 living wages of able-bodied population as of the day of payment.

5 Decision of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine No. 6 July 9, 2007

6 e.g. Decree of the Supreme Council of Ukraine “On information of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine concerning fulfillment of Recommendations of
Parliament hearings “On situation with housing and other guarantees for social protection of Service personnel, officers and ranks in the internal affairs
agencies and some other persons” No. 541 January 9, 2007

chapter 6


SOCIAL GUARANTEES AS A CONSTITUENT OF PROFESSIONALISATION OF THE ARMED FORCES

funded by the State Budget resulted in the discrepancy between construction
rate and rate of increase in Service personnel waiting for accommodation.
Secondly, the corresponding budget plans are continuously unfulfilled. Thirdly,
irregular General Budget Fund funding decreases the effectiveness of its utilization
(Table 6.1).

In 2007 housing construction was provided with

UAH 599.7 million, of which UAH 359.3 million
(General Fund) and UAH 240.4 (Special Fund).
The Plan included the construction or purchase
of 3,109 apartments at a cost not exceeding the
average cost defined by the Ministry of Regional
Development and Construction. That would have
equated to 70% of accommodation to be provided
in 2006.

However, the Government failed to solve

the problem with the Special Fund for housing
construction[7]. UAH 137.3 million (57%) of the State
Budget allocation for the Special Fund was provided
only by the end of the year which in practice ruled out
the construction (purchase) of housing financed by this
fund (figure 6.3).

General Fund finance was not provided by the

Ministry of Regional Development and Construction
until the third week in May. Moreover, budget fund
allocation envisaged UAH 326.5 million (91% of
general amount) to be spent on construction or
purchase of housing provided by the employer and only
UAH 32.8 million (9%) was allocated to construction
(purchase) of permanent housing for serving and
retired Service personnel.

Therefore, due to the imbalance in budget fund

allocation and actual funding level, only 1,560
accommodation units were provided in 2007, that is
three times lower than in 2006.

7 According to order of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 491 September, 2006 disposal of surplus military property was terminated. It was renewed only
in August 2007 due to the Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers “Some issues of disposal and management of surplus military property” No. 1063
August 15, 2007.

Generally, the experience of construction (purchase)

proved the following:

- Introduced in 2007 accumulation of General Fund

cost allocated by the State Budget for construction
(purchase) of housing for Service personnel in the
Ministry of Regional Development and Construction
is inefficient;

- MOD cannot be responsible for Special Fund

supply due to the fact that disposal of surplus military
property is conducted by the Department of Surplus
Property and Land, which was created within the
MOD structure but it is responsible to the Cabinet of
Ministers[8].

- The completion of MOD housing programmes is

complicated by the inconsistency of legal documents

concerning construction and/or purchase of housing as well as by durability,
complicacy and excessive expenses of tender procedures. On the other hand,
MOD cannot use funding such as privileged crediting, housing certificates,
stocks, etc. because it is not permitted under Regulations.

MOD is striving to develop the unitary state mechanism which together with local

authorities will enable the fulfillment of state guarantees concerning accommodation
for Service personnel and their family.

**In general, the current situation with accommodation for Service personnel**

**and their family requires urgent and extraordinary measures. The problems with**
**Service personnel accommodation liabilities cannot be solved through traditional**
**methods.**

An essential constituent of social protection of Service personnel is the right of
certain categories to free social and professional adaptation during the final year
before retirement and after retirement.

In 2007 MOD formed the system of Service personnel adaptation and introduced

the State Programme for Social and Professional Adaptation of Service personnel

who would retire and retired Service personnel for
the period to 2011 to enable implementation of this
right[9].

Social and professional adaptation is a complex

issue and in addition to MOD the Ministry of Labor and
Social Policy, the Ministry of Education and Science,
the State Employment Centre as well as Ukrainian and
international non-governmental organizations facilitate
adaptation (figure 6.5).

To solve adaptation problems the capabilities of

international projects and programmes are used with
funding from OSCE, NATO’s Economic Directorate and
the Government of Norway. During 2007, 1,835 persons

No.53/51/66, 2 February 2006

The de-mining is carried out by 54 freelance groups:

47 groups from the Army, 3 groups from the Navy and
4 groups from the Air Force.

In the structure of the AF there is a Demining

Centre (Kamyanets-Podilsky, Khmelnytsky region)
that performs training of appropriate specialists for all
force structures, as well as for peacekeeping missions
and structures of humanitarian assistance.

Groups that attend training course in the Centre

of de-mining carry out practical tasks. They took part
in the liquidation of consequences of ammunition
stores explosions in Novoboghdanivka, where they

determined and destroyed more than 200,000 items of ammunition, 19,000 of which
were exploded. In Artemivsk 12,000 were destroyed in such a way, and at the base
next to v. Tsvitokha – more than 120,000 items of ammunition.

In 2007 de-mining groups of the AF destroyed nearly 24,000 ammunitions

buried in the ground during the Wars across of 486 hectares. And in total, starting
from 1992, 500,000 explosives were determined and destroyed on the territory of
Ukraine.

Medical support of the population

The medical support given to the civil population by military doctors increases as a
result of the development of the medical support system of the AF. Thus, according
to the Order of the Chief of General Staff, after its approval with the Ministry of
Health Care of Ukraine and local authorities, on 18-21 September 2007 specialists of
the Military Mobile Hospital of Military Medical Clinical Centre of Northern region

(Kharkiv) conducted check-ups and medical treatment
free of charge for the inhabitants of Cherkaske,
Orlovshchyna and Vilne in Dnipropetrovsk region.
Check-ups and treatment in doctor’s surgery were to
906 inhabitants, 130 of whom were children.

Local people were provided with check-ups and

medical treatment. Medical aid was given to 1,527
inhabitants, 272 of whom were children.

On 14-17 September doctors-specialists of 66

Military Mobile Hospital of Military Medical Clinical
Centre Western region (Lviv) conducted check-ups and
treatment of inhabitants of Hovoukrainka, Kozlyn of
Rivne region. 621 adults and 142 children benefited
from the medical support.

The quality of medical support given by military

doctors is no lower, and in many cases is better, than medical support given in civilian
medical establishments.

Providing citizens, civilian ministries, institutions and local authorities with

medical support is an important direction of Armed Forces’ activity. This allows
the State to carry out its mission to protect the population, and the Armed Forces –
support professional skills and high level of readiness to perform tasks in peace time.
Reliability and timely support strengthens the image of the Armed Forces in Ukraine
and makes it a trustworthy protector of the interests of the population.

STRENGTHENING OF
DEMOCRATIC CIVIL
CONTROL OVER
ARMED FORCES


Strengthening of democratic civil control over the Armed Forces consists of
legislative procedures and mechanisms of political (presidential), administrative
(governmental), parliamentary and civil control by means of which civil power and
democratic institutions of society take part in creating defence policy and controlling
its implementation.

Development of democratic civil control over the Armed Forces is one of the

key elements of its transformation. In 2007 the main focus was on two directions:
participation of civil organizations in formation of MOD policy and providing the
civilian population with information on Armed Forces’ activity.

Activity of the Civil Council of Ministry of Defence

Activity of the Civil Council of Ministry of Defence in 2007 was directed to the
creation of organizational and legal conditions to let citizens realize their constitutional
right to take part in state management, taking into consideration civil opinion while
preparing and taking decisions, and support of permanent ministerial dialogue with
the structures of civil society.

The Civil Council comprises 90 civil formations and mass media. Their members

are always informed about the changes in the Armed Forces, for example, in June the
Chief of General Staff, General S.O.Kyrychenko, provided information on combat
capabilities of the Armed Forces.

The attention of the Civil Council members was concentrated on the issues of

military reform development; execution of the defence budget and perspectives of AF
financing; the organization of AF training; building of accommodation for Service
personnel and their money and pension insurance. In February 2007, according to
the results of regular meetings, the Civil Council addressed an Open Letter to the
President, Head of Verkhovna Rada and the Prime Minister, presenting its vision of
AF financing and solving the questions of social protection of Service personnel and
their families.

In March representatives of the MOD Department of Humanitarian Policy

and the Civil Council took part in the preparation of legislative documents on
cooperation between the civilian population and state authorities, its participation
in creating and implementing state policy on central and local levels, and access to
information.

At the end of 2007 the Civil Council in cooperation with the Ukrainian

Formation of Protection of Constitutional Rights and Freedoms of Ukrainian
Population “Legal protection” launched the project of consulting war veterans
and Service personnel on law issues. The Civil Council proposed also to create
information and consulting units inside the staff authorities of the AF in order to
provide Service personnel with qualified information in the areas of social and
professional adaptation.

Representatives of the Civil Council and other

institutions of civil society always took part in
preparing and holding of national and institutional
celebratory events. And being a member of the MOD
delegation they visited the Ukrainian AF peacekeeping
contingency in Kosovo where they congratulated the
personnel during Christmas holidays.

In total, in 2007 important questions of AF activity

and ways to solve them were discussed during five
meetings of the Civil Council and four meetings of
its Board. Members of the Civil Council provided
proposals how to solve the accommodation problems of
Service personnel (eliminating imbalances in financing
of Service and permanent accommodation, developing

working mechanisms to provide Service personnel families and retired personnel
living in closed, distant and decommissioned military bases with new accommodation
elsewhere).

General propositions after each meeting of the Civil Council are attentively

studied by employees of appropriate structural subunits of the Ministry and are taken
into consideration when taking the appropriate management decisions.

The activity of the MOD Civil Council in 2007 is characterized by an increase

of constructiveness and direction to cooperate with defence leaders to find out
the best ways to solve the problems of social and legal protection of Service
personnel, members of their families and also the military pensioners and retired
personnel.

Providing the civil population
with information on Armed Forces activity

Providing the civil population with information on Armed Forces activity is carried
out by the press service, MOD employees and members of the Civil Council through
personal communication with the representatives of society and mass media, military,
[national and local mass media and the MOD web-site www.gov.ua.](http://www.gov.ua)

A significant contribution to providing transparency of defence policy,

MOD and Armed Forces activity is the annual publication of the White Book
(from 2005).

Activities of MOD Press Service, the Civil Council and military mass media in

2007 was directed to increasing military information and improving the provision of
information to personnel. The main results of information activity are provided in

PATRIOTIC AND
EDUCATIONAL
ACTIVITY OF THE
ARMED FORCES


In 2007 MOD and Armed Forces personnel conducted their own measures of patriotic
education and took an active part in appropriate events of state authorities, city
administration authorities and civil organizations. The main task of this activity was
to develop in Service personnel and citizens of Ukraine a respectful attitude to the
culture, Cossack glory, history, language, traditions of Ukraine, and respect for the
Armed Forces.

In 2007 a national Ukrainian language competition, named after P.Yatsyk, was

conducted for the first time in the Armed Forces. More than 900 officers and cadets
of higher military education establishments took part and 10 received awards.

During the year some scientific and practical events of youth heroic and patriotic

education, strengthening of military traditions and respect for national heroes were

held at national and international levels. Also, nearly
30 measures, which had military and patriotic character,
as well as cultural and art events of celebration of state
and professional holidays and significant dates were
conducted together with executive authorities and civil
organizations.

MOD and Armed Forces cultural and enlightening

organizations (officers’ clubs, central and regional
museums) held more than 4,000 events that involved
nearly 100,000 people. The National Presidential
Orchestra and Song and Dance Ensemble of the
Ukrainian Armed Forces held nearly 100 concerts,
including concerts in military garrisons.

In cooperation with the Creative Centre, “Arsenal”

military and patriotic audio album “Knight Brotherhood” and songbook “Motherland
Defender” were launched. Creative teams of the Armed Forces took part in preparing
and holding a creative project concert - presentation “Ukrainian heroic song” where
the famous singer, O.Skrypka, participated.

On 6 December, on the 16[th] anniversary of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the TV

channel 1+1 transmitted the premiere of the film-concert “Stars in the Army” where
famous Ukrainian singers participated. The film is a common project of TV channel
1+1 and MOD.

To revive the best officers’ traditions, on the Eve of the Ukrainian Armed Forces

Day Officers’ Balls were conducted in Kyiv, Vinnytsa, Dnipropetrovsk, IvanoFrankovsk and other cities – the holding of such events fosters the establishment
of democratic relations between officers of various ranks, renews feelings of
collectivism, officers’ honour, responsibility, pride for the profession of defender of
motherland and its people.

The activity of Armed Forces creative and sports teams that received efficient

international rewards plays the primary role in the process of strengthening the
positive image of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the international arena. In 2007 the
singing group of the Central Intelligence Department of the MOD “Oberigh” won the
grand-prize of the Army song festival “Vivat, Victory” which united 136 international
teams.

During the year 823 military sports personnel took part in competitions in

36 countries. Ukrainian Armed Forces sports personnel won 25 gold, 43 silver and
37 bronze medals in the World and European championships, and 201 gold, 157 silver
and 136 bronze medals in Ukrainian ones.

International competitions of Army sports personnel took place in Ukraine,

also. In 2007 the international boxing tournament for brothers Klychko prizes
was held in the Armed Forces Central Sports Club. It united sports people from

Championship between sports people from 18 countries was held for the first time.
In this event, Ukrainian Armed Forces sports personnel won 6 gold, 4 silver and
7 bronze medals.

In total, during the years of Independence, Armed Forces sports personnel have

won 1,159 medals – 359 gold, 401 silver and 399 bronze.


**To sum up, in 2007 the MOD carried out these measures directed to the**

**patriotic education of youth, Service personnel and the civilian population. At**
**the same time, these measures fostered the creation of a positive image of the**
**Ukrainian Armed Forces, both in Ukrainian society and abroad, with an increase**
**in the level of belief and common support of their activity.**

**In total, the new format of relations between the Armed Forces and society**

**is characterized by the readiness of the Armed Forces at any time and in any**
**condition to help the civilian population and organizations; by the development of**
**democratic civil control of the Armed Forces; by increasing educational activity**
**effectiveness; and, strengthening of the Armed Forces authority in society.**

COOPERATION WITH
EUROPEAN UNION

REGIONAL
COOPERATION


**Notwithstanding negative foreign and domestic policy factors, military**

**cooperation with NATO is one of the most successful courses in Ukrainian**
**foreign policy and it meets the interests of Armed Forces reform and ensuring**
**its combat efficiency.**

Military and political cooperation with the European Union and its member states has
practical direction and is seen as an important mechanism of Ukrainian integration to
Europe by the State and Ministry of Defence. Priority lines of cooperation with the
European Union are as follows:

  - participation in European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP);

  - global disarmament, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and

arms control;

  - air transportation

  - participation of Ukrainian Armed Forces in EU-led peacekeeping operations

as a part of multinational units.

These priority lines were implemented in the

context of the Ukraine-EU Action Plan 2007. In the
framework of this Plan, MOD and GS officials took part
in negotiations of the delivery of a new basic UkraineEU Agreement. The results of these negotiations are
the draft of the new Agreement Chapter “Political
dialogue and reforms as well as cooperation in the field
of foreign and security policy”

Within the year, cooperation in ESDP has greatly

intensified, especially in the military field. Regular
meetings of Ukrainian and EU military authorities
were held. On 10 - 12 September 2007 Chairman, EU
Military Committee visited Ukraine and had official
meetings with leading MOD and GS officials. In turn,
Ukraine Chief of the General Staff - Commander-in
Chief of the Armed Forces - first took part in the EU Military Committee session on
15 November 2007.

In May 2007 the EU Combat Group Concept and decision-making procedure

in the field of crisis management were discussed during Ukraine-EU committee
work. In April during the 10[th] Permanent Ukrainian-Polish conference on European
Integration of the concept of the Multinational Ukrainian-Polish-Slovak combat
unit, Ukraine received an official invitation to join Multinational Military Police
Battalion, together with such countries as Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic and
Croatia (MNMPBAT).

**The development of cooperation with the EU in the field of security moved**

**into the intensive stage. Ukraine’s integration into NATO and the delivery of the**
**Ukraine-EU new basic Agreement advanced this development.**

One of the main elements of international cooperation of the Armed Forced is
participation in the events of regional organizations, which deal with security,
stabilization and trust.

The fact that Ukraine joined the South-Eastern Europe Defence Ministerial

(SEDM) intensified the participation of Ukraine in regional security structures and
will forward the achievement of the State’s long-term political goals.

In October 2007 the Ministers of Defence Meeting of SEDM took place in Kiev.

Ukraine expressed a willingness to join the South-Eastern Europe Peacekeeping

Force. Enlargement of cooperation in the framework of SEDM and CPF SWE is
undertaken as a beneficial factor to integrate Ukraine into European and Euro-Atlantic
security structures. Important and interesting projects and initiatives for Ukraine are
the following:

               - development of cooperation, coordination and interoperability of Armed Forces

of SEDM countries through the use of computer simulation, organizing and
holding computer training (SEESIM);

              - creation of a system of telecommunication satellite connection for two
way information exchange between military hospitals of SEDM countries
(SIMIHO);

               - support in the process of non-proliferation of WMD, border security and fight

against terrorism (CBSC);

              - research in the sphere of defence technologies (SEEDIRET);

              - cooperation in the sphere of military education between countries of SEDM

(SEMEC).

To create a zone of stability and security around

Ukraine in the framework of cooperation – Organization
for Democracy and Economic Development – (GUAM),
a Working Group for military and political cooperation
was established. Documents have been developed
concerning the tasks and structure of the GUAM
peacekeeping unit – a joint peacekeeping battalion
that can be deployed on UN and OCSE peacekeeping
operations.

Cooperation is actively developing with countries

of “Vyshegrad Four” (Poland, Slovakia, Hungary
and the Czech Republic) that support and are ready
to support in the future Ukraine on its way to
integration into European and Euro-Atlantic security
structures.

In January 2007 during the meeting of Chiefs of General Staffs of “Vyshegrad

Four” in which the Chief of General Staff of Ukraine took part, the Plan was approved
for Ukrainian Armed Forces assistance to 2010. The Ukrainian proposition to enlarge
the format of common anti-terrorist and peacekeeping training was supported.

Besides, the “Vyshegrad Four” proposed to Ukraine to join, in the framework

of EU, the Initiative to create a common combat unit, with a strength 1,500-2,000
Service personnel.

In December 2007, following the initiative of “Vyshegrad Four”, an international

conference of cooperation in the defence industrial sphere took place in Dnipropetrovsk.
The representatives of Defence enterprises of 5 countries participated.

Cooperation develops in support of regional security in the Black Sea area

in the framework of the Black Sea group of military and maritime cooperation
BLACKSEAFOR (Ukraine, Bulgaria, Georgia, Russia, Romania, Turkey). The priority
for this cooperation is the practical development of a new concept of BLACKSEAFOR
which is named “Defensive operations against terrorism”.

In accordance with the Protocol between MOD Ukraine and GS Armed Forces of

Turkey, the Ukrainian Navy joined the operations of the Turkish Navy “Black Sea
Harmony” in the format of information exchanges.

**Active involvement of the Armed Forces in regional security systems helps to**

**form an area of stability and mutual trust.**

COOPERATION
WITH THE RUSSIAN
FEDERATION,
COMMONWEALTH
OF INDEPENDENT
STATES (CIS) AND
OTHER PARTNER
COUNTRIES


Conducting combined activities between the Armed Forces of the Commonwealth
of Independent States during year 2007 was beneficial for deepening bilateral
cooperation.

Ukrainian participation as an observer at the meetings of the Ministers of Defence

of Commonwealth of Independent States (20 June in Moscow; 27 November, Actaw,
Kazakhstan) is an important tool of negotiating bilateral cooperation. Furthermore
it is a good instrument to receive information about the status and perspectives of
development of the Armed Forces of member states.

The most active was cooperation with Russia (42 bilateral events) and Belarus

(21 bilateral activities). Priorities of this cooperation are: training of special operation
forces and engineer formations; teachers of education establishments; peacekeeping
and scientific activities.

Special attention must be paid to the cooperation

with Russian within the framework of Commission of
Cooperation between the Armed Forces. The important
achievement of this activity is the possibility of
conducting practical training in combat shooting for
the Air Defence Forces of Ukraine.

Internship of Ukrainian medical military was

conducted in Russian military medical establishments.
Furthermore, consultations of experts on disposal
of surplus weapons and obsolete munitions were
conducted at the same time.

Drafts of the following documents are under

development:

                     - Standard operation procedures of Testing Centre

(Pheodosia);

  - Using polygon Nitka (Saki);

  - Conducting combat shooting in Russian polygons;

  - Possibility of studying in higher education establishments.

There was some work concerning definition of common scientific developments,

directions of cooperation in the area of standardization, measurement and codification
as well as peacekeeping activities.

During 2007 the representatives of the Ukrainian Armed Forces participated in the

meeting of Coordination Committee of the Air Defence Forces of the Commonwealth
of Independent States as well as the meeting of Commanders of the Air Forces.
Furthermore, the meetings of topography specialists were conducted at the same
time.

Participation in the activities of military cooperation within the framework of

Commonwealth of Independent States supports widening the format of experience
exchanging concerning overcoming of difficult issues. These activities support
finding effective ways of developing the Armed Forces as well as enhancing the level
of interoperability at bilateral and multilateral levels with consideration of national
interests of CIS countries.

During 2007 the Armed Forces conducted 24 rotations of Ukrainian peacekeeping

personnel. Also conducted were two rotations of Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents,
KFOR as part of peacekeeping forces and the rotation of the Ukrainian peacekeeping
contingent of the UNO Mission in Liberia. 3 Ukrainian officers are active members of
the International Security Assistance Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF), one officer serves
in HQ ISAF (CINIC) and two officers are embedded in the Lithuania group (Provincial
Reconstruction Team).

The national normative-legal basis of peacekeeping continues to be actively

developed. Drafts were prepared for three Decrees of the President of Ukraine which
will define the main aspects for participation of peacekeeping personnel in ISAF, UN
mission in Iraq (12 personnel) and the additional mission for peacekeeping personnel
for UN mission in Lebanon.

The system of financial support for peacekeeping contingents and military personnel

has been improved.

For a year Ukraine has continued to provide air space for the airplanes of NATO members

within the framework of the ISAF Operation. During the ISAF Operation throughout the
territory of Ukraine about 8,950 US and German airplanes carried out flights.

**Ukrainian Armed Forces participation in international peacekeeping operations**

**is valuable and an important direction of its international activity making a**
**significant contribution by the State to providing global security. Moreover, it**
**is an important constituent for training Ukrainian Armed Forces directed to**
**implementing modern tasks in real conditions.**

Ukraine actively participates in the international Arms control programme and
creation of new global and regional mechanisms to strengthen trust and security based
on principles of understanding and openness of military-political activity.

In 2007 verification activity of the Armed Forces was adapted to the new geopolitical

environment by activating bilateral collaboration, mainly with neighbouring States.

According to the OSCE framework, where in the field of strengthening trust and

security the Vienna Document 1999 is the normative basis of international cooperation
and bilateral agreements, inspection groups of Belgium, Belarus, Slovakia, US, Hungary
and France conducted 11 measures in Ukraine.

Representatives of Ukrainian Armed Forces conducted 13 planned measures in

Belgium, Belarus, Bulgaria, Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Turkey and Hungary, and

also took part in the demonstration of new systems of
armaments and military technique in Germany.

After bilateral agreements, in different military

units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine representatives
of Belgium and Hungary conducted one educational
inspection, during which new approaches were
developed to verification procedures. According to an
additional bilateral quota a Hungarian-Italian group
visited military units in Ukraine.

the Armed Forces of Ukraine 2006-2011. The year was characterized by qualitative
changes in the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

As a result of work in 2007, the Armed Forces are ready to accomplish their

assigned missions and tasks. The necessary pre-conditions to achieve the objectives
set by the State Programme and further improvement in Forces’ activities were
created

Following the tradition of concentrating attention and efforts of the Ministry of

Defence and General Staff on one of its key issues, 2008 will be the “Year of the Navy
and Special Operations Forces”.

Priorities to further develop Ukrainian Armed Forces in 2008 include:

  - Increasing military management effectiveness; improving combat training;

achieving readiness of Joint Rapid Reaction Forces units to fulfil assigned tasks
and missions; and, increasing Air Defence effectiveness to protect important
locations.

  - Providing effective Armed Forces’ manning with contract personnel and

implementing service in the Reserve.

  - Maintaining Armed Forces’ equipment; renewing military equipment and

weapons and developing innovative technologies.

  - Releasing military units from non-core functions such as maintenance and

storage of surplus weapons, military equipment and other assets; disposal
of obsolete surplus ammunition, components of rocket fuel and propellant
elements; guarding of Military of Defence decommissioned facilities; and,
base maintenance and cleaning, etc.

  - Ensuring social guarantees for Service personnel, their families and retired

personnel

  - Stimulating Armed Forces activities in the area of patriotic education of

youth, Service personnel and Ukrainian citizens in general, through qualitative
improvements and using historical Ukrainian traditions of service to the
Motherland, combat courage, military honour and respect for the profession
