##### Security Environment


-----

### India’s security environment is defined by a complex interplay
###### of regional and global imperatives and challenges. The size and the strategic location of the country places us at the centre of a security dynamic, impacted concurrently by the positive forces of regional and global connectivity on the one side and by the consequences arising from unpredictability, instability and volatility in parts of immediate and extended neighbourhood, on the other.


###### 1.1 India’s security environment is

 defined by a complex interplay of regional

 and global imperatives and challenges. The

 size and the strategic location of the country

 places us at the centre of a security dynamic,

 impacted concurrently by the positive

 forces of regional and global connectivity

 on the one side and by the consequences

 arising from unpredictability, instability and

 volatility in parts of immediate and extended

 neighbourhood, on the other.

 1.2 As India seeks to achieve

 transformative national growth and

 development internally, we pursue a robust

 defence strategy and policies which aim to

 address the wide spectrum of conventional

 and non-conventional security challenges

 faced by the country. Guided by the principle

 of building strength through the principles of

 strategic autonomy and self reliance, India

 seeks to enhance her own capabilities and

 also to pursue a constructive engagement with neighbours and partner countries in the


###### regional and global community to promote peace and stability.

 Global Security Environment
 1.3 India’s geo-strategic location makes
 it sensitive to developments beyond its immediate neighbourhood, in the Asia Pacific, West Asia, Central Asia, and in the Indian Ocean Region. Major geo-political and geo-economic developments are
 currently transforming the global security scenario into one of uncertainty and volatility.

 1.4 Since the end of the Cold War,
 the global security environment has seen major changes. On the one hand, the world has witnessed a spurt of globalisation and deepening economic interdependence,
 which has enhanced the growth of countries like India, China, Brazil and South Africa. On the other, large parts of the world continue to be affected by conflict and violence. The global balance of power has witnessed new adjustments and dynamics, generating new


2


-----

###### strategic uncertainties, reflected often in

 competition and contestations.

 1.5 Even as the probability of a full scale

 conventional war is thought to have receded

 since the end of the Cold War, a number of

 drivers have catalysed new challenges in the

 regional and global security landscape. The

 intense competition for natural resources

 adds another layer of volatility to existing

 faultlines of territorial disputes between

 nations and poses a challenge to the norms

 of international law and accepted standards

 of international behaviour. 

 1.6. The transnational threats posed by

 the activities of terrorist organizations have

 been exacerbated by the dynamics of intra

 and inter State conflicts and pose a danger

 to regions beyond the primary theatres. The

 transnational mobilization of foot-soldiers

 and logistics support for terrorist activities

 poses a serious internal security challenge for

 countries around the world. Technological

 advances in telecommunications and

 the cyber domain have provided force

 multipliers to boost the capabilities and

 impact of terrorist activities. There is

 continuing concern over terrorist threats

 emanating from India’s neighbourhood and

 the transnational and other linkages through

 which such groups are being sustained.

 1.7 The prospect of peace and stability
 in various regions of the world is also


###### marred by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and it continues to be major international security concerns, notwithstanding international efforts to strengthen nuclear security and to prevent non-State actors from acquiring nuclear materials. Piracy and other challenges to maritime security remain major challenges to regional and global peace and security. 

 1.8 The shift of the global balance of
 power from Europe to the Asia-Pacific region has brought a complex and dynamic interplay of economic, military and diplomatic factors, and it is reflected in escalation of maritime territorial disputes, military postures and power rivalries, all of which have added to the uncertainties in the security situation in the region. The contesting claims over island territories in the Asia Pacific have created tensions in the region and threaten to polarise the Asia Pacific community. The situation on the Korean peninsula is also fraught with tension between North and South Korea with North Korea conducting its third nuclear test. In view of these

-----

###### developments the global powers are getting to play a prominent role in regional affairs which is affecting the military balance and impacting economic cooperation between countries in the region. Non-traditional challenges such as trans-national crime, terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics, cyber security and food and energy security, also pose serious challenges to the region.

 1.9 India has important political,
 economic, commercial and social interests in the Asia Pacific and has a stake in continued peace and stability in the region. India supports freedom of navigation in international waters and the right of passage, in accordance with international law. India’s view is that all countries must exercise restraint and resolve bilateral issues diplomatically, according to principles to International law and without recourse to the use or threat to use of force. India is of the view that in the current regional security landscape there is a need to promote a cooperative approach. Hence, we remain actively engaged with the Asia Pacific community through a web of bilateral as well as multilateral fora like the East Asia Summit, ADMM – Plus and ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), so as to contribute to peace and stability in the region.

 1.10 The Central Asian region has gained
 salience in recent times due to the presence of hydrocarbon and mineral resources.


###### The increasing strategic competition in this region has implications for India’s security. To further its large geo-strategic interests in the region, India has focused on developing strong politico-economic and security partnerships with the Central Asian Republics.

 1.11 The situation in Ukraine has brought
 to the forefront a fresh challenge to peace and stability in the region and a prolonged stand-off could have an adverse impact on international security and the global economy. India believes that there is scope for a political and diplomatic solution to the current problem. 

 1.12 The West Asian region continues
 to face volatility and instability in the wake of the changes brought about by the Arab Spring. These changes have ushered in fundamental political and socio-economic transformation, in many parts of the region. As a consequence a number of non-state actors have mushroomed in the region. Sectarian fault-lines have also deepened,


4


-----

###### thereby disturbing the stability and internal

 cohesion of various countries in the region.

 India has not only vital stakes, but also has

 long standing relations with the countries

 and people of this region. Continuing

 unrest and uncertainty in West Asia has a

 major impact on India’s diverse interests

 in the region, which include the safety and

 security of nearly seven million Indians who

 live and work in the region, as well as the

 uninterrupted flow of India’s energy imports

 from the region. Therefore, India remains

 engaged with countries in the region on

 defence and security issues of common

 concern.

 1.13 The evolving situation in Syria and

 Iraq is of growing concern in terms of the

 impact of ongoing developments on the

 stability of these countries and repercussions

 for other countries within and beyond the

 region. The extension of the Syrian conflict

 into Iraq has serious ramifications for the

 region, with heightened extremist and

 sectarian overtones. India has expressed deep

 concern at the violence and loss of human

 lives in Syria and has consistently called for

 an inclusive and comprehensive political

 solution which will take into account the

 legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people.

 India has also expressed firm support to Iraq

 in its fight against international terrorism

 and in its efforts to preserve its unity and

 territorial integrity.


###### 1.14 The escalation of violence between
 Israel and Palestine is a matter of concern and further threatens the peace and security of the region.

 1.15 Iran occupies an important place
 in the economic and security calculus of India. India has welcomed the interim nuclear agreement between E-3+3 and Iran and supports resolving all issues related to Iran’s nuclear programme through a comprehensive dialogue between the
 parties.

 1.16 Many regions in Africa are witnessing
 upheaval, as uprisings and insurgencies have been sweeping across a number of North and West African countries. Of particular concern is the growing influence of terrorist organizations in the region. While, the threat from piracy in the Western Indian Ocean has diminished, the same has assumed serious proportions in the Gulf of Guinea. A number of Indian seafarers have been affected in acts of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea. The activities of terrorist outfits in Nigeria and other countries is a threat to the internal stability of these countries and the linkages between these and other terrorist organisations outside the region is a matter of serious concern. India has historic ties with several African nations and seeks to deepen its bonds with them through the strategic initiative of the India- Africa Forum Summit (IAFS) that seeks to


5


-----

###### promote bilateral, regional and continent- level political, economic development and strategic cooperation with African countries.

 1.17 The Indian Ocean Region (IOR) is
 vital to India’s security and prosperity. As a maritime nation by historical traditions and by its geo-physical configuration and geo-political circumstances, India is dependent on the oceans surrounding it. India’s peninsular dimension in the Indian Ocean Region, places it adjacent to the most vital sea-lanes of the world, stretching from the Suez Canal and the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Straits. India’s security and prosperity is dependent on these sea lanes and its ability to engage freely in maritime trade and commerce.

 1.18 The IOR is emerging as a source of
 multiple security concerns arising out of piracy, terrorism, human trafficking, WMD proliferation and competition over maritime resources. This has resulted in growing


###### presence of extra-regional powers in the Indian Ocean, increasing the prospect of geo-strategic competition between them. As maritime security issues gain greater urgency and relevance, power rivalries in the IOR will need to be closely monitored, as India’s strategic stakes in this region are of critical significance to its security calculus.

 1.19 India remains actively engaged
 in various regional fora that are based in or border the IOR region, so as to build a network of cooperative structures which would bring together all stakeholders based on mutuality of interests. The initiative to establish an expanded maritime security cooperation framework between India and various island countries in the Indian Ocean, namely, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritius and Seychelles has been born out of a mutual acknowledgement of the commonality of the sea-borne security challenges and the need for cooperative approaches.

 The Regional Security Environment
 1.20 A secure, stable, peaceful and
 prosperous neighbourhood is central to India’s security perspective. The regional security environment in South Asia continues to be dynamic, with terrorism, insurgency and sectarian conflict emerging from our immediate neighbourhood, increasingly
 threatening the stability of our region. Amidst the ongoing efforts to impart fresh vigour and dynamism to strengthening relations


6


-----

###### with neighbours in a comprehensive

 manner, the need to enhance a cooperative

 security construct is of immediate relevance

 in this period of strategic uncertainty. India

 is committed to build an open and dialogue

 based security cooperation with all partners

 in the neighbourhood on the basis of equality

 and mutual benefit and respect.

 1.21 As the international military

 forces in Afghanistan approach the phase

 of drawdown, the security situation in

 Afghanistan requires close monitoring. With

 the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF)

 taking full responsibility for the security of the

 country, the international community must

 ensure sustained support to the equipping

 and capability building requirements of

 the ANSF, to enable them to deal with the

 entire spectrum of security challenges that

 they may be required to face. The present

 political transition in the country is a

 significant milestone for Afghanistan, with

 renewed opportunities for an Afghan-led

 and Afghan-owned national reconciliation

 process. The Strategic Partnership Agreement

 between India and Afghanistan provides

 the framework for the commitment of both

 countries to build bilateral relationship in

 all spheres, including though defence and

 security cooperation aimed at enhancing

 mutual capacity in the fight against terrorism

 and other security challenges.


###### 1.22 India wishes to develop peaceful,

 friendly and cooperative ties with Pakistan.

 However, security concerns vis-à-vis Pakistan

 have remained due to the continued activities

 of terrorist organisations functioning from

 territories under its control. India has clearly

 indicated that we are willing to resolve

 all outstanding issues through a peaceful,

 bilateral dialogue process. However, for this

 dialogue to be meaningful, an environment

 free from terror and violence is required.

 During the recent meeting of the DGMOs of

 both countries at Wagah in December 2013,

 Pakistan has expressed its commitment to

 ensuring ceasefire and peace and tranquility

 on the Line of Control. However, the

 existence of terrorist camps across the

 India-Pak border and Line of Control and

 continued infiltrations and incidents on and

 across the LoC, demonstrate the challenges

 in this regard. India’s view is that a selective

 approach by Pakistan in tackling terrorist

 groups operating on its territory will not

 serve the interests of the region, nor indeed,

 those of Pakistan, particularly since these

 organisations pose a danger to Pakistan’s

 own internal security.

 1.23 Although the unresolved boundary

 dispute between India and China is a major

 factor in India’s security calculus, India has

 engaged with China on the principles of

 mutual trust and respect for each other’s

 interests and concerns. Both countries are


7


-----

###### agreed on the need to maintain peace and tranquility on the border and a number of measures are being pursued to promote interactions and confidence building
 measures between the Armed Forces of both sides. The conclusion of the Border Defence Cooperation Agreement with China in 2013 is a significant step in the direction of promoting confidence building measures between both countries, and is expected to contribute to maintenance of peace and tranquility along the LAC. India also remains conscious and watchful of the implication of China’s increasing military profile in our immediate and extended neighbourhood, as well as the development of strategic infrastructure by China in the border areas. India is also taking necessary measures to develop the requisite capabilities to counter any adverse impact on our own security.

 1.24 India and Bhutan have traditional
 and unique bilateral relationship,
 characterized by utmost trust and deep mutual understanding which has matured over the years. India and Bhutan have been privileged socio-economic partners since 1961. Today, there is extensive cooperation between the two countries in all areas including in the area of trade and economy including hydropower, defence and security as also people-to-people linkages.

 1.25 As close neighbours, India and Nepal

 share a unique relationship of friendship and


###### cooperation, which is characterized by open borders and deep-rooted people-to-people contacts of kinship and culture. There has been a long tradition of free movement of people across the borders. The misuse of the open borders by some elements inimical to Indian interests is a challenge that both countries are addressing jointly. As the security and economic interests of both countries are intertwined, India is determined, as a close friend and neighbour, to partner with the Government and people of Nepal in all areas of national endeavour, based on the principles of mutual respect and equality.

 1.26 India’s relations with Myanmar are
 rooted in shared historical, ethnic, cultural and religious ties that have stood the test of time. An MOU on Border Cooperation, concluded between India and Myanmar in May 2014, provides a strong framework for security cooperation and intelligence exchange between Indian and Myanmar security agencies in areas of coordinated patrolling, intelligence sharing, counter- insurgency, arms-smuggling, drug, human and wildlife trafficking. Under an MOU on Border Area Development concluded in 2012, projects pertaining to school, hospital and bridge construction in Myanmar are being supported by the Government.

 1.27 Cooperative relations between India

 and Bangladesh remain a positive factor in


8


-----

###### the regional security scenario. There is a high degree of convergence in the concerns and views of both countries on security issues and on managing border security concerns. India continues to emphasize its security concerns to Bangladesh, especially the use of Bangladeshi territory by Indian Insurgent Groups (IIGs) and terrorists of other nationalities.

 1.28 A Coordinated Border Management
 Plan (CBMP), signed between the two countries in July 2011, synergizes the efforts of the Border Guarding Forces of both countries, for more effective control over cross border illegal activities and crimes, as well as for maintenance of peace and harmony along the India-Bangladesh border. A system of institutionalized interactions for discussion on border management through meetings at all levels, addresses all such concerns.

 1.29 Relations between India and
 Sri Lanka are based on shared cultural, religious, linguistic and historical ties and remain cooperative and constructive.
 Maritime security challenges and the maintenance of peace and stability in the Indian Ocean region are common concerns which provide for a convergence of strategic interests between both countries and the underpinning to ongoing cooperation in the field of defence. India has been supportive of the process of reconciliation in Sri Lanka


###### and supports a lasting political settlement within the framework of a united Sri Lanka which would meet the aspirations of the Tamil community for equality, justice, peace and dignity.

 1.30 Security cooperation between India
 and Maldives is a highly significant dimension of bilateral cooperation, as the security interests of both countries are interlinked. Bilateral relations are being nurtured and strengthened through regular contacts at the highest levels and at various levels of the defence forces of both countries.

 1.31 The commonality of regional
 maritime security challenges is the
 foundation for the trilateral defence and security cooperation framework through which India, Sri Lanka and Maldives are working to develop joint capabilities to respond to a variety of maritime challenges. The initiative enables the defence and security establishments of all three countries to pursue dialogue and practical cooperation on a regular basis. It is expected that the initiative will contribute to the development of a cooperative vision of security in the region. 

 1.32 The challenge posed by non traditional threats such as WMD proliferation, terrorism, drugs, human trafficking, etc continue to remain high on India’s security agenda. New challenges have emerged in the domains of Cyber and Space, with

 Internal Security Environment
 1.33 India faces multifaceted internal
 security challenges which include left wing extremism, an ongoing proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir and insurgencies in some states in the North East.

 1.34 The separatists and anti-national
 elements continue in their efforts to disrupt the prevailing calm in J&K. However, the security situation in the State has substantially improved, on account of the effective operations of the Army, the CAPF and the State government. Effective counter terrorism operations by the Army and other security forces have resulted in the successful elimination of a number of hardcore

10


###### 1.35 The security situation in the North
 East is stable and violence levels have declined substantially over the last year. Over 47 militant groups are presently in ceasefire/ suspension of operations and talks, creating a conducive atmosphere for implementation of conflict resolution measures.

 1.36 In a global and regional
 security environment characterized by unpredictability and volatility, India’s
 defence forces remain prepared to tackle the full spectrum of security challenges. Concurrently, India remains engaged with the regional and global community through a network of cooperative, constructive and mutually beneficial relationships, in a manner which would serve national interests and also contribute to the larger interests of global peace and stability.

### the Indian Army is committed to the defence of the country
###### from external and internal threats across the entire spectrum of warfare.


###### SECURITY OVERVIEW

 3.1 The changing global geo-political
 dynamics presents the Nation with multiple security challenges. While constantly
 reviewing its operational preparedness/ postures to meet the perceived security challenges, the Indian Army (IA) is
 committed to the defence of the country from external and internal threats across the entire spectrum of warfare. Also, in times of disaster/ natural calamities, the Indian Army is at the forefront, providing aid and succour to the affected people.

 JAMMU AND KASHMIR
 3.2 The security situation in J&K is stable
 but fragile. The terror infrastructure across the border remains intact and Pakistan’s support to the proxy war being waged in the State continues unabated. The Pakistan –Terrorists–Separatist nexus continues
 its attempts to undermine the democratic process in the State.

 3.3 A large number of tourists visiting
 J&K and an incident free Amarnath

20


###### Yatra are some positive indicators which
 need to be built upon. However, the

 situation in J&K is at crossroads and

 needs consolidation by synergised efforts

 of the Security Forces and the Civil

 Administration.

 3.4 Situation along the border: The

 ceasefire along the Actual Ground Position

 Line (AGPL), Line of Control (LC) and

 International Border (IB) Sector in Jammu

 and Kashmir has generally held, barring a

 few aberrations which has been restricted to

 certain sectors along the LC and IB Sector.

 However, there has been an increase in

 the number of Cease Fire Violations (CFVs)

 during 2013 as compared to the previous

 two years. In this context, a meeting of DGs

 MO of India and Pakistan was held after a

 long gap on December 24, 2013 to address

 the issue of ceasefire violations. Pursuant to

 these talks, the number of CFVs has come

 down in 2014. 

 3.5 Relentless Counter Terrorism

 operations by the Army have resulted in


-----

###### attrition and neutralisation of terrorists and

 their leadership.

 NORTH EAST
 3.6 The prevailing security situation
 in the North East excluding Manipur has stabilized due to the concerted efforts of Army, Assam Rifles and other security forces under the overall aegis of the Central and State Governments. Violence levels have subsided significantly as compared to previous years. Presently, talks/ Suspension of Operation (SoO)/ Cease Fire (CF) are underway with 17 major groups. State-wise security situation in the North –East is detailed as under:  

 3.7 Assam:  The security situation in
 the State is peaceful and under control.  Calibrated operations by the Security Forces have significantly reduced violent activities of terrorist groups in the State. The Security Forces have established moral ascendancy over them.

 3.8 Nagaland:  Overall violence
 levels in the State have declined but inter- factional clashes between NSCN (K) and NSCN (K/K), which emerged after the split in NSCN (K), are continuing unabated as both these factions are trying to enhance their respective areas of influence. The Army and Assam Rifles are keeping the Under Ground groups under check and ensuring adherence of Ceasefire Ground Rules. Process for finding a permanent solution to the Naga issue is underway.

21


###### 3.9 Manipur: The security situation in
 Manipur, despite reduction in violence levels, continues to remain tense.Operations by the Army and Assam Rifles (AR) are continuing. The de-notified area of Imphal Valley has emerged as the hub of violent activities in the state. SoO with Kuki and Zomi Under Grounds Groups has ushered peace in the Kuki and Zomi inhabited areas and they have been impressed upon to adhere to the SoO ground rules. 

 3.10 Arunachal Pradesh: The situation,
 though under control, remains dynamic as a result of the turf war presently underway between NSCN (IM) and NSCN (K). Intelligence reports indicate that the region is being exploited by insurgent groups for movement of cadres and arms/ ammunition from/ to Myanmar and proactive operations are being conducted by the Security Forces.

 3.11 Tripura and Mizoram: The security
 situation is under control. The assembly elections have been conducted peacefully in both the states.

 Situation Along the Border
 3.12 Bilateral relations with China:
 Relations between the two nations
 have improved over the past few years.  Constructive engagement at the political, diplomatic and military level is continuing with regular military exchanges from time to time. The visit of Chinese Premier to India

 MODERNISATION AND EQUIPMENT
 3.22 The major Army acquisitions are
 focused on building new capabilities as well as making up deficiencies in the inventory. With Defence Procurement Procedure- 2013 coming into effect, indigenization will get due impetus. The Army also carried out alignment of the acquisition structures by streamlining the evolution of General Staff Qualitative Requirements (GSQRs), establishment of a Contracts Negotiation Committee (CNC) Cell and inclusion of Integrated Financial Adviser (IFA) Capital for delegated financial powers and strengthening of the Request for Proposal (RFP) Cell. All these measures have made the system more robust and efficient.

 3.23 During the Financial Year 2012-13, a
 total of 29 contracts (including three of OFB contracts) were concluded. The total value of procurement contracted was `6332.20 Crore (including ` 6132.17 Crore of OFB procurement) and the total cash outgo was  ` 764.41 Crore. 

 3.24 During the current Financial Year, i.e.
 2013-14, a total of 18 contracts (including two OFB contracts) have been concluded amounting to ` 11781.13 Crore (including ` 1632.17 Crore of OFB contracts) and total cash outgo was `1265.26 Crore as on December 31, 2013.

###### 3.25 Mechanised Forces: Modernisation

 of the mechanized forces is underway to meet

 the requirements of the future battle field.

 Towards this end, upgradation of aspects

 of in-service equipment like night fighting

 capability, modern fire control systems and

 better power packs has been the thrust area.

 Concurrently, the indigenous development

 of future combat vehicle platforms is also

 being progressed.

 3.26 Artillery: Procurement of Artillery

 equipment is focused on conversion of

 equipment to 155 mm caliber, enhancing

 surveillance capabilities and acquisition of

 long range vectors. In a major step towards

 self reliance in Defence equipment, the

 indent for electronically upgraded 155 mm

 Guns has been placed on the Ordnance

 Factory Board.

 3.27 Infantry:  Modernisation of the

 infantry soldier is aimed at enhancing

 lethality and providing individual protection.

 To this end, procurement of modern Assault

 Rifles, Carbines and LMGs is concurrently

 underway, alongwith Bullet Proof Jackets


###### taking major strides in upgrading its gun

 and missile systems. A number of quality

 upgrades and inductions which are in the

 pipeline would replace the existing vintage

 equipment. The project for automation of Air

 also progressing apace.

 3.29 Common Equipment: In addition

 to acquisitions specific to different arms,

 induction of High Mobility Vehicles,

 Materials Handling Equipment and critical

 Rolling Stock for rail movement are in

 the pipeline. Modernisation of logistics

 installations with state of the art warehousing

 facilities, retrieval and accounting systems is

 also underway.

 facilitated operations and assisted in

 ushering of near normalcy in the State

 of Jammu and Kashmir. A number of

 successful tactical military operations

 based on specific intelligence were

 conducted resulting in neutralization of

 a large number of terrorists and recovery

 of huge quantities of warlike and logistic

 stores. This operational success with zero

 collateral damage is a manifestation of

 the professional excellence of the Force. 

 3.32 Given the impending exit of extra

 regional powers from Afghanistan in 2014,

 along with the National and State Assembly

 elections scheduled in 2014, there exists a

 need for RR to constantly keep its guard up

 and maintain utmost vigil.

 3.33 Over the years, RR has excelled

 in all spheres and has now woven itself

 inextricably into the fabric of J&K. This

 year was no different, when this force

 not only kept terrorism at highly reduced

 levels, but provided yeoman service to

 the people of J&K in the form of civic

 action/ programmes aimed at integration

 of the locals in the national mainstream.

 It will be the endeavour of the Force to

 completely eliminate terrorism from the

 State and continue to guide the populace,

26


###### particularly the youth, to join the national

 mainstream. In doing so the aspirations

 of the people and complete avoidance

 of human rights violations, as done in

 the past, will be the important guiding

 parameters.

### The objective of the Navy’s military role is deterrence/
###### dissuasion against any intervention or act which is against our National interests, and the ability to inflict a crushing defeat on the adversary in the event of hostilities.


###### 4.1  The Indian Navy (IN) is the prime
 enabler and guarantor of the country’s maritime sovereignty and myriad use- of-sea activities. This is discharged by the Indian Navy through its four roles – military, diplomatic, constabulary and
 benign. The objective of the Navy’s military role is deterrence/ dissuasion against any intervention or act which is against our National interests, and the ability to inflict a crushing defeat on the adversary in the event of hostilities. Indian Navy’s deployments for coercion, as demonstrated during Operation VIJAY and Operation PARAKRAM, will also remain key missions of the Indian Navy. A major objective of the Navy’s Constabulary role is to ensure coastal security and implement anti-piracy measures. 

 4.2  India is a maritime nation and our economy is critically dependent on the seas for conduct of trade. More than 90% of our trade by volume, and 77% by value, is transported over the seas. For a rapidly growing economy seeking new markets worldwide, these trade figures will only spiral

30


###### upwards in the future. This would result in the enhanced use of the seas for economic development including shipping, fishing, natural and energy resource extraction, and security of our offshore and coastal assets, etc.

 4.3 A key objective of the Indian Navy
 is to use India’s maritime power in support of the national foreign policy. The Navy discharges this role by shaping perceptions, building partnerships, showing presence, building trust with other friendly navies and participating in Combined/ Joint operations. The use of the Indian Navy for disaster relief operations, both within the country and abroad, as part of the Navy’s benign role, would continue to provide options to the national leadership.

 4.4 The IN is being increasingly called
 upon to address issues pertaining to safety, security and stability in the region. As a responsible nation and a benign maritime neighbour, enforcement of international laws, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR)

###### security environment in the IOR requires the IN to maintain a high level of operational tempo and readiness at all times. Besides a large number of operational deployments, the IN has successfully undertaken exercises with the navies of a number of friendly foreign countries. These exercises have helped in strengthening bilateral relationships, cementing our
 professional ties and streamlining inter- operability issues.

 4.5 Piracy continues to remain a major
 area of concern in the IOR and specifically in the Horn of Africa. During its anti- piracy patrols the IN has been successful in thwarting 40 attacks on Indian and foreign merchant ships since October 23, 2008. Our continued presence in the piracy infested areas off the Gulf of Aden has demonstrated our commitment and resolve to deal with this threat. The role and responsibility of the IN to protect our maritime interests will continue to grow with the requirement to safeguard our expanding economic interests as also the leadership responsibilities associated with being a mature and responsible regional maritime power. Indian warships have been carrying out patrol in the Gulf of Aden

31


###### flagged vessels, have been escorted safely

 by Indian warships. To optimise the escort

 operations, the Indian Navy coordinates

 patrol by the IN warship with that of the

 other navies.

 4.6 The IN has wholeheartedly

 supported indigenisation programmes, in

 consonance with our overall national vision

 of sustained growth and self-reliance. It is

 a matter of significant achievement that

 the modernisation programme of the IN

 is focused towards indigenous warship

 construction. Our preferred choice is to

 induct ships and submarines through the

 indigenous route. Currently, all the 45 ships

 and submarines presently on order are being

 built in Indian Public and Private shipyards

 OVERSEAS OPERATIONS

 4.7 Overseas Deployment (OSD):

 Overseas Deployments (OSD) are

 undertaken by ships of the Indian Navy

 for the purposes of Flag showing, fostering

 A Defining Moment in DRDO and India’s History


-----

### DRDO has maintained a constant focus on incorporating
###### latest technologies so as to keep systems contemporary and comparable with the best in the world.


###### BACKGROUND

 8.1 Defence Research and Development

 Organisation (DRDO) is the Research and

 Development arm of the Ministry of Defence,

 created with the mandate of providing

 technological solutions for India’s Armed

 Forces. DRDO was created in 1958 when

 Technical Development Establishments

 (TDEs) of the Indian Army and the

 Directorate of Technical Development and

 Production (DTDP) were amalgamated with

 the Defence Science Organisation (DSO).

 During the eighties DRDO emerged as a

 system developer when it took up design

 of India’s first Main Battle Tank (MBT) and

 the Integrated Guided Missile Development

 Programme (IGMDP). In the nineties, DRDO

 initiated development of the Light Combat

 Aircraft (LCA) and Electronic Warfare

 (EW) systems, while Radar and Sonar

 development was continued. In the early

 2000s, DRDO launched next generation

 systems and its activities have touched

 virtually every area of defence requirement

82


###### from life support systems for soldiers to

 the sophisticated ballistic missile defence

 program. DRDO has maintained a constant

 focus on incorporating latest technologies

 so as to keep systems contemporary and

 comparable with the best in the world. All

 this has been achieved with a committed

 workforce of approximately 7,600 Scientists

 supported by about 10,000 technical staff,

 who have worked tirelessly to overcome

 the challenges of developing cutting edge

 technologies and systems.

 8.2 DRDO’s mandate covers the

 following broad activities:

l Design and development of products,

###### systems and technologies for India’s

 Armed Forces

l Providing advice to Raksha Mantri on

###### matters of technology with respect to

###### Appendix-III


###### (II) Report No. 13 of 2013 on Compliance Audit Observations


###### Highlights of significant paras included in the Report are given below:

 MINISTRY OF DEFENCE

 1. Ministry of Defence sanctioned in
 July 1999, design and development of an Intermediate Jet Trainer (UT) by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) at a cost of `180 crore to be completed by July 2004. Though the design and development of UT was yet to reach the stage of obtaining approval for Initial Operational Clearance (IOC), the Ministry also sanctioned concurrent handling of Limited Series Production (LSP) (March 2006) and Series Production (SP) (March 2010) by HAL. Audit observed the following:

 IOC originally scheduled for March 2007 had not been achieved even after six years of delay. The development was beset with a number of failures at various stages.

 Set back to the scheduled timelines for different stages was due to non-freezing of engine design, change in weight of engine and experimenting with engine of inadequate thrust. Accidents to both the prototypes after completion of the prescribed number of flights resulted in suspension of flight test


###### activities and modifications for strengthening the structure of the aircraft.

 The prescribed procedure for fabrication and testing of the Structural Test Specimen whereby the basic airframe was to be tested to one-and-a-half times the designed load to prove the robustness of the design was not adhered to in respect of the first prototype. This resulted in cracking of specimen fuselage even at less load, leading to fabrication of another wing entailing extra expenditure of `38.78 crore.

 Since the Company could not achieve refinement of stall characteristics and spin testing, engagement of a consultant at a cost of `23.59 crore was done as late as in December 2012.

 Adoption of tentative purchase price for equipments /components while quoting for LSP resulted in extra expenditure of `63.59 crore.

 Against the original sanction for development of `180 crore, the project had already incurred an expenditure of `516 crore.

 Milestones set for release of funds to HAL were without linkage to definite and substantive physical progress. Against the


-----

###### sanctioned cost of `487 crore for LSP, the amount released by Ministry even before achievement of IOC was `444 crore. In respect of SP, against the sanction for `6180 crore, the releases amounted to `3075 crore but the expenditure was only `168 crore.

 Acceptance of reduced initial life of engine despite calling quotations for engine with unlimited total technical life and later seeking enhancement of life resulted in avoidable expenditure of `131 crore.

 Procurement of Line Replacement Units in advance of requirement resulted in warranty expired inventory of `114.76 crore.

 On account of non-delivery of aircraft as per requirement, the intermediate stage training to the pilots of IAF was adversely affected as of March 2013.

 (Para No. 7.8)

 2. Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL)
 was incorporated with the objective of manufacturing sophisticated Defence
 equipment required by the Armed Forces. BDL is a prime production agency for Guided Missiles in India. The Bhanur unit of BDL established (1988) for
 manufacturing Konkurs ATGM Systems and Unified Launchers was assigned with the production of Konkurs missiles since
 1989 as a part of the contract entered into by the MoD. Since Konkurs missile was


###### not defeating the tanks fitted with ERA panel, Army recognized (1994) the need for induction of Konkurs-M missile which is an advanced version of Konkurs and capable of defeating tanks protected by ERA.

 Audit observed that, the process of finalizing the contract took about eight years from the date of recognizing (1994) the need of improved version of Konkurs-M. Further, technology absorption took a longer time than anticipated and this led to delay in execution of the contract by three years and consequential delay in supply of 14,722 missiles resulted in loss of `283.72 crore besides levy of Liquidated Damages (LD) of
 `38.81 crore by the Army. The estimated loss for supply of the balance `13,278 missiles
 is `297.25 crore and the likely LD is `75.57 crore. BDL planned (August 2010) to enhance the capacity for production of missiles in two phases at a cost of `50 crore and `130 crore respectively. Phase- I was to be completed by March 2012 and phase- II by March 2013. Though the first phase was to be completed by March 2012, the capacity remained at the same level of 3000 missiles per annum, even after spending `59.27 crore till February 2013.

 Audit further observed that MoD,
 concluded a contract with M/s Rosoboron export for purchase of 10,000 Konkurs-M at a cost of `1223 crore for the Army on


-----

###### the ground that BDL had not been able to meet their contractual obligations due to problems in absorption of TOT. This indicates that the efforts of MoD to indigenize production of Konkurs-M missiles to avoid dependency on
 foreign suppliers was defeated despite
 buying technology at a cost of `249 crore from KBP under a contract concluded as early as in October 2002.

 (Para No. 7.3) 

 3. Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL)
 entered into a contract for procurement with a foreign vendor M/s Rheinmetall Air Defence, AG, Zurich (RAD) despite the fact that the CBI was investigating the firm’s deals for alleged corrupt practices in earlier contracts which had the risk of the firm being blacklisted. As the firm was eventually blacklisted, this led to blocking of BEL’s funds of `502.31 crore.

 (Para No. 7.4)

 4. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited
 (HAL) signed (January 2003), a Co- operation Agreement (agreement), with Turbomeca, France (TM) at a cost of
 `878.08 crore for co-development and indigenous production of 320 Shakti engines in five phases (0 to 4) by 2013. The assembly kits for various phases were to be supplied by TM at the agreed prices


###### subject to escalation (with 2002 as base year) valid up to the year of delivery.

 Audit observed that even· after more than a decade, the self-reliance in manufacture of an engine to suit requirements of ALH has not been achieved as envisaged. The need for variants of engines to operate at different climatic conditions and altitude was not foreseen leading to frequent modifications requiring more investment in terms of time and money. HAL had to bear additional burden due to the failure of TM, indicating undue favours extended to the foreign partner in the development and production of Shakti engines. Failure to ensure compliance to offset obligation by the foreign collaborator has so far denied an opportunity to the Indian industry to contribute towards self-reliance.
 Acquisition of additional technical know- how without optimal usage of free technical assistance has further contributed to extra
 cost on the project.

 Thus, inability of HAL to absorb the

 technology and non-assessment of the

 available in-house capacity to manufacture

 Shakti engines impacted timely induction of

 ALH into Defence forces and also resulted

 in avoidable extra expenditure of `204.27

 crore to HAL.

 (Para No. 7.7)

###### Executive Summary

 Background
 Five factories of Ordnance

 Equipment Group (OEFG) under the
 control of Ordnance Equipment Group Headquarters Kanpur (OEF HQ) and Ordnance Factory Board Kolkata (OFB) are engaged in production of general stores and clothing (GS&C) items to meet the requirements of the Services. Army is the main recipient of these items (around 77%).

 Mention was made in previous Audit
 Reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India about inefficient production planning, deficiencies in procurement of stores and machinery, underperformance in production, underutilization of resources, etc. in OEFG. Performance of these factories for the period 1999-2004 had been reviewed in audit during February-June 2004 and the results thereof were included in Paragraph 8.2 of Report No. 6 of 2005 of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. The performance of OEFG was reviewed by us afresh during January – July, 2011 with focus on the areas of production planning, utilisation of capacity, production and issue of GS&C products of specific quality at the right time to the Army (major recipient of the products). The data for the year 2011-12, wherever stated in this Report, was collected subsequently in April 2013.


###### The Performance Audit of these
 factories for the years 2008-12 brought out systemic deficiencies right from planning to execution.

 Key findings
 1.  Shortcomings in fixation of annual production targets

 Deficiencies including mismatch of
 the targets and capacity of the factories, delay in fixation of targets for annual production and subsequent unilateral reduction of targets by the factories persisted, which resulted in slippages in supply of items to the Army.

 (Chapter-III)

 2. Violation of procurement norms

 Paragraphs 3.1.1, 3.7.7, 4.6.1 and
 Annexure-47 of OFBs Material Management and Procurement Manual (MMPM) stipulate the procurement norms, procedures etc. We observed that procurement of stores in violation of these extant provisions in MMPM resulted in over-provisioning of stores worth ` 165.54 crore during 2008-11. Similarly, against the prescribed provision for 20 per cent purchases through open tender enquiry (OTE) in MMPM, four factories, in violation, made only 4 to 10 per cent of the purchases through OTE. An extra expenditure of
 ` 12.31 crore was observed in procurement of 14 items through 40 supply orders due to limited tender enquiry (LTE), instead of


-----

###### OTE. Further, in violation of OFB’s direction (April 2007), 107 supply orders valuing ` 94.33 crore were placed by OEFG even though the rates exceeded the reasonable limit of eight per cent over the last purchase rate. This manifests that reasonability of rates was not ensured before placing orders by the factories.

 Failure to break the suppliers’ cartel
 in line with the OFB’s instruction of July 2007 led to procurement of stores worth ` 33.91 crore through 102 orders from different suppliers, at identical rates.

 As compared to the specific
 timeframe stipulated in MMPM, there were significant delays (up to 1441 days) in placement of 4117 orders valuing ` 430.63 crore, out of 11689 orders placed by the five factories in 2008-12.

 (Chapter-IV)

 3. Slippages in production and issue of items to the Army

 In 116 out of 228 instances, the
 percentage of shortfalls in production and issue of GS&C items to the Army ranged between 21 and 100. The value of shortfalls in respect of 34 to 41 items out of 52 items analysed each year works out to ` 1147.13 crore during 2008-12. Besides, the value of issues to the Services spilled over to the next year amounts to ` 493.08 crore. The endemic slippages in issue of


###### GS&C items despite outsourcing of jobs and unilateral reduction of targets in many cases, caused serious concern to the Army. OEFG also failed to tap the potential needs of paramilitary forces as it catered only 2.62 per cent of their requirements (` 1068.36 crore) of GS&C items during 2008-12.

 (Chapter-V)

 4. Underutilization of resources

 Although the available standard
 man-hours was not fully utilised, the factory management allowed overtime payments of ` 48.68 crore to the Industrial Employees (IEs) in excess of actual requirement in 2008- 12. Besides, the factories made additional payment of ` 10.91 crore towards piece work profit to IEs in 2011-12. Use of machines on single shift also led to underutilization of capacity in the range of 45 to 69 per cent.

 (Chapter-VI)

 5. Poor quality control and assurance of products

 Inefficient manufacture and
 inadequate quality control by the factories led to increasing trend of ‘Returned for Rectification’ (RFR) at quality assurance stage even in respect of established items. High level of RFR beyond 20 per cent and up to 100 per cent was noticed in 72 out of 266 instances in respect of 31 items during 2008-12. There were final rejections of five


-----

###### items valuing ` 11.66 crore in two factories during 2009-11. Apart from regular customer complaints, we came across rejections worth ` 10.42 crore in five cases at the users’ end though the same were passed in inspection by Quality Assurance agencies.

 (Chapter-VII)

 6. Recurring loss in issue of products to the indentors

 Deficient pricing mechanism of OFB
 and ineffective cost control by the factories led to recurring losses in four factories during 2008-12 in issue of items to the indento` Net loss suffered by the OEFG worked out to ` 226.09 crore during 2008-12. Besides there was extra expenditure of ` 105.47 crore in 16 instances due to higher cost of production for common items at one factory compared to that of another factory. OEFG had the production share of only six per cent every year while it accounted for 16 to 18 per cent of direct labour cost of ordnance factory organisation as a whole during 2008- 12. OEFG could not tap potential market for its products due to their exorbitant price.

 (Chapter-VIII)

 7. Ineffective internal control and monitoring

 Inadequate internal control and
 lack of proper monitoring at the factories coupled with ineffective monitoring and guidance by the OEF HQ resulted in irregular


###### booking of labour charges on closed/ non- existent warrants, non-regularisation of losses arising from rejections/wastages and manufacture with excess or without drawal of material. The monitoring by the top level management on the working of OEFG was also inadequate.

 (Chapter-IX)

 Recommendations

l Ministry may ensure that the Army
###### and OFB, in close coordination, fix production targets taking into account Army’s requirement and capacity of OEFG. OFB should communicate its production capacity for each item to the Army well in advance before target fixation meetings.

l Ministry may ensure that the Army and

###### OFB hold target fixation meetings at the appropriate time so as to give the factories the required procurement lead time.

l OFB may ensure that the factories

###### adhere to the prescribed policy/
 guidelines in assessment of net
 requirement of stores for reliable and accurate provisioning to avoid excess procurement.

l The e-procurement system should

###### be implemented effectively in all the factories and all factories should maintain shareable database.


-----

l OFB may ensure that the procurement

###### agencies strictly adhere to the OFB’s guidelines of July 2007 to prevent cartelisation.

l Ministry may ensure that OEFG

###### formulate judicious production and procurement plan so as to achieve realistic production targets.

l A system should be institutionalised to

###### ensure that Army’s account is debited with simultaneous credit of ordnance factories’ account only after the stores are inspected and cleared by the consignee Army’s depots to plug the deficient accounting for spill-over
 issues.

l OFB may streamline the outsourcing

###### policy to minimise the outsourcing of jobs so as to ensure optimum capacity utilisation and also institute a mechanism to ensure reasonableness of rates.

l OFB should generate a database at OEF

###### HQ with the latest and reasonable rates for outsourcing of jobs which can be shared by all factories.

l OFB may ensure that the factories plan

###### their production activities efficiently, deploy their manpower judiciously in tune with the workload requirements and fully utilise the available SMH before resorting to work on overtime payment.


l Ministry may ensure that OFB follow

###### the correct methodology for making payment towards piece-work profit by excluding additional 25 per cent over and above the output SMH booked.

l OFB should operationalise two-shift

###### working in the factories to increase the productivity and to optimise capacity utilisation.

l OFB should put in place a system of

###### periodical review of inventory holding at different factories as well as take prompt action to dispose of all surplus/ obsolete/non-moving/waste after proper identification.

l OFB must ensure that the factories

###### diligently follow the prescribed norms for inspection of input materials.

l OFB may ensure that factories adhere to

###### 100 per cent pre-inspection as required, by independent Quality Control staff of the factories.

l Ministry may ensure that OEFG generate

###### reliable cost-data for enforcing strict cost control on the products.

l Ministry may ensure that the OFB and

###### the factories strengthen their internal control and monitoring mechanism, especially in planning and production, accounting and documentation of the related activities.

l A comprehensive and effective internal


-----

###### control system must be put in place by the OEFG to avoid irregularities in booking of labour charges and manufacture with excess or without drawal of materials.

 Report No. 10 of 2013
 Acquisition of helicopter for VVIPs

l The Communication Squadron of

###### the Indian Air Force (IAF) maintains a fleet of aircraft and helicopters for providing air transportation to VVIPs. IAF proposed (August 1999) to replace Mi-8 helicopters in this squadron with an advanced version of helicopters due to their ageing and; operational limitations. Ministry of Defence (MoD) concluded a contract (February 2010) with M/s Agusta Westland International Ltd., UK for the procurement of 12 numbers of AW-101 helicopters at a total cost of ` 3726.96 crore (Euro 556,262,026). Compliance audit of acquisition of VVIP helicopters was conducted and the key findings of audit are highlighted below:

l The initial RFP issued in March 2002 for

###### replacement of present Mi-8 helicopters stipulated a mandatory altitude
 requirement of 6000 metre. The EH-101 helicopter (later renamed as AW-101 of Agusta Westland) could not be field evaluated as it was certified to fly up to


###### an altitude of 4572metre only. The first RFP was subsequently cancelled due to emergence of a resultant single vendor situation. In the revised RFP issued in 2006 the ‘mandatory SQR relating to altitude requirement of 6000 metre was reduced to 4500 metre and a cabin height of atleast 1.8 metre was introduced.
 While mandatory requirement of
 minimum cabin height of 1.8 metre reduced the competition, the lowering of altitude requirement was against the inescapable operational requirement of 6000 metre for transportation to many areas in North and North East. The purpose of reframing the SQRs i.e. avoidance of a resultant single vendor situation, could not be met because even with the revision of SQRs, the acquisition process again led to a resultant single vendor situation and AW-101 of Agusta Westland was selected.

l The initial RFP of March 2002 issued

###### to eleven vendors was ‘cancelled due to reservations of PMO as it resulted in a single vendor situation. In the revised RFP of 2006, instead of making the SQRs broad based to increase the competition, these were made more restrictive thereby narrowing down the choices to a limited range of helicopte The revised RFP was issued only to six ‘vendo’.


-----

l The Field Evaluation Trial of AW-101

###### of Agusta Westland was conducted on representative helicopters Merlin MK-3A and Civ-01 and mock-up of the passenger cabin and not on the actual helicopter whereas actual S-92 helicopter of Sikorsky was evaluated. Even at the stage of the FET, the helicopter offered by Agusta Westland was still in its developmental phase. Evaluation of helicopters following different methodologies could not give the desired assurance that equal opportunity was provided to both the shortlisted vendo’.

l Several instances have been observed

###### where the Ministry had deviated from the provisions of the DPP-2006 and RFP issued in September 2006. While approval for deviation was required to be obtained with extreme caution and in exceptional circumstances, the frequent deviations made in this case are counter to the principal aim with which Paragraph 75 of the DPP-2006 has been incorporated.

l IAF continued to face operational

###### disadvantage on the existing helicopters due to inordinate delay of more than 10 years in finalizing the acquisition process.

l Despite the emphasis laid in the

###### DPP-2006 on determination of


###### reasonableness of price for the purpose of benchmarking, the benchmarked cost (` 4871.5 crore) arrived at by CNC was unreasonably high and thus it had provided no realistic basis for comparison with the offered cost
 (` 3966 crore) of helicopters for price negotiations.

l Additional procurement of 4 helicopters

###### at a cost of ` 1240 crore was avoidable as assessed requirement was not commensurate with the low. utilisation levels of existing helicopters providing transportation to VVIPs in the past.

l Agusta Westland had projected

###### seven programmes which were to be completed as part of the offset contract. The allowed offsets were not compliant with the DPP, besides many Indian Offset Partners (IOPs) selected for discharge of offset obligations were not eligible.

l There was ambiguity in the offset

###### contract regarding the type of services and export orders to be executed by IDS Infotech (Indian Offset Partner). Agusta Westland gave an year-wise break up of work from 2011 to 2014 to be executed by IDS Infotech under this offset programme even though the work had been completed well before ‘the conclusion of the contract in 2010.
