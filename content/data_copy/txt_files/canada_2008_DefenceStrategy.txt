**A Message from the Prime Minister**

This Government took office with a firm commitment to
stand up for Canada. Fulfilling this obligation means keeping
our citizens safe and secure, defending our sovereignty, and
ensuring that Canada can return to the international stage as
a credible and influential country, ready to do its part.
Rebuilding the Canadian Forces into a first-class, modern
military is a fundamental requirement if we are to deliver on
these goals.

We have already begun to deliver results on the _Canada First Defence_
Strategy by acquiring urgently needed equipment such as C-17
Globemaster transport aircraft. Now we are setting a comprehensive,
long-term plan that will provide the Canadian Forces with the people,
equipment and support they need to carry out their core missions in
Canada, in North America and abroad.

Supported by predictable, long-term funding, the Strategy not only delivers
increased security for Canadians, but also significant economic benefits for
citizens across the country. By unveiling a detailed plan for the future
replacement of key equipment fleets, we are providing Canadian industry
the opportunity to more effectively meet defence procurement requirements, and to position themselves for global excellence.

Canadians are rightly proud of the vital contributions made each and every
day by our men and women in uniform. With the Canada First Defence
Strategy and the detailed plans we have presented in this document, they
should now be equally confident that their military will have the tools and
resources it needs to defend the country and be a positive force in the
world, both today and in the years to come.

The Right Honourable
Stephen Joseph Harper

**A Message from the Minister of National Defence**

It is my privilege to introduce this comprehensive strategy for
the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces,
which builds on the vision that the Government has progressively laid out since coming to power in January 2006.

The Canada First Defence Strategy puts forward clear roles
and missions for the armed forces, outlining a level of ambition that will enable them to protect Canadians from the
variety of threats and challenges they may face in the years to
come. It calls for the Canadian Forces to support the Government’s broader
national security and foreign policy objectives by maintaining the ability to
deliver excellence at home, be a strong and reliable partner in the defence of
North America, and project leadership abroad by making meaningful
contributions to operations overseas.

Building on the significant investments made in our armed forces over the
last two years, this document sets out a detailed plan to modernize the
Canadian Forces. Providing balanced investments across the four pillars
upon which military capabilities are built – personnel, equipment, readiness and infrastructure – our plan will increase the size of the Forces and
replace their core capabilities. The implementation of this 20-year plan
will provide Canada with a strengthened, state-of-the-art military and
the predictable funding that Canadian industry needs to position itself
effectively to meet the Forces’ equipment and technology requirements
over the long haul.

The Canada First Defence Strategy represents a major milestone. It fulfills
the Government’s commitment to provide enhanced security for Canadians
and gives the military the long-term support it so critically needs and
deserves, now and in the future.

#### Canada First deFenCe strategy

##### exeCutive summary


The _Canada First Defence Strategy provides a_
detailed road map for the modernization of the
Canadian Forces, building on the Government’s
investments in the military since taking office in
2006. It will produce a first-class, modern military
that is well trained, well equipped and ready to take
on the challenges of the 21st century. This Strategy
is based on the Government’s vision for defence as
well as an extensive and rigorous analysis of the
risks and threats facing Canada and Canadians in
the years to come. Starting from the Government’s
clearly defined roles and level of ambition for the
Canadian Forces, the Strategy identifies the military
capabilities required to meet these objectives, which
in turn determine where investments are most
needed. This Strategy also takes into account valuable lessons drawn from recent experience at home
and around the globe.

Through stable and predictable defence funding,
the Canada First Defence Strategy provides the
planning certainty required to allow the
Government to continue rebuilding the Canadian
Forces into the state-of-the-art military that
Canada needs and deserves. It also presents
unprecedented opportunities for Canadian
industry in its reach for global excellence.

**A Modern Military with Clearly Defined**
**Missions and Capabilities**

The Government has established a level of ambition for the Canadian Forces that will enable
them to meet the country’s defence needs,


enhance the safety and security of Canadians and
support the Government’s foreign policy and
national security objectives. To fulfill these commitments, the Canadian Forces must be able to
deliver excellence at home, be a strong and reliable partner in the defence of North America,
and project leadership abroad by making meaningful contributions to international security.

The military will deliver on this level of ambition by
maintaining its ability to conduct six core missions
within Canada, in North America and globally, at
times simultaneously. Specifically, the Forces will
have the capacity to:

-  Conduct daily domestic and continental operations, including in the Arctic and through
NORAD;

-  Support a major international event in Canada,
such as the 2010 Olympics;

-  Respond to a major terrorist attack;

-  Support civilian authorities during a crisis in
Canada such as a natural disaster;

-  Lead and/or conduct a major international
operation for an extended period; and

-  Deploy forces in response to crises elsewhere in
the world for shorter periods.

To carry out these missions, the Canadian Forces
will need to be a fully integrated, flexible, multi-role
and combat-capable military, working in partnership with the knowledgeable and responsive civilian
personnel of the Department of National Defence.
This integrated Defence team will constitute a core

element of a whole-of-government approach to
meeting security requirements, both domestically
and internationally.

**A Military with Stable, Predictable Funding**

The Canada First Defence Strategy is supported by
a strategic investment plan based on a commitment
to provide predictable funding increases over a
20-year period. Building on Budget 2006, which
increased defence baseline funding by $5.3 billion
over 5 years, the Government has committed
through Budget 2008 to raise the annual increase in
defence funding to 2 percent from the current
1.5 percent starting in fiscal year 2011–12. Over the
next 20 years, these increases will expand National
Defence’s annual budget from approximately
$18 billion in 2008-09, to over $30 billion in
2027–28. In total, the Government plans to invest
close to $490 billion in defence over this period.
Most importantly, the infusion of reliable funding
will provide the certainty required to conduct longterm planning and meet future requirements.

**A Military with the Right Equipment**
**and Training**

Significant progress towards these objectives has
been achieved through a number of key initiatives,
including funded increases in the Regular Forces and
the procurement of urgently needed equipment. In
addition to the acquisition of four C-17 Globemaster
strategic lift aircraft already in service, the Government
is procuring 17 new C-130J Hercules tactical lift
aircraft and has announced plans to acquire 16
CH-47F Chinook helicopters, three replenishment
ships, 2,300 trucks, up to 100 Leopard 2 tanks and
6–8 Arctic/offshore patrol ships.

The Government will continue to enhance the
capacity of the Forces through balanced investments
across the four pillars that form the foundation of
military capabilities – personnel, equipment, readiness and infrastructure. Specifically, National
Defence will:



-  Increase the number of military personnel to
70,000 Regular Forces and 30,000 Reserve Forces;

-  Replace the Forces’ core equipment fleets,
including:

-  15 ships to replace existing destroyers and
frigates;

-  10 to 12 maritime patrol aircraft;

-  17 fixed-wing search and rescue aircraft;

-  65 next-generation fighter aircraft; and

-  a fleet of land combat vehicles and systems.

-  Strengthen the overall state of the Forces’
readiness to deploy, and their ability to sustain
operations once deployed; and

-  Improve and modernize defence infrastructure.

**A Military in Partnership with Canadian**
**Industry**

The _Canada First Defence Strategy will also_
have significant benefits for Canadian industry.
The infusion of long-term stable funding it
provides will enable industry to reach for global
excellence and to be better positioned to compete for defence contracts at home and abroad,
thus enabling a pro-active investment in research
and development and opportunities for domestic
and international spin-offs as well as potential
commercial applications.

**Moving Forward**

The _Canada First Defence Strategy will enable the_
Forces to meet the Government’s commitments and
address the full range of defence and security challenges facing Canada now and into the future. This
strengthened military will translate into enhanced
security for Canadians at home as well as a stronger
voice for Canada on the world stage. Recognizing
that global security challenges and the capabilities
required to meet them will continue to evolve, the
Government is committed to reviewing this comprehensive plan on a regular basis to ensure that it continues to fully meet the needs of the military in service
of Canadians.

##### i. intrOduCtiOn

Defending Canadians from threats to their safety
and well-being is a critical role for government. To
deliver on this core responsibility, the Government
is committed to rebuilding the Canadian Forces
into a first-class, modern military. Starting in 2006,
the Government began laying the foundation for a
more integrated, adaptive and capable force by
recognizing that the military is a vital national
institution essential to the security and prosperity
of Canada and by making initial but significant
investments to address critical gaps in personnel
and equipment. The Canada First Defence Strategy
translates this vision of a first-class, modern military
into a comprehensive 20-year investment plan.

Building an effective military is an ongoing process
and requires clear strategic goals. As part of the
_Canada First Defence Strategy, the Government_
established explicit objectives for the Canadian Forces.
These objectives were derived from a thorough assessment of the Government’s expectations for the
Forces at home and abroad, the capabilities needed
to achieve the desired operational outcomes, and
the resources required to generate the required
capabilities over a 20-year planning period.

##### developing the strategy


Over the last two years, the Government has been
engaged in a rigorous planning exercise that has
taken into account Canada’s defence and security
challenges, recent operational experience and current and future demands on the military, including
scenarios of possible missions that the Canadian
Forces might be asked to undertake. This allowed
the Government to generate a detailed level of
ambition for the Forces and determine the military capabilities needed to carry out essential
missions. This exercise, in turn, helped identify
where investments were most needed in order to
fill gaps across the four pillars upon which military
capabilities are built – personnel, equipment,
readiness and infrastructure.

This analysis informed the development of the
Government’s 20-year plan aimed at strengthening
key military capabilities through focused investments in each of the pillars. Supported by increased,
predictable long-term funding, the Strategy will
deliver a balanced, multi-role, combat-capable
force that will give the Government the necessary
flexibility to respond to a full range of challenges in
the years ahead.

##### ii. strategiC envirOnment
# II

Canadians live in a world characterized by volatility
and unpredictability. Looking back, it is clear that
the peace dividend that resulted from the end of the
Cold War was relatively short-lived. The 1990s saw
the emergence of difficult security challenges,
including failed and failing states, civil wars and
global terrorism. Many countries, including Canada,
were slow to fully appreciate and adjust to these
new realities. During this period, governments
dramatically under-invested in the Canadian Forces,
leaving them seriously unprepared to deal effectively
with this increasingly complex global environment.

Today we live in an uncertain world, and the security
challenges facing Canada are real. Globalization
means that developments abroad can have a profound impact on the safety and interests of
Canadians at home. Indeed, the terrorist attacks of
September 11th, 2001 and those carried out since,
demonstrate how instability and state failure in
distant lands can directly affect our own security
and that of our allies.

Ethnic and border conflicts, fragile states, resurgent
nationalism and global criminal networks continue
to threaten international stability. In addition,
unequal access to resources and uneven economic
distribution are proving to be increasing sources of
regional tension even as existing low-intensity or
frozen conflicts in Africa, South Asia, the Middle
East and the Balkans remain largely unresolved.

The proliferation of advanced weapons and the
potential emergence of new, nuclear-capable
adversarial states headed by unpredictable regimes
are particularly worrisome, as is the pernicious
influence of Islamist militants in key regions. The
ongoing buildup of conventional forces in Asia
Pacific countries is another trend that may have a
significant impact on international stability in
coming years.


Canada also faces challenges on the home front.
Catastrophic events such as floods, forest fires, hurricanes and earthquakes can overwhelm local capabilities. Over the last decade, our military has been
called upon to assist civil authorities in dealing with
a number of natural disasters, including floods in
Manitoba and Quebec, the ice storm in Eastern
Canada, and forest fires in British Columbia. As
Hurricane Katrina has shown in the United States,
such disasters will continue to occur, often with
devastating consequences, and the citizens affected
will expect immediate responses.

Other challenges to domestic security include possible terrorist attacks, human and drug trafficking,
foreign encroachments on Canada’s natural resources,
and potential outbreaks of infectious disease. Should
the need arise, the Canadian Forces are ready to play
an important role in supporting their emergency
management partners across Canada.

In Canada’s Arctic region, changing weather patterns
are altering the environment, making it more accessible
to sea traffic and economic activity. Retreating ice
cover has opened the way for increased shipping, tourism and resource exploration, and new transportation
routes are being considered, including through the
Northwest Passage. While this promises substantial
economic benefits for Canada, it has also brought new
challenges from other shores. These changes in the
Arctic could also spark an increase in illegal activity,
with important implications for Canadian sovereignty
and security and a potential requirement for additional
military support.

The Government has committed to making sure that
Canada has the tools it needs to deal with the full range
of threats and challenges to Canada and Canadians.
The Canada First Defence Strategy represents a major
step in this direction by giving the Canadian Forces the
capabilities they need to operate effectively in today’s –
and tomorrow’s – uncertain environment.

##### iii. rOLes OF tHe Canadian FOrCes

**A CLEAR LEVEL OF AMBITION**


In such a complex and unpredictable security environment, Canada needs a modern, well-trained and
well-equipped military with the core capabilities
and flexibility required to successfully address both
conventional and asymmetric threats, including
terrorism, insurgencies and cyber attacks. Indeed,
Canadians expect and deserve no less than a highly
capable military that can keep them safe and secure
while effectively supporting foreign policy and
national security objectives.

To this end, the Government is giving the Canadian
Forces clear direction concerning their three roles
– defending Canada, defending North America
and contributing to international peace and security
– as well as the types and numbers of missions it
expects our military to fulfill. This level of ambition
will see the Canadian Forces deliver excellence at
home, be a strong and reliable partner in the defence
of North America, and project leadership abroad
by contributing to international operations in support of Canadian interests and values.

**Defending Canada – Delivering Excellence**
**At Home**

First and foremost, the Canadian Forces must
ensure the security of our citizens and help exercise
Canada’s sovereignty. Canadians rightly expect their
military to be there for them in domestic crises. The
Forces must also work closely with federal government partners to ensure the constant monitoring of
Canada’s territory and air and maritime approaches,
including in the Arctic, in order to detect threats to
Canadian security as early as possible.

Excellence at home requires the Forces not only to
identify threats, but also to possess the capacity to
address them quickly and effectively. While, under


most circumstances, other government departments
and agencies will have leadership responsibilities,
the Canadian Forces will also play a vital role in
many situations. Canada Command was created in
2006 to provide a single operational authority for
such domestic operations and will work closely with
federal departments such as Public Safety Canada in
responding to a natural disaster or a terrorist attack.

**excellence at Home**

Delivering excellence at home requires the
Forces to **be aware of anything going**
on in or approaching our territory, **deter**
threats to our security before they reach
our shores, and **respond to contingen-**
cies anywhere in the country. Specifically,
it means that the military will maintain the
capacity to:

-  Provide surveillance of Canadian territory
and air and maritime approaches;

-  Maintain search and rescue response
capabilities that are able to reach those
in distress anywhere in Canada on a
24/7 basis;

-  Assist civil authorities in responding to
a wide range of threats – from natural
disasters to terrorist attacks.

The Forces must also be available to assist other
government departments in addressing such security concerns as over-fishing, organized crime,
drug- and people-smuggling and environmental
degradation. As well, the Forces will be prepared to
effectively assist other government departments in


-----

providing security for major events at home, such as

# III

the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games and the G8
Summit to be held in Canada that same year.

Finally, the Canadian Forces must have the capacity
to exercise control over and defend Canada’s
sovereignty in the Arctic. New opportunities are
emerging across the region, bringing with them
new challenges. As activity in northern lands
and waters accelerates, the military will play an
increasingly vital role in demonstrating a visible
Canadian presence in this potentially resourcerich region, and in helping other government
agencies such as the Coast Guard respond to
any threats that may arise.

**a strong, reliable defence Partner**

Being a credible partner in the defence
of North America requires the Canadian
Forces to:

-  Conduct daily continental operations
(including through NORAD);

-  Carry out bilateral training and exercises
with the United States;

-  Respond to crises; and

-  Remain interoperable with the US military.

**Defending North America – A Strong and**
**Reliable Partner**

Delivering excellence at home also helps us
contribute to the defence of North America in
cooperation with the United States, Canada’s
closest ally. Given our common defence and
security requirements, it is in Canada’s strategic
interest to remain a reliable partner in the
defence of the continent.


The Canadian Forces will continue to collaborate
with their US counterparts as a partner in the
North American Aerospace Defence Command
(NORAD). This binational command has been
an important element of the Canada–US defence
relationship since its creation in 1958, and its
primary mission of defending North American
aerospace remains important today. NORAD is
also evolving to meet future threats and, as part
of the May 2006 renewal of the Agreement, the
Command was assigned the new responsibility of
maritime warning.

Canada Command will continue to work with US
Northern Command in support of shared objectives.
The two Commands are dedicated to enhancing
military-to-military cooperation to provide assistance to civilian emergency response agencies in
the event of a crisis. The Forces are prepared to do
their part under such circumstances with the
approval of both governments and would expect
similar help in return.

Finally, the two nations’ armed forces will pursue
their effective collaboration on operations in North
America and abroad. To remain interoperable, we
must ensure that key aspects of our equipment and
doctrine are compatible. Accordingly, the Forces will
continue to participate in joint training exercises and
personnel exchanges with their US counterparts.

**Contributing to International Peace and**
**Security – Projecting Leadership Abroad**

As a trading nation in a highly globalized world,
Canada’s prosperity and security rely on stability
abroad. As the international community grapples
with numerous security threats, Canada must do its
part to address such challenges as they arise. Indeed,
tackling such threats at their source is an important
element in protecting Canada.


-----

to support and contribute to these key international

# III

bodies. In addition, the Canadian Forces will participate, where circumstances dictate, in missions
with like-minded states as a responsible member of
the international community.

Projecting leadership abroad can take many forms –
from taking part in a large international campaign, as
Canada is currently doing in Afghanistan, to leading
a specific component of a multinational operation,
such as a naval task group. One thing is clear, however: Canada cannot lead with words alone. Above
all else, leadership requires the ability to deploy
military assets, including “boots on the ground.” In
concert with its allies, Canada must be prepared to
act and provide appropriate resources in support of
national interests and international objectives.


Providing international leadership is vital if Canada is
to continue to be a credible player on the world stage.
This will require the Canadian Forces to have the
necessary capabilities to make a meaningful contribution across the full spectrum of international
operations, from humanitarian assistance to stabilization operations to combat.

Today’s deployments are far more dangerous, complex and challenging than in the past, and they
require more than a purely military solution. In
Afghanistan, for example, the Canadian Forces’
contribution is only one component, albeit an
essential one, of a “whole-of-government” approach.
Only by drawing upon a wide range of governmental expertise and resources will Canada be successful
in its efforts to confront today’s threats.

These operations will often be conducted under the
auspices of the United Nations and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. Canada will continue


**Projecting Leadership abroad: Lessons Learned from the afghanistan mission**

The Canadian Forces have learned many lessons from their complex mission in Afghanistan, and
will continue to incorporate those lessons into their operational planning and training. Among
other things, the Afghanistan mission has reinforced the need to:

-  Maintain combat-capable units at the right level of readiness.

-  Provide deployed personnel with the right mix of equipment so they can take part, on their
own or with allies, in the full spectrum of operations – from countering asymmetric threats
like improvised explosive devices, to contributing to reconstruction efforts in a harsh and
unforgiving environment.

-  Work closely and develop a coherent overarching strategy with departmental partners.

**Level of Ambition – Six Core Missions in Canada, in North America and Abroad**

The global security environment has seen significant change in recent years. We have witnessed
regional tensions escalate quickly into conflict and natural disasters turn into humanitarian
crises. Canada requires a military with the flexibility to respond to such challenges while
continuing to carry out essential, day-to-day missions. The Government has accordingly
established a level of ambition that will see the Forces carry out the following missions,
potentially all at the same time:

the damage done by major cuts to the defence
budget in the 1990s. Indeed, after defence spending peaked in the waning years of the Cold War,
funding for defence declined in real terms by
roughly 30 percent as the government of the day
dealt with the federal deficit.

**Challenge:**
At the end of the Cold War, the Canadian Forces
had a total strength of approximately 89,000 Regular
Force personnel. While this number declined to
below 60,000 in the 1990s, the military’s operational tempo significantly increased over the same
period, placing extreme stress on Canadian Forces
personnel. Operational fatigue, combined with the
demographic reality of an ageing workforce,
resulted over time in a “hollow force.” Faced with
new demands and the need to respond to new and
unforeseen crises, the Canadian Forces require
more recruits of higher quality with the right
knowledge and skills.

While its strength has increased, at current manning
levels of about 64,000 Regular and 26,000 Reserve
personnel, our military is still hard pressed to carry
out core operations at home and abroad.

**_Canada First Defence Strategy_**

**Previous initiatives:**
The Government will remedy this situation by
funding significant personnel growth. Budget 2006
provided funding to increase the effective strength
of the Regular Force to 68,000 personnel and the
Reserves to 26,000. These additional personnel will
help sustain international operations in coming
years, as well as supporting the Canadian Forces’
contribution to security efforts at the 2010 Olympics
in Vancouver.

**What is new:**
The _Canada First Defence Strategy provides the_
resources needed to expand the Forces to 70,000
Regular Force and 30,000 Reserve Force personnel.
This will give the Canadian Forces a total strength
of 100,000 to achieve the Government’s defence
objectives in Canada, on the continent and internationally, as well as positioning them for future
growth. This expansion will allow the military to
strengthen key joint and enabling capabilities,
including medical and maintenance technicians,


**sustaining a major Operation**

Maintaining 2,500 Canadian Forces personnel in Afghanistan requires a pool of
over 12,500. This includes 2,500 personnel in theatre for six months, 5,000
at different stages of training for upcoming rotations and 5,000 recovering
following their deployment, affording
the soldiers a minimum of 12 months
between deployments.

About 10,000 additional civilian and
military personnel are required in Canada to support the mission.

surveillance, reconnaissance and intelligence specialists, and special operations forces. This will be a
significant undertaking. The cost of increasing military strength by 1,000 regular personnel is about
$150 million annually – and this does not include
the associated equipment, infrastructure and training. Overall, just over 50 percent of National
Defence’s budget is spent on personnel.

**2. Equipment**

**Challenge:**
Serious and significant cuts to defence funding in
the 1990s resulted in an overall degradation of the
Forces’ equipment, affecting all three services. For
example, the navy had to dispose of one of its three
replenishment ships and one of its four destroyers;
the air force eliminated almost half its aircraft,
including Chinook helicopters, which are now
being urgently re-acquired for use in Afghanistan;
and the army lost a significant portion of its fighting
and utility vehicles. In today’s dangerous operational
environment, the Canadian Forces need robust and
modern equipment to fulfill their roles.


-----

**investing in People**

-  People are Defence’s most important resource. Both the Department and the Forces rely heavily
on the work and expertise of dedicated personnel to ensure the operational effectiveness of
the military.

-  Rebuilding the Forces into a first-class, modern military means recruiting the “best and the
brightest” that Canadian communities have to offer.

-  Recognizing the demographic challenges that will be facing the Canadian workforce in the
coming decades, Defence will continue to strive for excellence by:
-  Recruiting and retaining quality candidates that reflect the face of Canada;
-  Providing world-class technical training and advanced education;

-  Encouraging the continued development of a knowledge-based workforce;
-  Providing personnel with the highest level of health care possible; and
-  Integrating a motivated and effective Defence team comprising Regulars, Reserves
and civilians.


Looking ahead, several major equipment fleets will
reach the end of their operational lives within the
next 10 to 20 years, and will need to be replaced.
Decisions on acquiring critical new systems to
replace these ageing fleets must be made in the
near term.

**_Canada First Defence Strategy_**

**Previous initiatives:**
Over the last two years, the Government committed
significant resources to rebuilding the Forces and
made decisions related to the most urgent equipment
needs while continuing the analysis suppporting the
_Canada First Defence Strategy. During that period,_
the Government made significant commitments to
acquire urgently needed equipment. This included
C-17 Globemaster strategic and C-130J Hercules
tactical transport aircraft, CH-47F Chinook helicopters, Joint Support Ships and trucks to increase


the deployability of the military, modern Leopard II
tanks and mine-protected vehicles to enhance its
combat-capability, and Arctic/offshore patrol ships
to help the Forces operate in our northern waters.

These acquisitions are building a solid foundation for
the continued modernization and strengthening of
the military and will enable it to conduct operations
more effectively and safely, both at home and abroad.
However, more work remains to be done to ensure
that the Forces have all the tools they need to do
their job over the long term.

**What is new:**
Through this 20-year plan, based on a detailed assessment of requirements, the Government has committed
to renewing the Forces’ core equipment platforms.

These will preserve maximum flexibility in countering the range of threats facing Canada and include:


-----

**Destroyers and Frigates**
Starting in 2015, 15 ships to replace Canada’s destroyers and frigates.
While all these vessels will be based on a common hull design, the frigate
and destroyer variants will be fitted with different weapons, communications, surveillance and other systems. These new ships will ensure that
the military can continue to monitor and defend Canadian waters and
make significant contributions to international naval operations.

**Fixed Wing Search & Rescue Aircraft**
Starting in 2015, 17 fixed-wing search and rescue aircraft to replace
the current ageing fleet of Buffalo and Hercules aircraft. These new
platforms will help improve the military’s response to Canadians in
distress across this country’s vast territory and oceans.

**Fighters**
Starting in 2017, 65 next-generation fighter aircraft to replace the
existing fleet of CF-18s. These new fighters will help the military
defend the sovereignty of Canadian airspace, remain a strong and reliable
partner in the defence of North America through NORAD, and provide
Canada with an effective and modern air capability for international
operations.

**Maritime Patrol Aircraft**
Starting in 2020, 10-12 maritime patrol aircraft to replace the Aurora
fleet. The new aircraft will become part of a surveillance “system of systems”
that will also comprise sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites
and keep Canada’s maritime approaches safe and secure, including in
the Arctic.

**Land Combat Vehicles and Systems**
The progressive acquisition of a new family of land combat vehicles and
systems that will provide a robust and flexible capability for Canada’s
soldiers on high-risk missions abroad. The earliest investments in this
project will provide enhanced capabilities for use in Afghanistan.


-----

**3. Readiness**

**Challenge:**
Readiness refers to the Canadian Forces’ flexibility
and preparedness to deploy in response to
Government direction. It encompasses the resources
needed to maintain equipment, conduct training,
and prepare units for operations. Over the last
15 years, the military have been forced to economize
in this area. Fewer resources for training and spare
parts, coupled with an increasing operational tempo
and ageing equipment eroded the Canadian Forces’
preparedness to undertake operations on short notice.
Until recently, the resources allocated for the National
Procurement budget, which covers fuel, ammunition,
spare parts and maintenance, covered only 70 percent
of demand, significantly impeding the Forces’ ability
to train and maintain high readiness levels.

**_Canada First Defence Strategy_**

**Previous initiatives:**
The Government recognizes that, if they are to be
effective in such difficult and diverse environments as
the Arctic and Afghanistan, the Canadian Forces need
adequate resources for training, spare parts and equipment. Recent budget increases have begun to reverse
the decline in readiness and have funded more exercises for the army, more days at sea for the navy,
and more flying hours for the air force.

**What is new:**
The implementation of the Strategy’s 20-year plan
will further enhance the readiness of the Canadian
Forces. Planned, rather than ad-hoc investments
will improve and increase training for personnel.
In addition, such funding will provide further relief
and ensure that more personnel are trained to
required levels and that more equipment is available for both training and operations. Through this
Strategy, the Government is building a military
that can deploy more quickly and effectively.


Replacing these core platforms will require investments ranging between $45 billion and $50 billion in
acquisition capital costs. Under accrual budgeting
principles, these costs will be amortized over the
useful life of the equipment, which extends beyond
the time frame of the Strategy.

In addition to these major fleet replacement programs,
Defence will continue to make ongoing investments
in other capital projects to improve and replace key
existing equipment and capabilities. These projects
will focus on individual weapons, communications
equipment and smaller support vehicles. Defence will
also look at acquiring radars and satellites to improve
surveillance capabilities, especially in the Arctic.

Translating scientific advances into military capabilities is crucial to success in operations. The new equipment that will be acquired, including the fleet of land
combat vehicles and systems, the ships to replace the
frigates and destroyers and the next-generation fighter
aircraft, will incorporate advances in technology. New
command and control elements will exploit advances
in information systems, including miniaturization.

**readiness**

Since the early 1990s, readiness resources
have been cut to pay for higher priority
operational demands. This has resulted in:

-  a 30 percent reduction in sea days;

-  a 40 percent reduction in the average
number of hours that planes fly each
year; and

-  the ability to train only 30 percent of
land forces at high readiness.

The Canada First Defence Strategy will help
reverse this trend by allocating enough
resources to ensure that Canadian Forces
personnel and their equipment are ready to
deploy when and where they are needed.

**4. Infrastructure**

**Challenge:**
National Defence is the single largest property
holder in the federal government, owning approximately 21,000 buildings, 13,500 works (including
5,500 kilometres of roads, jetties, training areas,
etc.) and 800 parcels of land covering 2.25 million
hectares (four times the size of Prince Edward
Island). More than half of Defence’s infrastructure
is over 50 years old and much of its portfolio was
not designed for today’s operational requirements.
National Defence is also the custodian of a number
of heritage buildings and has a strong program to
promote environmental stewardship, including
thorough cleanup and remediation initiatives.

Following budget cuts in the 1990s, the resources
earmarked for infrastructure maintenance and
replacement were reduced significantly. As a result,
much of National Defence’s infrastructure is ageing
and in poor repair, and will require refurbishing or
replacement over the coming years.

**_Canada First Defence Strategy_**

**Previous initiatives:**
Beginning in 2006, the Government began to
address the infrastructure issue. For instance, the
new equipment acquisitions, such as the C-17
Globemaster and C-130J Hercules aircraft, include
funding for associated infrastructure projects. This
means that the cost of new hangars and other facilities directly related to these capabilities has already
been taken into account in the overall cost of these
projects. This new approach will reduce pressure on
the broader infrastructure budget.

**What is new:**
To ensure that the Canadian Forces have the facilities
they need, the _Canada First Defence Strategy_
includes measures that will result in an overall
improvement in the condition of defence infrastructure over the long term. In particular, our
military will benefit from new investment and the
ongoing implementation of a national approach


to responsible stewardship and risk management.
In concrete terms, Defence will move from spending an average of 2.5 percent of realty replacement
costs annually from 2000 to 2006, to an average
level of just under 4 percent annually over the next
20 years. Sufficient resources will also be set aside
for the future acquisitions required under this
Strategy to build or upgrade associated infrastructure. Overall, the Strategy aims to replace 25 percent
of existing infrastructure over 10 years and
50 percent over the next 20 years. In coming years,
National Defence will also further improve the
management of its heritage sites and continue to
promote and exercise environmental stewardship
in the conduct of its activities.

**Investment Plan**

The _Canada First Defence Strategy provides an_
affordable roadmap that encompasses initiatives in
all four pillars of military capability. To ensure that
the investments outlined in this document are
brought forward in a coherent way, National
Defence is developing a comprehensive, multi-year
Strategic Investment Plan. This Plan will assist
National Defence in implementing the Strategy by
helping to manage the complexity involved in balancing resources across the four pillars, including
the sequencing of key projects so that equipment is
not delivered without the necessary personnel to
operate it and the infrastructure required to support
it. It will integrate funding demands from across
National Defence into a single, coherent plan, and
ensure that the timing of major investments corresponds to the availability of funds. This will not only
minimize the risk of capability gaps, but will also
ensure affordability over the next 20 years.

The first version of the Plan will be submitted to the
Treasury Board Secretariat in November 2008 as
part of a pilot project associated with that agency’s
new Policy on Investment Planning, which aims to
“contribute to the achievement of value for money
and sound stewardship in government program
delivery through effective investment planning.”

The unprecedented commitment of long-term, stable
funding over the next 20 years will directly support
_Advantage Canada, the Government’s strategic plan_
for boosting the economic prosperity, global competitiveness and quality of life of Canadians. Indeed, the
_Canada First Defence Strategy represents a significant_
investment in the country’s industry, knowledge and
technology sectors that will yield sizeable dividends
for every region of the country. This clear, long-term
plan will give these sectors the opportunity to better
position themselves to compete for defence contracts
in Canada and in the global marketplace.

**Global Excellence**
Combined with the improved framework for competition and trade provided through _Advantage_
_Canada, the Canada First Defence Strategy will help_
position Canadian companies for success in the
global marketplace. Its infusion of long-term, stable
funding will allow industry to plan ahead, make
better use of investments in capital and technology,
and become more effective players in the supply
chains of the world’s primary defence equipment
manufacturers. In short, this Strategy will help
Canadian companies build global excellence and
leverage Canada’s competitive advantage.

**Technology and Innovation**
Through Defence Research and Development
Canada (DRDC), National Defence has a long
history of working with Canadian industry and
with its allies to develop technology that meets the
needs of the Canadian Forces. As National Defence
implements this Strategy, DRDC will collaborate
with defence partners to derive maximum benefit
from technology and ensure that the Canadian
Forces continue to be a state-of-the-art military.

The significant procurement initiatives contained in
this plan will also open up valuable new opportunities for Canadian industry, building on the
Government’s Science and Technology Strategy.
Specifically, the new long-term funding framework
will allow large, well-established companies in


Canada’s high- value-added technology sectors to
align their own manufacturing, support, and research
and development plans to better support defence
procurement requirements. Significant benefits will
also accrue to small and medium-sized companies
that have established themselves as world leaders in
specific technologies. They will be better positioned
to grow and expand their businesses and to invest in
emerging technologies at a level that will improve
the likelihood of developing a viable product.
Finally, much of the technology and innovation that
will be required to rebuild the Canadian Forces will
have valuable commercial applications, resulting in
additional long-term benefits for industry.

**A New Relationship**
The Canada First Defence Strategy will set the stage
for a renewed relationship with Canadian defence
industry and research and development organizations
across the country.

The Government will take specific measures to
enhance its interaction with industry. For example,
it will continue to improve the way it procures new
equipment, fostering greater transparency and engaging industry earlier in the process. These ongoing
procurement reforms will further streamline the
contracting process and ensure that it continues to
remain open and fair. In addition, the Government
will revise the current industrial benefit policies
attached to significant procurement projects with a
view to encouraging industry to make long-term
investments in Canada.

With the Government’s significant investment in the
Canadian Forces, Canadians will profit from the
development of high-tech, high-value sustainable
jobs in all regions – directly through the development
of military capabilities and indirectly through technological spinoffs and commercial applications. This will
put Canadians to work protecting Canadians.
Universities and colleges will also benefit through
increased opportunities to undertake cutting-edge
research.

The _Canada First Defence Strategy represents a_
major milestone, and reflects the Government’s
commitment to rebuilding the Canadian Forces
into a first-class military capable of providing
enhanced security for Canadians. It strikes the right
balance between what the Forces need today, and
what they will likely need in the future to address a
different set of security challenges. Recognizing
that the global security environment and the capabilities required to deal effectively with it will continue to evolve, the Government is committed to
reviewing this comprehensive plan on a regular
basis to ensure that it continues to meet the needs
of the military and Canadians.

The implementation of the _Canada First Defence_
Strategy will give the Forces, who sacrifice so much
for their country, the resources they need to perform
their vital missions to a standard that Canadians
expect and deserve.


This 20-year plan to rebuild the Forces, supported
by an unprecedented long-term, predictable funding framework, will ensure that Canadians can
depend on a military capable of delivering excellence at home, meeting its commitments as a reliable
partner in the defence of North America, and projecting leadership abroad in support of international
