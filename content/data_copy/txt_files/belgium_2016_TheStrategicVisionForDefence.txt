### Foreword by the Minister of Defence

Dear Reader,

My Government colleagues and I have favoured a positive vision of
the future of Belgian Defence. I firmly believe that accomplishing
this strategic vision will ensure the security and freedom of all
Belgians on a long-term basis and will largely contribute to our
prosperity and well-being. This vision of the future also strengthens
the Euro-Atlantic anchoring of Belgian Defence. Since the end of
the Second World War this anchoring has guaranteed our security
and that of all our European and trans-Atlantic fellow citizens.

In May 2015, I presented a strategic vision note to my Government
colleagues on the future of Defence up to 2030. We immediately agreed on my analysis of the
(future) Belgian security environment that you will find hereafter in the first chapter. Based
on this note, my collaborators, the experts of my fellow ministers, and the Defence Staff have
worked hard on different possible scenarios for the future of Belgian Defence, inspired by
ideas coming from the Parliament and the academic world. On 22 December 2015, the Federal
Government took the decisions of principle[1] that were necessary to draw up this strategic vision
and the Preamble by the Government[2] accompanying this strategic vision.

I am proud of what we have achieved!

This vision honours the Government agreement which stated: “The Government will again
provide the army with the means needed to perform its tasks properly.”

A Defence of 25,000 full-time equivalents in 2030 has been chosen. The defence personnel of
the future will focus even more on the military specific tasks and as such the core business of
Defence. They will be increasingly supported by civilian service providers to do so. Combined
with a strong rejuvenation, this evolution will boost the operational readiness of Defence.
The Government also opted for a budgetary path that must lead to a healthy balance between
personnel costs, operating costs and investments in 2030 and that will release an investment
budget of 9.4 billion euros[3] for the Belgian military capabilities up to 2030. Our future capabilities
will enable us to accomplish our multilateral solidarity and our will to contribute to a more
European defence.

The decision path leading to this strategic vision for Defence proceeded step by step. Taking
into account the different political visions, we have succeeded in creating positive prospects
for Defence and hence for its key stakeholder, i.e. the Belgian population, as well. Investing in
Defence is an intergenerational issue. The decisions taken by this Government will also have an
impact on the security of future generations.

This strategic vision offers the defence personnel the prospect of a modern and efficient
organisation with opportunities for everyone. It offers the prospect of a Defence able to
maintain a broadly deployable toolbox for the purpose of the defence policy of current and
future Governments. It offers the prospect of a Defence based on multilateral solidarity towards
NATO, the EU and the UN. It offers the prospect of a Defence committed to supporting the
building of a more European defence. And last but not least, the strategic vision offers the
prospect of a Defence which plays an important role in defending the security, the freedom, the
prosperity and the well-being of all Belgian citizens.

Once again I would like to express my sincere thanks to everybody who helped in bringing
about this historical turning point for Defence: my fellow politicians, members of Parliament,
my Defence Staff, academics, the members of my private office … During this term of office
we will start the practical realisation of this vision which will also remain a guide for future
Governments.

Finally, I wish you a pleasant reading of the strategic vision for Belgian Defence towards 2030.

Steven Vandeput
Minister of Defence

### Introduction

This strategic vision is based on a general framework, namely a Defence of 25,000 Full Time
Equivalents (FTE) and a budget for investments in major equipment of 9.4 billion euros[4]
(2015 euros) until 2030. Furthermore, this vision is built around 9 principles described in
Annex A. Besides the analysis of our security environment (approved in May 2015) which
clearly points out the security challenges for our country, these principles form the guiding
thread of this strategic vision. The first chapter of this vision thus includes the analysis of
the security environment with updated figures.

This document determines the capability portfolio[5] for our Defence towards 2030, within the
investment budget and the personnel envelope. Three intermediary chapters, each of them
structured around a number of specific principles, are the steppingstones from the security
environment to the description of the
future capabilities.

###### This strategic vision is

the world. Principle no. 3a underlines
that the capabilities of Belgian Defence
should allow it to perform the core tasks in an appropriate way. Chapter 2 thus sketches the
outlines for the capabilities starting from the different core tasks our Defence has to carry out in
the security environment.
In order to carry out the supporting role of Defence within the framework of internal security, it
is important that Defence strives to intensify cooperation with the national security actors. This
will strengthen interdepartmental efficiency on the national territory (principle no. 6). A part of
this chapter is dedicated to the optimisation of this support.


**Chapter three addresses the political will to maintain a pioneering role for a more European**
defence. This willingness is to be found in principle no. 3c which states that our country should

_e.g. the combined air-ground engagement during a military campaign), organisation (organisation in the event of engagement,_
_e.g. a combined arms Battlegroup), training (how the operational preparation is done for these means), materiel (all material_
_aspects needed by the military forces in order to operate effectively, e.g. weapons and spare parts), leadership and education_
_(how superiors are trained for operations at different levels within the armed forces and the necessary training in order to engage_
_personnel and deploy materiel), personnel (availability of qualified personnel for engagement and support), infrastructure_
_(immovable property like military quarters and training facilities for supporting the armed forces) and interoperability (the_
_possibility to engage our own armed forces with those of other NATO member states)._

participate in filling European capability gaps[6]. Principle no. 6 follows suit, as it proposes elaborate
forms of international cooperation in support of a more European defence policy. The security
environment clearly shows the need for a greater European military autonomy, both in matters of
policy and in the field of capabilities. This ambition has immediately visible consequences for the
future capability portfolio of Defence.

**Chapter four describes the importance of a recapitalisation of Defence that is based on**
multilateral solidarity, and the way it will improve the internal budgetary balance of the defence
effort by 2030. It is essential that Defence should be given sufficient investment budgets if it
wants to further take part in generating multilateral security in the future. In addition to this, the
necessary operational resources and personnel budgets should be released in order to sufficiently
contribute to the multilateral Euro-Atlantic burden-sharing within the framework of collective
defence and collective security. Principles no. 2, 3b and 3d hint at this need when underlining
the necessity for a defence budget based on multilateral solidarity for a capability output in line
with multilateral solidarity. They also refer to a balanced internal costs structure for Defence.

**Chapter five details the capability portfolio by 2030.**
A balance between the military capabilities, based on the three core tasks, is defined in principle
no. 3a. Principle no. 3b then provides
for a balance among the four capability

laying stress on non-kinetic and civilmilitary capabilities.
The emphasis put on the strategic support capabilities of this capability portfolio – which,  most of
the time, correspond to European capability gaps (principle no. 3c) – has already been mentioned
above. With this capability portfolio, Defence has a clear heading for the long term, towards 2030.
The following chapters will give the necessary guidance for the implementation of this strategic
vision, based on the other principles.

**Chapter six sets out the guidelines for a continuous pursuit of an efficient Defence[7] (principle no.**
4). The functioning of Defence will be rationalised as much as possible by building structures that
follow the processes, and not the other way around. For Defence, the key process is: generating
military capabilities for the execution of operations within the framework of the three core tasks.
Defence should thus focus on military specific tasks and as much as possible make use of market
opportunities for supporting tasks and services within the framework of a sourcing policy.

_6_ _Capability gaps are the shortages at the European level for certain defence capabilities that complicate autonomous European_
_military engagement._
_7_ _An action is efficient if the efforts and expenses concerned make an effective contribution to the achievement of the objective_
_(= effective) and if, at the same time, the costs are proportionate to the profits._

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

This chapter also pays attention to a continued rationalisation of the competence development
and the military medical support. As stated in principle no. 4, this strategic vision also enables a
further rationalisation of the infrastructure.
Another possibility of improving our national security policy is to take advantage of the existing
and developing links between Defence, the national research institutions and the industry for
the increased support of our security interests. Defence can thus strengthen the efficiency of the
security policy. As mentioned in principle no. 8, this objective can enable the transfer of knowhow, technology and employment to our society.

**Chapter seven brings forward the ambition with regard to personnel, i.e. to rejuvenate Defence**
by developing a more flexible personnel policy. This chapter is completely built around principle
no. 9 which asks to assess the education/training and the personnel regulations of servicemen,
and to consider which adjustments bring about a more dynamic personnel policy. The aim is to
abandon the principle of Lifetime Employment as much as possible in order to make Defence a
younger organisation and therefore better adapted to its core business. The creation of a modern
Reserve is an integral part of the efforts provided to strive for a more flexible personnel policy.
Obviously, this ambition regarding personnel should be further developed. The social partners
should be involved as much as possible, not only as representatives of the Defence personnel
members, but also as experts on these questions.

Finally, chapter eight provides the steps for the implementation of this strategic vision. This will
be achieved through an implementation plan for the geographical distribution of the quarters.
This plan will be valid for the duration of the strategic vision. A proposition for the military
programme Act which ensures the legal anchoring of the investment programmes for major
equipment for the duration of this strategic vision is also planned in the four months following
the strategic vision (see principle no. 7). Furthermore, this strategic vision forms the foundation
on which a series of individual projects will be elaborated and coordinated at the political level
with the aim to build together and step by step the future of Defence.

### The Belgian Security Environment up to 2030:

 Continuously Uncertain and More Complex


The future always remains uncertain. The rapidly increasing complexity of the world is, however,
remarkable. This is due to the exponentially rising pace of sociological, economic, political,
environmental and technological change. This far more complex world is an important factor
in defining the place Belgium wants to occupy in the global security environment. Through its
composition, Belgian Defence needs to be able to adapt quickly and flexibly to this environment.
Today’s multipolar world will persist in the years to come, as new poles of power will equally
take their place on the world stage. At the
moment, this transition period is already

states is thus going through a period of
change which can generate uncertainties
and even instability.
In a more fragmented world, regional security dynamics will become more important again.
The Europe of NATO and EU countries, already an important economic pole today, needs to
extend its policy instruments in this multipolar world, as to be not merely a pawn but a player in
this new global constellation. The regional European framework is already the most important
dimension of the Belgian security policy, primarily through the multilateral framework of NATO
and the EU, but additionally also that of the OSCE (Organisation for Security and Cooperation
in Europe).
The United States are Europe’s most important global security partner. They ask the European
countries for a more important

to the security situation in Asia, as it can

reinforces the need for the European countries to become a more autonomous military security
player in and around the European continent.

Now more than ever, security in both Belgium and Europe is connected with peace and security
in the world. Non-military means play a central role in the promotion of a tolerant, safe and
prosperous world. However, Defence remains a necessary tool in the states’ toolbox. All security
experts are in agreement on this. The military instrument is necessary to protect not just the
Belgian society and interests, but also the universal values anchored in the European DNA.
Because of these values and Europe’s economic prosperity, the European societal model remains
attractive to other countries and their population. In contrast however, extremists can influence
the Belgian and European population directly and attack the values on which this open and
tolerant Belgian and European society is built. Extremists are by definition prepared to use
extreme means and in this context, the threat of military retaliation remains a very useful power
tool.

**a. Europe: an Island of Peace Surrounded by a Periphery in Chaos**


Especially its economic but also its social and political integration make Europe – and
particularly the EU – the most important reference for the Belgian international security
policy. Reality today is that this Europe in peace is surrounded by a periphery in chaos.

The Arab Spring has led to a clear deterioration of the security environment south
of Europe and in the Middle East. What started as a wave of democratisation based
on universal values did not result in a lasting emancipation of the population. For a
long time to come, these regions will probably be plagued by cross-border extremist
groups, domestic and regional conflicts, a social-economic situation with no prospect of
improvement and weak and/or authoritarian regimes with limited internal and external
legitimacy. According to the Fragile States Index this southern European periphery,
consisting of North Africa, the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and the Middle East, includes
the most fragile countries in the world[8].

The EU and the European countries need to continue to play a role in the stabilisation of
these countries, if necessary by using military means. Moreover, the societal instability in
these countries also has a direct negative impact
on the security, well-being and prosperity

crime (trafficking in drugs, arms and human

beings), illegal immigration and refugee flows.

###### pressure in the years to come.

However, instability is not inevitable. In Chad
for instance, the European Union has shown that the combination of military intervention
and the development of administrative capacities can provide a permanent solution to
long-lasting conflicts. In Libya by contrast, a successful military action of the European
countries in 2011 was not followed by an equally bold civil-military stabilisation phase.
This failure led to the destabilisation of not only Libya, but also large parts of the region
(including Mali).

The conflict in Syria provides the clearest illustration of the link between
external and internal security, namely the participation of radicalised foreign
fighters in this conflict and their subsequent return to Europe. This conflict also
shows that non-intervention carries a cost at the national and European level.
Furthermore, the stability of the southern European periphery will be subjected to more
pressure in the years to come because of the impact of demographic and climatic evolutions.
The entire region will experience a strong population growth over the next few years. This
will be especially the case in West Africa. The region’s fragile ecosystems will have even
more difficulties in dealing with this demographic growth, especially given the additional
climatic impact on this region. Local authorities do not have sufficient means nor resilience
to carry out the necessary adjustments. Without sufficient support from Europe to allow
them to adapt to changing climatic circumstances local tensions will rise because of the
additional pressure on food security, water security and energy security. This reality
increases the likelihood of military stabilisation missions in this region in the future.

Within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the EU pays
particular attention to reinforcing security and establishing stable governance in the
southern periphery. NATO is also clear about the importance of this region for the EuroAtlantic security[9], which is why it has invested in regional partnerships over the past
decades. Conventional deterrence supports European diplomacy and other preventive
efforts here as well.

**II.** **Central Africa**

Although Central Africa borders on the southern European periphery, the direct impact
of this region on European security is rather limited today. Nevertheless, a direct link
between this region and our country remains because of the presence of a significant
diaspora from this region in our country. The Great Lakes region is the centre of political
and military friction in Central Africa, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo
remains one of the most fragile states of this region. The Belgian government wants to
continue to contribute to the stabilisation of Central Africa and of the Great Lakes region
in particular, through a national comprehensive approach[10], in which Defence also plays
a structural role. The Belgian expertise in this region allows our diplomacy as well as our
intelligence services to build up credit on a global level. This credit can then be used for
other issues that have an impact on the Belgian and European security interests.

**III.** **The European Eastern Periphery**

The situation in the eastern periphery of Europe is also back on the security agenda,
in a way that we have not seen since the end of the Cold War. The interference
of Russia in the east of the Ukraine, the annexation of Crimea, and the earlier
disinformation and military actions in Transnistria[11] and Georgia confirm the fact
that Russia does not resign itself to the expanding NATO/EU sphere of influence
even though this expansion is merely reflecting the sovereign wish of the former
Warsaw Pact countries and former Soviet Union republics to join NATO and the EU.
Russia’s attitude in the eastern European periphery will determine Europe’s security
and military position towards Russia for a long time. NATO has made a clear response
by refocusing on its collective defence task[12]. After the Cold War this task had lost its

_10 The comprehensive approach is an integrated security approach combining, depending on the situation, the most efficient_

At the moment, the EU does not focus on the military dimension for the reinforcement of
security in the eastern periphery of Europe. Here, NATO clearly takes the lead. However,
the EU’s large toolbox offers more than just an added value in this matter. In the Ukraine
the EU provides economic, financial and humanitarian support as well as assistance in
the development of civilian security forces. In addition, economic and financial sanctions
have been taken against Russia. However, in the long run, we cannot exclude a military
role for the EU (as well as the UN) in the matter of crisis management in Eastern Europe.
The roles of NATO and the EU are thus very much complementary in the reinforcement
of the integrity of their

response to the use of
all available (including
military) Russian means of power, a way of acting that is defined today as “hybrid
warfare”[14]. It is to be expected that the Russian authorities will continue to implement
this negative version of the comprehensive approach in order to destabilise countries in
Eastern Europe who look to the West for their future. The East European countries expect
the other NATO member states – including Belgium – to increase their military presence
in the East and to maintain a sufficiently high contribution to the burden and risk sharing
of military deterrence. In recent years, Belgian Defence has actively contributed to this,
notably by participating in the air defence in Eastern Europe, but also by carrying out
mine-clearing activities in the Baltic Sea and participating in NATO exercises in this
region with our land forces. NATO is developing a renewed policy in Eastern Europe,
specifically for the land forces, aimed at provisioning and prepositioning heavier means,
as was the case for a long time in Central Europe during the Cold War.

_14 Hybrid warfare combines military and non-military means and methods to destabilise countries. Russia, for instance, uses_
_hybrid warfare in the Ukraine and Georgia by supporting opponents of the local government with civilian and military means_
_and by using military and civilian elements of power, such as the media and the economy, to the detriment of another country._
_Therefore, hybrid warfare is also regarded as a negative form of the well-known comprehensive approach of the EU, which uses_
_an appropriate combination of civilian and military means to stabilise areas within the framework of crisis management._

**IV.** **The European Northern Periphery**

Due to global warming, the strategic relevance of the Arctic region could increase
significantly by 2030, as shipping routes through the Arctic Ocean will become easier to
navigate and the reserves of energy and other raw materials present in this region will
become more accessible. In time, this would mean for Belgian ports that the shipping
routes to East Asia will become shorter: by 40% to Japan, 30% to Korea and 20 to 25%
to the important Chinese ports, compared to the current route through the Suez Canal.
Climatologists estimate that by 2030 the entire Arctic Ocean will be ice-free by the end
of summer, which would shorten the distances even further. Russia has already started
to reinforce its governance in this region, also by reopening military bases. Several other
Arctic countries are also developing their capability to reinforce their governance. Still,
most specialists assume that for the time being the northern European periphery will
remain quiet as far as security is concerned.


**V.** **NATO and EU: Key Pillars of the Belgian Security and Defence**
**Policy**

After the failing of the Belgian neutrality policy during both World Wars of the twentieth
century, Belgium became one of the founders of the postwar security architecture, based on multilateralism, in
which – besides the UN – NATO and the EU take up a
prominent place.
Belgium occupies a central position within NATO
and the EU as host country of the main institutions of
both organisations, such as the NATO headquarters
and SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers
Europe), NATO’s most important military command.
Brussels is also de facto the capital of the European
Union because of the presence of the main EU
institutions. The important link between Belgium and
both NATO and the EU testifies to the desire of the _The Belgian statesman Paul-Henri_

will undoubtedly continue to play a main role in the safeguarding of European security
for the next fifteen years.
The Belgian authorities consider NATO and the EU to be complementary organisations.
They underline the necessity for a greater integration of the European defence effort to
support a credible and balanced NATO as well as the possibility for the EU to carry out

wish of the United States.

**b. European and Belgian Security from a Global Perspective**


It would be unwise to examine the European and Belgian security environment exclusively
from a regional point of view, focusing only on the European periphery. On the one hand, the
EU is a global economic power, which also has the continuous ambition to become a global
political power. On the other hand,

Flow security is aimed at the protection of “flows” (of goods, raw materials, people,
capital, services, and information) that are not constrained by territoriality anymore, but
do have a link with the interests of a country or group of countries and their economy
and society.

A global flow – such as international maritime transport – is not a new phenomenon, but
it becomes all the more important in a globalised economy.

In our multipolar world no country benefits from disrupting these global flows. However,
military conflicts arising from the fragmentation of the political global governance can
have a negative influence on these global flows in the decades to come. For example,
several countries in East and Southeast Asia, particularly China and its neighbours, are
investing in submarines on a massive scale, in order to be able to claim access to maritime
areas and deny it to adversaries should a conflict erupt.

Flow security also consists of

backbone of the Belgian and European economy. As an essential part of the worldwide
economic and social tissue, the cyber environment has more and more security
consequences. The use of this environment by security services and as an additional
dimension for (the support of) warfare is the most direct link between security and the
cyber environment, and it should also be taken into account.

The Society for Worldwide Interbank
Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) has its
headquarters in Belgium, in La Hulpe in Walloon
Brabant. SWIFT is an international cooperative
organisation which facilitates cross-border
payments. More than 8,000 financial institutions
from about 200 countries are affiliated to SWIFT.
Ensuring a secure Belgian data network is essential
for the global financial security.


Another very important flow
is ensuring the energy supply.
Energy security is an important
issue, since energy can be used
to put pressure on countries.
Russia has already demonstrated
this several times. Moreover,
Europe relies very heavily on
energy import, largely through
the unstable eastern and southern
periphery.


**II.** **The United Nations under Pressure**

After the Second World War, the United Nations were mandated with a central
role in maintaining global security and regulating the use of the military power
instrument. The Government agreement states that the Belgian government
wishes to contribute in a credible and lasting way to this role of the United
Nations, given its direct impact on Belgian security and interests. From a military
point of view this implies a continued significant deployment of our Defence in
UN military operations, including UN-mandated NATO and EU operations.
However, it is troubling that the position of the UN as central organisation for
peace and security in the world has come under pressure. On the one hand, this
is due to the fact that the new emerging powers are focusing more on their own
regional spheres of influence, which reinforces the fragmentation of the world
into regional poles. On the other hand, there is an imbalance between the new
geopolitical realities and the current representativeness in the United Nations
Security Council.
The development of a multipolar world could lead to friction and armed conflicts
in overlapping areas of influence, but also an open conflict between the new
poles cannot be excluded. It is necessary to pay due attention to the fact that
the emerging powers are investing heavily in their military power. Whereas
the European defence effort has decreased substantially in recent years, that of
the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) increased by 38 to 132%[16]
between 2006 and 2015. Three of these countries have nuclear weapons. These
weapons also remain an option for other emerging regional powers. If the security
situation in East Asia deteriorates further, this could lead to an enhanced nuclear
proliferation in this region.

In addition, Defence is also the last bulwark of the societal security within Belgium. For
instance, within the framework of counter-terrorism Defence can temporarily participate
in supporting the police for the surveillance of critical infrastructure and societal sensitive
targets. Defence also contributes to consequence management in the event of disasters
on the national territory by deploying troops, but also by offering specialised means of
transport, logistic support, assistance in the case of nuclear/biological/chemical accidents,
medical assistance, maritime command support, execution of engineering works, etc.
As climatologists expect more extreme weather conditions, the already existing task of Belgian
and European Defences to render assistance in the case of disasters will become even more
relevant in the years to come. Specifically for

###### “The need for security is high.” (Government agreement of 9 October 2014)


The analysis of the Belgian security environment up to 2030 shows that the security on
the streets of Belgium and the protection of the Belgian economic interests remain closely
connected with the security situation in the world. Global flows such as maritime transport,
energy flows or information shared in cyberspace are essential to the freedom, security,
well-being and prosperity of all Belgians. Conflicts in the world can disrupt these flows and
thus bring international security issues into our everyday life.
The world is becoming more and more complex, and international security is under
pressure because of growing fragmentation in several poles of power. Europe is surrounded
by security threats arising from the unstable European periphery.
Therefore, it is essential for Belgian Defence to contribute to a more European security and
defence effort, to a continuously strong Euro-Atlantic military alliance, and to the global
efforts of the United Nations. This safeguards our national security in a multipolar world
in a relevant way.
To this end, Belgian Defence needs to be sufficiently adaptive and deployable with adequate
flexibility in order to be able to participate in a spirit of solidarity within an international
framework, but also to remain the ultimate and structural security actor in Belgium, for
societal security.

### A Balanced Positioning of Belgian

 Defence in the Security Environment

Defence is an important actor that meets the need for security identified by the analysis of the
security environment. Moreover, Defence is an essential instrument for a credible foreign and
security policy.


###### “A modern Defence remains one of the crucial components of our security and an absolute necessity to conduct a credible foreign and security policy.” (Government agreement of 9 October 2014)


The essence of our Defence is to contribute to the security of our citizens and the protection
of our values and worldwide interests. These form the basis for our freedom, well-being and
prosperity. Because of the strong European anchoring of our interests and values, the national
and European security policies are inextricably linked.
Defence contributes to international security in order to prevent existing threats from having a
negative effect on our society and new threats against our territory from originating. Defence
also contributes to the protection of global flows, which are of vital importance to our open
economy and thus to the prosperity and well-being of the population.
Starting from the analysis of the security environment and the core tasks of Defence, this chapter
describes which position our Defence needs to occupy by 2030 in order to ensure our security,
prosperity and well-being.

The analysis of the security environment and the input of Belgian Defence experts have shown
several possible core tasks that Defence should carry out in the future. Three core tasks have
been selected, i.e.:

§ contribute to the collective defence§ _[17] through NATO to defend the Alliance’s territorial_
integrity;

_17 Collective defence against an armed attack violating the territorial integrity of the NATO member states in Europe and North_
_America is at the very heart of the 1949 NATO treaty and is enshrined in Article 5. According to this article an attack against_
_one of the NATO member states shall be considered an attack on all member states, which can, if they deem it necessary, use_
_armed force to restore the territorial integrity. By ensuring interoperability between NATO forces, by striving for sufficient_
_and adequate military capabilities in the member states, by joint training and by joint planning, NATO provides an effective_
_collective defence with military means._

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6

_On 25 February 2015 the Minister of Defence organised a seminar in support of the development of the strategic_
_vision. The Minister asked a group of experts from the academic, diplomatic, financial and economic world as well as_
_from the media and the military to give their vision on the tasks and capabilities of Defence for the period until 2030._

§ contribute to the collective security§ _[18] through crisis management operations[19] in a multilateral_
or international framework, preferably mandated or organised by international security
organisations, to ensure peace and security in the world;

§ protect Belgian citizens all over the world.§


_18 Collective security consists in ensuring peace and (physical) security within the framework of (potentially) armed conflicts. This_
_takes place outside the Belgian borders and usually outside NATO and EU borders. Collective security is directed at security_
_crises that do not directly threaten our territorial integrity or that of our allies, contrary to collective defence, but that (can)_
_endanger our security and our interests (and those of our allies). These interests also include the pursuit and maintenance of an_
_international order based on rules that protect the safety of a population. Different military and civilian means and ways exist_
_to contribute to collective security, e.g. through (civil-) military crisis management operations, diplomacy (including defence_
_diplomacy), development cooperation and disarmament. The core task of Belgian Defence specifically consists of a contribution_
_to the collective security through crisis management operations._
_19 Crisis management operations are operations with civilian and/or military means to prevent a security crisis from escalating_
_into a conflict, and to end or (help) to settle an ongoing conflict that can have an impact on the security and interests of our_
_country and our allies. Crisis management operations can also take place within the context of the Responsibility to Protect a_
_population that is being exposed to (an important threat of) physical violence, which goes against maintaining a rules-based_
_international order. Crisis management operations can also contribute to the consolidation of stability in post-conflict situations._
_The more restrictive definition used in this document does not consider deployments within the framework of collective defence_
_or international humanitarian operations through military means to be crisis management operations. Military deployment_
_within the framework of crisis management operations can involve conflict prevention, preventive military deployments,_
_peacekeeping, peacemaking, peacebuilding and peace enforcement._

###### “The core tasks of Belgian Defence are collective defence, collective security and the protection of Belgian citizens all over the world. Defence can also always be deployed by the government within the framework of national and international missions according to the capabilities available.” (principle no. 1)


These core tasks are inextricably intertwined. For example, collective security and collective
defence contribute to peace and security in the world. More stability in the world fosters the
security of Belgian citizens all over the world and on the national territory.
The definition of these core tasks is important, since they determine the capabilities in which
Defence should or should not invest.

of military tasks that are not regarded as core
tasks and that will consequently not be taken into
account when sizing our military capabilities.
Nevertheless, Defence can also contribute significantly to the security policy of the Belgian state
by undertaking these non-core tasks. These additional tasks of Defence are:

§ Deployment in support of internal security§ _[20] (e.g. for counter-terrorism, for national crises_
and for consequence management in the event of disasters). In national crisis situations, the
government can always decide to commit Defence capabilities for internal security purposes.
This deployment can entail a temporary limitation of the deployment possibilities for the
three core tasks;

§ Humanitarian missions, both national (e.g. support of Defence for the housing of refugees in §
Belgium) and international (e.g. the provision of a C-130 transport aircraft for humanitarian
aid or in support of B-FAST[21]);

_20 “Internal security” concerns any deployment of Defence on the national territory for the benefit of the societal security, in_
_addition to the deployment on the national territory within the framework of collective defence. Collective security and ‘the_

core tasks are essentially a European and often a Euro-Atlantic issue. If our Defence wants
to make a relevant contribution to European security – which is the broader frame of our
national security – all Belgian defence capabilities have to contribute to these core tasks in

Since the violations of the Ukrainian territorial integrity by Russia in 2014, the security
dynamic in the eastern European periphery is once again primarily aimed at collective
defence through NATO. For Belgium NATO remains the main organisation to ensure
collective defence of our territory and that of our European and North American allies.
The additional measures taken by the NATO member states directed at East and Central
Europe create an increased level of conventional deterrence. This fits in with NATO’s broader
deterrence strategy to which Belgium also contributes. At the moment, NATO’s existing
deterrence initiatives are complemented by means that can offer a specific response to a
hybrid threat. Effective intelligence services are an essential first link in quickly identifying
and understanding hybrid threats, in order to respond rapidly and avoid escalation, for
example through the deployment of Special Operations Forces. Averting hybrid threats
also requires a reinforcement of the comprehensive approach and thus the use of all power
elements to support stability and security.
In this respect, the EU will be a natural

current economic sanctions imposed by the EU on Russia because of its aggression against
Ukraine.

The security dynamic in the southern European periphery is experiencing a negative
development. Up until today, the spillover of insecurity from this region has not posed a
direct threat to the European territorial integrity, but it does have an impact on internal
security. The EU (through the Common Security and Defence Policy), the UN and separate
European countries – either within the framework of a coalition of the willing or not –
are the most active actors in this southern region, alongside regional security organisations
and local national actors. They contribute to the reinforcement of international security by
means of civilian and military crisis management. Recently NATO has also again underlined
its growing concern about the southern flank.
Within the framework of collective security, Defence is an active policy instrument that
is preferably deployed to intervene before an armed conflict actually breaks out or before
failed states emerge and with them armed groups who can threaten our security or
interests. In the last few years, these
types of deployment of our Defence

for their actions.
When in spite of all this armed conflicts
still break out, interventions can be carried out within the framework of collective security
to stop them and subsequently contribute to the building of a stable and secure society,
in coordination with other international and interdepartmental actors. The operations in
Chad, Mali, Somalia, the Gulf of Aden, Syria, and Iraq are just a few examples of these types
of deployment.
The analysis of the security environment indicates that this southern region has a continuing
and even growing need for European crisis management, with or without military support.
In collective security Defence is but one of the actors in a joint approach with civilian actors
(comprehensive approach). Defence only takes the lead in an intervention to effectively stop
an armed conflict. Stabilisation can take place by providing assistance in ending a conflict, by
providing security, and by contributing to the start-up of the reconstruction after the military
part of a conflict has ended (follow-up phase, reconstruction). At that moment, the security
situation is often still too precarious for civilian relief organisations. Intelligence services will
then play an important role in determining the necessity to intervene and in understanding
the best way in which to proceed. The successful and the structural approach of a security

situation within the framework of collective security largely depends on an adequate
coordination between military actions on the one hand and those of other governmental and
non-governmental actors on the other hand. The effectiveness of the military deployment
depends on the extent to which Defence can cooperate with other actors. This comprehensive
approach does not only have an international dimension (primarily through the EU and the
UN), but also a national interdepartmental dimension.

countries will have to invest more in these capability gaps in order to obtain the necessary
autonomy.

and well-being seem to be threatened
elsewhere (piracy, terrorism,…).
As far as capabilities are concerned this implies that choices must also be guided by the
multilateral framework in which our defence policy is determined. The needed capabilities
are identified within NATO through the NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP) as well
as within the EU through the Capability Development Plan (CDP). In this matter, NATO
proceeds in a more mandatory way than the EU. In addition, Belgian Defence should also
rely on sufficient combat capabilities to be able to participate in the burden and risk sharing
for operational deployments within a NATO, EU, and UN framework.

The Air Combat Capability: a Spearhead for Collective Defence
At the moment, the spearhead of our contribution to NATO’s collective defence is the
air combat capability, assured with the F-16-multirole[24] combat aircraft. This capability is
particularly appropriate for collective defence, since these aircraft can be deployed quickly
and over large distances. This capability contributes to the territorial dimension of collective
defence on the Belgian (and soon the Benelux) territory by means of aircraft on Quick
Reaction Alert as well as to NATO’s broader deterrence through, among other things, air
defence of the Alliance borders.

aircraft of possible adversaries. Therefore, we comply with the request of NATO to acquire
modern combat aircraft, which are technologically more advanced and designed to integrate
developing technologies over the next decades. These aircraft need to be available to be
deployed for NATO’s collective defence for the coming decades.
The 34 new modern combat aircraft also need to be multirole so that they can be deployed
in the best possible way to ensure security at the European borders within the framework of
collective security.

The efficient deployment of an air combat capability strongly depends on tanker aircraft,
both for collective defence and for collective security. In the past, European combat aircraft
could always count on the United States’ air refuelling capability. As a result, Europe has
developed only a limited capability itself. At the moment, this essential operational logistic
capability of the combined European defence forces is too limited to allow an autonomous
European deployment with combat aircraft at the borders of Europe. Several European
countries have taken action, for instance through the European Defence Agency (EDA), to
fill this capability gap.
Therefore, it has been decided that our country will reinforce the European air-to-air-refuelling
capability through a contribution to a European pool of tanker aircraft corresponding to the
capability of one tanker aircraft and through the acquisition of refuelling kits for the future
A400M transport aircraft. This will be done within the framework of EDA programmes for
the reinforcement of this capability.

At the Transatlantic level Defence will also continue to contribute to NATO’s AWACS
command and control aircraft, which form a strategic support capability for the deployment
of our combat aircraft, both within the framework of collective defence and collective
security. Furthermore, AWACS aircraft are also essential for intelligence gathering and for
airspace surveillance.

The Navy: a Second Spearhead for Collective Defence
The Belgian ports are European external borders within the framework of European
security. They are essential to an effective organisation of collective defence at NATO level.
Therefore, our ports and the connected European sea lines of communication have to be
kept free of mines at all times. To this end, the current mine hunters will be replaced by
six new mine countermeasures vessels equipped with an adequate mine countermeasures
toolbox, which will allow a future-oriented concept of use and will also easily respond to
the new technological evolutions of the coming decades. The new ships will offer not only
the accomplishment of the national tasks within the framework of collective defence but
also a contribution to the expeditionary deployment within an international framework in
order to keep the European maritime supply routes open. Belgian Defence thus maintains
a capability for which it has an internationally recognised expertise and that will remain
relevant in the future.

The Surface Combatant capability (based on of multi-purpose frigates) is important for the
protection of maritime supply routes that are indispensable to the Belgian and European
economy.

_In 2015, the Belgian frigate ‘Leopold I’ participated in the protection of the French aircraft carrier ‘Charles de Gaulle’_
_from which combat aircraft performed missions over Iraq and Syria._


However, today our current frigates are insufficiently equipped. The submarine threat is
growing in the European periphery as well as all over the world, and NATO is requesting
that additional efforts be made by the European member states. The purpose is to better
equip our current frigates for anti-submarine warfare and for the monitoring of European
maritime supply routes that also have a global security dimension. That is why their
capability will be reinforced in the short
term by the integration of new, already

same type that will be the spearhead of our contribution to NATO’s collective defence in the
future.
Just as the new combat aircraft, these new multirole frigates will also be deployed in missions
within the framework of collective security, such as the expeditionary protection of supply
routes or counter-piracy missions. These tasks aim to protect the maritime interests of
our country and play a part in the protection of Belgian citizens on board our merchant
fleet, which is an important fleet at a global level as shown in the analysis of the security
environment.

It will be examined whether our Navy can participate in the functioning of the Dutch Joint
Logistic Support Ship (JSS) in order to be able to offer an additional contribution to the
operational logistic support of the Admiral Benelux fleet (ABNL) and to the autonomous
deployment of the Belgian and European maritime capabilities. Just as with the combat
aircraft, this operational logistic support is essential to the reinforcement of the effectiveness
of the combat capability, i.e. the frigates. In consultation with the Netherlands, this platform
also offers the possibility to have a medical Role 2[25] on board and to support land operations
from the sea, such as evacuation operations.

Civilian and military ships are most vulnerable when they are moored. In port they are an
easy target for actions that can be very effective with limited means. NATO has stressed
the importance of developing specific capabilities against this threat. Based on the existing
knowledge within NATO, Belgian Defence will develop a harbour protection capability, which
can make a significant contribution to the maritime deployment, within the framework of
both collective defence and collective security, in an expeditionary way as well as for our own
ports.

The Optimisation of Land Forces for Motorised Deployment and Special Operations
Given the renewed importance of collective defence, NATO is bringing the focus back
to mechanised land forces with tracked vehicles and high firepower[26]. However, taking
into account the budgetary context, the reality
regarding personnel and the large number of

The government has explicitly opted to maintain
and modernise the existing motorised land forces


_25 See paragraph ‘medical support’ in chapter 5._
_26 Mechanised land forces with tracked vehicles have the best protection, the highest firepower and a very good tactical mobility_

so that they can remain the spearhead of the Belgian deployment within the context of
collective security. This strategic vision will allow a complete re-equipment of the Belgian
motorised land forces, for manoeuvre, combat support as well as combat service support
elements. This equipment is necessary for their operational preparation and deployment,
and to meet the desired level of ambition. This equipment is just as necessary to ensure
the individual safety of the servicemen and
to take a step toward a more networked
deployment. Because of the optimisation **This strategic vision**

deployment conditions for crisis management
operations in the southern European periphery (North Africa, Sahel, Middle East). Thus, for
the duration of this strategic vision the focus will primarily be on flexibly deployable land
forces to ensure stability and security in this southern European periphery, and secondarily,
on interventions worldwide within the same context of crisis management. Additionally,
these motorised land forces can also be deployed within the framework of rapid interventions

against hybrid threats, supporting collective defence within the framework of NATO. It will
thus remain possible for the existing and future Belgian land forces to make a meaningful
contribution to the NATO stand-by forces within the framework of collective defence (NATO
Response Force (NRF) and Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF)).


_Operators of our Special Forces are training together with a German helicopter and a Norwegian submarine during_

Furthermore, while staying within the current budgetary path and the planned means for
investing in major equipment, it is also possible to widen the deployment possibilities of
our para-commando troops within the framework of a general reinforcement of our Special
Operations Forces capability, a capability which is more and more demanded by NATO,
especially when dealing with hybrid threats. The two current para-commando battalions
will be transformed into two Ranger battalions which will primarily focus on the support of
the Special Forces, as Special Forces Support Group. Today the para-commando troops are
primarily airborne units[28]. The transformation of the para-commandos into Rangers in
support of the Special Forces widens their deployment possibilities, ensures the lasting

is further emphasised by the participation **Group.**
of Belgian Defence in the NATO project
for a Composite Special Operations Component Command (C-SOCC), which will be created
together with the Netherlands and Denmark. For Belgian Defence this contribution will be
based on a national Special Operations Command (SOCOM). An important basic mission
of the Special Forces themselves as well as of their Support Group (the Rangers) is providing
local ground troops in an armed conflict with military assistance. This military deployment
form is increasingly preferred to an active armed external intervention and plays an ever
more important role in crisis management operations within the framework of collective
security.

The deployment of combined arms motorised land forces (including their own combat
support and combat service support elements) requires additional essential support
capabilities.
Our important strategic air transport capability is an element in ensuring the expeditionary
deployment of these troops. The future A400M transport aircraft and a possible participation
in the Joint Logistic Support Ship will reinforce the expeditionary deployment capability and
their logistic and medical support.
Other air support assets, such as combat aircraft and drones, will allow for additional
precision firepower as well as the necessary intelligence gathering to obtain a good situational
awareness.
Teams for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear warfare, explosive ordnance disposal
teams and military construction teams contribute to a safe deployment of the motorised
land forces, as well as to other forms of expeditionary deployment.
Helicopters can supply additional mobility and can be deployed for medical support of
ground troops.
A non-kinetic capability such as influence support teams contributes to the engagement
of the combined arms motorised capability (as well as of other capabilities), allowing the
deployed troops to better understand and work with the local population and execute

influence operations. In combination with military construction, these teams can provide
the population with humanitarian assistance in support of the military deployment and
revive social aid[30]. This non-kinetic support capability is also essential to the development of
an effective comprehensive approach in an engagement zone.

Military Cyber Capability: Essential for Deployment Within the Framework of
Collective Security and Collective Defence
A military cyber capability contributes to the defence of communication and weapon systems
that are crucial to armed forces, but it also has to be able to participate in offensive actions
within the expeditionary deployment.
In addition to the contribution of cyber

NATO exercises collective defence, as it
has been noticed that cyber attacks can
have the same effect on the territorial
integrity of NATO countries as conventional attacks. Therefore, our military cyber capability
also needs to be reinforced to meet the needs of collective defence. NATO considers this a
national responsibility, but expects the countries that have important NATO facilities on their
territory to take the lead in the matter of cyber protection.

**b. A Modern Approach to the Core Task ‘Protection of Belgian Citizens**
**Worldwide’**

Our citizens live all over the world. The safety of these Belgians is ensured in the
first place by the contribution of the Belgian authorities to security in the world,
notably through diplomatic action, development cooperation and the deployment
of Defence, mainly within the context of the core task of ‘collective security’.
However, situations can occur in which there is a direct threat against Belgian citizens or
groups of Belgians in a particular country, region or city, or against individual Belgian
citizens who perform specific duties. When local authorities are no longer capable of
ensuring the safety of our fellow citizens, Defence must be able to intervene in order to
ensure their physical safety worldwide.

When Belgian citizens abroad are faced with a direct threat, this is identified in first
instance by our military intelligence service, which is in close contact with the Belgian
diplomacy and consular services, the Belgian intelligence and security services, and the
intelligence services of partner nations. This service provides the Belgian authorities with
intelligence and makes it possible for the government to take appropriate measures.

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

In most cases the threat against Belgian citizens abroad builds gradually, thus allowing the
Belgian authorities to react in stages, if possible in consultation with other countries and at
the European level.
De Consular services are responsible for informing Belgian citizens under threat, encouraging
them to take appropriate measures, such as leaving the country by civilian transport before the
security situation deteriorates further.
However, at a certain moment the authorities can decide that an effective and immediate
evacuation of national citizens is necessary because their safety can no longer be
guaranteed. Defence can provide transport with its strategic means of transport when
the civilian transport no longer works. At the moment, our strategic means of transport
consist of air transport only. In the future, this could possibly be expanded with strategic
maritime transport.
If there are indications that the security situation in a specific region can change dramatically
and that the safety of our citizens is in danger, the authorities can decide to preposition soldiers
and equipment for a fast intervention. Prepositioning can be organised on land or, possibly in
the future, at sea through the JSS and an amphibious company. Prepositioning takes into account
the fact that because of the current proliferation
of war weapons, potential opponents can have **In the future, the**

citizens, without the possibility to preposition,
Defence will continue to be able to execute a military evacuation of citizens (Non-Combatant
Evacuation Operation - NEO). A flexible detachment adapted to the operational assessment,
ranging from a reinforcement of the security teams on the spot to a SOF Task Force[31], must
be able to deploy within that context by means of air transport assets.
In the future, the actual organisation of evacuation operations will be increasingly
international and multilateral, for which France is and remains the most evident strategic
partner. This partnership is reflected, among other things, in the Belgian participation in the
command structure of the Rapid Reaction Corps in Lille.
Belgium provides an evacuation contribution within an international framework with a
focus on Sub-Saharan Africa and the Great Lakes region for historical reasons, whereas
other countries take the lead in other regions. Our military capabilities should also be able
to contribute to evacuation operations around the world, possibly under the leadership of
other countries.

Besides evacuation operations aimed at repatriating large groups of people, Belgian Defence
also has to be able to execute direct actions across the world when Belgian citizens are in
danger, if necessary, to free Belgian hostages.

_31 The maximum configuration of a SOF Task Force consists of one SOF Task Group and one Ranger battalion._

Special Forces operators can also ensure the protection of Belgian citizens whose job requires
them to stay in unsafe areas, as is mainly the case for embassy staff. In addition, they also
carry out from time to time Close Protection missions to protect delegations.

**c. Optimisation of Support Provided by Defence to Internal Security**

Internal security is not one of Defence’s core tasks. However, Defence plans to support
internal security, for there is an obvious interconnection between internal and external
security, as has become very clear with the increased terrorist threat on our territory.
Ideally, our security is ensured as far away from our borders as possible through expeditionary
deployment within the framework of collective security. Today however, it is a fact that
terrorism linked to other security
issues constitutes a threat to our

In view of the permanent reality that Defence is the last bulwark for the security of our
society, it will optimise the use of its capabilities – set up around the three core tasks – within
the framework of internal security.

That being said, Defence already carries out internal security missions in a structural way.
On the one hand, it makes the specialist assets available that are covering the territorial
aspect of collective defence for a role in internal security (combat aircraft, coastal patrol
vessels). On the other hand, Defence takes up some territorial tasks because of its (historical)
expertise (Explosive Ordnance Disposal Service (EODS), Search and Rescue helicopters,
national missions of the military intelligence service, some capabilities of the military
medical support).
Two combat aircraft are permanently available to NATO on the national territory for
Quick Reaction Alert missions (air defence) and can also be deployed, for reasons of
interdepartmental efficiency, for missions within the framework of internal security (air
policing), such as the counter-terrorism Renegade[32] mission. The same goes for the Navy’s
coastal patrol vessels that are always on standby to follow up any military threats in our
maritime area of responsibility. These vessels can also execute tasks within the framework
of internal security, such as fisheries control, the fight against trafficking (drugs, human

case of natural disasters and incidents. From the authorities’ point of view the contribution
of these capabilities to internal security is an optimisation of the use of the state’s resources.
Today, there are also capabilities and missions primarily or partly aimed at supporting
internal security. For example, the Search and Rescue capability with helicopters is aimed
at internal security. Certain sub-capabilities of the military medical capability, in particular
the possibility to organise an emergency hospital in the military hospital, the organisation of
an emergency mortuary in the military hospital or the capability to produce medicine also
aim at internal security in the first place. Other military capabilities are additionally adjusted
to their contribution to internal security, like the EOD/C-IED[33] national response and the
EODS that is responsible for cleaning up historical ammunition.
Search and Rescue with helicopters and the tasks allocated to the EODS within the framework
of internal security will continue to be covered by the defence budget. Defence will as much
as possible rely on sourcing for the role of the EODS to clean up historical ammunition.


_The military capability for the disposal of improvised explosive devices plays an important role in ensuring internal_
_security within the framework of counterterrorism._

The possible options for the future of the SAR helicopters will be studied on the basis of
business cases, as a separate implementation topic and taking into account the capability
orientations of this strategic vision. The future of the medical support is discussed in more
detail in chapters 5 and 6. However, the military medical support will continue to pursue a
supporting role within the framework of internal security. Today Defence can also rely on

structures allowing a good interdepartmental coordination in terms of internal security, i.e.
the Maritime Information Hub and the province commands described in chapter 5.

Apart from the limited structural tasks, the expertise of Defence and the capabilities available
are used at national level during national crises. However, in the first instance they are
intended for the expeditionary deployment. The capabilities referred to include:

§ the surveillance detachments made available by the land forces because of the higher §
terrorism threat;

§ manpower and assets (ships, vehicles, engineer vehicles) for consequence management in §
case of flooding or other disasters;

§ CBRN teams in case of chemical disasters§ _;_
§ Special Forces in support of the Police special units;§
§ The use of the Military Hospital for the coordination, triage and care in the event of mass §
casualties;

§ The cyber capability to solve hacking of firms;§
§ Transport helicopters for the transport of wounded;§
§ The employment of the military Aviation Safety Directorate (ASD) in the event of air §
accidents with civilian aircraft;

§ The replacement of the civilian air traffic control by the military Air Traffic Control Centre§ .
As noted previously, the deployment of Defence by the government within the framework of
internal security, according to a substantial level of ambition, will be to the detriment of the
deployment possibilities for the three core tasks.

As pointed out, this strategic vision will optimise the commitment of the support provided
by Defence within the framework of internal security.
This strategic vision presents two additional military capabilities that are more particularly
related to internal security, i.e. the reserve companies (currently under study) for the specific
reinforcement of the land forces for tasks within the framework of internal security and the
Air Information Hub to ensure interdepartmental coordination (see chapter 5).


###### “Elaborate forms of cooperation with other national and international security partners will be strived for, in order to strengthen the national efficiency of Defence and in support of a more European defence policy." (principle n° 6)


If certain military capabilities, indispensable to the three core tasks, can also help the
authorities to take care of internal security in a more efficient way at interdepartmental
level, it goes without saying that this path should be pursued. A reinforced coordination with
other national security actors (including private companies[34] ) can contribute to achieving

this objective. It is important for our civilian security actors to know to what extent Defence
can ensure that military capabilities can be made available for a national deployment.
Cooperation and coordination with other national security actors active in the same field
will be pursued (for instance: Civil Protection in the CBRN field and military construction;
civilian hospitals for the Military Hospital) and could lead to synergies. A win-win situation
can be considered for comparable civilian and military capabilities through the procurement
(or even dual use) of common (identical)
equipment and the joint organisation of

and the other national security actors
within the framework of the European
Comprehensive Approach. For the time being, this approach is essentially applied within
the framework of civil and civil-military crisis management operations within the context of
the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy. It also gains in importance within NATO.
NATO has requested that closer links be created with the other Belgian security actors such
as the Crisis Centre of the Ministry of the Interior, Police and Civil Defence, within the
framework of the NATO defence planning and the civil-military operational deployment.
Defence will actively contribute to the reinforcement of these links.

A stronger legal framework will be developed for the deployment of defence capabilities
within the framework of internal security. Generally speaking as well as within the specific
framework of intelligence gathering, this approach would offer more clarity and legal
certainty to the servicemen deployed.

The optimisation of the role played by Defence within the framework of internal security
can contribute to building up the public support that is needed in order to create sufficient
stability to execute the strategic vision up to 2030.

**d. Potential for Adaptation**

The extent to which Defence is capable of continuously adapting to the security environment,
represents an important element for the organisation to remain a relevant security actor in
a volatile security environment.

This potential for adaptation is only possible if Defence itself has a clear vision of the trends
of the security environment and regularly checks if changes in this environment impose
adjustments to the defence policy and to the means made available to this end. A vision,
however strategic, remains a vision that should adapt to a new reality.

The organisation of military capabilities is
often a time-consuming process, first of all

Defence forces with a broad portfolio
will always be found to be flexible if
new capability emphases are necessary after a change in the security environment[36]. The
opportunities to further develop existing capabilities are simply more numerous within a
Defence with a broad portfolio.

The broad capability portfolio of this strategic vision (see chapter 5), the clear will of a
capability anchoring at European level (see chapter 3) and the development of a defence
R&T policy at national level (see chapter 6), will give concrete expression to the potential for
adaptation of our Defence.

Furthermore, this capacity to adapt goes beyond the material dimension. It is also determined
by adapted personnel regulations and by the extent to which Defence manages to acquire and
retain knowledge of other engagement doctrines and is able to rapidly (re)-integrate them
into the Defence training and structures. Maintaining its own robust capacity for military
specific competence development (see chapters 5 and 6) guarantees this.

_35 As referred to in the introduction, a military capability includes following lines of development: doctrine, organisation, training,_
_equipment, leadership and education, personnel, infrastructure and interoperability._
_36 Thus, giving the MALE drones the possibility to be armed leaves the option open for the future to proceed to an actual_
_deployment of these devices to support the ground troops with a tactical fire support._

### Actively Strive for a More European

 Defence Through Anchoring our

 Capabilities with Partners

Given the analysis of the security environment, our country primarily wants to build security
in Europe and around the continent. This priority is reflected in the « collective defence » and
« collective security » core tasks, in which the European security environment and the two
major European multilateral security organisations are central. For Belgium, as a middle-sized
European country, this strategy also is best suited to maintain an influence on the European and
international security.
The pursuit of a more common European security policy, both through the EU and within
NATO, remains the central and constant element
of our foreign policy, and therefore our security
and defence policy. Moreover, from a security **Considering the current**
perspective, these Euro-Atlantic organisations **European political**
are very complementary. Since the rebalancing

European military capability cooperation **European Defences does not**
(Pooling & Sharing)[37]. This should allow **seem a politically realistic option**
European countries to cover the entire spectrum **in the short term.**
of military capabilities in a more efficient
manner. This approach is essential to provide
security in their own periphery, with an increased autonomy, as mentioned before.

Today, European capability cooperation is still not optimal, because each country has a strong
national focus on its own defence policy and planning.

In addition, there is not enough guidance from the European level in order to coordinate this
defence policy (including the capability policy) in a top-down way. This is not much of a surprise,
knowing that security and defence matters are not handled by a supranational institution such
as the European Commission, but by the EU Member States themselves via intergovernmental
structures.

_37 It concerns the EDA Pooling & Sharing programme, the NATO Smart Defence programme and the Framework Nations Concept,_
_which is also supported by NATO. Pooling & Sharing focuses on achieving an economy of scale. Pooling is about supporting_
_common national capabilities between a certain number of partner countries or multilaterally. Sharing implies the creation of_
_a joint capability with rules on the use of capability on a national base (commensurate with the national contribution)._

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

Considering the current European political integration into the defence area, task specialisation[38]
among European Defences does not seem a politically realistic option in the short term. Task
specialisation would imply that one or more Defences develop a military capability for the
benefit of all European countries, while other countries would develop different capabilities
for serving the whole. Even with a new security strategy at EU level, a more compelling and
efficient division of military tasks and related military capabilities is not feasible without a
supranational authority.
In the fifteen years to come, the main actors of defence policy within Europe will more than
probably still be the European national states. It would therefore be premature, and even
dangerous to have Belgian Defence specialise unilaterally in some capabilities at this point.
After all, in the absence of a clear-cut overarching European political framework, no reciprocity
can be expected from other countries. Moreover, the reality is that countries that are already
cooperating with us today on defence matters are not seeking specialisation in terms of tasks
and military capabilities[39].

How can a middle-sized European country such as Belgium, for which a more European defence
is desirable and which at the same time aspires to actively enhance the European supranational
character, contribute in an efficient way to this more European defence in the current context?
Two complementary options will be discussed below: contribute to the filling of capability
gaps at a European level, and develop as many national capabilities as possible, together with
strategic partner countries.
These elements that clearly appear in the Government agreement and in the sixth principle will
be further developed hereafter.


###### “The Government will continue to work on strengthening international cooperation - within the framework of Benelux, as well as on a bilateral basis and at a broader multilateral level – to increase pooling & sharing with our allies and to develop more common procurement programmes with them." (Government agreement of 9 October 2014)


_38 A fictitious example of task specialisation consists in creating a Western European navy, including the Benelux countries,_
_France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Belgium would entirely turn its marine towards mine countermeasures vessels in_
_support of the six countries. The Netherlands would only supply amphibious vessels, France submarines, Germany frigates and_
_destroyers and the United Kingdom aircraft carriers. This option implies that specialised national capabilities be able to support_
_all needs of this Western European navy. In the case of this fictitious example, Belgium would have to invest in dozens of mine_
_countermeasures vessels, without being able/allowed to maintain other capabilities._
_39 Nevertheless, as indicated hereafter, far-reaching defence-related cooperation initiatives, such as the Belgian-Dutch naval_
_cooperation, already include a specialisation for specific components of military capabilities (lines of development)._

###### “Elaborate forms of cooperation with other national and international security partners will be strived for in order to strengthen the national efficiency of Defence and in support of a more European defence policy." (principle no. 6)


**a. Filling European Capability Gaps**

The main European capability gaps have been known for a few decades. At the Euro-Atlantic
level, the need for strategic enablers is the most stringent, allowing combat capabilities
to operate efficiently. We are talking about tanker aircraft, large transport aircraft,
reconnaissance drones, long-range precision missiles, Special Operation Forces, offensive
cyber capabilities, means of
gathering intelligence and

organise a strategic enabler in an
efficient way.

With regards to our budgetary possibilities, and in compliance with our defence policy, our
country will contribute to these joint European strategic enablers. The latter will enable an
autonomous European military engagement in the European periphery and at the same time
enhance the capabilities of the transatlantic partnership.

**b. Strengthening the Common Development of our Defence Capabilities**
**with Strategic Partner Countries**

The capabilities of our Defence can also help strengthening European capability defence
cooperation, by favouring their joint organisation with strategic partner countries. This
would enable these capabilities to be scaled up and to be supported more efficiently.

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

Looking ahead to an increasingly smaller Belgian Defence, the very organisation of the
support needed for a specific military capability is less and less proportional with the size of
the operational capability itself. From a capability perspective there is an incentive in favour
of an economy of scale to support our defence capabilities. This can only be implemented
through an extensive integration with the military capabilities of strategic partner countries.
Geographical proximity is crucial if the lines of development of a capability that are devoted
to « education », « organisation », « training », « equipment maintenance and management »
and « infrastructure »[40] are to be organised in a common way.

_In November 2013 a new infrastructure for the common Belgian-Dutch naval cooperation was inaugurated at Den_
_Helder in the Netherlands._


_40 The textbook example is the Belgian-Dutch naval cooperation. From a Belgian perspective, this cooperation model is_
_the most important benchmark for further cooperation initiatives with our strategic partner countries. This particular_
_cooperation actually consists of an integration between both navies, with a common organisation of the support_
_(doctrine, command, maintenance, education, training, logistics) of the identical multi-purpose frigates and the_
_identical mine hunters. Identical systems are a very important driving force in this deep defence cooperation. The_
_national sovereignty of both countries is enhanced by the Belgian-Dutch naval cooperation, as the extended national_
_capability of action outweighs the loss of national autonomy because of the joint organisation of lines of development._
_Belgian Defence also established close cooperation relationships with France for the instruction of its pilots. This cooperation_
_focuses on one single line of development of a capability. However, like for the navy, it includes the joint organisation of various_
_supporting lines of development for our training aircraft, the Alphajets, with France._

###### The capabilities of our Defence can also help strengthening European capability defence cooperation, by favouring their joint organisation with strategic partner countries. This would enable these capabilities to be scaled up and to be supported more efficiently.


A well-balanced partnership is the key to
success. If the differences in the benefits
brought by cooperation are too different for
the individual partner countries, a relation
of dependency could emerge instead of a
partnership.
From this reality, it is quite logical that our
Defence should first seek for well-balanced
partnerships with its neighbouring countries
(Germany, France, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, the United Kingdom)[41], before
trying to strengthen its cooperation with
other EU and NATO member states.


The example of structural cooperation between the Benelux countries, within a flexible
cooperation structure (the Benelux Defence Cooperation) should extend to our other
neighbouring countries. A cooperation structure has to offer guidance as well as impulses
to enhance cooperation at the political and military strategic level, and open the door to
bottom-up initiatives. These structural cooperation bonds can also provide opportunities
for a systematic dialogue on the national defence capability planning, for the purpose of
setting up a (partially) common planning. ursuing identical equipment indeed offers the
best possible basis for extensive cooperation in all lines of development sustaining a military
capability.


In order to line up the defence planning of – and, more generally to strengthen capability
cooperation between – partner countries one needs to be a reliable partner. The
recapitalisation of Defence (see
chapter 4) and its anchoring through
this strategic vision as well as a **A Belgian Defence equipped**

8) contribute to this effect. **portfolio, strongly anchored at**

– remains the most logic approach
towards a more European defence.

_41 In addition to strong capability cooperation links requiring a geographical proximity, there are of course other forms of important_
_capability and operational cooperation with other countries, such as the United States, that is one of our major partners._

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

This European capability anchoring also favours a more coherent European defence
policy (whether via NATO or CSDP[42] ). Filling European capability gaps increases
the number of opportunities for European action. A common capability support
with our partner countries also helps building bonds of trust, mutual reliance, and
therefore in time, a national defence policy, which also has to take other parties into
account and thus should be done increasingly in consultation.
In a more fragmented world, in which new and older powers keep investing in the
military instrument of power, the Europe of the EU and NATO countries can send
a strong signal by speaking more often with a single voice, supported by the real
possibility of conducting common (autonomous) military engagements.

**c. Impact on Belgian Defence Capabilities**

Our defence policy orientation outlined above provides us with incentives to invest,
as a public authority, in essential strategic support capabilities through European
programmes.

strategic partner countries –
will enable us to generate more **The operational commitment**

in a more efficient way increases the deployable capabilities within the framework
of the defence and foreign policy of our country. The capability for action of the
Belgian State is therefore enhanced and prevails over the dependence created by the
common organisation of lines of development with a strategic partner country. The
operational commitment of our national capability remains a decision taken by our
government alone. This decision does not necessarily have to be taken together with
the partner country with which we cooperate on capabilities[43].

Without any claim to completeness, a few possible forms of cooperation for a
European capability anchoring will be mentioned in regard to the various capabilities

### A Defence with a Balanced Budget

 Through Recapitalisation Based on

 Multilateral Solidarity

This chapter underlines the importance of recapitalising Defence by 2030, both to strengthen
the solidarity-based character of our Defence within a multilateral framework and to achieve a
balanced Defence budget in 2030.

**a. A Recapitalisation of Defence Based on Multilateral Solidarity**

It is important that our country faces its responsibilities at the international level in the area
of defence, in accordance with its position in the world and in Europe. This is a determining
factor in the international perception of our country in the world[44]. As the fourth most open
economy worldwide, Belgium strongly depends on foreign trade. It is therefore vital that our
country is perceived positively on the international scene.

Our defence policy focuses on a multilateral and solidarity-based contribution, with a special
emphasis on ensuring European security. We can only bring a solidarity-based contribution
to the operational and capability needs
of the two major European security
organisations, namely NATO and the EU, **It is important that**

that all countries which do not spend 2%

This would be the only way for these countries to meet the capability goals set by NATO and

help filling NATO's capability gaps. It was also decided that NATO Member States currently
spending less than 20% of their annual defence effort on the procurement of new major
equipment, would aim, within a decade, to increase their investments to 20% or more to
meet this criterion[46].


###### We can only bring a solidarity- based contribution to the operational and capability needs of NATO and the EU, if Defence manages to invest sufficiently in its capability evolution and can rely on the necessary personnel and operating budget.


NATO statistics reveal that the
average defence effort made
by European NATO Member
States currently represents
1.5% of the GDP[47]. If we only
consider European countries
which do not have any nuclear
capability (all but the United
Kingdom and France), this
percentage falls to 1.2%.


_46 Beside these input criteria, there are also output criteria, such as a sufficient burden and risk sharing for NATO operations, a_
_sufficiently deployable Defence with a sufficient sustainability and the implementation of NATO standards and doctrines, so_
_that NATO armed forces can operate jointly and effectively._

###### Starting with this legislature, the Government has decided to break the downward budgetary trend for Defence.


Like many European countries, Belgium has
cashed a peace dividend since the end of the
cold war. With the exception of Luxembourg,
today all our neighbour States (in green on
the chart below) have a substantially higher
defence effort relative to their GDP.


Starting with this legislature, the Government has decided to break the downward budgetary
trend for Defence, as it no longer meets the reality of our security environment, nor the will
to maintain a safe, free and prosperous Europe together with our allies on the long run. It
has been decided to recapitalise Defence in a way that reflects our multilateral solidarity. This
budget-related multilateral solidarity will enable our country to remain a credible partner
and maintain our solidarity within NATO and the EU. This is part of the Government
agreement and appears in principle no. 2 of this strategic vision.


###### “Belgium will remain a credible partner and will maintain its solidarity within NATO (…).” (Government agreement of 9 October 2014)


###### “The multilateral anchoring of Belgian Defence that generates a solidarity-based security, has also to be supported by Belgium with budgetary means.” (principle no. 2)


The strategic vision takes the budgetary path of Defence, as decided in 2014 for this legislature,
as a starting point. This path will be mitigated until 2019 included, by transferring 100 million
euros from the interdepartmental provision to Defence every year. These funds will be used
to reimburse the debt and to pay for current investments[48]. It has also been decided to use
200 million euros from the reserves of Defence’s budgetary funds[49] during the 2016-2019
period to invest in major equipment, with a special focus on investments for ground forces.
This extra budget renders additional investments in major equipment possible, in addition
to the basic amount of 9.2 billion euros foreseen in the period 2020-2030 for this type of
investments.

_48 This is not about investments in specific military equipment, but about the replacement of specialised tools and major_
_infrastructural maintenance._
_49 These three funds were closed on 31 December 2015 by decision of the Council of Ministers of 1 October 2015. They were_
_replaced by one new fund for Defence starting on 1 January 2016. The remaining credits are still available on the previous_
_funds._

From 2019 on, the budgetary path will follow a progressive and linear growth in order to
reach a defence effort of 1.3% of the GDP by 2030.

_Table 1: The defence effort planned for 2015-2030 and its % of GDP according to the budgetary path of the_

The budgetary path for the recapitalisation of Defence leads to a solidarity-based defence
effort towards 2030, which exceeds the current average of the European NATO countries
without nuclear capability. Considering that in the meantime other European countries have
also decided to recapitalise their Defence this decision should allow us to join the middle
group of NATO countries by 2030.

_Chart 1: The defence effort of the European NATO countries in 2015 (as a % of GDP)_

As stated in the table below, the linear increase of the Belgian defence effort will give way
to an increased defence budget from 2019 on. These figures are also expressed in constant
euros 2015.

_Table 2: The defence budgets planned for 2015-2030 according to the budget path of the strategic vision._

The first instalment of the 9.2 billion euros for investment budgets on major equipment (for
the 2020-2030 period) will be available for payments in 2020. Compared with the defence
budget of 2.4 billion euros for 2019, the additional budgetary effort made during the 20202030 period will be 13.8 billion euros. This will be detailed in the next subchapter.

**b. A Balanced Budget for Defence in 2030**

Thanks to the above-mentioned relative global increase of the defence effort and the defence
budget, the internal cost structure of Defence will be rebalanced by 2030. The main criterion
in this regard is the ratio between personnel costs, operating costs and investment costs.
Before discussing this ratio, a word of explanation should be given on the need and on the

practical content of this recapitalisation according to the different budgetary lines of the
global cost structure of Defence.

The overall cost structure of Defence can be subdivided in 11 different budgetary lines:
investments in major equipment, debt, investments in infrastructure, contributions to
multilateral investments, investments in R&T, additional sourcing in replacement of duties
without military specificity, small equipment investments, functioning, activity-related
personnel expenditure, personnel and pensions. These 11 budgetary lines are shown
hereafter in a chart representing the planned global cost structure for Defence and in the
corresponding table of figures.

Investments in Major Equipment
The recapitalisation of Defence will create an investment margin for major equipment
procurement programmes amounting to 9.4 billion euros up to 2030. This will allow Defence
to modernise weapon systems that remain relevant and to focus on new capabilities. This
investment budget will be spent on investments in the capabilities described in chapter 5.
Given the importance of the anchoring of investments planned until 2030, not only for our
society and our allies, but also for the business world, the Government agreement foresees
the creation of a military programme Act. This point is mentioned in principle no. 7 of this
strategic vision.


###### “A military programme Act which will include the investments in major equipment of Belgian Defence for the duration of the strategic vision, will help generate stability and predictability for the effective realisation of a credible Belgian Defence by 2030 towards society, our allies and the business world.” (principle no. 7)


Debt
The budgetary line for “debt” covers the payments for past contracts relating to investments in
major equipment. These investments mainly include the payments for the A400M transport
aircraft, with smaller amounts for the procurement of the Rapid Reaction Vehicle, which was
decided in 2015, the improvement of the protection of the ISTAR battalion’s Pandur and the
consolidation of the F-16 combat aircraft and the frigates.

Investments in Infrastructure
This budgetary line specifically covers all investments in infrastructure, including the
maintenance works which are borne by the owners, such as replacing roofs and external
carpentry works. The operating costs related to infrastructure belong to the budgetary line
“functioning”.
For decades, savings have been made on Defence infrastructure. The modernisation of
ageing buildings in order to bring them in line with new standards, especially with regards
to sustainability, will take several years. To finance this modernisation, the budget for
infrastructure investments will be increased from 28.3 million euros in 2019 to 140 million
euros in 2030. In a first estimate a reduction of the number of military quarters, proportionate
to the evolution towards a Defence of 25,000 FTE, has already been taken into account.

Contributions to Multilateral Investments
The budgetary line for “contributions to multilateral investments” mainly covers the budgets
for the NATO infrastructure investment programme to which all allies must contribute and
the NATO investment programme for the modernisation of the AWACS fleet (see chapter 5).
In addition, contributions are made to smaller investment costs for NATO and the Eurocorps.

Investments in R&T
Defence does not currently meet the EDA standard for investments in Research &
Technology (R&T), requiring 2% of the defence effort to be spent on R&T, of which at
least 20% should be done through European collaboration programmes. In 2013, only
0.2% of the defence effort was spent on R&T[51].
Defence’s R&T investments correspond to the budget Defence wants to spend
on research in the field of innovative

development.
R&T as a standard of innovation is mainly
used by the EDA. The other EU bodies, NATO as well as the national and regional
authorities use mainly an R&D standard which includes both R&T and the resulting
development. This strategic vision specifically sees a role for research within and
financed by Defence for military innovation that is further developed by the industry
afterwards. Therefore, emphasis is given to EDA’s R&T standard. The national R&T
policy also should contribute to strengthening European defence cooperation.
Increasing the contribution of Defence to R&T is essential to give a positive impetus
to the pragmatic partnership mentioned in chapter 6 between Defence, our industry
and our research institutions. Today, this limited budget is included in the operating
costs of Defence (budget line “functioning”). As from 2022, additional investments
will be made in this field, and as from 2023, all R&T investments will be covered by
a separate budget line that will reach a level of 140 million euros in 2030. With this
increase of R&T spending to 2% of the defence effort in 2030, Defence will meet the
EDA standard and will be among the best-performing EU member states in this field,
according to the current NATO and EU statistics.

Additional Sourcing in Replacement of ‘Duties Without Military Specificity’
The wave of retirements within Defence will be mainly compensated by the extended use of
sourcing. This will be achieved, as provided for by the Government agreement, by outsourcing
tasks for which no military expertise or experience are required and which can be carried out
more efficiently through the civilian market. By 2030, activities which are currently carried
out by a total number of 5,000 military FTE should be taken over by enterprises or other public
authority bodies for the benefit of Defence. Chapter 6 lists the fields which are currently being
considered: the territorial services inside and outside the quarters (Territorial Support Service,
including the outsourcing of
catering activities, part of the
surveillance of the military **By 2030, activities which are**
quarters and maintenance), **currently carried out by a total**

current training areas, as well
as the storage and distribution
of equipment, clothing and material. These activities will be outsourced stage by stage,
according to the retirement of the personnel currently active in these areas.
Today, the 5,000 FTE to be compensated by this type of sourcing represent an annual wage
cost of some 275 million euros. It is assumed that the sourcing of these services will not
exceed 90% of the wages that are paid to the current personnel. Therefore, as from 2017, a
budgetary line for “additional sourcing in replacement of ‘duties without military specificity’”
will be created. This budget will add up to a maximum of 250 million euros.

Small Equipment Investments
The budgetary line for “small equipment investments” enables Defence to maintain existing
(weapon) systems and to purchase, among others, the tools, machines, furniture and
electronic equipment needed in support of the day-to-day functioning of Defence.
This budgetary line must be proportional to Defence’s new major equipment. Generally, to
determine the necessary budgets for this budgetary line, the Defence Staff takes into account
about 10% of the investments in major equipment. Consequently, the small equipment
investments will increase to 148 million euros in 2030.

Functioning
This budgetary line is planned to be gradually increased from 607 million euros in 2016 to
1,155 million euros in 2030.
This increase is mainly related to the rise in the “operating costs for the equipment of the
military capabilities” mentioned in this vision. Indeed, these costs increase from 236.1
million euros in 2016 to 607.7 million euros in 2030. They include the costs related to
the maintenance and upgrade (small modifications) of the (weapon) systems[53] of these

_53 The outsourcing of the maintenance of the mine hunters is a current example of this._

capabilities, but also the costs related to fuel, the procurement of new types of ammunition
and the replenishment of ammunition used for operations (estimate) and training purposes.
The increase of the budgets needed for this part of the budgetary line is mainly due to a rise
in the operating costs of the weapon systems owing to the higher technicality of the new
systems. Civilian firms are already today taking care of an important part of the technicallogistic maintenance and servicing of these (weapon) systems. As this trend will only
increase in time, it will require additional operating budgets. Furthermore, the introduction
of new weapon systems leads to increased operating costs for initial one-time expenditures
in the start-up period (programme costs, initial education and training for technicians and
operators, participations in pools for spare parts and ammunition, the procurement of an
initial stock of ammunition for a weapon system …). As several new weapon systems will
be introduced within Defence, especially during the period 2025-2030, this will lead to an
additional increase of the operating costs during this period. The ammunition and fuel
consumption of some specific systems will also increase, due to an increase in education and
training, to strengthen the operational preparedness of our defence forces.
During the same period, the “operating costs within the framework of general support
of Defence in the field of equipment” will also significantly increase from 125.9 million
euros to 197.7 million euros. However, this increase is mainly the result of choosing for a
service contract for the education and training of our combat pilots (instead of purchasing
a replacement for the Alpha Jet training aircraft) and contributing to the development of a
NATO ammunition pool for the air assets in support of a flexible operational engagement, as
well as for the sake of efficiency.
This budgetary line also covers the

and gas). This part of the operating costs
for infrastructure will remain stable
in the coming years and could eventually decrease by improving the sustainability of the
defence infrastructure (through investments on the “infrastructure” budget). The remainder
of the operating costs for infrastructure mainly includes service contracts for all sorts of
maintenance, repairs and small renovation works. The amounts budgeted for these tasks
over the last few years were far too low in relation to Defence’s real estate. The projected
increase will enable Defence to catch up on the current backlog and to return to a normal
level of activity after 2030 for this part of the budgetary line “functioning”.
A last part of this budgetary line covers the “operating costs not related to equipment”.
These will also significantly increase from 162 million euros in 2016 to 210 million euros
in 2030. This rise is due to the increased education and training costs, owing to the growth
of education and training abroad, the increased recruitment costs in order to maximise the
application of the BDL personnel regulations (see chapter 7) and the increased operational

deployment of Defence, besides the existing operating costs, especially for NATO, the EU
and Eurocorps, which are also covered by this budgetary line.

Activity-Related Personnel Expenditure
The level of training for servicemen is being raised in order to bring the capabilities into
line with the NATO standard and thereby meet the expectations regarding the enhanced
operational engagement of Defence.
In order to achieve this, the budget for activity-related personnel expenditures is being
increased from 92 million euros in 2016 to 250 million euros in 2030. This budgetary line
covers all allocations relating to operations, as well as the allowances for weekend work
and intensive service (related to training on the one hand and to structural needs such as
permanent services on the other hand).

Personnel
These are the (basic) salaries of the personnel. Defence has to maintain an attractive position
on the labour market in order to enlist the (technically) educated personnel it needs and
provide the operational capabilities with personnel complying with the mental, physical and
medical requirements. Part of this budgetary line will also be spent on the introduction of
more flexible wages in order to attract and retain the people with the appropriate profiles
within Defence.

Pensions
The pension costs represent the expenditures for the payment of the pensions of the
Defence personnel. In order to determine this budgetary line, the actual expenses have been
extrapolated to the future according to the expected retirement of personnel, based on the
current personnel regulations.

Thanks to the subdivision of the defence effort in budgetary lines, it is now possible to
analyse the evolution of the balance between the personnel costs, the operating costs and the
investment costs as part of this effort.
For historical reasons, the major part of the Belgian defence effort is currently spent on
personnel costs. Consequently, there is very little budget left for operating and investments.
This historical distribution differs substantially from the international benchmark based on
a more balanced distribution as referred to in principle no. 3d.

###### “For the duration of the strategic vision (2016-2030), we will strive towards a better balance within Belgian Defence, by means of a cost structure for Defence with a strong decrease in the proportion of personnel-related costs within the Belgian defence effort.” (principle no. 3d)


It is generally accepted that personnel costs are balanced if they don’t exceed in an
important way 50% of the defence effort. NATO expects that at least 20% of the defence
effort is spent on investments in major equipment, as mentioned above. Considering also
the investments in infrastructure and R&T, the optimum investment percentage ranges
between 20 and 30%. Consequently, in order to have a balanced Defence, the remaining
operating costs should vary between 20 and 30%. The Belgian government has decided
that our Defence of the future should strive for this balanced distribution of the defence
effort by 2030.

R&T”, “debt”, “contributions to multilateral

categorises small investments in equipment as operating costs; so does the current document.[54]

The budgetary lines relating to “small investments in equipment”, “functioning” and
“additional sourcing in replacement of non-specifically military duties” constitute the
operating costs.
The lines relating to “activity-related personnel expenditure”, “personnel” and “pensions”
cover the personnel costs within the framework of the defence effort.
The evolution of the percentages of the personnel, the operating and the investment costs as
part of the defence effort appears at the bottom of the table showing the global budgetary
evolution (table 3). It is quite clear from this that the percentage of personnel costs will
decrease considerably from 78% in 2016 to the ideal value of 49% in 2030, and that the

Consequently, this recapitalisation of Defence based on multilateral solidarity ensures the

### The Capability Portfolio by 2030

Based on the analysis of the security environment, chapter 2 described how Belgian Defence will
position itself in the years to come and what the consequences are on its capabilities. Chapter 4
explained the precise budgetary framework to fund these capabilities. This chapter will elaborate
on the level of ambition and will provide guidance for the distribution of the budgetary means,
the estimated timetable for investments and the personnel envelopes for the various future
capabilities.

The extent to which the rationalisation principles referred to in chapter 6 can be implemented,
will become clear during the execution of the strategic vision. This may possibly require (limited)
shifts in the personnel envelopes planned for 2030. Nevertheless, the mentioned figures give a
very clear guidance for the future organisation of the capabilities of Defence.

In this chapter, a clear budgetary framework is used based on conservative estimates for the
various capabilities. Thus, from the start of the implementation of this strategic vision, there is
a clear perspective on the evolution towards a balanced and gradual realisation of the capability
portfolio up to 2030. Both the level of ambition and this budgetary estimate set clear boundaries
for the development of this capability portfolio. The precise figures for the investments needed
for the realisation of this level of ambition will however only become clear at the end of a
procurement procedure. Should there be important differences in the equipment’s purchase
price throughout the duration of the strategic vision, it goes without saying that the related
investment programmes nevertheless shall be carried out in accordance with the budgetary
estimates. This restriction allows avoiding foreclosure effects with respect to other procurement
programmes planned at a later stage.
All investment budgets below are expressed in constant 2015 euros so that the relative impact
of the investments is immediately visible. These investments are also linked to a timing in
which the actual procurement of this equipment will take place. Depending on the timing of
the investments up to 2030 in the military programme Act, the investment amounts shall be
adjusted for inflation, while the 9.4 billion euros (€ 2015) for investments in major equipment
shall not be exceeded. The total amount of 9.4 billion euros planned to be invested in major
equipment will be liquidated in the period up to 2030.

This chapter also gives a first indication about the evolution of the current Defence capability
portfolio towards the portfolio of the future. Whenever appropriate, we will propose ideas for
the reinforcement of the supporting role of some capabilities within the framework of internal
security and how their European anchoring can be achieved, in compliance with chapter 3. The
precise impact of these two capability aspects will only become clear in the course of the strategic
vision. The outcome must be a more efficient (and thus also more effective) Defence, as provided
for in principle no.6. Depending on the international military cooperation opportunities, the

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

international alignment of the procurement timetable of some capabilities will possibly have an
impact on the distribution of the procurement programmes proposed below.

Additional studies will still be conducted for some (support) capabilities. These concern more in
particular the organisation of reserve companies, the realisation of the replacement capability for
the current white fleet, the future organisation of the SAR mission with helicopters, the disposal
of historical ammunition by Defence, the relevance of maintaining the A109 helicopters as
training capability, the integrated operational preparation of the Ranger battalions’ amphibious
company, the organisation of a central operational preparation and support structure for the
medical support and a participation in the Joint Logistic Support Ship.

This chapter gives an overview of the personnel envelope after the implementation of this
strategic vision in 2030. However, in practice, the target figure of 25,000 FTE for Defence will
already have been reached in 2024.

The necessary investments for the essential operational support and command of the capabilities
(of the four capability dimensions) will also be dealt with below. This information will be further
clarified in a next chapter that emphasises the rationalisation and the reinforcement of the
efficiency of Defence. Based on the general philosophy that the operational capabilities play a
central role, the main rationalisations logically will be found in their support. This does not alter
the fact that this support is essential for the proper functioning of all four capability dimensions,
and that it fully contributes to the effectiveness of Defence.

With the evolution of the capability portfolio by 2030 that is being described below, the provision
of the Government agreement, according to which important investments are put forward for
all dimensions and more in particular for combat capabilities, is being met. Moreover, this also
complies with principle no.3a related to a balanced Defence:


###### “For the duration of the strategic vision (2016-2030), we will strive towards a better balance within Belgian Defence by means of capabilities allowing an appropriate completion of the core tasks.” (principle no. 3a)


T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

###### “For the duration of the strategic vision (2016-2030), we will strive towards a better balance within Belgian Defence, by means of a balance among the four capability dimensions (intelligence- cyber-influence, land, air, maritime), with at least always one credible and sustainable deployable combat capability per dimension. The risk sharing aspect is essential to an output based on solidarity and requires a sufficiently broad national toolbox with sufficient combat capacity in each dimension. This toolbox assures the Belgian government of a lasting influence and impact on international security. It makes Belgium a credible partner at international level. In order to generate this solidarity- based output within a multilateral framework and in support of the national interests, an equally solidarity-based input by means of a defence effort based on solidarity is of the utmost importance.” (principle no. 3b)


###### “For the duration of the strategic vision (2016-2030), we will strive towards a better balance within Belgian Defence through a stronger emphasis on the strategic support capabilities (strategic enablers) that are indispensable to support our own combat capabilities and that often result in a better approach to remedy the European capability gaps. These strategic enablers can be acquired at national level or through a participation in an international cooperation.” (principle no. 3c)


T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6

###### “For the duration of the strategic vision (2016-2030), we will strive towards a better balance within Belgian Defence through a stronger emphasis on the non-kinetic and civil-military capabilities that are important for the prevention of armed conflicts, for stabilisation after an armed conflict and for a contribution to security in the conflict area.” (principle no. 3e)


The parameters of 9.4 billion euros (€ 2015) budgetary means for investments in major equipment,
a personnel envelope of 25,000 FTE in 2030, the will to maximise the efficiency of our Defence
through an increased use of civilian services – if this approach is cost-reducing – and a strong
European capability anchoring, allow for a balanced and broadly deployable military capability
portfolio by 2030, with modern equipment and a sufficient sustainability. This approach offers
the best guarantee to:

§ allow the government to conduct a defence policy offering a valuable contribution to collective §
security and collective defence;

§ maintain capabilities that have a sufficient potential for adaptation, in order to rapidly respond §
to changes in the Belgian and European security environment;

§ be able to contribute in an active and effective way to a more European defence, that §
constitutes the essential basis for a more European defence policy and that is ready to take up
the challenges of a multipolar world.

On the next page you will find an overview of the level of ambition per capability dimension, of
the personnel envelope and the investments in major equipment for the various capabilities by
2030.

**I.** **Military Intelligence Service**

The military intelligence service referred to as ADIV (Algemene Dienst Inlichting en
Veiligheid (General Intelligence and Security Service))[56] supports Defence from the
strategic to the tactical level. This service is also in charge of gathering intelligence abroad
for our government. The activities of this service are consequently complementary to the
mainly national mission of the Security of the State.
In order to obtain a clear view of a situation abroad, it is essential to have personnel on
the spot. It is therefore of the utmost importance to rely on an effective and judicious
security apparatus abroad, consisting of specialised personnel. This apparatus must be
deployed in priority in areas where our national interests are at stake or where a possible
deployment of military means is probable.
During operations abroad, the intelligence apparatus is composed of members of the
military intelligence service, of tactical elements of the ISTAR capability and of members
of the other dimensions’ operational capabilities.
The military intelligence service is also in charge of the monitoring and analysis of
influence (including propaganda) by external actors, among others through the cyber
environment, within the framework of its mission.

Current and Future Content
The military intelligence service continues to work at the current level, with an improved
support for the military operations.

Investments in software will be made to improve the support of the analysis. It is essential
for the operational deployment to be able to rely on an intelligence gathering capability
in the field of signal intelligence (SIGINT) (for instance, sources of communication).
In order to reinforce Defence’s intelligence and influence capabilities, the cyber
environment has to be at the forefront. In addition to intelligence required for the support
of cyber operations, following domains shall be further developed: the monitoring of
social media, one of the most important sources of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
and the introduction of virtual agents with the goal to gather intelligence from third
parties or groups on the Internet (Human Intelligence - HUMINT).

The current Intelligence and Security School will be transformed into a Centre of
Competence for intelligence and security. This centre will keep pace with the complex
operational environment to make sure that the operators of the intelligence and security
community always receive a high-quality education and training.

_56 The mission of the military intelligence service referred to as ADIV is defined in article 11 of the Act related to the intelligence_
_and security service of 30 November 1998._

A study shall be carried out on the role, the competencies, the funding, the internal organisation and the capabilities of the intelligence services and on the cooperation among them as well as on the management and the control of these bodies. Their operating shall be optimised based on this study.” (Government agreement of 9 October 2014)


The military intelligence service will further reinforce the synergies with other national
actors, as laid down in the Government agreement. The reinforced coordination of
the missions of both Belgian intelligence services as well as the coordination with the

integrated Police forces and the Public Prosecutor’s Office must make sure that all necessary
domains are covered in an appropriate manner while avoiding useless overlaps. Synergy
in the support of the various actors should lead to enhanced efficiency and consequently
to the possibility to offer more security with the same means. The recently established
Belgian Intelligence Academy is a perfect illustration of this. The Centre of Competence
for intelligence and security will constitute the military pillar of this organisation while the
education/training capabilities and skills of our partners will also be used.

Within our country, the military intelligence service has unique capabilities such as
IMINT, SIGINT and cyber intelligence. It can also use the information provided by the
tactical sensors of the ISTAR capability. These means will be integrated in the national
security mechanism, taking into account the priority that will be given to the support of
the core tasks of Defence and within a legal framework yet to be defined.

Possibilities for a European Capability Anchoring
Although structural international cooperation in the field of intelligence is not always
easy, there are opportunities at the Benelux level. The objective will consist in eventually
creating an OSINT Centre of Excellence in Brussels.
Within the framework of the Benelux Defence cooperation, a project has been launched
on the rationalisation of the Defence Attachés network through a cooperation between
Belgium and the Netherlands, in which the first steps have recently been taken.

**II.** **HALE and MALE Reconnaissance Drones**

General Points
The relative importance of the use of drones in operations as a strategic support
capability increases. Therefore they need to be further integrated in the Belgian capability
portfolio. Reconnaissance drones are part of the ISTAR capabilities. Through the ISR
aspect (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance), an ISTAR capability provides the
situational understanding needed to give guidance at command level during operations
and to enhance the security and efficiency of the actions in the field. “Target Acquisition”
is, in this context, the process of target acquisition that is based on ISR and that provides
the correct data for precise kinetic interventions.
In addition to the HALE drones, the MALE drones and the ISTAR capability are also an
integral part of the ISR means.
Drones must be deployable for networked operations (in real time) in a complex
operational air space.

For the time being, the Belgian drones are limited to the tactical level. In terms of capability
classification, these B-Hunter drones are situated in the upper part of the spectrum of
tactical drones, just under the MALE drones. The MALE drones, in turn, are the category

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

under the HALE drones. The expertise acquired with the B-Hunter drones will be used
to develop and reinforce the HALE and MALE capabilities as well as the tactical drones.

HALE Reconnaissance Drones
**Current and Future Content**
Today, our Defence does not have any HALE drones and does furthermore not have any
access to this capability through international cooperation.
Our Defence will not invest in HALE drones but will participate in the NATO HALE
capability (the Alliance Ground Surveillance programme (AGS)) through a personnel
contribution to the data exploitation centre. The AGS HALE drones (five Global Hawks)
will be made available to NATO from 2017-2018 onwards.
The exploitation of the data collected by these drones requires the integration of our
armed forces into a secured integrated digital network that guarantees the interoperability
between the capabilities of the various dimensions at international and national level.


**Possibilities for a European Capability Anchoring**
These drones will fill important capability gaps at European level. Our contribution to the
AGS programme reaffirms our permanent will to reinforce the deployment possibilities
of NATO as essential European security organisation.

_NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg is briefed on the Global Hawk drone that will be operational from 2017-_
_2018 onwards within the framework of the NATO Allied Ground Surveillance programme._

-----

MALE Reconnaissance Drones
MALE drones are smaller than HALE drones and their possibilities are also more limited
but they are more flexible in use and less expensive. The primary mission of the MALE
drones consists of ISR, but certain types can also be armed and used for close tactical
fire support in order to offer, among others, a precise and rapid tactical fire support in
protection of ground forces.
Tactical drones are still indispensable, but the more capable MALE drones are gaining
more prominence in support of operational deployments. The operations in Afghanistan
and in Libya as well as in Mali have highlighted the important shortage of this strategic
support capability at European level.

_Image from an American MALE drone._

**Current and Future Content**
For the time being, Belgian Defence does not have this capability. Defence does
however have tactical drones that are just under the level of the MALE drones. Based
on this expertise, Defence will first acquire two MALE drones and the related control
and communication systems. During the second half of the strategic vision, investments
will be made through a participation in a MALE programme (preferably developed in
Europe) with the final aim to acquire four additional (European) systems (including the
support systems).

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

The cost of the first two MALE drones, which will be acquired in the short term (20212025), has been benchmarked with the cost of similar Dutch drones. This price takes into
consideration the complete system, including the airframe (as well as the sensors), the
ground-based control station and related equipment. Considering the Dutch benchmark,
one ground-based control station per drone is planned to assure optimal deployment
possibilities. The procurement of one single station per drone increases their ability to
deploy and consequently their efficiency. The planned integration of these aircraft in our
air space offers an important increase in value for training purposes and for the possible
execution of national tasks within an interdepartmental framework.

Our MALE drones will have the possibility to carry out armed operations. Actual arming
(and the related ammunition’s operating costs) shall however be subject to an additional
government decision.[57] _[58]_

**Reinforcement of the Support to Internal Security and Possible Cooperation at the**
**National Level**
The MALE capability could also offer a support to internal security. In this respect, MALE
drones could, for instance, carry out tasks for the (federal) Police forces, Customs and
even for environmental services. For surveillance missions, they are complementary to
helicopters, because they can discretely hover over an area for longer periods of time. The
data collected by the drones of Defence could consequently be exploited at the Maritime
Information Hub and in the future Air Information Hub.

**Possibilities for a European Capability Anchoring**
These MALE drones fill an important capability gap at the European level that both NATO
and the EU have identified and are trying to solve. Our contribution to this capability
implies therefore an important capability reinforcement of the European potential for
military actions. At the same time, these drones offer possibilities to actively participate
in building more European defence cooperation. This materialises, on the one hand, in
joining (if possible) a European project for the development of a MALE drone, which
reinforces the European strategic autonomy, and on the other hand, in starting a close
partnership with our neighbouring countries to pool our MALE drones, which will
enhance efficiency. France already has MALE drones in use. If the same type of drones
is bought by our country or together with neighbouring countries, new cooperation
opportunities could occur in the field of support (maintenance and logistics), training
and education but also with respect to operational deployments with these strategic
partner countries.
Within that framework, Belgium offers an added value because of its long experience
in integrating unmanned aircraft in a complex air space and in the development of

_57 The potentially needed ammunition (basic stocks) for both drones in the short term and for the four drones in the long term_
_amounts to 20 and 40 million euros respectively; the purchase of ammunition falls under the operating costs._
_58 The other countries using this type of drones (France, Italy, the United Kingdom) have, since their integration in Defence, also_
_kept open the option of a deployment within the framework of tactical fire support. In the meantime, the British and Italian_
_governments have effectively decided to arm their drones._

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6

real-time networked operations with ground troops, combat aircraft and the Maritime
Information Hub. These elements could constitute the foundations for cooperation
with our neighbouring countries with regards to training and education on tactical
air-to-ground integration, including real-time imagery analysis, tactical situational
understanding, close air support (CAS) and the practical deployment of drones in a
complex operational air space.


**III.** **Intelligence Gathering by Means of Satellites (Space-Based IMINT)**

This capability generates intelligence at a strategic level that is complementary to ISR
through drones, among other things because of their capacity to map areas and facilities
worldwide.


Current and Future Content
Belgian Defence has been participating
in the French Helios programme related
to a satellite-based imagery intelligence
capability (IMINT: Imagery Intelligence)
since the nineties. The Helios system will
reach its end-of-life by 2020 and France plans
to launch the CSO (Composante Spatiale
_Optique) programme to follow it up. In 2012,_
Belgium decided to also participate in this
program. BELSPO[59] has already invested in
this capability as it is of crucial importance
to the Belgian space industry. The planned
military investment budget is intended to
fully meet this decision as regards Defence
and will allow Belgian Defence to participate
in this programme in accordance with its
needs. The start-up of CSO is planned in
2022 at the latest.


_In 2022 at the latest the new CSO satellites will_
_transmit images from space in support of our_
_intelligence services._


Reinforcement of the Support to Internal Security and Possible Cooperation at
National Level
Like all other IMINT of the military intelligence service, the space-based IMINT can be
integrated into the national security apparatus, considering the priority for the support
of the core tasks of Defence and in a yet to be defined legal framework.

Possibilities of a European Capability Anchoring
This programme contributes to the possibility for European autonomous action in the
field of intelligence and military operations. It enables us to keep a national access to
a capability through international defence cooperation and to continue an important
partnership with our strategic partner France.
This participation of Belgian Defence in the costs could make an additional cooperation
with other (strategic) partner countries possible.

**IV.** **Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, Reconnaissance (ISTAR)**

The ISTAR capability forms the core of the deployable intelligence and security
support and consists of command and control elements, an analysis capability as well
as of the requisite sensors. The command and control elements guarantee the proper
functioning of this ISTAR capability in support of each type of engagement of the other
dimensions.
The analysis capability includes all source and specialised analysts who guarantee the
situational understanding, in close cooperation with the analysis capability of the
military intelligence service.
To ensure intelligence gathering in the future complex environment, this capability
contains a mix of sensors: ground reconnaissance, human intelligence, tactical
Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), tactical signal intelligence, radars and ground
sensors.
This capability plays a central role in the joint[60] intelligence community.

Current and Future Content
The current sensors will evolve into a modern set of sensors. They must be capable
of operating in a networked environment in order to guarantee the integration of all
relevant information in due time. The existing capability of battlefield surveillance
radars will be replaced.
Based on the experience and expertise acquired with the tactical B-Hunter drones,
Defence will buy new tactical drones that will be integrated into this capability.
A study conducted by the Defence staff has showed that the further development
of the Pandur combat vehicle, which is currently the basic vehicle of the ground
reconnaissance capability, is to be considered as the best solution to make this
capability deployable in a complex theatre of operations in the shortest possible time.

_60 Joint: that integrates the various components of the armed forces. The contributions of the different components of the armed_
_forces are integrated on the joint level to obtain an outcome that is higher than the sum of the separate contributions._

_The observation camera of the Pandur combat vehicle supports the production of tactical intelligence in a networked_
_environment. The ISTAR capability is an essential Combat Support capability of the land forces._

Reinforcement of the Support to Internal Security and Possible Cooperation at
National Level
The tactical sensors of the ISTAR capability can also be used in the national security
system, considering the priority for the support of the core tasks of Defence and in a yet
to be defined legal framework.


Possibilities of a European Capability Anchoring
The existing close cooperation between the Benelux countries on the common
organisation of education and training as well as on the support of systems will be further
developed, just like the military cooperation with the French “Brigade de Renseignement”
(Intelligence Brigade).
The common purchase of UAS and ISTAR sensors can offer an opportunity to intensify
cooperation in the various lines of development when exploiting these systems.


**V.** **Cyber Capability**

Defence is an organisation strongly oriented towards technology and is therefore to a
large extent dependent on the cyber environment. The reinforcement of the technological


T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

nature and the digitisation of Defence will continue unabated. Defence will therefore rely
ever more on the cyber environment. The growing integration of unmanned military
systems in the capability portfolio reinforces this phenomenon. Our adversaries will try
to sabotage, destroy or seize our weapon systems and networks through cyber actions.
Dependence on the cyber environment also represents a threat to cyber security in
Belgium because of the growing interweaving of internal and external security.
Defence must be able to offer an appropriate response to this reality. Therefore it
will further develop its own cyber capability, consisting of a defensive, offensive and
intelligence pillar. This capability must guarantee an adequate level of cyber security of
the communication and weapon systems of Defence and at the same time be capable
to identify, manipulate and disrupt networks and systems of an opponent in order to
restrain or destroy its freedom of action.
The cyber-intelligence pillar guarantees the situational understanding needed to maintain
our own freedom of action in this essential military dimension.

Current and Future Content
Today, Belgian Defence is already developing a CSOC (Cyber Security Operations
Centre) for the cyber defence of the armed forces’ communication and information
systems (CIS). This strategic vision plans additional means and personnel for this cyber
capability in the short term.
For the time being, we have no offensive cyber capability. The necessary investment
budgets and additional personnel are provided for in this strategic vision in order to
rapidly develop this additional cyber capability. The offensive cyber capability in support
of the expeditionary operations will be essentially based on a reach-back capability,
physically located in our own country.
Defence will investigate whether the development of its cyber capability can be further
reinforced with specialised reservists.

Reinforcement of the Support to Internal Security and Possible Cooperation at
National Level
As stated in chapter 2, our military cyber capability has a territorial approach within
the framework of NATO’s collective defence. The reinforcement of the military cyber
capability will also offer opportunities to reinforce our national cyber capability within
the framework of internal security. Belgian Defence will have one of the most important
cyber capabilities in our country. As such, Defence will be able to contribute to internal
security (more in particular through its expertise in the field of intelligence and
malware), in line with the coordinating actions of the Belgian Cyber Security Centre
for ensuring our cyber security[61]. The cyber dimension of internal security is a priority
of the government.

_61 Cyber security is a situation where the protection of the cyber environment is proportional to the cyber threat and to the_
_possible consequences of cyber attacks. Cyber security stands for an absence of dangers or damage caused by the disruption, the_
_breakdown or the abuse of ICT systems._

###### “Considering the dangers facing our institutions, our enterprises and our citizens, cyber security will constitute a priority.” (Government agreement of 9 October 2014)


As stated previously, cyber threats will possibly arise in our country because of the
growing interweaving of internal and external security. The cyber environment can
be used to inflict damage on our economy, our industry and the scientific potential
of our knowledge society. In case of insufficient protection against cyber attacks, our
economy is exposed to risks that are likely to affect our country’s attractiveness in
terms of investments. Brussels is also one of the diplomatic capitals of the world and
Belgium hosts important institutions of international organisations.
Defence will strive for interdepartmental partnerships at national level for the acquisition
of systems, for education, for training and for common exploitation.

Possibilities of a European Capability Anchoring
Besides interdepartmental cooperation, we also strive for a more intense multinational
cooperation in the cyber domain. Within that framework, Defence will further
develop its leading role with respect to malware sharing, which represents a relevant
contribution to NATO’s cyber capability.


_Belgian cyber specialists participate in a NATO cyber exercise from their own facilities. These NATO exercises are_
_coordinated by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence located in Estonia._

From 2017, Defence will make one cyber specialist available to NATO’s Cooperative
Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Estonia.


**VI. Influence Capability**

In a hybrid and civil-military operational environment, capabilities should be developed
to influence the attitude and behaviour of specific target groups, both locally and globally
in benefit of a military deployment. Moreover, it is important to optimise civil-military
cooperation both for an effective comprehensive approach and to respond effectively to
hybrid threats.
The influence capability should be able to give advice on influence and civil-military
cooperation at strategic, operational and tactical level, as to prevent the actions of other
(military) actors from having negative effects on our operational and strategic objectives.


This capability consists of Influence Support Teams that support the operational
deployment by positively influencing the local population and authorities, our adversaries,
etc., and by proposing responses to the adversaries’ propaganda. These teams also ensure

_A Belgian civil-military cooperation team (CIMIC team) with a local interpreter is supporting our operational_
_deployment in Afghanistan within the framework of ISAF by establishing contacts with the local authorities._


T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

the civil-military cooperation (CIMIC) through contacts with the civilian authorities, the
local population and international, governmental and non-governmental organisations.
The Influence Support Teams work in direct support for the military present in theatre
and seek to align the military operations as much as possible with the civilian actions.
They coordinate military actions in close cooperation with the civilian authorities and
the actors of the international community, which can also involve medical assistance and
military construction means.
When deployed in a post-conflict reconstruction phase, these teams can also assess the
actions necessary for the restoration of public services such as electric power and drinking
water supply, road infrastructure, waste removal, telecommunications, police, health or
legal services, public administration and economic recovery. In this way, other civilian
actors and (non)-governmental organisations, and in a first phase, usually military actors
(military construction, military medical support), can restore the functioning of these
public services. Consequently, the opponents who want to disturb security in a particular
area are denied an important possibility to maintain or reassure themselves of the support
of the local population. This support of the local population is moreover a crucial asset
for the realisation of sustainable solutions for the local security.

These non-kinetic military effects shall mainly support the combined arms motorised
capability when deployed within the framework of collective security.
However, the specialists of these teams can also be deployed in support of the Special
Operations Forces capability or, in general, as a joint support capability. This influence
capability is an essential link in the general coordination of influence and of strategic
communication.

The influence support teams can rely on specialists in local culture and customs. They
determine the human factors that influence cooperation between servicemen and local
civilian actors in an area of operations. The efficiency of the military operations conducted
within the framework of a comprehensive approach is consequently maximised.

The influence capability, including the civil-military interaction (civil-military
cooperation - CIMIC) in the event of an operational deployment, is one of the most
important non-kinetic military capabilities. Principle no.3 e recognises its importance in
guaranteeing a balanced capability portfolio by 2030.

Besides a direct influence in the field during operations, this capability also includes
more global activities in support to our military operations and to counter hybrid
threats through the media and cyber environment and the production of a counternarrative. These activities are coordinated with the strategic communication and in close
cooperation with the Belgian military intelligence community, from the tactical to the
strategic level, because it is responsible for the detection of hybrid threats and propaganda.
A close cooperation with our Communication Department will also be indispensable for
a genuine strategic communication.

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

Current and Future Content
The investments planned are intended to reinforce the capability of the influence support
teams in the virtual world (social media, the Internet).
After 2020, the intention will be to develop the capabilities of these teams through
sourcing and the use of specialists from the civilian world (reservists) by a gradual
increase in operating means.
A structural partnership between Defence, industry and research institutions with
respect to the influence capability can be particularly interesting in order to gain access
to specialised capabilities in domains such as psychology, sociology, communication,
journalism, culture, languages, religion, history and marketing.

Reinforcement of the Support to Internal Security and Possible Cooperation at
National Level
Within the framework of internal security, this capability could, through the Influence
Support Teams, give support to a national influence strategy (among other things to
directly counter external threats), within a yet to be defined legal framework and in
support of national security actors.

Possibilities of a European Capability Anchoring
Within NATO, the Netherlands play a leading role in the field of CIMIC, through the
CIMIC Centre of Excellence. All our CIMIC specialists currently attend a training
course in that centre. A cooperation is also existing between our influence capability and
the Dutch « Civiel en Militaire Interactie Commando” (Civilian and Military Interaction
Command). The existing cooperation with both organisations could be reinforced
considering the importance of the non-kinetic capabilities in this strategic vision.

Contacts and cooperative initiatives with the French and German influence and
CIMIC centers (the “Centre Interarmées d’Action sur l’Environnement”, the “Bundeswehr
_Operational Communication Centre”_ _and the “Deutsches CIMIC Zentrum”) also exist._
These initiatives will be extended where possible.

**I.** **Combined Arms Motorised Capability**

The composition of a combined arms Battle Group depends on the mission it has to
execute and on the environment in which it is deployed. A typical composition consists
of a command and control element, a 500-men strong manoeuvre battalion (a mix of
infantry, armoured vehicles for direct fire support, own reconnaissance means and
mortars), combat support elements (artillery, engineers, ISTAR), combat service support
elements (logistics, medical support, command and communication means) and
sometimes also other mission-tailored capabilities, such as air assets (helicopters and
drones). In its largest configuration, a combined arms Battle Group is about 1,200 men
strong. A combined arms company is also a combined structure but is limited to some
250 men. With the integrated operational preparation of the various manoeuvre, combat
support and combat service support elements, the combined arms concept makes a rapid
deployment possible.


_The rifleman version of the Piranha combat vehicles in action during an exercise in the Baltic States. The Piranha_
_combat vehicles constitute the heaviest means of the current motorised capability._

Motorised land forces use wheeled armoured vehicles for their deployment. These vehicles offer
protection and firepower combined with a high mobility in the engagement area (operational
mobility). Motorised units can be deployed for mounted or dismounted operations in which
they can use their wheeled armoured vehicles either as a means of transport or to support

combat with available on-board armament. Because of this they can rapidly adapt to the
conditions in the field (urbanised area, wooded area, open plains …) and to enemy threats.

Current and Future Content
Since 2014, our land forces have been operationally prepared in a reinforced manner
according to a combined arms deployment concept comparable to the French concept.
This allows for combined arms formations to be deployed at short notice, which
increases our land forces’ responsiveness. This concept also remains the basis for any
deployment throughout the duration of the strategic vision. The investments described
in this strategic vision should enable the sufficient equipment of all units with new and
modern material in order to optimise the operational preparation and deployments. The
current pooling system for combat vehicles will be stopped.
By 2030, combined arms motorised Battle Groups or companies will be deployed
with adapted command structures, according to the level of ambition described in the
table. The deployment takes the international framework of the EUBG, NRF and VJTF
into consideration. All vehicles of the combined arms motorised capability will be air
transportable by means of the future A400M transport aircraft. In this way, the first
elements can be rapidly projected into the theatre of operations. The participation in the
Joint Logistic Support Ship, referred to previously, would, in addition, offer the possibility
to transport an important part of a Battle Group at one time[74].

Besides the command and control elements that are indispensable to a deployment at
the level of combined arms Battle Groups and companies, a brigade-level operational
preparation structure will be maintained. In this way, Belgium can - subject to a limited
operational preparation - meet the level of ambition that NATO requires, namely the
deployment of a motorised brigade within the framework of collective defence. Although
such a deployment scenario is unlikely, this form of organisation increases the potential for
adaptation of our land forces. This structure also offers opportunities for an international
integration into a divisional structure of one of our strategic partners.

Investments will also be made in security and interconnectivity to improve the
deployability of our land forces and more in particular, of the combined arms motorised
capability. To this end, the personal weaponry will be modernised with a new individual
weapon, smart combat vests (Belgian Soldier Transformation - BEST) which will
include integrated communication and information technology, night vision, thermal
observation means, heavy machine guns and light mortars. Besides the smart combat
vests, interconnectivity will be reinforced with the modernisation of communication
means (multirole radio sets, mobile satellite communications and tablets for the Battlefield
Management System). During engagements, security will also be ensured by investing in
jammers (against improvised explosive devices).

_74 The military logistic services that guarantee the rapid deployment of contingents are essential to shorten the deployment_
_time._

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

A solution will also be proposed to remedy the current lack of combat vehicles within the
motorised manoeuvre battalions and related Combat Support elements. To this end, part
of the LTTV (Light Troop Transport Vehicle), that are planned for the SOF capability
(Special Forces Group and Ranger battalions), will first be used by the motorised units.
During the period 2025-2030, all motorised manoeuvre battalions and their Combat
Support and Combat Service Support units will be equipped on the basis of a common
international motorised platform in various types. In this way, the LTTV can be
transferred to the SOF capability.

The lighter version of this common international motorised platform will replace the
current MPPV (Dingo 2)[75] vehicles in their Command Post/Rifleman/Scout versions
and the current AIV (Piranha)[76] vehicles in their Command Post/Rifleman versions. The
median version of this common international motorised platform will replace the current
MPPV with heavy (.50) machine gun and the current Direct Fire 30mm and Direct Fire
90mm AIV. Throughout the duration of this strategic vision, all basic vehicles of the
motorised brigade will consequently be replaced for both the manoeuvre battalions and
the Combat Support and Combat Service Support units that guarantee the combined
arms nature of the motorised capability.
Therefore, the lighter version of the

command and liaison will be replaced.

By 2030, the combined arms motorised capability will consist of 5 motorised manoeuvre
battalions, fully equipped and in a uniform way (combat and support vehicles, individual
equipment). The number of the Combat Support and Combat Service Support elements
will be aligned on this figure.
The manoeuvre battalions will maintain their direct fire support capability. The firepower
and the combined arms character of the manoeuvre battalions will also be reinforced
with the (re)-integration of mortars, equipped with guided precision ammunition. MiniUAS (Unmanned Aerial System)[79] will reinforce the reconnaissance elements of the
manoeuvre battalions.

The investments in individual equipment, means of communication and vehicles referred
to above to a large extent also apply to the Combat Support[80] and Combat Service Support
elements. Besides, specific investments will be made for these capabilities.

Wheeled bridging equipment and route clearance packages to clear the roads of IED[81]
will be bought for the motorised combat engineers, which conduct actions within the
framework of mobility, counter-mobility and survival support. This reinforces the safe
deployment of the combined arms motorised capability.

-----

Within the framework of escalation dominance when deploying combined arms Battle
Groups and companies in crisis management operations, these indirect precision fire
support means will, among other things, be capable of rapidly and efficiently delivering
precision fire in the Belgian area of responsibility, from a central position in a compound.
This will be coordinated with other fire support means and air assets. The artillery will
also use a (short-range) radar system able to locate adversaries firing grenades, rockets
and mortars. By linking these radar data directly with the indirect fire means this threat
can be efficiently addressed. This radar will also be effective against Unmanned Aerial
Systems (UAS/small drones).
The current limited-range air defence artillery (Mistral missiles) will be abandoned.


The ISTAR capability described in the dimension Intelligence-Cyber-Influence is also
the core of the deployable intelligence and security support of the operations in the
capability dimension Land. The various elements of this capability are indispensable as
tactical Combat Support for all forms of deployment within the level of ambition of the
Land dimension[82].

_By means of the Battlefield Management System on board military vehicles and in headquarters, it is possible to_
_command operations in an effective way and to ensure that the position of our own and friendly troops is known and_

_motorised companies, the SOF Task Groups, the Ranger battalions and the Ranger companies._

-----

The modernisation planned for the communication assets (multirole radio sets, satellite
communication and tablets for the Battlefield Management System) of the combined
arms motorised capability is valid for Defence as a whole. 530 FTE CIS personnel are
linked to them, among whom 210 FTE are general joint support, without being related
to the Land dimension specifically. They support all capability dimensions and are in
charge of territorial support. In the Land dimension table, these personnel are mentioned
separately as the joint CIS capability but the necessary investments have been integrated
in the general investments of the combined arms motorised capability (personal weaponry
and vehicles) and in the specific investments for communication means.
The CIS support of deployed detachments is structured around standard modules
that can be deployed in a joint and multinational framework, where the final user’s
interoperability and autonomy are ensured. The technical complexity is centrally
managed by specialised CIS personnel. The growing needs in connectivity and services
for the support of operations require robust strategic and tactical connections based on
the use of satellite communications.

The logistic capability of Defence is responsible for the supply of food, fuel, ammunition,
spare parts and equipment and assures the sustainability of the deployed capabilities. It is
also in charge of the repairs and maintenance of the land forces’ equipment.
The nature of the deployment and the distance from the national territory require

During an operational deployment, a maximum centralisation of the logistic means is
strived for in order to limit the number of logistic compounds, means and movements
while guaranteeing an optimal logistic support with minimum footprint. Throughout the
duration of this strategic vision, Belgian Defence will be able to catch up in the field of
equipping the logistic capability, with armoured vehicles that are adapted to the reality of
the theatre of operations, in which there is a permanent threat outside the compounds.
These are armoured protected recovery vehicles, armoured protected evacuation vehicles,
armoured trucks for the transport of containers and armoured heavy trucks.

Possibilities of a European Capability Anchoring
Within the land forces, cooperation with neighbouring countries has been well developed
in terms of quantity. With the Netherlands and Luxembourg it even takes place within
the structural framework of the Benelux defence cooperation. Besides, our country also
has a structural cooperation with France within the Rapid Reaction Corps in Lille and
through our contribution to the Eurocorps. The Dutch-German cooperation structure
and the Benelux defence cooperation have also generated cooperation with Germany for
land (sub-)capabilities. These forms of cooperation are primarily focused on the exchange
of doctrine, common training and operational preparation (within the framework of
EUBG and NRF). However, there is considerable potential for further intensification of
cooperation with regard to the lines of development “education/training” and “equipment”
(acquisition, logistic support and maintenance, configuration management). Economies
of scale in these areas can enhance our efficiency.


_In 2016 the first common Belgian-Dutch course for artillery piece commander of the heavy (120mm) mortars was_
_organised in Belgium, led by the Belgian artillery. This common course is the result of the strengthened cooperation_
_between Belgium and the Netherlands concerning artillery education and training for which a division of roles has_
_been agreed upon in order to ensure a better efficiency and interoperability._

Consequently, in accordance with the principles developed in chapter 3, the objective
for the land capabilities in general is to reinforce the current forms of cooperation in the
short term and to deepen the capability anchoring. A good example in this context is the
common organisation of education and training in indirect fire support and logistics,
within the Benelux defence cooperation, for which each of the three countries specialises
in different parts of the courses.


T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

Therefore, based on the capability programmes of this strategic vision, opportunities for
cooperation need to be identified and pursued as soon as possible by comparing and
aligning the defence planning of our land forces firstly with those of our strategic partner
countries. The orientation of the land forces in our neighbouring countries should also
be taken into account, in order to have as many opportunities for common deployment
in the future as possible, thus enabling common support of identical systems. Within
the time frame planned for the acquisition of a replacement capability for the MPPV
(Dingo) and the AIV (Piranha), from 2025 up to and including 2030, already one
programme in our neighbouring countries seems to qualify at the moment, i.e. the
French Scorpion programme. This programme would allow for the replacement of the
basic vehicles of the combined arms motorised capability by different types of a common
international platform, i.e. a lighter version
suitable for troop transport and adaptable

In view of the renewed focus on and
configuration of the combined arms motorised capability, it is also important that the
participation of the Belgian land forces in any overarching command levels contributes
to reinforcing the efficiency of the foreseeable operational engagement. The development
of the combined arms motorised capability shall therefore, if possible, take place within
the broader framework of a long-term strategic cooperation of our land forces with one
or more strategic partner countries, in which the development lines will be organised
in common and our motorised brigade will be integrated in the overarching command
structures of this/these strategic partner country(ies).

**II.** **Reserve Companies**

Defence has the big advantage that reserves can be integrated into its personnel to provide
a specific additional capability during peak periods.
In view of the core tasks “collective defence”, “collective security” and “the protection of
Belgian citizens all over the world”, the focus is rather on a specialised Reserve that can
make a contribution through specific duties that are not – or not sufficiently – available
within Defence itself.


_Today, only professional military personnel can be deployed for national surveillance missions in case of an increased_
_security threat. This task should be partially taken over by reserve troops in the future._

In order to allow Defence to continue to focus on its core tasks while making an important
and efficient contribution to the support of internal security during peak periods, it will
be examined if the existing non-specialist Reserve can be renewed and reactivated.[83]

The objective would be to organise reserve companies consisting of light infantry. These
reserve troops would be able to use leased commercial vehicles and other material
(vehicles, equipment, and armament) already present within Defence.
The reserve companies could be attached to the manoeuvre battalions of the combined
arms motorised capability, which would also be responsible for their operational
preparation.


_83 When the current policy remains unchanged, this non-specialist Reserve will cease to exist within the next five years due to a_
_lack of young recruits._

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

They could be led by a centralised territorial staff structure (cf reform of the province
commands of chapter 6), integrated into the Defence staff.


**III.** **Special Operations Forces (including Special Operations Aviation)**

Special Operations Forces (SOF) are elite troops that are used as a strategic support
capability.
According to NATO doctrine, Special Operations Forces have three basic missions:

§ special reconnaissance: reconnaissance and surveillance activities as well as special §
human intelligence operations for gathering strategic and/or operational information;

§ direct action: limited offensive actions to conquer or destroy specific targets, or to §
capture prisoners or free hostages;

§ military assistance: supporting allied forces in the entire spectre of violence, from §
giving basic training to supporting these troops, in particular through direct actions,
or by serving as liaison with air assets or intelligence sources.


The core of the Special Operations Forces capability consists of the Special Forces, the
operators of the Special Forces Group.

_The operators of the Special Forces have been giving military assistance to the Iraqi goverment troops since 2015._
_Whereas this mission primarly focused on giving training to the Iraqi Forces, it has evolved to an assist and advice_
_mission from behind the frontline._

essential for reinforcing the capability of the Special
Forces, in order to participate in rapid response
operations (counter-terrorism, rescue of hostages, protection or evacuation of Belgian
citizens).

Furthermore, a SOF capability also consists of joint enablers from all dimensions.

Current and Future Content
The future Special Operations Forces will consist of the operators of the Special Forces
Group, members of the Special Forces Support Group and specialised air assets. In
addition, some personnel members of the joint enablers will receive specific SOF training.
This includes EOD/C-IED teams, dog teams, a medical support capability and influence
support teams.

The Special Forces of the current Special Forces Group constitute the core around which
a reinforced SOF capability will be built. The Special Forces Group will grow to a total of
about 225 FTE.

The Special Forces Support Group will be based on the current para-commandos within
our Defence and will consist of two Ranger battalions. The Special Forces Support
Group must be able to deploy with the same reactivity as the Special Forces themselves.
Therefore, the Ranger battalions need to be continuously (structurally) organised as a
combined arms unit. They also need to have the same SOF mindset. For that reason,
the SOF competence centre (see section e. “Command and Operational Support of
Capabilities”) will not only include the Benelux parachuting school and the commando
training centre. A new competence centre will be established that will provide specific
Special Forces training to the Special Forces Group operators, to the Special Forces
Support Group personnel, and to selected personnel of the joint enablers whose mission
is to support these operators.

The basic vehicles of the Special Forces and the two Ranger battalions are light motorised
vehicles of the RVV (Rapid Reaction Vehicle) and LTTV (Light Troop Transport Vehicle)
type. These LTTVs will be acquired in various versions, adapted to the combat support
and combat service support elements integrated in the Ranger battalions. The acquisition
of the RRVs has already been approved by the government, whereas the acquisition of the

LTTVs will take place in the period 2019-2021. Other investments in major equipment
will be realised concurrently with those of the combined arms motorised capability.
Parachuting remains one of the many means of insertion of these troops. Therefore, the
requisite investments will be made in new parachuting equipment. This way the Belgian
international expertise in this field, demonstrated by the Benelux parachuting school,
can be kept up-to-date.
In addition to these investments in major equipment, small investments will constantly
be necessary to develop the Special Forces and the Rangers and to maintain their
operational capability. This involves means of insertion (amphibious, diving and
parachuting equipment, systems for land mobility), specific armament, optics, C4
(Command, Control, Communication, Computer), and ISR.

As indicated in chapter 2, the SOF capability will also be deployed within the framework
of the core task “protection of Belgian citizens all over the world”. On the one hand, this
can involve operations that have a clear tie with the missions of the SOF capability, such
as direct actions to rescue hostages or to protect citizens in danger. On the other hand,
this capability must also remain able to carry out evacuation operations of citizens up to
the level of a SOF Task Force (a SOF Task Group together with a Ranger battalion). Our
SOCOM will be the basis for providing a Joint Forces Command when rapid response
operations, including evacuation operations, need to be carried out.

One of the companies of the Ranger battalions will be an amphibious company.
Amphibious troops are specialised in executing operations on land launched from
the water, often by means of landing craft from amphibious mother ships, called
Landing Platform Docks (LPD). This specialised amphibious company is an important

reinforcement of Defence’s current amphibious capability and directly supports the
amphibious capability that already exists within the Special Forces Group. The possibilities
to integrate the operational preparation of this amphibious company with the Netherlands
or France will be examined, since both countries have Marine battalions. The amphibious
capability of the Special Forces Group already works closely together with its Dutch
colleagues and has identical vessels. An amphibious company within the Rangers is a
necessary capability and at the same
time reinforces and widens the

and investments will have to be made in coordination with this country.


Reinforcement of the Support to Internal Security and Possible Cooperation at
National Level
Within the framework of counter-terrorism, Defence’s Special Forces are already
deployed for direct actions under supervision of the Police. Defence could reinforce the

-----

cooperation with the Police’s Special Units by organising training and the acquisition
of equipment in a more structured way together. To this end, the legal basis needs to be
adapted.

Possibilities of a European Capability Anchoring
In general, Special Operations Forces (SOF) are a strategic capability. Europe has an
important shortage of this capability, which both NATO and the EU consider to be a
priority.
Through a NATO programme Defence will work together with Denmark and the
Netherlands to set up an international SOCOM (C-SOCC) which can be deployed in
expeditionary operations.


###### Through a NATO programme Defence will work together with Denmark and the Netherlands to set up an international SOCOM (C-SOCC) which can be deployed in expeditionary operations.


Defence will also continue to provide
instructors for the International Special
Training Centre (ISTC) in Pfullendorf,
Germany which offers specialist training to
the Special Forces of NATO member states.
In this centre our instructors work together
with their American, Danish, Dutch,
German, Greek, Italian, Norwegian, and
Turkish colleagues.


Within the Benelux Defence Cooperation,
Defence already cooperates with the Dutch _Korps Commandotroepen for education,_
training, operations, acquisition of equipment, and command and control structures.
This cooperation will be intensified to achieve more synergy and thus more efficiency. The
possibility to reinforce the good cooperation with the French, German, and American
Special Forces in a structural way will also be examined.

The Benelux parachuting school in Schaffen, Belgium is one of the main realisations of
the reinforced Benelux Defence Cooperation, initiated in 2012. Common training as well
as other areas of cooperation, such as air supply, will be further developed and if possible,
expanded. The same kind of internationalisation will be pursued for the commando
training centre of Marche-les-Dames, also in Belgium.

The integrated operational preparation of a Belgian amphibious company with Dutch or
French Marines, still to be examined, indicates the will to expand in an innovative way
the European defence cooperation through capability anchoring, in accordance with the
ideas developed in chapter 3. The reinforcement of the European amphibious capability
is demanded by both the EU and NATO. This initiative would also add to the European
anchoring of our Defence through the existing amphibious partnership between the
Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and also reinforces the position of our country
within the European Amphibious Initiative (EAI) cooperation.

**IV.** **Tactical Air Transport**


Multirole transport helicopters are used for the transport of goods and personnel. They
provide the motorised troops with additional mobility. They can also make airmobile
operations of the Special Operations Forces possible, and can be used as medical
evacuation helicopters[84].

Current and Future Content
Belgian Defence has four NH90-type multirole transport helicopters, the acquisition
costs of which have already been absorbed. The investments that are planned concern
upgrades.


The A-109 helicopters will no longer be used in operations. Whether or not a limited
number of these helicopters will be maintained will depend on a study which will
examine the efficiency of keeping these helicopters as a training capability to support
the operational preparation of the multirole transport helicopters (as well as the NATO
frigate helicopters).

_84 As indicated above, the budgets of the Special Operations Aviation will be reviewed for the possibility to acquire SOF kits_
_and medical kits for the NH90 helicopters._


T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

If this is the case, the possibility will also be examined to use them in support of internal
security, within the framework of their training mission, for instance to support certain
police tasks.


_The NH90 helicopters strengthen the airmobile character of our land forces. Making use of fast roping, troops can be_
_deployed rapidly, without the helicopter having to land._

Reinforcement of the Support to Internal Security and Possible Cooperation at
National Level
An agreement[85] already exists today allowing for the use of the multirole transport
helicopters in a non-structural, specific, and temporary way to assist Civil Security
during firefighting operations. In practice, this kind of support is usually provided in
case of large wildfires for observation, transport of intervention teams, evacuation of
persons, but also for actual firefighting. As from 2016 the process to operationalise the
multirole transport helicopters as firefighting helicopters will be started, making use of a
firefighting set acquired by the Civil Security. The training costs and operating costs are
also reimbursed by the Civil Security.
In addition to its use in firefighting, this helicopter can also be used during consequence
management in case of disasters, for instance for the transport of casualties or to carry out
or coordinate rescue actions. This helicopter could also be used to carry out transport in

case of a rapid deployment of surveillance detachments or for a SOF intervention on the
national territory. The sensors of these helicopters can also be used as an ISR capability
on the national territory (combined with the military analysis capability), within a legal
framework yet to be defined and in cooperation with other national security actors.

Possibilities of a European Capability Anchoring
The common production and development of the NH90 helicopters during their entire
life span is provided through NAHEMA, the NATO Helicopter Management Agency
which is the international programme office of the NH90 core countries (Belgium,
Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands).

A common pool for spare parts for the various NH90-type helicopters of our country
and the Netherlands has already been set up.

The training on NH90 simulators will be developed as internationally as possible. At the
moment, the basic training for these helicopters is provided in cooperation with Germany.
In the longer term, Defence will examine if it is possible to join the German or alternatively
the French NH90 Training Centre. In that case Defence personnel could also be employed
in this training centre.

In the short term political guidance will be given for the development of a common
helicopter command with the Netherlands, a project that was set up in 2013 but has until
now only resulted in limited forms of cooperation (coordination of training, operations,
and procedures). However, the final aim of this project is to be a step towards a European
structure for a common operational command, following the example of the successful
EATC which focuses on transport and tanker aircraft.

**V.** **Military Construction**

Military construction contributes to the expeditionary deployment by repairing (or even
building) major road infrastructure, and by building or installing military constructions,
especially infrastructure for compounds or for personnel protection.

Furthermore, military construction is of major importance to the reconstruction phase
after the main combat actions during an armed conflict have come to an end. This
capability is essential for a quick restoration of public services such as the availability of
power, drinking water, road infrastructure, waste removal, telecommunications, and so
on. This is important in order to win and keep the support of the local population against
opponents.

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

Military construction carried out for the benefit of local communities also helps to ensure
the support of the population for the foreign and local troops that are present during the
reconstruction phase of a conflict. These troops provide security when restarting the
local political, social, and economic process that should eventually lead to a structural
solution of a conflict.


_The excavators of the military construction (engineers) can be deployed both in direct support of our troops and to_
_carry out projects for the local population that contribute indirectly to the stabilisation of the security situation in a_
_conflict zone._

Missions in support of the local population are carried out in close cooperation with the
influence capability. The latter capability is responsible for the civil-military interaction
which gives guidance to military construction actions (e.g. by prioritising).


Deployment within the framework of international crisis management in case of disasters
and international humanitarian missions is also possible.

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

Current and Future Realisations
The current elements of military construction within the multimodal engineering
battalions will be maintained. The current Field Accommodation capability, which has
a similar mission, will be integrated into the military construction. Today both units
already work closely together to build compounds for all Defence units.
The planned investments are intended to replace the major military construction
equipment, as well as to acquire semi-permanent bridging systems (logistic bridges).

Efforts will be made to maintain the current deployable infrastructure equipment until
2030.

For the execution of its missions, the military construction can count on reserve personnel
providing specific knowhow that is only required in specific cases. In addition, reservists
will also be called upon to provide fast and specific additional capability, for instance
when restarting public services or building a compound.

Reinforcement of the Support to Internal Security and Possible Cooperation at
National Level
Within the framework of internal security, the military construction can support
consequence management in case of disasters, and it can also be deployed for national
humanitarian missions (e.g. building accommodation for refugees).

An enhanced cooperation with similar capabilities of the Civil Protection (part of the
Civil Security) will be pursued.
Education and training, acquisition of equipment and its support will be integrated as
much as possible in order for the civilian and military services to become more efficient
in terms of both budget and operations. This makes it easier to use military equipment
for national missions, and for civilian equipment to be also used by the military.
The Civil Protection could also form a pool of reservists for military engagement. A
possible military engagement of their equipment could be considered.

Possibilities of a European Capability Anchoring
The military construction has the ambition to acquire future equipment together with
our strategic partner countries.

**VI.** **CBRN (Chemical-Biological-Radiological-Nuclear) Capability**

The CBRN capability provides joint support to the mobility and survival of armed forces
through the detection of CBRN agents and the decontamination of vehicles, equipment,
and personnel.

Current and Future Content
Defence will reinforce its CBRN capability, building on its current capabilities.

New CBRN reconnaissance vehicles will be acquired for the HSE teams (Hazardous Site
Evaluation) that assess sites which are suspected of being contaminated.

Equipment for forensic sampling and field identification will also be acquired as well
as equipment to maintain our home-based reach back capability (DLD[86]) for the
examination of samples taken by SIBCRA[87] teams and RDOIT[88].

Part of the mobile decontamination stations and tents will be replaced.

Specialised CBRN reconnaissance and sampling teams will be able to support the Special
Operations Forces capability.

Together with the medical capability, medical CBRN teams will also be trained to
decontaminate casualties in a CBRN environment and they will be able to provide
specialised transport.

Reinforcement of the Support to Internal Security and Possible Cooperation at
National Level
Because of the proliferation of CBRN weapons and improvised devices, military CBRN
capabilities are more likely to be deployed in case of terrorist acts on the national territory.
In light of a terrorist threat and the potential use of CBRN agents by terrorist groups,
advisers, a decontamination capability, specialised CBRN reconnaissance and CBRN
forensic sampling teams can be made available to support the Civil Protection and the
Federal Police. Moreover, the CBRN capability can also be deployed in case of disasters
(e.g. chemical disasters such as the one in Wetteren in 2013).
An enhanced cooperation with similar capabilities of the Civil Protection will be pursued.
Education and training, acquisition of equipment and support of this equipment will
be integrated as much as possible in order to enhance the efficiency of civilian and
military services both budgetarily and operationally. This makes it easier to use military
equipment for national missions and civilian equipment by the military.

The civil services could also form a pool of reserve personnel for military engagement.
A possible military engagement of their equipment could be considered. This offers
possibilities for upscaling the capabilities both for national and military engagement,
whenever necessary.


Possibilities of a European Capability Anchoring
NATO encourages its member states to pool capabilities in order to generate economies
of scale and make their support more efficient. Within this framework cooperation
between Germany and the Benelux countries in a multinational CBRN battalion is now
being developed. This battalion should make common education and training of CBRN
specialists possible.

**VII.** **Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)/Counter-Improvised Explosive**
**Devices (C-IED) Capability**

The EOD/C-IED capability provides joint support for the neutralisation of ammunition
and the dismantling of explosive devices (whether or not improvised) during the
deployment of our contingents. In addition, this capability also provides support to the
neutralisation of ammunition during operational preparation.
This capability works together with the CBRN capability for IEDs equipped with CBRN
agents.


_A Belgian EOD/C-IED team prepares the demolition of ammunition during the ISAF operation in Afghanistan._

Current and Future Content
The investments that are required for the expeditionary deployment of the EOD/C-IED
capability are closely related to those for the combat engineers and are carried out in common.
Part of the investment budgets for major equipment of the combat engineers (included
in the combined arms motorised capability) is intended to be used for the EOD/C-IED
capability. This involves the Route Clearance Packages that are necessary for clearing
and destroying improvised explosive devices during expeditionary deployment.


T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

Support to Internal Security
Nowadays, a major part of the EOD/C-IED capability is already concentrating specifically
on supporting internal security. The most important investment during the period of
the strategic vision for this capability is oriented towards internal security, namely a
dismantling facility. It will be primarily used for cleaning up the historical ammunition
pollution in Flanders Fields. Half of this investment has been financed through
interdepartmental cooperation. The removal of this historical ammunition pollution
does not tie in with the current military mission of the EOD/C-IED capability, but it
does occupy a large part of this capability’s personnel and equipment. As indicated in
chapter 2, Defence will continue to carry out this task of internal security, but it will do
so with less military personnel by using outsourcing as much as possible, which should
also allow for optimised operating costs.

In addition to its expeditionary deployment the EOD/C-IED capability will continue
to support internal security in case of threats requiring specialised military expertise,
such as the neutralisation and disposal of IEDs, for instance of terrorist origin, or the
neutralisation of more recent war ammunition.

Possibilities of a European Capability Anchoring
The Benelux defence cooperation is increasing its cooperation with regard to EOD/CIED doctrine, documentation, education, and training.

**I.** **Multirole Air Combat Capability**

Multirole combat aircraft can execute air defence, air attack, ground attack and
reconnaissance missions (as a link in the ISR chain). These combat aircraft also play
an important role in the support to the land forces by maintaining air superiority and
providing Close Air Support. They can also support maritime flotillas.

Current and Future Content
This strategic vision provides 66.5 million euros of investments to maintain the 54 F-16
combat aircraft deployable until the end of their life cycle. As from 2023, the F-16s will be
replaced with a fleet of 34 new modern combat aircraft, including a reserve for attrition.
In total, this investment represents nearly 3.6 billion euros for this capability, and already
includes a first part of the upgrades for the new aircraft.
Based on the available deployable combat aircraft, six aircraft can be permanently
engaged in expeditionary tasks and two aircraft in air defence missions within the NATO
framework (QRA). This level of ambition is based on a binational distribution of the
QRA role between Belgium and the
Netherlands. Within the QRA role,

interception[89].

As from the introduction of the
new combat aircraft, an adapted support will be needed regarding mission preparations
and debriefings, armament and self-protection parameters, flight simulators and digital
cartography. This support will be networked as much as possible at a multinational level.

Support to Internal Security
At national level, in addition to other forms of air policing, multirole combat aircraft also
carry out a counter-terrorism mission (Renegade) as part of internal security, given the
fact that they are anyway always ready to execute the military NATO air defence mission
(QRA).

_89 The Control and Reporting Centre will be addressed under point e. below (“Command and Operational Support of_
_Capabilities”)._

Possibilities of a European Capability Anchoring
The efficiency and effectiveness of the future air combat capability should be reinforced
as much as possible through cooperation agreements with EU and NATO member
states. For each of the five candidates to replace the F-16, there are opportunities for
close cooperation at European level, in most of the cases even with a neighbouring
country. The acquisition of a replacement capability for the F-16, which will enable a
close cooperation for the lines of development with one or several partner nations, may
ensure an optimisation of the support of this capability.

_Typhoon followed by: the Boeing F-18 Super Hornet, the Dassault Rafale, the Lockheed-Martin F-35 and the Saab_
_JAS 39 Gripen._

The common Benelux Quick Reaction Alert and air policing are a major step towards
more European defence cooperation. This approach will indeed generate more
interdependence for the execution of a sensitive defence mission (from a sovereignty
point of view), like Renegade. As from 2017, Belgian and Dutch aircraft will ensure the
security of the Benelux airspace in turns. This Benelux QRA cooperation also has an
impact on France. There is indeed a bilateral agreement between Belgium and France on
the execution of certain QRA missions above our territory (and vice versa). Given the
fact that Dutch aircraft will also perform QRA missions above our territory as from 2017,
the Netherlands have indicated that they want to enter into a complementary agreement

with France which would give the same competences to aircraft from the three countries
concerned.

The training of combat pilots on Alphajet is currently organised
in a binational way in France. In the short term, however, our
Alphajets will progressively be removed from service. The aim is
to integrate a multinational cooperation project based on operating
costs, without buying our own aircraft. As a consequence, no
investment budget has been planned for a replacement capability
for these training aircraft.


**II.** **Air-to-Air Refuelling and Strategic (Medical)**
**Air Transport Capability**


_Since 2004, the basic training on Alphajet_
_of the Belgian and French fighter pilots_
_has been organised in common on the_
_French air base of Cazaux using aircraft_
_of both countries._


Air-to-air refuelling and strategic air transport are two distinct capabilities. The aircraft
mentioned below are able to perform both capabilities simultaneously. For that reason,
they will be considered together.

Air-to-air refuelling is necessary for the execution of long-duration missions with combat
aircraft and for the extension of their range. This capability also reduces the dependence on
the support provided by the host nation in case of expeditionary deployments. Refuelling
aircraft are also crucial for the deployment of transport aircraft on long distances and
with heavy loads.

Strategic air transport allows for the deployment of troops and loads over strategic
distances and within the desired response time. It ensures the expeditionary autonomy
of Defence by ensuring the delivery of logistic and operational support. In addition to
its engagement in core tasks, strategic air transport is a much requested capability for
humanitarian operations, often to the advantage of civil actors.

Current and Future Content
Currently, Belgian Defence does not own any air-to-air refuelling capability. To this day,
our combat aircraft fleet has never benefited from any support from national refuelling
aircraft. Our fleet has been using the existing (often American) capability within NATO.
The aim is to develop a national air-to-air refuelling capability based on a participation
in a multinational pool of refuelling aircraft on the one hand, and on the A400M on the
other.

Defence will take part in the EDA Multinational Multirole Tanker Transport (MRTT) Fleet
programme, which will be implemented through the NATO Support and Procurement
Agency. In this programme, the Netherlands, Poland, Luxembourg and maybe Norway
and Germany will be acquiring 3 to 8 Multirole Tanker Transport aircraft in an identical

configuration. These aircraft will be delivered as from 2019. Our country will eventually
assume investment and operational costs into this programme equivalent to one MRTT
aircraft. This aircraft will allow to refuel all types of combat aircraft and to efficiently and
simultaneously combine the air-to-air refuelling capability with passenger and freight
transport.


With the purchase of two kits the A400M transport aircraft will also be deployable as
refuelling aircraft. Although these kits do not provide air-to-air refuelling for all types of
combat aircraft, they will help reduce a capability gap at European level. From a national
point of view, these kits are essential to ensure a refuelling capability which will be able
to refuel our A400M transport aircraft[90].


The current strategic air transport capability of Defence is carried out by 11 C-130
transport aircraft. Over the 2019-2020 period, these aircraft will be replaced by 7 A400M
transport aircraft. Just as the current transport aircraft, the new ones are suitable for air
transport within the theatre of operations, in tactical conditions. To this end, they are
equipped with self-protection systems and are able to land on improvised runways. The

_The French A400M transport aircraft to be deployed operationally at the end of 2013 is transporting equipment and_
_personnel for an operation in Mali._

A400M is equipped in a standard way for air-to-air refuelling. Just as the C-130, it can
undertake paradrop missions. As soon as all A400M are operational, four aircraft will
be deployable at all times.
Currently, Defence is also leasing an Airbus A321 for passenger and freight transport.
The commercial leasing contract for this aircraft ends by the end of 2017. If available,
we could switch to a leased MRTT aircraft, preferably integrated into an existing pool,
before developing our own capability as mentioned above. The MRTT aircraft can also
provide passenger and freight transport on strategic distances. The MRTT can also be
equipped with a kit for the execution of strategic medical evacuation missions.


Besides the Airbus A321, the “white fleet” also includes two Falcon executive jets and
four Embraer Regional Jets (ERJ). The government, the European bodies and the King’s
Household call upon this fleet as well. Defence has historically been given this role.
Furthermore, these aircraft are at the disposal of EATC partners as well.
The operational relevance of these aircraft is limited and this capability is (partially)
available on the civil market. For this reason, a study will be carried out to determine
the military-operational needs of Defence regarding this type of aircraft and identify
the possible options (including contracting civilian means or maintaining/acquiring
our own aircraft) in order to potentially ensure this capability. Future realisation of the
needs of Defence regarding this type of aircraft might potentially also meet the needs

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

of other public services. Provided a contribution to expenses is being made and as long
as this approach does not result in extra direct or indirect costs for Defence, common
management of this capability could allow for economies of scale and might lead to winwin cost reduction for all partners, including Defence.
This study also includes a section on medical evacuation, which demonstrates the need
to provide for medical evacuation with this type of aircraft, besides the possibility to
organise those interventions with the C-130s, the A400Ms and possibly the MRTTs, as
well as through international cooperation.

Possibilities of a European Capability Anchoring
Both programmes mentioned above (the Multinational MRTT Fleet programme and
the A400M refuelling kits) represent our country’s contribution to two sections of
the EDA initiatives (partly in collaboration with NATO) to provide various solutions
to the reduction of the European capability gap regarding air refuelling, by means of
a European cooperation. These are two examples of European capability anchoring.
The MRTT European cooperation programme provides for the common and rational
organisation of the different lines of development. The A400M kits may also form the
basis for cooperation in several fields, among other things through the EATC (European
Air Transport Command, see below).
Acquiring a strategic medical evacuation kit could also be considered in collaboration
with the MRTT partner nations in order to also meet this need.

The A400M project is an excellent example of European cooperation to ensure the
European strategic autonomy, both industrially and as a solution to a European capability
gap. Belgium, all our strategic partners (except the Netherlands), Spain and Turkey have
contributed to the production and development of this aircraft. Defence will strive for a
common continued development in collaboration with those partners.
The operational preparation of the A400M at national level will also be an example of
intensive defence cooperation. This will be achieved notably within a common BelgianLuxembourg A400M unit consisting of 7 Belgian aircraft and one Luxembourg aircraft.
The integration of Luxembourg pilots has already begun based on the Belgian C-130s.
As several countries will own the A400M aircraft, the operating of the aircraft will be
optimised within the EATC, while we will keep our own autonomy for managing national
operations. From its Eindhoven headquarters, the EATC ensures the daily management
of a varied pool of transport and refuelling aircraft. The aim is to extend the tasks of the
EATC to different lines of development of the A400M (logistics, maintenance, training).
This way, we should be able to implement a strengthened cooperation for this aircraft
with our strategic partners and at European level. This common command and the use of
identical aircraft provide for an important opportunity to reinforce the European defence
cooperation.

At the moment, Belgian C-130 pilots follow a part of their training programme in a
binational school in France. The aim is to keep the pilots’ training within the framework
of an international partnership, also after the introduction of the A400M.

_The first Luxembourg transport pilot receives his wings in June 2014. Until the commissioning of the Belgian-_
_Luxembourg fleet of A400M transport aircraft, Luxembourg transport pilots will be flying the Belgian C-130_

**III.** **Command and Surveillance Aircraft**

Command and surveillance aircraft[91] are equipped with sensors and command means
which are necessary for conducting coordinated air operations. Together with refuelling
assets, these aircraft form the strategic support capabilities necessary for an effective
engagement of multirole combat aircraft in large operations which require constant
coordination with other countries’ means. These aircraft are also important for the
monitoring of troop movement in an engagement zone or at the borders of Europe,
beyond the coverage of terrestrial radars and sensors.


Current and Future Content
Since its implementation in 1978, Belgium takes part in the NATO Airborne Early Warning
and Control Programme, currently counting on a fleet of 16 E-3A AWACS aircraft. In the
past, it was decided to take part in the further development of those aircraft. From 2019
to 2025, Belgium will contribute to the modernisation of these aircraft for a total amount

of 33.5 million euros through the “Investments in international contributions” budgetary
line. This programme will ensure that the aircraft remain operationally deployable and
maintain their operational relevance until 2035.
Defence provides personnel for the NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen in Germany from
where the AWACS operate.


Possibilities of a European Capability Anchoring
Currently, the AWACS fleet is the only truly common NATO capability (besides the NATO
Command & Control structure). Participation in this AWACS fleet therefore represents
more than a pure military capability. It shows the determination of NATO countries to
acquire together the necessary capabilities for the implementation of a credible collective
defence.


**IV.** **Air Information Hub (LInK)**

The good coordination between Defence and other national security actors within
the Maritime Information Hub in Zeebrugge will also be implemented for the Air
dimension: an Air Information Hub (LInK (Lucht Informatie Kruispunt)) will be

established within the Control and Reporting Centre. This LInK is an interdepartmental
civil-military structure that will generate an integrated air picture at national level,
primarily in collaboration with the Federal Police, Customs, Justice, Asylum and
Migration, and environmental authorities, in order to combat illegal activities. It
could also play a useful role for the fire services, the Government Crisis Centre and
the Maritime Information Hub in the context of emergency and rescue operations.
The LInK will also be able to coordinate the emergency services in the event of an aviation
accident within the national territory.

**I.** **The Surface Combatant Capability (Frigate Helicopters Included)**

The surface combatant capability is provided by military vessels from the frigate level
on[93]. A frigate is the smallest platform equipped with sensors and weapons capable
of protecting other vessels, both merchant and military (such as amphibious vessels
and aircraft carriers). Frigates are also equipped with self-protection means, namely
sensors and weapon systems, in order to safely carry out their mission under combined
submarine-, surface-, cyber- and aerial threats.
Frigate helicopters, tactical drones and small manned vessels are part of the surface
combatant capability. Frigate helicopters and drones can significantly contribute to the
maritime common operational picture and the collection of tactical intelligence. The
helicopters are also forward deployable means for combatting submarines and surface
targets. The small vessels are needed for the boarding[94] team on board the frigate.


Current and Future Content
Our navy’s current multipurpose frigates both were originally developed during the
Cold war to contribute in the fight against submarine threats. However, some of the
submarine sensors and the embarked Lynx helicopter (sensor and weapon carrier) were
not included in the acquisition of the frigates from the Netherlands in 2005. On the
other hand, the deployment capability against asymmetrical threats and the capability
for maritime security operations (such as counter-piracy) were reinforced by means of
additional sensors. Today, NATO is
asking once more for a reinforced

multipurpose frigates as from 2025.
(However, some investments will
already be made for studies from 2017 onwards.) This replacement will take place
together with the Netherlands. The frigates will have a reinforced anti-submarine
capability thanks to intermediate- and long-range sonars, torpedoes and a maritime
helicopter (the existing NH90 NATO Frigate Helicopter (NFH), but fully equipped),
which can be engaged in anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare. They will also have a
more important surveillance capability by means of integrated tactical drones.

_93 Destroyers and cruisers can also provide a surface combatant capability. However, considering their more important investment_

_Concept representation of the future Belgian and Dutch multipurpose frigates. The aim is to procure identical ships in_
_order to maintain the current close cooperation for support of these ships._

Our frigates will, if desired, be deployable in a ballistic missile defence-system[95], as
they will be able to launch missiles capable of engaging ballistic missiles outside the
atmosphere. This will have to be done in cooperation with long-range detection radar
systems, for example on board air defence frigates. This BMD role can be supported
through international contributions to the specialised NATO structures for this capability
(the BMD coordination cell at the SHAPE in Casteau or the BMD Operations Centre
(BMDOC) within the Air Component Commander (ACC) in Ramstein).


In the short term, the capability of the current frigates will be reinforced by integrating
tactical drones and frigate helicopters. The helicopter capability will then be integrated
on board according to the operational preparation and the operational deployment of
the new frigates.
Two tactical drones will be used as a supporting surveillance capability to improve
the maritime common operational picture, surveillance and the collection of tactical
intelligence.

The current Alouette III type board helicopters will be decommissioned by 2020 at the
latest. The arrival of the NFH is a significant upgrade of the frigate’s possibilities. The
Alouette III does not have any sensors, while the NFH can be used as an advanced sensor

threat. The NATO Frigate Helicopter can also be equipped with weapon systems able to
engage these very threats. Two modules comprising sensors and weapons for the frigate
helicopters will be purchased in 2023 in order to reinforce the anti-submarine capability
of the current frigates.
The four NATO frigate helicopters were supposed to replace the three current embarked
maritime helicopters (Alouette III), and take over the search and rescue mission (SAR)
in the context of internal security. SAR-helicopters are deployed for medical support
and evacuations, mainly in national waters; however they can provide assistance on the
entire territory. Until recently, SAR was
carried out by five Sea King helicopters.

Chapter 2 mentions a study conducted by Defence on the future of the search and
rescue mission by means of helicopters. This study will determine whether the residual
capability of the frigate helicopters enables them to carry out possible future SAR
missions as well. The SAR study will also give an overview of other ways to carry out
this SAR mission, as a Defence capability, without Defence having to invest in SAR
helicopters and for which the aspect of cost reduction is a key element. This study has
to take into account possible opportunities to achieve this capability, together with our
strategic partner countries.

cycle cost.

The possibility of cooperating with other Defence forces for this capability is under
constant investigation.
There could also be more cooperation with other European countries by using identical
sub-systems, or for lines of development (such as doctrine or training), without using
identical systems. Belgium maintains privileged relationships with the French and
British navies, whereas the Netherlands has privileged relationships with the British and
German navies.

A close cooperation already exists between Belgium and the Netherlands on the NFH.
A common pool on spare parts has already been launched with the Netherlands. The
operational preparation of our frigate helicopters is achieved in close cooperation with
the Netherlands. Belgian Defence personnel are already present in the Netherlands for
logistic support, education and training. Belgium and the Netherlands will act as one
entity towards the industry and align their configuration management as far as these
helicopters are concerned. After purchasing specific kits for anti-submarine and antisurface warfare, there is further scope for deepening the cooperation.

In the short term, the necessary guidance will be given for the possible development of a
common Benelux helicopter command, as a stepping stone for a European cooperation
project.

The NFH is also used by France, and will be used later on by Germany, which allows for
an increase of the cooperation with our strategic partner countries.

The common production and lifetime development of the NH90 helicopters are organised
via the NATO Helicopter Management Agency (NAHEMA), being the international
programme office for the NH90 core countries (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy
and Belgium).

The basic training course for Belgian helicopter pilots is currently provided at a binational
school in France. It is being studied how the training of our helicopter pilots can be
continued in the future within a multinational setting.

With regard to the acquisition of tactical drones, it would be ideal to purchase one single
type of drone within the Admiral Benelux fleet to guarantee a joint support, or within the
context of a broader cooperation with Germany and/or France, where similar projects
already exist.

**II.** **The Mine Countermeasures Capability**

The new generation of mine countermeasures vessels are specialised ships for demining
missions (including EOD/C-IED) at sea. The so-called “mother ship” keeps a safe
distance from the mine threat and deploys a series of unmanned submarine, surface
and flying devices, called the “MCM-toolbox”. These unmanned devices are used to
detect, classify, identify and neutralise explosive devices. EOD/C-IED clearance divers
can also be deployed. Unlike their predecessors, these vessels will be provided with
the necessary self-defence capability in order to face an asymmetrical threat, with an
improved endurance and a maritime command capability for mine countermeasures
operations.
In addition to being operated from mine countermeasures vessels, some systems also
need to be operable from land, in confined and shallow waters (CSW), such as ports and
locks for instance.

Current and Future Content
Our maritime mine countermeasures capability currently consists of:

§ six tripartite class mine hunters (CMT) (one of which being a spare);§
§ the command and logistical support ship Godetia – supporting the mine hunters;§
§ systems for clearing very shallow waters (VSW).§

The tripartite mine hunters will reach the end of their lifespan by 2025. Compared
with more recent platforms, and considering the technological evolution, current
mine hunters are limited in terms of transit speed, duration of mine countermeasures
operations, space required for a staff capability and self-protection means.
The Godetia that was built in 1965, is now 51 years old, which is well beyond its envisaged
service life of 30 years.

The new mine countermeasures platforms will be larger in order to meet the need for
more autonomy, better self-protection and the use of unmanned modules. Thanks to
their modularity, these vessels will also be deployable in a more multifunctional way
for, among other things, maritime security operations. The larger size and the more
important embarkation capability make it possible to take other capabilities on board,
such as boarding teams or SOF, which represents an asset for other maritime operations
in a (semi) permissive environment, including humanitarian missions. These vessels will
also be used to educate and train personnel, including that of other navies (capability
building missions).


In addition to the existing mine countermeasures vessels, the Belgian navy also developed a
complementary mine-clearance capability for ports and shallow waters. These operations
involve specific small unmanned vehicles (very shallow water modules), steered by
an operator from the quayside or from a ship. This capability will be maintained and
modernised.

_A REMUS Unmanned Underwater Vehicle can be deployed for demining ports and shallow waters, both nationally_
_and during expeditionary operations._

Reinforcing Support to Internal Security and Possible Cooperation at National
Level
In the context of internal security, this capability (vessels, divers, as well as land-based
teams (mine countermeasures modules for harbours and shallow waters)) is essential for
the removal of submarine explosive devices. It may be a matter of historical ammunition,
or IED from a criminal or terrorist origin.

Possibilities of a European Capability Anchoring
The new mine countermeasures vessels will be jointly developed, purchased and
supported with the Dutch Defence. Our Defence maintains its role as leading party for
the mine countermeasures vessels within the Dutch-Belgian naval cooperation. As such,
our Defence remains responsible for the material management. This requires an accurate
sizing of personnel for training, education and material management. Like for the frigates,
the operational command of the mine countermeasures vessels will be binational. Our
Defence will remain in charge of the maintenance of all mine countermeasures vessels of
the Admiral Benelux fleet.

The building programme for new Belgian and Dutch mine countermeasures vessels will
be carried out on a binational basis at the least. However, this programme also has a
European dimension as its implementation also takes place within the framework of
an international programme, coordinated by the EDA. In October 2014, six member
states of the EDA (Germany, Belgium, Estonia, Norway, the Netherlands, and Sweden)
initiated a research project on the future of maritime mine countermeasures capabilities.
These countries, together with Spain, Finland, France, Italy, Poland and Portugal also take
part in the EDA ‘unmanned maritime systems programme’. The programme in question
wants to provide maritime mine countermeasures technology between 2015 and 2019,
which will also be usable for our new vessels. These unmanned vehicles are considered
as an essential element both by the EDA and the countries participating in this project.
Developing these devices is regarded as a European capability priority by EDA. These
cooperative relationships through
the EDA can provide a basis **Together with the**

**III.** **The Coastal Patrol Capability (Including the Maritime Information**
**Hub)**

This capability is carried out by coastal patrol vessels (CPV). Coastal patrol vessels are
engaged in military operations in waters under the Nation’s responsibility. The issue
at stake is to ensure Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA), to guide and accompany
foreign military vessels, and to make a wide range of specific military security-related
interventions, such as the surveillance and protection of critical facilities.
These vessels are primarily designed and equipped to patrol independently in coastal
areas. They feature appropriate seaworthiness and endurance, a small crew and a limited
amount of sensors and weapons. These vessels cannot be deployed as a maritime combat
capability due to their specific tasks and the corresponding equipment.

Current and Future Content
The coastal patrol capability is carried out by the two recently purchased coastal patrol
vessels, directed and supported by a command capability for operations in our national
waters. These coastal patrol vessels can be deployed very rapidly, and one vessel is
permanently available.


Support of Internal Security
Chapter 2 already mentioned that this capability plays an important support role in the
context of internal security for fishery control, the struggle against trafficking (drugs,
human trafficking, weapons), the conservation of the environment and support in case
of disasters and incidents. Therefore, personnel belonging to Customs and the Maritime
and River Police are integrated in the navy command capability for operations in national
waters. Together, they form the Maritime Information Hub. Each of the three bodies has
its own tasks and databases containing information on the entire Belgian coastal area.
They join their forces within the Maritime Information Hub to gather, analyse and share
information.
Interdepartmental cooperation within the Maritime Information Hub might also
prove beneficial for fire services, the government’s crisis centre and the LInK in case of
emergency and relief operations.

Possibilities of a European Capability Anchoring
With a limited investment, mainly in hardware and software, the Maritime Information
Hub can comply with the NATO and EU maritime surveillance standards. The Maritime
Information Hub of Zeebrugge is already integrated in the MARSUR network (maritime
surveillance), a prime example of European defence cooperation. MARSUR (maritime
surveillance) is an EDA project launched in 2006 and operational since 2014 in 18 EDA
Member States, including Belgium but also countries such as the Netherlands, France,
Germany and the United Kingdom. MARSUR is a network that enables European navies
to automatically exchange information (such as vessels positions, headings, identification
data, and pictures). This gives us a common picture of the situation in European seas and
information on maritime GVDB operations. MARSUR is also a precursor of a broader
civil-military project of the European Commission that will provide a common maritime
information exchange structure for all maritime security stakeholders of the EU member
states and the member states of the European Economic Area (EEA).
There is a structural cooperation with the Dutch and the British counterparts for the
Maritime Information Hub since 2013 and with France since 2015. As the German
Maritime Security Centre also wishes to join this cooperation structure, a de facto
multilateral maritime security centre consultation among these 5 countries is created

for the North Sea region. Through structured consultation tangible agreements can be
achieved on further cooperation and data sharing.

**IV.** **Logistic Operational Support and Strategic Maritime Transportation**
**via a Possible Participation in the Dutch Joint Logistic Support Ship**

Vessels with a logistic support capability such as the Godetia and the Joint Logistic Support
Ship Zr. Ms. Karel Doorman are important to increase the sustainability of maritime
task forces in the area of operations. Logistic support ships may be unable to provide
as much fuel as refuelling vessels, but they supply other forms of logistic support such
as specialised maintenance, a broader medical support capability and the provision of
spare parts, ammunition and food. The reason of existence of logistic support ships and
supply vessels is to make sure that other vessels do not have to interrupt their operational
activities to resupply in a port.

Current and Future Content Through European Capability Anchoring
Today, our country has a limited logistic support capability via the command and
logistic support ship Godetia. This ship can provide specific support to a fleet of mine
countermeasures vessels. In the new concept for the future mine countermeasures
vessels, this support does no longer have to be provided by a specific vessel.
For the multipurpose frigates (Surface Combatant capability), our country is counting
on the support of tankers and logistic vessels of partner countries during exercises
and operational deployment.
NATO and the EU (EDA) both stress the importance of reinforcing the maritime
logistic support capability in order to strengthen the autonomous deployment
possibilities.

In the future, Defence wants to contribute to the European maritime logistic support
capability by participating in the existing capability within the Admiral Benelux fleet.
The possibility for our navy to supply personnel, operating means and/or a helicopter
at short notice for the JSS will therefore be assessed. Belgian participation in the
JSS depends on Dutch authorisation, but the Netherlands is seeking international
cooperation to make this vessel fully operational.
The JSS offers other facilities as well, such as a limited amphibious support
capability, in order to be able to operate independently of port facilities. A possible
Belgian participation in the JSS would also mean that our Defence would receive, in
agreement with its partner, an additional possibility of strategic transport of large
volumes, for seabasing operations (the logistical support of troops from the sea),
access to a helicopter sea base, and an additional option for humanitarian operations
with the deployment of the JSS as a hospital ship.

_countries to fully operationalise the ship. Germany has already confirmed its participation and other European_
_countries, including Belgium, also want to contribute to this maritime strategic enabler._

**V.** **Harbour Protection**


The harbour protection capability can protect vessels and critical port facilities. This
capability includes an aquatic part to protect a port or vessels against a sea-based threat,
with sensors (such as sonars), command and control systems, barriers and the personnel
required to operate them. There is also a land-based part to protect a perimeter, composed
of personnel and means, serving amongst others for the Force Protection, EOD/C-IED
and engineering works.


Current and Future Content
NATO is asking our country (via the NATO Defence Planning) for specific expeditionary
modules for harbour protection. These modules constitute one of the alliance’s capability
gaps. This shortfall is also identified within the EU.
This constitutes a new capability with respect to the aquatic part of the harbour protection
capability. Defence will develop this aquatic part, in order to be able to deploy it on a
permanent basis. The level of ambition does not include any land-based contribution.
This contribution will preferably be made by an international partner, but our own troops
could provide this harbour protection capability as well.w

**I.** **Defence Staff**

The Defence staff steers Defence’s capabilities and processes. It encompasses the staff
structures from the Chief of Defence level down to and including the components’ staff
level and their direct support.


_Different parts of the Defence staff are directly involved with the operational deployment. For example, the operations_
_centre of Evere ensures the command and the coordination of the support of our operationally deployed troops._

Greater focus on the staff structures directly connected to the operational deployment
should result in flattening the structure. The new Defence staff will make up about 10% of
the personnel of the future Defence (2,545 FTE), which is a reduction of 30% compared
to the 3,700 positions
planned today. The scale of

first place on the number of capabilities a Defence has and only in the second place on the
respective size of these capabilities.

The structure of the new Defence staff is one of the implementation projects of the
strategic vision.


Although the positions in the Defence staff are not operational deployable positions,
Defence staff personnel can be sent to foreign operations as reinforcement, often in
international command structures.


**II.** **Competence Development**

As indicated in the next chapter, Defence is strongly committed to making its competence
development more efficient. The number of FTE in the competence centres providing
specialised professional training strongly decrease, as well as those in the general
education institutions responsible for the education of staff personnel and the general
military education of our officers, NCOs, and volunteers. In total 2,698 FTE will still
be employed in education (and training) within Defence. Besides, part of the posts in
international organisations (both inside and outside of the components) is also connected

_Considering its specific equipment, Defence will continue to ensure specialised_
_courses in the future as well._

to this aspect of support. The amount of resources for competence management is linked
to the multitude of professions within Defence and the necessity to provide servicemen
with a specifically military basic training, and a constant maintenance and improvement
afterwards.

In 2030 the personnel of the general training institutions for officers, NCOs, and
volunteers will represent about half of the FTEs in the field of competence development.
These personnel are in charge of the education of the students of Defence, and support the
functioning of the general education institutions (administration, running of Territorial
Support Service, sports).
The academic staff of the education centre for staff personnel (the modernised Royal
Military Academy) also carries out scientific research for Defence in collaboration with
the specific research staff of this centre. Together with the Defence laboratories (see
below) the scientific research within this education centre constitutes the main capability
for scientific research within Defence, and is thus an important part of Defence’s R&T
policy (see chapter 6).

Furthermore, about 1,150 FTE of students are planned in the general training institutions
in 2030[96]. This does not include Defence personnel attending additional education in the
organisation within the framework of social promotion (see chapter 7) and continuing
education.

Specialised military training is to a growing extent provided within international
forms of cooperation. This can be organised on the basis of binational agreements
such as the common pilot training with France for combat aircraft, transport aircraft
and helicopters, and the binational navy schools and parachuting training with the
Netherlands. Moreover, international training within a NATO framework, the NATO
Centres of Excellence, has grown in importance. Defence contributes to these centres
with instructors and through the NATO Naval Mine Warfare Centre of Excellence
which has its seat in our country.
A significant part of the personnel employed within competence development also
contributes directly to operations. For instance, the competence centre for airborne
operations (the Benelux parachuting school) provides specialised personnel and resources
for operational parachuting of personnel and equipment of the Special Operations Forces
capability. This competence centre has a platoon of Pathfinders for the reconnaissance

_96 These 1,150 FTE are based on the education and training concepts mentioned below (see chapter 6). As for the academic_
_education of officers the number of 1,150 FTE takes into account an annual recruitment of 120 students with an expected_
_attrition of 50% at the end of the education. This results in a total of 380 FTE of students. In addition to these students_
_every year about 20 officers start an education at other academic institutions (industrial engineer and medicine). Taking into_
_account the duration of the education and a lower attrition a FTE of 75 students is planned. Officers recruited on the basis of_
_a master’s or bachelor’s degree in order to meet certain specific recruitment needs of Defence receive an education and training_
_of only one year. After attrition a FTE of 85 students is taken into account, resulting in a total of 540 students for the officers._
_As for NCOs an annual recruitment of 600 students is taken into account. An average training of 1 year for_
_non-technicians and 2 years for technicians and an average attrition of 32% results in a FTE of 410 students._
_The model used also allows for an annual recruitment of 1,250 volunteers. Their training lasts 10 weeks, i.e. 5 sessions each_
_year with on average 250 students. Taking into account an attrition of 20% the number is estimated at an average of 200 FTE._

of landing zones for airdrops, a platoon of Dispatchers who are in charge of parachuting
personnel, and an air supply platoon in charge of parachuting and transport by helicopter
of equipment. The commando training centre provides experts in rock climbing to
reinforce units. The instructors of the various competence centres can and are employed in
operations centres during international operational deployment. All competence centres
can also provide training capability for operations abroad.

**III.** **Medical Support**

Medical support is an essential form of combat service support that needs to be
adjusted to the level of ambition of the various capability dimensions. It is organised in
accordance with the planned operational deployment for the three core tasks. However,
proper coordination with national (medical) security actors and national health services
has to be pursued permanently in order to optimise the supporting role of the military
medical elements within internal security and
to guarantee maximum access to national

organised: an operational pillar, operational preparation and support. In addition to the
personnel of the operational pillar, a part of the personnel for operational preparation
and support can also be deployed in operations. In the table “command and operational

well as the 96 FTE manning the Competence Centre Medical are included in the total
numbers of the Defence staff and as a part of competence development respectively.

The operational Pillar
The operational pillar consists of all medical capabilities that contribute directly to the
operational deployment of the capabilities of the four dimensions. They are organised in
accordance with the NATO provisions on this matter that are intended to allow for treating
casualties as soon and as continuously as possible depending on the severity of their
injuries. Recent NATO operations have made the timings in NATO’s medical doctrine
stricter and thus emphasised the importance of a rapid operational medical capability. As
a result, forward[100] and tactical[101] air assets for medical transport (helicopters and STOL
aircraft) are gaining importance in this doctrine but they represent a capability gap at the
European level. The military medical capability is in general not sufficiently available within
NATO and the EU. Besides maintaining sufficient medical capability to be able to provide
autonomous national medical support to our troops it is important that our Defence can
quantitatively contribute sufficient medical
capability to the capability objectives of

###### The military medical

###### capability is in general not of multilateral burden sharing. Therefore, the sufficiently available within NATO level of our medical capability needs to be in and the EU. accordance with Defence’s general level of

ambition for the four capability dimensions.
In the continuous healthcare chain, the
military medical capability does not provide the lowest level of medical care itself.
But it is responsible for the training and operational preparation of each individual
serviceman and for those who receive additional medical training outside of the
medical capability. Every serviceman should at least be able to carry out basic medical
procedures in order to save lives and avoid irreparable damage before more specialised
medical support can take over. In NATO terminology, the non-specialised basic level
of medical care is called Role 0.
The basic level of the specialised medical capability (thus within the operational pillar
of our medical support) are the Role 1[102] medical facilities that stabilise casualties in
operations so that they can be evacuated. The Role 1 elements also provide medical
treatment in a compound during operations, comparable to the care provided by a
general practitioner and a nurse (primary healthcare). The Role 1 facilities are very close
to the expeditionary capabilities and should be regarded as an essential combat service
support element which should be integrated as much as possible into the combined arms
operational preparation and training. Therefore, Role 1 medical facilities and deployable
operational units should as much as possible be set up at the same place. Operational
preparation and support of these Role 1 medical facilities shall continue to be run
centrally, for maximum efficiency.

_100 Forward air assets carry out the transport of casualties between the site where the injuries were sustained and a Role 1 medical_
_facility._
_101 Tactical air assets carry out the transport of casualties between different medical facilities in the theatre of operations._
_102 A “Role 1” medical treatment facility is defined by NATO as a medical response capability which is a national responsibility_
_and which provides primary health care, specialised first aid, triage, resuscitation and stabilisation (NATO Standard AJP-4.10_

According to the current NATO doctrine, life-saving surgical procedures are only
performed at a higher level of medical operational support, i.e. the Role 2 medical
capability. However, in recent years operational deployment has shown that a limited
surgical capability in the first line of the specialised medical support is necessary to
increase the possibilities of saving lives and avoiding permanent injuries. Our Defence
wants to play a pioneering role in integrating this capability into the military medical
doctrine. Therefore, Forward Surgical Teams (FST) are to be included in the Role 1 of
our military medical capability. In general, a specific trauma-related surgical capability
constitutes a capability gap in the medical capability of most European NATO countries.
The investments planned in medical vehicles of the same type as those of the land forces (a
light version of the common international motorised platform and LTTV) are connected
with this basic level of operational medical support. These vehicles are deployed as ground
evacuation assets. Forward and tactical air assets (helicopters and STOL aircraft) can also
be deployed at this level or to provide the link to a higher level of operational medical
support. At the moment, Belgian Defence does not have a sufficient capability in forward
and tactical medical air evacuation (with helicopters or specialised tactical aircraft). The
budget for SOF Aviation will be reviewed for the possibility to also acquire medical kits
for STOL aircraft and/or NH90 helicopters, in order to offer a solution for this national
capability gap. A Belgian contribution to this specific medical evacuation capability is also
important since this is a European capability gap and it enhances Defence’s possibilities
to support internal security. However, the primary mission of these helicopters and

STOL aircraft will still be the direct support of the combined arms motorised and Special
Operations Forces capabilities.


In addition to Role 1, a national Role 2[103] capability is indispensable to provide sufficient
autonomous operational support and make a sufficient contribution to the multilateral
capability burden sharing regarding NATO and EU medical capabilities. Role 2 medical
elements are field hospitals where casualties can receive more specialised care including a
full surgical capability with support and follow-up services. A Role 2 element has a basic
structure (Role 2 basic) which, depending on the length and/or nature of an operation,
can be expanded with more specialised modules (Role 2 Enhanced), such as a more
extensive surgical capability, an intensive care module or a ward.

_The Belgian field hospital (Role 2) in Lebanon that provided medical support to the Belgian and UN troops from 2006_
_until 2009 at the beginning of the strengthened UN mission UNIFIL._


_103 A “Role 2” medical treatment facility is defined by NATO as an “initial surgical response capability” characterised by its ability_
_to perform surgical interventions in addition to performing reception and triage of casualties, resuscitation and treatment of_
_a shock. This treatment facility follows the Role 1 capability in which casualties are treated in first instance by a specialised_
_emergency medicine team. A Role 2 facility ensures in its basic constellation (Role 2 Basic) the surgical capacity, including_
_damage control surgery and surgical procedures for war traumas, to perform life and limb saving medical treatments. This way_
_the patient can be transported within the specified time limit to the next hospital formation that has more extensive means._
_This Role 2 facility can be expanded by additional specialised medical modules to a Role 2 Enhanced which has all medical-_
_technical modules to perform damage control surgery and damage control resuscitation making it possible to stabilise and_
_prepare casualties for strategic (air) evacuation (NATO Standard AJP-4.10 Allied Joint Doctrine for Medical Support, NATO,_
_May 2015)._

The RDOIT (Rapid Deployment Outbreak Investigation Team) of the CBRN capability
will be able to support the Role 2 in order to reinforce the medical CBRN capability
which is also a capability gap in the European NATO countries.
The medical equipment and specialised medical-technical personnel of a Role 2 are
employed in the centralised operational preparation structure of the medical capability
(see below) when they are not deployed.

The current Belgian medical facilities of Role 1 and 2 levels will soon reach the end
of their lifespan and need to be replaced as soon as the budget allows. To this end, an
investment budget of 10 million euros will be provided in 2021 (in the budgetary line for
investments in major equipment).


Our Defence will also continue to contribute to strategic medical evacuation (with air
assets) which in the process of medical support usually follows a treatment in a Role 2
or Role 3 facility. Strategic medical evacuation can be provided using existing patient
transport systems that can be installed in the current C-130 transport aircraft and in the
future A400M transport aircraft and potentially through an international cooperation
programme for a strategic medical evacuation kit for the MRTT pool.

_During the presence of the Belgian F-16s in Kandahar from 2008 until 2014, Defence also contributed with_
_medical personnel to the international Role 3 field hospital that was located at the same compound._


Only on an ad hoc basis will Belgian Defence be able to contribute to an international
Role 3[104] capability with specialised medical personnel (such as in Afghanistan in the

past years) and modules of the Role 2 capability. No specific investments are planned for
a Belgian Role 3 capability. Only the big European Defences (Germany, France, and the
United Kingdom) have a national Role 3 capability.

The current Belgian military hospital has evolved from a real Role 4[105] medical facility
of the Cold War era (a hospital comparable to a general hospital, but for the military) to
an institution focussing on the operational preparation of and the provision of services
to operationally deployable military medical capabilities (see below). Among the
European NATO countries only France and Germany still have real military hospitals
(Role 4 medical capability) but they are also moving towards a specialisation of their
hospital capability to military specialised areas and as an operational preparation
and support capability for their other expeditionary deployable medical elements
(Role 1/2/3). Today our military hospital only performs a limited range of military
specialised curative care[106], and its services (mobile emergency units, ambulance, burns
centre, orthopaedic surgery) ensure the specifically military operational preparation
and training for a Role 2. This Role 2 requires medical-technical personnel capable
of treating complex injuries while working as a team in a less specialised and less
comfortable environment than civilian hospitals, using specific medical equipment
and applying specific procedures. The curative care given by the Military Hospital also
allows taking care of patients with specific military injuries before their treatment is
continued in a civilian hospital. Specific military mental health care is also necessary to
lend proper support to the operational deployment, and will continue to be provided.

The total number of FTE for the operational pillar[107] will evolve to 1,094 FTE[108] or 62% of
the total medical capability. This number takes into account the level of ambition of the
different capabilities in the four operational dimensions mentioned above. 1, 2 or 3 sets
of personnel and means are provided depending on capability and level of ambition. Five
sets are even planned for the strategic air evacuation.

The Operational Preparation Pillar
This pillar takes care of the operational preparation of the medical capabilities as well as
the support to the operational preparation of the other components. It is calculated at 569
FTE (including the 96 FTE of the Medical Competence Centre) in the future.
The operational preparation pillar is responsible for verifying whether new recruits have
an appropriate medical profile to work for Defence (selection) and for making sure that
servicemen are medically fit to be deployed (evaluation and expertise).
Furthermore, this pillar provides the curative care within Defence as described above. The
primary curative military care has already been outsourced to a large extent through the system of
certified medical practitioners (civilian general practitioners, dentists, physiotherapists, …).
The operational preparation pillar of the medical support also includes medical-technical support
such as radiology and laboratory analyses.
The Competence Centre Medical provides the military specific training to the personnel
of the medical capability and support to medical training of the other capability
dimensions (Role 0). Medical-technical education (for among others doctors, nurses,
psychologists), both academic and continuing education, is provided in civilian institutes
or interdepartmentally[109].
A last element of the medical operational preparation pillar is responsible for the training
of medical elements, within the medical capability itself as well as for the combined
operational preparation with the capabilities of the other dimensions. The medical training
capability consists of the ambulance services, mobile emergency units (including the
CBRN capability), the burns centre (including outpatient clinic), the operating wing and
the hospital capability for orthopaedic surgery of the Military Hospital. The disciplines
of the medical training capability are in accordance with the military specific operational
preparation for the Role 2. Medical-technical personnel of the Role 2 capability who are
not deployed participate in carrying out the services provided by the training capability.
Today the different elements of the medical operational preparation pillar are centralised
in the Military Hospital (with some decentralisation for curative care in the large quarters).
The necessity to maintain a centralised military operational preparation structure in the
future has been examined. Considering the fact that the military medical capability is

_107 As indicated above, the curative care provided in the military hospital and included in the operational preparation pillar also_
_plays a role in the operational pillar. However, the total of 1,094 FTE does not include any FTE of the military hospital._

focussed on operational deployment, it is advisable to maintain a largely centralised and
mainly military operational preparation structure.
A centralised and military operational preparation structure ensures a rapid availability
of the military medical personnel working there and being operationally prepared within
it. It also ensures that these personnel are sufficiently trained in the use of the equipment
that will be used in operations and in accordance with the military medical procedures.
Both the equipment and the procedures differ from those used in civilian health services.
At the same time however, a close link should always remain between the medical
central operational preparation capability and the national health services in order for
our military medical-technical specialists to receive sufficient training and education
for their operational deployment.

###### A centralised and military operational preparation structure ensures a rapid availability of the military medical personnel working there and being operationally prepared within it. It also ensures that these personnel are sufficiently trained in the use of the equipment that will be used in operations and in accordance with the military medical procedures.

A thorough evaluation has shown that a new vision on the activities within the Military
Hospital through rationalisation and more interdepartmental and civil-military
cooperation is to be preferred, in order to maintain an operational preparation structure
for the military medical support. Besides rationalisation this new and more efficient role
should also reinforce the specifically military character of the military hospital. This will
be further discussed in chapter 6.

_Hospital. The medical CBRN capability can be deployed in operations together with the CBRN capability and can_
_offer specialised support within the framework of internal security._

Support Pillar
The support pillar consists of the medical support that is part of the Defence Staff (52 FTE)
and the medical logistics (40 FTE). The medical logistics are in charge of the acquisition,

storage and distribution of medical equipment for operations and operational preparation.
As is the case for the rationalisation of storage and distribution in the Material Resources
branch described below, the logistic support of the medical support will be outsourced
as much as possible.

An Integrated Health and Well-being Policy
An adequate health and well-being policy consisting of prevention, evaluation
of the specific medical-military fitness, evaluation of work- and environmentrelated health effects, specific care and expertise is necessary to safeguard the
potential of the Defence personnel and to optimise efficiency. To address these
needs Defence develops an integrated health and well-being model through a
systematic and methodical approach. This model guarantees the cohesion of all
efforts designed to directly or indirectly improve, preserve or restore the physical
and mental health of its personnel. This model will be realised by providing
prevention, occupational medicine, psychosocial support and specific primary
and secondary care in an integrated way. The future of this policy will be part
of the analysis regarding a further improvement of efficiency of the military
medical support (see chapter 6).


###### “Defence will continue to adapt its medical-military legislation in order to respect well-being at work, and it will continue the integrated health and well-being model, taking into account all risks already experienced and all their consequences for the health of personnel, during and after their career.”  (Government agreement of 9 October 2014)


Personnel Issues
Today the main issue for the medical operational support is finding sufficient medicaltechnical personnel to man the medical capabilities. This will continue to be a challenge.
This is the case for all medical-technical personnel, such as nurses and doctors[110]. In the
last few years significant efforts have been made in order to improve this situation. At
this moment for instance, about 70 medical-technical officers are in training. Adapted
regulations will contribute to the job satisfaction of these servicemen, while Defence
can count on a higher availability and the development and maintenance of important
know-how for the armed forces.
Another way to solve this issue would be strengthening the efforts to attract more doctors
and nurses from civilian hospitals to the specialised reserve. In order to achieve this,
additional initiatives will need to be taken in order to reinforce the link between Defence
and employers (see also chapter 7) and to provide adequate military medical training to

_110 For instance, in 2015 Defence had 83 military doctors whereas it needs 230, which is an occupation rate of 36%._

-----

these reservists. The personnel regulations of the medical reserve need to allow them to
be deployed in all operational circumstances.
Furthermore, a partner hospital system will be examined in order to gain better access to
medical reservists (doctors and nurses). This system could be linked to services performed
by military personnel in civilian hospitals, within the framework of their operational
preparation for deployments, within a new regulatory framework for medical-technical
personnel.

Reinforcement of the Support to Internal Security and Possible Cooperation at
National Level
In general the military medical capability can make a valuable contribution to
the support of internal security with those capabilities that are not deployed in
operation. Because of Defence’s level of ambition, relying on permanent deployment
of certain elements, medical elements able to be deployed permanently should also
be available. This means that medical elements will always be present in Belgium
that are either preparing for operational deployment or reconditioning after
deployment.
Furthermore, as indicated above, the operational preparation pillar of the
medical capability needs to be involved with the national health services. Defence
wants to specialise further in areas that are closely connected to the operational
deployment. This is part
of the reinforcement of the

###### Defence wants to specialise further in

###### operational deployment. chapter 6, and at the same time

it can contribute to internal
security. Terrorist attacks or big disasters cause injuries that are comparable to
military injuries in operations.
Both at the federal and the regional level the military medical emergency modules
(ambulance and mobile emergency units) are already participating in the execution
of emergency plans at the national airport and some SEVESO establishments. They
also play a role in the position of “medical director” for the Brussels Capital Region
and the province of Flemish Brabant.
Within the context of internal security and national health care, the existing
interdepartmental cooperation partnerships with the Ministry of Public Health and
that of the Interior will be formalised further, in particular in the field of CBRN,
capacity for reception of victims in case of disasters, the emergency mortuary, and
care of patients suffering from highly infectious diseases. As indicated in chapter
6, this should result in further rationalisation of the military medical support and
particularly of the Military Hospital, which is also a reinforcement of internal
security.

Possibilities of a European Capability Anchoring
Today our troops in operations already use the medical structures of other NATO
and EU countries and our medical capability contributes to UN, EU, and NATO
operations. Just as for other capabilities, Belgian Defence wants to promote more
defence cooperation in the medical field as well. At Benelux level a separate steering
group on medical cooperation has been set up, and steps have been taken toward the
common organisation of education and training, and the common development of
doctrines. As far as capabilities are concerned, initiatives do exist (e.g. the creation
of common Benelux capability within the framework of air evacuation[111] and an
initiative for cooperation on blood banks) but the replacement of equipment of the
medical elements creates opportunities for greater convergence of capabilities with
our strategic partner countries. As already indicated above, this provides a basis
for more operational cooperation, but also cooperation in the field of education,
training, doctrine, logistic support...

_A Patient Transport Unit for intensive care can be easily set up in a Belgian C-130. Our Defence develops the_
_capabilities for aeromedical evacuations together with the other Benelux countries._

The medical cluster of the Framework Nations Concept (FNC) is also very active in
determining common procedures for operational medical support and the acquisition
of medical equipment.


**IV.** **Material Resources Branch**

The budgetary means for investments in major equipment will allow the renewal of
capabilities that remain relevant. In addition, new capabilities will also be developed.
These investments will thus generate an additional need for specialised logistic and
technical support.
Within the composition of the defence budget towards 2030, important new
investments in infrastructure are also planned that will need to be guided as well.
However, the goal is to strongly reduce the Material Resources branch that has been
in charge of this mission within Defence until now (albeit with significant support
from the civilian industrial world for the maintenance of weapon systems), by using
additional outsourcing. As such, it will be a major challenge for Defence to reduce
its own capability within the Material Resources branch while meeting the growing
need for this kind of support through outsourcing.

_The Competence Centre for Flying Equipment & Communication and Information Systems ensures, among other_
_things, the maintenance and the support of specific information systems of Defence._

By 2030 this branch will include several fields.
Just as today, in order for Defence to be able to carry out its missions properly, it is
essential that it is capable of carrying out the specialised maintenance of its avionics (flying
equipment) and electronic systems, the maintenance of its territorial communications
network and its operational Command, Control & Communication (C3) systems itself.
Today this is done in the Competence Centre for Flying Equipment & Communication
and Information Systems and by 2030 506 FTE will be provided for these tasks within the
“Material Resources branch”.


This branch also encompasses: the Competence Centre Infrastructure (138 FTE
planned by 2030) which manages the Defence infrastructure and properties, the
Equipment Identification Centre (60 FTE) and the Defence Staff Headquarters
Battalion (101 FTE).

-----

The other current structures of this department (the Competence Centre “Supporting
Equipment and Products” (Ypres), the Distribution Centre “Spare Parts” (Berlaar) and
the Competence Centre “Mobile Equipment & Armament” (Rocourt, Zutendaal)) will
be outsourced to a large extent. In total 445 FTE remain planned for this by 2030. Their
current tasks will be carried out together with civilian partners. These involve:

§ provision of specific clothing and equipment;§
§ acquisition, acceptance, storage, and distribution of equipment for the benefit of all §
Defence units, both at home and in operation;

§ (partial) industrial maintenance of mobile equipment§ _[112], armament, optronics and_
ammunition of Defence;

§ prototyping and production of small volumes;§
§ destruction of conventional ammunition;§
§ storage at the industrial level of land systems equipment.§

**V.** **Management of Outsourced Training Ranges**

The next chapter states that the training ranges of Belgian Defence will in the future
be managed through outsourcing. These ranges are an essential part of the national
operational preparation structure. Today the ranges are run locally with Defence
personnel, representing an equivalent of 579 decentralised FTE. In the future
this will be carried out by a private partner, while keeping 60 decentralised FTE
to manage the outsourcing (for instance planning and security responsibilities).
Besides major rationalisation of personnel this should also seriously reduce the
costs of Defence.

_112 Besides the logistic battalions that directly support the land forces through a single-level maintenance concept for operational_
_vehicles._

**VI.** **Support Air**

Various structures support both the territorial and the expeditionary deployment of the
Defence air assets.


The Meteorological Wing meets the needs of Defence with regard to meteorological
information. It has an important territorial task for the benefit of the military air assets of
Defence and those of our partner countries. The Meteorological Wing is also essential for
the preparation of an operational deployment, as it provides information needed to take
into consideration the climatic conditions in the engagement area during the planned
engagement period. Meteorological Wing detachments can be sent in operation and in
support of the operational centres. The Meteorological Wing also supports the national
civilian meteorological capability.


_During operation Guardian Falcon in Afghanistan, the Meteo Wing was responsible for the support of the operational_
_deployment of the F-16s by gathering meteorological data._

The military flight safety (Aviation Safety Directorate) mainly has a territorial task. It
issues and checks the measures taken to prevent air accidents. In case of an aviation
accident involving a Belgian military aircraft or – if requested – any aviation accident in
our airspace, this directorate is in charge of the investigation and analysis with regard to
flight safety.


T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

The Air Traffic Control Centre (ATCC) ensures the military air traffic control and is
essential for the proper coordination between military and civilian air traffic in our
national airspace, which is one of the densest in the world. As indicated above, the
Control and Reporting Centre (CRC) carries out the air combat control. The missions of
the CRC consist in monitoring the national (and in the future Benelux) and international
airspaces within the framework of the NATO collective defence. The CRC is thus part
of a chain of other NATO CRCs under the supervision of a NATO command structure.
The CRC guides the combat aircraft that carry out Quick Reaction Alert missions. At the
same time, these aircraft and the CRC also support internal security.
In order to support the expeditionary operations of Belgian Defence’s air assets an air
controller of the ATCC is always included as a liaison officer in order to ensure the
integration of our aircraft on the deployed base.
During operations the CRC air combat controllers can be integrated into an international
command structure. They can also act as liaison officer in the national Red Card Holder
Team that is deployed in the Air Operations Centre to make sure that the national
interests and the imposed restrictions (caveats) are observed.
At the moment both the ATCC and the CRC are under review to determine how their
duties can be carried out more efficiently through closer national and international
cooperation.

As indicated above, the Air Information Hub (Lucht Informatie Kruispunt - LInK) will be
integrated into the CRC.

**VII.** **Support Navy**

In the capability dimension Intelligence-Cyber-Influence as well as in the Land and Air
capability dimensions, an important part of the logistic support (including maintenance)
and the CIS support is integrated within the capability itself. This is not the case for
the vessels of the dimension Maritime mentioned above. Besides the logistic and CIS
positions on board our vessels, positions on shore are also necessary to maintain our
naval capabilities deployable and to support their operational deployment.
Within the framework of the Belgian-Dutch naval cooperation the support of both
Navies is partly carried out by a division of tasks. The logistic support of both the Dutch
and Belgian fleet of multipurpose frigates happens from the Netherlands, while our
country is responsible for the logistic support (including maintenance) of the mine
countermeasures vessels of both Navies. The Belgian service in charge of the maintenance
(mostly of the mine countermeasures vessels) is NAVLOG which counts 334 FTE today,
tending towards 240 FTE by 2030. NAVLOG has technicians who gained experience
on board of our vessels. They can also repair vessels abroad in case of operational need.
NAVLOG largely uses outsourcing for maintenance activities.
The “support Navy” also encompasses the NAVSUPPORT service that is in charge of
operational support, maritime communications, and the running of the naval base

in Zeebrugge, all of which are essential elements for the operational preparation and
operational deployment of our fleet. This service today has 281 FTE and will still have
147 FTE by 2030, including 5 FTE for maritime communications. NAVSUPPORT
supports the vessels of the naval base of Zeebrugge, so that they can carry out their
missions in the best possible circumstances. This involves several sections such as a
central administration, berthing parties, fire-fighting teams, a communications centre,
protection of the naval base, surveillance, and a maritime military information service.
All support services are centralised for all vessels.
The servicemen employed in the “support Navy” can be embarked to relieve the personnel
on board our vessels.

**VIII.** **Multiservice Kennel Unit (IKE)**

Today Defence already has a central kennel which is integrated in the Air Competence
Centre. In addition, guard dog handlers can be found across Defence’s units, in which
they are part of the guard system. The total number amounts to 258 FTE.
This number will be drastically reduced because Defence will organise the guard system
of the barracks less autonomously. In 2030 a separate Multiservice Kennel Unit IKE
(Intermachten Kennel Eenheid) is planned with 80 FTE. As such, the use of dogs remains
important for Defence. It involves Explosive Detection dogs at EOD and engineering
units, tracking dogs (patrol dogs qualified to be used for the surveillance of sensitive
facilities and patrol missions) and combat dogs for the Special Forces Group. Besides
their relevance for expeditionary operations, these dogs can also be deployed within
the framework of internal security.
Synergies with other public services that also use dogs (Police, Customs, Civil Security),
as well as with other partners, both national and international, will be pursued as much
as possible in order to organise and support the national military kennel capability as
rationally as possible.

**IX.** **Provincial Commands**

The structure of the provincial commands will be adapted but their role regarding
internal security will be maintained through a centralised territorial command,
integrated into the operational command structures. A military representative
will be maintained as liaison officer between the provincial governor and Defence.
This allows a strong rationalisation of the current planned 152 FTE to 60 FTE, and
specific infrastructure where the current provincial commands are housed can be
abandoned.

**X.** **Defence Laboratories (DLD)**

The Defence laboratories support the logistic chain of the various Defence capabilities,
for example by checking the quality of fuel and testing textiles.
They also provide the necessary scientific and technical support to the CBRN capability
since DLD is certified to analyse CBRN agents. This certification also allows the Defence
laboratories to contribute to the international struggle against CBRN weapons of mass
destruction and to be involved in the support of internal security.
The Defence laboratories also have an important role to play in the safe deployment
of our troops in expeditionary operations by controlling soil samples of sites where
detachments are supposed to be stationed.

**XI.** **Sports Centre Duisburg**

The sports centre at Duisburg (22 FTE currently planned) will not be run by Defence
anymore. A PPP construction will be set up for this sports centre, and it is being studied
how Defence could maintain access to these facilities without providing FTE or having
fixed costs. The running of a sports centre is not a Defence mission.

**XII.** **Defence Bands**

The bands (208 FTE currently planned) will be halved to 100 musicians, and will be
reassembled into one Defence band. This capability is important in order to carry on
the tradition, but it also needs to be adapted to the reality of a Defence that focuses on
operational deployment.

**XIII.** **Participation in International Organisations**

The international posts of Defence, both inside (370 FTE) and outside of the components
(280 FTE), not only provide a national voice at the international level, but also contribute
to an important extent to the control and support of the operational deployment. As
indicated above, personnel contributions to these international organisations will
be assessed continuously to determine their need for the command and support of
Defence’s operational deployment. If necessary, other priorities will be set. For the time
being, the personnel contributions for 2030 are based on the current contributions.

The international posts that are part of the intervention force (the total of the components
with the operationally deployable Defence capabilities) are discussed first below.
The Land Component (150 FTE) mainly contributes to the Eurocorps, the French Rapid
Reaction Corps Headquarters in Lille and to various NATO headquarters both at home
and abroad[113]. In the past, the multinational Eurocorps headquarters in Strasbourg has
been in command of NATO operations several times, always involving a significant
participation of Belgian servicemen. The Belgian servicemen employed in Lille and
Brunssum also participate in foreign multinational operations from these headquarters.
Furthermore, the Land Component also cooperates at the Benelux level in several areas
(parachute training, engineering, EOD, CBRN, C-IED, indirect fire support, civil-military
interaction, logistic support, ISTAR, land exercises and training, Special Forces) in which
land forces personnel are working in the command and control structure of the Dutch
armed forces, in addition to liaison positions.
Today the Air Component (83 FTE) is represented in various international staffs
and organisations for the planning and execution of air operations as well as for the

_113 NATO headquarters in Evere, NATO Joint Force Command in Brunssum, the strategic-level headquarters Supreme_
_Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Mons and NATO Allied Land Command Headquarters in Izmir._

operational preparation of our units. For NATO this involves the headquarters in
Ramstein, the Combined Air Operations Centre (CAOC) in Eudem and the Joint Air
Power Competence Centre (JAPCC) in Kalkar, all of them in Germany. In case of a
NATO operation these persons can be deployed within the NATO structure. Our Air
Component also has a bilateral cooperation with France which involves the participation
of our Defence personnel in the command and control structure of the Joint Force Air
Component in Lyon. It also contributes with personnel to the permanent staff of the
European Air Group in High Wycombe in the United Kingdom, to the European Personnel
Recovery Centre (EPRC) in Poggio, Italy, and to the European Air Transport Command
(EATC) in Eindhoven (the Netherlands). The EATC provides active support to operations
through the coordination of air transport for the logistic operational deployment and
supply. For the commissioning and technical support of the Air Component’s weapon
systems Defence has integrated some subject matter experts in cooperation projects with
other nations, such as the F-16 MNFP (Multinational Fighter Program), within OCCAR
(Organisation Conjointe de Cooperation en matiere d'ARmement – Organisation for
Joint Armament Cooperation) for the acquisition and support of the A400Ms, and
within NAHEMA (NATO HElicopter Management Agency) and BENESAM for the
NH90 helicopters.
The international positions of the Navy (137 FTE) are mainly to be found in the BelgianDutch headquarters and schools. Belgian and Dutch servicemen are responsible for the

planning and supervision of the Belgian and Dutch maritime units within the Operations
Directorate of the bi-national headquarters Admiral Benelux. The persons active within
NLMARFOR (the Netherlands Maritime Force Staff) are deployed in the various
operations led by this staff (e.g. ATALANTA). Bi-national structures also exist to evaluate
the frigates and mine countermeasures vessels during their conversion into vessels that
can be deployed in operations. The bi-national schools provide education and training
in technical and operational fields to Belgian and Dutch servicemen. Moreover, some
Belgian servicemen work in Den Helder within the framework of material support. The
Naval Component is also present in Northwood, the maritime headquarters supporting
the NATO operations, as well as in Toulon, with the HRF-M (High Readiness ForcesMaritime), the personnel of which can be deployed in French maritime task forces.


Besides the international positions within the Defence components our Defence also
contributes personnel to the headquarters of international security organisations. The
importance that both Defence and the Belgian authorities attach to our multilateral
partnerships should always be reflected in our positions within these organisations.
This is also part of a multilateral solidary burden and responsibility sharing. These
positions are also of the utmost importance from an operational point of view since
the operational deployment of our Defence usually takes place within the framework of
these organisations. Control and influence over these operations and the policy of these

international organisations are not just exercised by diplomatic positions, but also by
military positions at the military-strategic level.
Defence is represented in the following international NATO structures at the militarystrategic level: International Staff (IS) in Brussels, Allied Command Operations (SHAPE)
in Mons, Allied Command Transformation (ACT) in Norfolk, Joint Forces Command
(JFC) in Brunssum, NATO Defense College (NDC) in Rome, NATO Communications
and Information Agency (NCIA) (mainly in Mons and The Hague) and NATO Support
and Procurement Agency (NSPA) (mainly in Kapellen in Luxembourg).
Furthermore, our country also participates in the EU headquarters in Brussels, and
occupies international liaison positions at the military-strategic level in coalition planning
and command structures and the equivalent structures at a national level of France and the
United States.

**XIV.** **Defence Attachés and Military Advisers**

A defence attaché is a serviceman or -woman who represents the Minister of Defence
and the Chief of Defence in the countries for which he or she is accredited. A defence
attaché has responsibilities in diplomatic and military matters as well as in the field of
intelligence.
The defence attaché is the Belgian military representative in the military diplomatic
environment, and plays a central role in defence diplomacy. The defence attaché can
assist diplomats in diplomatic negotiations or other matters with important military
operational and military technical aspects by using the professional experience and
knowledge gained during his or her military career.
The defence attaché also plays an important military operational role in ensuring the
local procedures for the core task “protection of Belgian citizens all over the world”.
In order to fulfil his military mission the defence attaché needs to maintain all necessary
contacts with the local (military) authorities and with the international (military)
representation in order to obtain a correct and up-to-date strategic overview of the
country and the (military) actors involved. The defence attaché actively keeps up with
the (military) developments, the security risks, and the opportunities in his region,
in particular within the framework of possible, current or planned bilateral and/or
multilateral activities and operations.
The role of the defence attaché as an essential link in the intelligence apparatus of our
country has already been mentioned above. Within the applicable legal framework he or
she informs the Minister of Defence, the CHOD and the Defence Staff about the military
and defence policy of the countries of accreditation and about their armed forces.

Today Defence has a global network of 19 defence attachés and 2 military advisers,
as well as staff personnel (68 FTE in total). Defence attachés do not necessarily reside
in the country for which they are accredited. Whether they reside in their country of
accreditation or not does not have any influence on their role and missions. Many defence

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

attachés abroad have an accreditation for several countries in the same region, and the
defence attachés for the European countries work from the Defence staff in Belgium. In
total, the 19 defence attachés are currently accredited for about 76 countries.
The military advisers are members of the Belgian delegations at the United Nations in
New York and at the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe in Vienna.
Some defence attachés are also military advisers for regional organisations.
The geographic distribution and the accreditations are the result of a recurrent analysis
at the Defence level that considers not only the geopolitical security environment but
also our bilateral and/or multilateral relations. The geographic distribution is also
coordinated with the departments of Foreign Affairs and Development Cooperation in
order to reinforce a national comprehensive approach with regard to security policy.
By 2030 the number of FTE for defence attachés and military advisers (and their support
personnel) will be reduced to 50 FTE. This reduction will primarily be achieved by a further
rationalisation of accreditations of defence attachés and by a more common approach of
the national military representation with strategic partner countries. Today an initiative
has already been taken at the Benelux level to issue complementary accreditations to
defence attachés who would then work for both Belgium and the Netherlands.

**XV.** **Policy Unit Minister of Defence and Administrative and Technical**
**Secretariat (ATS)**

The policy unit of the Minister of Defence will in the future also be able to rely on the
Administrative and Technical Secretariat in which military experts of the Defence staff
provide expertise and facilitate contacts with the Defence staff. As is the case with the rest
of Defence, by 2030 the number of FTE will be reduced (to 60 FTE).

**XVI.** **Royal Higher Institute for Defence (RHID)**

The Royal Higher Institute for Defence is a think tank in the military-strategic field that
has its own researchers and organises conferences and civil-military training in the same
field. This institute is currently also in charge of the coordination and control of the
scientific research within Defence. The future of this institute will be determined taking
into account the emphasis that will be placed on a stronger and more centralised defence
policy regarding R&T with a view to reinforcing the partnership between Defence,
industry and research institutes (see chapter 6).

### An Efficient Defence

The recapitalisation of Defence described in chapter 4 does not affect the search for enhanced
efficiency leading to an even better performance.
An important example of this is to be found in chapter 2 about the positioning of Defence in the
security environment. While on the one hand, Defence needs to focus on its three core tasks, it
is also committed to offering maximum support to other internal security actors according to
the capabilities available.
Furthermore, chapter 4 shows the willingness to strive for a more efficient support of our national
defence capabilities through capability anchoring with our strategic partner countries.


###### “Elaborate forms of cooperation with other national and international security partners in order to strengthen the national efficiency of Defence and in support of a more European defence policy will be strived for.” (principle no. 6)


Chapter 5 makes it clear that the downsizing of FTE will be even more important in the essential
command and operational support capabilities than in the capabilities of the Intelligence-CyberInfluence dimension and the Land, Air and Maritime dimensions. This is perfectly in line with
a Defence wishing to be lean & mean, focused on the military specificity and as such an efficient
Defence.
This chapter sets out the guidelines for this efficient Defence with regard to structures, sourcing
of non-military activities, medical support, competence development, infrastructure, the bonds
with the industry and the research institutions, the institutions under the supervision of the
Minister of Defence and sustainability.

**a. Structures According to Processes**

This strategic vision offers a new opportunity for optimising the existing structures of
Defence with respect to both quantity and content. The general rule is that the structures are
based on the processes as a matter of principle. The processes have to focus on the core tasks
of Defence and hence on operational deployment.
This immediately leads us to consider that the tasks currently being carried out by Defence
but for which a more efficient alternative exists on the civilian market (with the same output
but at lower cost) or within the public service, should not be organised by Defence anymore,

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

or at least not autonomously. This aspect will be further examined in the following subchapter
dedicated to sourcing.
Secondly, the processes and therefore also the structures of Defence have to proactively adapt
to the capability changes provided for in this strategic vision.
Finally, the expected internationalisation of the organisation of capabilities will lead to an
increase of a networked functioning
of our defence structure with both

###### The general rule is that the

European structures and structures

###### structures are based on the of cooperation partners rather than processes as a matter of principle. The to an exclusively national defence processes have to focus on the core tasks structure. In the long run, some of

our staff and command structures

###### of Defence and hence on operational

will be integrated for the most part

###### deployment. into an international network, with

a special focus on our neighbours.
All current contributions of our Defence to multinational command structures will also be
assessed based on their future necessity. Those which offer no added value within the policy
framework specified in this strategic vision will be re-examined. Special emphasis will be put
on the integration of our structures into those of our closest partner countries based on our
cooperation for the common operational preparation of our capabilities.

In chapter 5 the operational character of the capabilities in the field of command and
operational support is indicated as well as the way some of them will be rationalised in the
future while maintaining their functionality. Some structures which do not easily fit in with
the processes relating to the core tasks, including the Sports Centre of Duisburg and the
Defence bands, are being (partly) questioned. Other supporting structures which are not
essential to the core tasks of Defence will also be rationalised. As the services provided by
the Prince Albert Club and the Louise Residence could also be provided by both the existing
catering facilities (including lodging) and services inside the quarters, and the existing
catering on the market, these will not be run nor financed by Defence anymore.

**b. Sourcing of Activities Without Military Specificity**

As mentioned above, a Defence focused on operational deployment will have to be assisted as
much as possible by civilian service providers with respect to supporting tasks and services.
Tasks currently being carried out by Defence, but for which a more efficient alternative is
available through civilian service providers or public partners, i.e. with the same output
(both quantitative and qualitative) but at lower cost (taking into account a Life Cycle Cost
approach), will not be carried out internally anymore, or at least not autonomously. Defence
will achieve this by pursuing a sourcing policy applying to both the provision of services and
the investment in equipment and infrastructure. A sourcing policy considers, in a structural
way, whether to ensure/purchase specific services/equipment/infrastructure internally rather

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

than by cooperating with or outsourcing to civilian or public partners. This sourcing reflex is
not new within Defence as several activities are already being sourced now. Today, Defence
relies on civilian service providers
for facility services (maintenance

equipment, primary health care and
maintenance (vessels, aircraft and **autonomously.**
commercial vehicles).
Defence will carry on this policy in
a more structural way and assess, for any current and new service/equipment/infrastructure,
the opportunity of cooperating with or outsourcing to a civilian or public partner for the
sake of efficiency.


_The replacement of the fleet of commercial vehicles started in 2015. The majority of these vehicles is now leased,_
_including services such as roadside assistance. Leasing ensures that Defence has a fleet of new and modern vehicles_
_at all times._

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

As from 2017, this enhanced sourcing policy will lead to the creation of a budgetary line for
“additional sourcing replacing ‘duties without military specificity’” within the global cost
structure of Defence. This line will be part of the operating budget.


###### “The functioning of Defence will be rationalised as much as possible taking into account important points of consideration such as cost-saving and effectiveness-enhancing measures. This implies, among other things, that servicemen will focus on military specific tasks, an increased use of market opportunities for supporting tasks and services and a rationalisation of the infrastructure.” (principle no. 4)


Within the Defence Staff, several ongoing studies examine additional sourcing opportunities.
The most important projects are:

§ opportunities for broadening the existing sourcing of territorial services related to quarters §
and other territorial tasks (Territorial Support Service (TSS))[114]. The ultimate goal is to
have in time global contracts rather than a vast number of separate contracts for each TSS
subarea. This will ensure the creation of economies of scale, which means more budgetary
benefits and fewer Defence personnel for maintaining the overview;

§§ the study on the white fleet examines to what extent its operational capability can be ensured
by contracting civilian capability (see chapter 5);

§ maximal sourcing of maintenance as well as the technical-logistic support of weapon §
systems at industrial level (depot level);

§ outsourcing the organisation of the current training ranges;§
§ maximal sourcing of storage and distribution of equipment, clothing and material by a §
civilian partner.

Gradual sourcing will be applied where possible, taking into account the progressive
downsizing of Defence personnel currently in charge of specific services.
The rationalisation of the medical support and competence development (see below) is also
partly based on increased sourcing.

_114 The sourcing scope for TSS will be broadened in the following areas:_

§ within the Facility Management area, the lodging, catering and cafeterias which are now mainly organised by Defence, will §
_be outsourced, while the already partly sourced maintenance tasks (treatment of waste, gardening and clearing during the_
_winter) will be entirely sourced from now on;_

§ the inferior levels of technical Facility Management, including the handyman services and small repairs, will also be entirely §
_sourced in addition to the already sourced maintenance of technical facilities and statutory inspections;_

§ the surveillance of infrastructures, including reception, supervision and intervention, will be sourced according to the safety §
_instructions, using as many technological means as possible;_

§ territorial packages and parcels services as well as post sorting and delivery will be subject to increased sourcing;§
§ sourcing will be applied to territorial mobility (such as individual and collective duty trips), eco-mobility within the §
_framework of the home-to-work traffic of the personnel and the running of gas stations for military vehicles._

If consultation demonstrates that certain supporting services could be carried out more
efficiently by or in cooperation with other public partners, then this could also be a
(complementary) approach. For
example, the closure of the internal

also be created between Defence and
service centres of other public services
with regard to the acquisition policy,
central accounting services, education, payroll, data management and security, as well as the
management of both the fleet of (commercial) vehicles and the buildings of Defence.

The combination of all sourcing efforts is expected at least to lead to the replacement of about
5,000 FTE of the current personnel. Sourcing is indeed an important step to compensate the
downsizing of Defence personnel and should enable military personnel to carry out more
military specific duties.
In the short term, pilot projects will

investment of these projects has to be studied
with a long-term perspective. The overall objective is to reduce the current costs (including
the personnel costs) by at least 10% for all sourcing agreements concluded.

**c. Additional Efficiency-Enhancing Measures for the Medical Support**

As mentioned in the previous chapter, the military medical support will be organised
according to the level of ambition in the four capability dimensions, with a focus on
operational deployment as requested by the Government agreement. For this purpose, the
Government agreement asks for a further investigation of the three following aspects: the
autonomy of the Medical Component, giving up tasks of a purely civilian nature and the
necessity of maintaining the Military Hospital. These three issues have to be considered in
the light of efficiency-enhancing measures for the military medical support with a view to
operational deployment. As indicated in the previous chapter, a military medical capability
focused on operational deployment can be achieved by maintaining a military hospital as
a centralised operational preparation structure. A reorientation of this Military Hospital
through rationalisation and increased cooperation at the interdepartmental, civilian-military
and international level can however strengthen the efficiency of the future Military Hospital
and as such the future military medical capability.


###### “The medical component is being thoroughly restructured (revision of the autonomy, giving up tasks of a purely civilian nature) with a view to operational deployment. Within this framework, the future and the necessity of the Military Hospital are being examined.” (Government agreement of 9 October 2014)


The first question asked by the Government agreement with regard to operational
deployment is whether to maintain the Medical Component as a separate component, or
to consider its integration into the supporting services of the other components. When
we benchmark ourselves against our neighbours, we find that medical support is provided
by a separate “component” in both France and Germany, whereas the United Kingdom
integrates its medical support into the different forces. The Netherlands apply a hybrid
model including both a decentralisation into the different forces and a limited centralised
structure. Therefore the Defence Staff will conduct a study, within the framework of the
implementation project on the future structure of the Defence Staff, to determine the most
appropriate type of autonomy for the medical support within the Defence structure. This
study will take into consideration the specific regulations and organisation of public health
in Belgium, as well as the experiences in other NATO countries regarding the added value
of their medical support structure in relation to the efficiency of their military medical
capability. Based on this study, a political decision will be taken on the autonomy of the
military medical support, in addition to the other decisions regarding the future structure
of the Defence Staff.

-----

According to the Government agreement, a second possibility consists in giving up tasks
of a purely civilian nature. Given the already quite limited tasks of an essentially civilian
nature, this strategic vision will consider the ties between military medical support and the
civilian world in a larger context in order to strengthen efficiency as much as possible. As the
Military Hospital (the third aspect in the vision on medical support in the above quoted text
of the Government agreement) plays an important role in the ties between military medical
support and the civilian world, it will be further discussed in connection with these civilianmilitary ties.
The current interdepartmental and civilian-military contacts and projects offer the prospect
of a positive interdepartmental, civil-military and maybe international partnership for
Defence on the existing site of the Military Hospital. This partnership would contribute to
anchoring a centralised structure for military medical operational preparation in the future,
in a manner that is efficient and financially viable in a structural way. In the short run, these
contacts and projects should be further materialised.
We will discuss the following three general aspects of the ties between military medical
support and the civilian world, including the related efficiency-enhancing measures:

§ military tasks of an essentially civilian nature which can be transferred to a private or §
public actor without affecting the deployment of Defence in an important manner;

§ activities which are currently part of the military medical operational preparation §
and logistic support of Defence, but which might be organised more efficiently by the
(increased) use of civilian service providers and civilian-military cooperation, without
negatively affecting the operational capability of Defence;

§ civilian tasks which are currently being carried out by Defence within the framework §
of operational preparation and whose content could be broadened for the benefit of
the operational preparation of Defence and to optimise the Defence support to internal
security.

Tasks of an essentially civilian nature which could be transferred to a private or public actor
without largely affecting the deployment of Defence include the capability for production
and storage of medicine of Defence, the hospital capability of the Military Hospital in the
event of disasters and the emergency mortuary of the Military Hospital.
The medicine production capability can be given up by Defence considering its only limited
operational relevance and because there are sufficient possibilities to outsource this capability
to the civilian sector. Currently, Defence and the Ministry of Health have an agreement on
the use of this production capability within the framework of public health. The disposal of
this capability by Defence and the potential takeover by another actor will thus have to be
coordinated at the interdepartmental level.
Since after studying the matter, it has been decided to maintain a centralised operational
preparation structure through a further rationalisation of the current Military Hospital,
the existing infrastructure for hospital capability in case of disasters and the emergency
mortuary within the Military Hospital can also be maintained. However, internal security
not being one of Defence’s core tasks, this infrastructure must be kept operational without
using the financial and personnel resources of Defence. The current studies and risk analyses

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

carried out in cooperation with the Ministry of Health with regard to these infrastructural
capabilities will have to be finalised in the short run. They could be integrated into a broader
overall cooperation between the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry
of Justice and Defence for the creation of a national hospital for disaster relief. Besides the
operating and maintenance costs of the hospital capability infrastructure in case of disasters
and the emergency mortuary, an interdepartmental partnership has to take into account
a contribution to the important overall infrastructure maintenance works of the Military
Hospital (80 million euros in the short term).


_The emergency hospital capability of the Military Hospital is prepared to receive the wounded of the attacks of_
_22 March 2016._

Like the other logistic support of Defence (see chapter 5 “Material Resources branch”), the
medical logistic support (storage and distribution), being an integral part of the medical
support pillar, will be sourced as much as possible.
Furthermore, the military medical operational preparation centralised in the Military
Hospital includes sub-capabilities which can be carried out more efficiently through the
(increased) use of civilian service providers and by enhanced civilian-military cooperation,
without adversely affecting the operational readiness of Defence. According to a first study
of the Defence Staff, the overall operating costs (including the personnel and investment
costs[115] ) of the future Military Hospital can be rationalised by about 20 to 25% through the


_115 Except for the important infrastructure investments._

-----

organisation of the different sub-capabilities of the operational preparation structure for the
medical capability according to a combination of five business models:
(1) entirely sourcing sub-capabilities to civilian hospitals;
(2) integration of deployable military personnel into civilian hospitals where they can
exercise (if possible with military equipment);
(3) integration of civilian personnel and equipment into the (renovated) Military Hospital for
sub-capabilities which, basically, do not have much military relevance, but are essential
to organise a medical activity with military relevance within the Military Hospital;
(4) option (3) with the civilian personnel in the Military Hospital using military equipment;
(5) a model where the personnel as well as the equipment and infrastructure for a subcapability are provided by Defence.
At any rate, it is clear that the Military Hospital at Neder-over-Heembeek can no longer
continue to exist in its current form. Today, the Hospital is mainly organised according to
business model no. 5. The four other business models will be applied as much as possible to
strengthen the efficiency of the Military Hospital as an operational preparation pillar of the
operational medical support.

The final decisions on the future of the Military Hospital will be prepared by a technical
working group at the intersectoral and interdepartmental level. First, however, the abovementioned study of the Defence Staff will be further elaborated based on an independent
audit on the short-term feasibility of these proposals.
This audit will also show to what extent an increase of civilian-military partnerships can
contribute to civilian-military financing of the infrastructure works planned for the Military
Hospital.
Furthermore, this audit will make any additional proposals with regard to the rationalisation
of the operational preparation structure of the military medical capability, without affecting
the necessary operational flexibility and autonomy. With regard to this aspect of the audit, the
opportunities for a broad cooperation with external prevention and protection services will
be studied in order to ensure cost-effective and qualitative occupational medicine adjusted
to the operational needs of Defence. The audit will also draw up an inventory of the legal
adjustments required to implement these (additional) proposals.
Additionally, the audit will identify the most appropriate legal structure for anchoring this
central operational preparation structure. Given the focus on operational deployment, the
future legal structure of the Military Hospital should provide the necessary autonomy to
support the core tasks of Defence as well as flexible administrative management to ensure
the regulations and needs of Defence. As mentioned above, the financial management of the
Military Hospital should contribute to fair burden-sharing between all partners.
Finally, the audit has to consider the equitable balance in the existing partnerships of Defence
with public and private actors with respect to the Military Hospital and submit proposals to
obtain a better balance if necessary.
The results of this audit will have to be available by the end of 2016 in order to provide further
guidance for the implementation project on the rationalisation of the operational preparation
structure of the medical capability, the Military Hospital. As mentioned above, this project

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

will then be treated in a technical working group at the intersectoral and interdepartmental
level. This working group will be set up in the short term so as to allow the other parties
to prepare this file from their perspective by the end of 2016. The working group will be
provided with a precise mandate and will base its proceedings on both the above-mentioned
study of the Defence Staff and the independent audit.


_The operating wing of the Military Hospital is part of the operational preparation infrastructure for the operational_
_medical support._

A last complementary element for strengthening the efficiency of the medical support,
based on more efficient ties between military medical support and the civilian context, is to
broaden the content of the civilian tasks which are currently carried out by Defence, for the
benefit of better operational preparation. Broadening civilian tasks concurrently implies the
optimisation of the role of Defence for internal security.
Currently, the medical-technical personnel of Defence (nurses and doctors) receive training
within the Military Hospital. As mentioned above, these personnel can use deployable
equipment to practise specifically military procedures. This training takes place in the
ambulance service, the MUG (Mobiele UrgentieGroep, emergency medical services including
the CBRN capability), the burns unit (including the day clinic), the operating wing and
the hospital capability for orthopaedic interventions. The will to perpetuate a centralised
operational preparation structure for the medical capability of Defence also means that there
are enough patients and that the activities are geared to the operational needs. Therefore,


T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

the aim is to extend the activities of the future Military Hospital to areas which are equally
relevant for operational preparation due to their complexity and resemblance with injuries
caused during operational deployment. This should also enhance the structural profitability
of the Military Hospital. Issues to be considered include the development of a capability
for (“dirty”) septic orthopaedic surgery, a capability for the treatment of highly infectious
diseases and a stronger role for the military medical capability with regard to traumatology[116].
This broadening of the training opportunities (leading to increased effectiveness) will have
to be realised without creating an oversized training capability for operational preparation.
The broadening of the training capability of the Military Hospital does not in any way reduce
the value of existing and future partnerships which consist in employing part-time medicaltechnical Defence personnel in civilian institutions to maintain their skills.

Maintaining scalable capabilities in case of national disasters through interdepartmental
partnerships, and broadening the medical provision of care relevant for national
emergencies and crises increase the opportunities of the Military Hospital of the future if
it would be earmarked as a national hospital for disaster relief. Such a hospital could not
only bring added value to the operational preparation of the military medical capability but
also optimise the supporting role of Defence with regard to the medical aspect of internal
security. Furthermore, a hospital for disaster relief could meet requests of international
organisations in Brussels and also be partly financed by these organisations.
As Defence cannot assume a leading role with regard to internal security, the possible use of
the Military Hospital as a basis for a future national hospital for disaster relief will depend
on the participation of interdepartmental (the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of
Health in the first place), regional and civilian partners in such a project, and if common
financing can be found to cover the operating costs as well as the additional equipment and
personnel needed for this role.
The opportunities (and related financing models) of transforming the Military Hospital into
a national hospital for disaster relief according to the framework referred to above will also
be examined by the above-mentioned audit.

**d. Rationalisation of Competence Development**

Defence will continue to invest maximum effort in the competence development of its
personnel. However, the downsizing of FTE for competence development referred to in
chapter 5 does indicate that Defence will have to rethink the organisation of its education
and training to further comply with the high standards in the future.
The first issue discussed below involves the general principles for a more efficient and
innovative approach of competence development.
Guidance will also be provided for a rationalisation of the academic, technical-academic,
continuing and basic military education currently available at the Royal Military School
and the Royal School for Non-Commissioned Officers, as well as in both Basic Education
and Training Centres.

**I.** **General Principles for a More Efficient Competence Development**

The rationalisation of competence development will in the first place be achieved by
the fact that Defence will no longer organise education and training which are also
available in civilian institutions. The idea is to only maintain education and training
organised by and within Defence as required by their military specificity. Examples of
education and training without military specificity include sports education/training
and education/training for catering personnel.

Additional rationalisation is possible with regard to the military specific education and
training organised at national level. Studies are already being conducted to organise
military education and training as much as possible at the workplace, within the
units, and as part of the operational preparation process. The opportunity for overall
implementation of blended learning[117] will also be examined. This system could have
positive effects on the functioning of Defence thanks to a more limited impact on the
availability of the personnel involved in this type of education.

A third general element to rationalise competence development as much as possible,
is to achieve maximum cooperation with other (military specific) education and
training institutions of our strategic partner countries. This can be done by the common
organisation of certain types of education/training and result in mutual optimisation
through specialisation. In this way, we also contribute to the European capability
anchoring as discussed in chapter 3. Common education and training can also be
optimised by the use of common doctrines and similar equipment. As mentioned in
chapter 5, an important part of the specialised professional education and training for the
Air dimension as well as the greater part of this education and training for the Maritime

dimension are already available in international training institutions organised together
with France and the Netherlands, respectively. Especially the Navy has already achieved
optimisation through partial specialisation. Our Defence also relies on NATO and EU
institutions as well as the NATO Centres of Excellence for the education and training of
its personnel.


**II.** **The Rationalisation of the Academic, Technical-Academic, Continuing**
**and Basic Military Education and Training within Defence**

The organisation of the basic military education and training for all categories will be
more centralised.
The Royal Military Academy (KMS (Koninklijke Militaire School)) will be turned
into an education organisation that centralises all education currently offered to
staff personnel within Defence. This education includes the academic education, the
technical-academic education as well as the continuing education, for both officers and
non-commissioned officers whereas today this education for both categories is given


_In the future, all basic education for staff personnel will be taught in the Royal Military Academy._

separately for the most part. A unique education organisation for staff personnel will
create synergies and reinforce the cohesion of the different courses in terms of content
so as to offer more efficient education in general to all staff personnel.
The general education for all categories will therefore be more centralised, allowing
for efficiencies in terms of content and budget. However, the specialised professional


T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

education and training will have to rely further on the different, be it rationalised, centres
of competence, besides specialised professional education and training in the units, as a
result of the specific characteristics of the capabilities and the different dimensions.

The current academic education at the KMS will also be largely rationalised[118]. The
number of specialisations in the two main branches (Bachelor/Master in Social and
Military Sciences and Polytechnic Bachelor/Master) will decrease considerably and will
have a very military specific content. All Master’s degree courses will be given in English
(and therefore no longer in French and Dutch). The duration of education for the Master
in Social and Military Sciences will be shortened by one year[119]. These adjustments have
to be made while maintaining the Bologna accreditation standards for education.
The cadets’ pay will be revised downwards during the first years of education and will
gradually increase following the example of other military academic institutions within
NATO.
The planned adjustment of the current education at the KMS should allow for a reduction
by 40 to 50% of the number of senior staff currently envisaged and a reduction by 20 to
30% of the current overall operating costs (including personnel and investment costs).
Taking also into account the rationalisations of the personnel of the KSOO and the
Basic Education and Training Centres, a reduction by some 30% is achieved in the total
number of personnel working in the “general basic and continuing education of officers,
non-commissioned officers and volunteers".

As regards the education at the KMS, a closer partnership with civilian academic
institutions will also be pursued in order to strengthen the academic education and
research at the KMS. This can be achieved by an exchange of teaching and research
personnel, the alignment of research areas and the pursuit of complementarity between
certain fields of education. As a consequence, these fields of education will also be open to
civilian students. The close ties with civilian academic institutions will also be supported
by the research done at the KMS (and more generally within Defence). These ties can
support our security interests in a complementary manner (see point f. below).

As regards the new academic education at the KMS, Defence will proactively look for
further opportunities for interdepartmental cooperation and international military
cooperation.

_118 Besides, the renewed education for officers, the KMS will continue to pay special attention to physical and behavioural training._
_The military education will be organised through the more centralised structure for basic military education._
_119 Four years instead of five. The Polytechnic education will still take five years to complete._

**e. Principles Related to the Rationalisation of the Infrastructure**


###### “Taking the needs of Belgian Defence into account, regional balances will be ensured during the implementation phase for the geographical distribution of quarters, personnel and capabilities. This strengthens the bonds with society.” (principle no. 5)


As mentioned in principle no. 5, the decision of the new geographical distribution of Defence
by 2030 will be detailed in the implementation plan for the geographical distribution of
the quarters to be issued after this strategic vision. A few principles with regard to the
rationalisation of the infrastructure are discussed below.

The Government agreement mentions that for the future distribution of the Defence units
“the potential of the quarters, the costs and the balance with regard to regional distribution,
the potential impact of sub-regional recruitment, the well-being of the servicemen, the
regional embedment of the support to the Nation as well as a focus on current or future forms
of multinational cooperation” will be taken into account. Consequently, all these aspects will
be taken into consideration in the implementation plan for the geographical distribution of
the quarters. Principle no. 5 places an additional focus on ensuring regional balances while
specifying that, besides the quarters, a fair distribution of the personnel and the capabilities
has to be achieved. The distribution of the capabilities will be based on both quantity and
quality, while ensuring a regional balance with respect to their technicity.

An excessive centralisation of our Defence on our territory is not desirable. Of course, this
has not prevented Defence, over the past years, from pursuing a policy aimed at adjusting
its real-estate assets as much as possible to the actual operational needs. This policy will be
maintained until 2030 and will allow for a rationalisation by reducing the operating costs.

The quarters which are no longer necessary to meet the needs of Defence will be sold. The
proceeds of the sales will go into the budgetary fund of Defence[120] which is used[121] among
other things for the necessary infrastructure works in the remaining quarters and the
investments required for this rationalisation.

To avoid lengthy sales procedures and accelerate certain infrastructure rationalisations,
Defence will also rely on alternative financing where appropriate. More specifically,
this involves exchange agreements with private and public partners receiving land and

_120 On 1 October 2015, the Council of Ministers decided that as from 1 January 2016, only 1 budgetary fund would be maintained_
_for Defence. This fund brings together all receipts of the three previous funds. These receipts can be used by Defence as from 1_
_January 2016, in addition to the regular budget, and this for all kinds of expenditure: new investments, infrastructure works,_
_operating or personnel expenditure. However, the receipts and expenditure have to remain in balance on an annual basis._
_121 During the period 2010-2014, the sales of Defence real estate brought in nearly 17 million euros per year on average._

infrastructure in exchange of the building of new infrastructure, the renovation or even the
maintenance of infrastructure for a fixed period of time.

**f. Towards a Strategy for Additionally Supporting our Security Interests**
**by Means of our National Research Institutions and Industry**

The defence investments mentioned in the previous chapters are in the first place aimed
at enabling the Belgian authorities to remain a security partner based on multilateral
solidarity within the security environment described above.
Furthermore, these investments make it possible to establish ties between Defence, the
industry and the research institutions which also contribute to enhancing our security. In
practice, these will primarily be the bonds with the national industry and national research
institutions, as our authorities are able to have a direct influence on them. Within a holistic
defence and security policy, the close implication of actors involved in industry, service
provision and knowledge acquisition constitutes a key component of national security. In
addition, the bonds between Defence, the industry and the research institutions will always
include an economic component (the derived value). The investments made by Defence
can directly or indirectly produce a return on investment as know-how, technology and
employment. The opportunity offered by the important investment amounts and R&T
resources in this strategic vision with regard to research in areas of high technology could
not only be an important driving force behind our research institutions but also contribute
to the development and production of innovative systems by our industry. A return on
investment, including know-how, technology and employment, also contributes to
creating public support for these investments from both the population and the business
world. However, it is clear that the desired close bonds between our Defence, our industry
and our research institutions constitute in the first place a necessary and additional factor
to strengthen our national security. From the security point of view of this strategic vision,
the derived economic value and innovation resulting from the bonds between these three
actors is nothing more than a side-effect.


###### “The efforts made to liberate the necessary budgets are, however, not only a question of intergenerational solidarity, but can also be a source of important economic incentives and innovation.” (Government agreement of 9 October 2014)


T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

###### “The efficiency of the investments in major equipment will be optimised by means of a maximum return on investment to society through know-how, technology and employment, in compliance with national and European legislation in force. To this end, the Ministry of Economy together with Defence, will define the implementation measures for a maximum economic return for defence procurement, among other things, by using article 346 TFEU, as referred to in the Government agreement.” (principle no. 8)


At the core of the desired pragmatic partnership between our Defence, our industry
and our research institutions is the support provided to our essential security interests.
These security interests will be defined by Defence in order to apply article 346, 1, b
of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This article concerns the
protection of the essential security interests which are connected with the production of
or trade in arms, munitions and war material. These essential security interests include
for example the secured supply of indispensable components for our weapon systems,
the guaranteed provision of vital services for Defence and research activities of direct
relevance to our national security.

Moreover, the Ministry of Economy, Defence, the Regions and Communities (in
charge of education and industry) as well as the umbrella organisations of our industry
and education will have to collaborate closely to develop the pragmatic partnership
between our Defence, our research institutions and our industry. The basic terms of
this partnership will be defined within a “Defence, Industry and Research Strategy”
(DIRS). This document will be edited under the leadership of the Ministry of Economy
and Defence. This DIRS is one of the major projects to be developed based on this
strategic vision and the essential security interests defined by Defence. Based on these
essential security interests, the DIRS will point out the industry and scientific research
areas of direct relevance to our national security (= the strategic industrial and research
sectors within the framework of our defence policy). The DIRS will include both the
focal points for R&T (Research and Technology) and the subsequent R&D (Research
and Development) of the different competent authorities in Belgium. Of course, these
areas must be in harmony with both the capabilities to be acquired as provided for in
this strategic vision and the expected capability and technological priorities of Belgian
Defence after 2030. This DIRS must specify how the public authorities (both the
federal level and the level of the competent regional and community authorities) see
the distribution of responsibilities for managing this security cooperation as well as

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

the contribution by the three stakeholders (Defence, industry, research institutions).
All of this is essential to enable a methodical development of the ties between Defence,
the research institutions and the industry which would be an added value for our
national security.

The DIRS will show that Belgium is and will be able to develop competitive defencerelated industrial competences and capabilities necessary for the protection of the
essential security interests of our country. This competitive industry strengthens our
country’s credibility and opportunities to be considered a partner in international
cooperation relationships. The investment programmes planned for our Defence are
an additional incentive to establish close bonds between the European/international
industry and our own industry. In this way, the Belgian industry and research centres
can strengthen their contribution to the elaboration of a European industrial and
technological basis which constitutes a key element for strengthening European
military autonomy.

Maintaining the priority technology areas and industrial capabilities is a key aspect
of the essential security interests of our country. The procurement of weapon systems
by our own Defence however does not provide sufficient critical mass to develop a
Belgian defence industry. This could be rectified through the contribution of our
industry to an international industrial network. The presence of Belgian companies
in the supply chain of important military equipment manufacturers (OEMs or
Original-Equipment Manufacturers) in Europe and North America can also offer
additional guarantees for our security.
In case of large contracts for the procurement of military equipment, the necessity
to invoke article 346 TFEU will be analysed. Where appropriate, the necessity and
the extent to which the essential security interests are being guaranteed will be
considered. The priority technology areas referred to in the above-mentioned DIRS,
or the related industrial activities, have been anchored in these essential security
interests.

By ensuring the legal anchorage of the different procurement programmes for major
equipment, the military programme Act (see principle no. 7 below) clearly establishes
the capability priorities with respect to our industry and research institutions for the
duration of the strategic vision. In this way, our industry will have the opportunity
to position itself strategically in relation to the future military needs of Belgian
Defence. This means among other things that our industry becomes an even more
interesting cooperation partner for other (larger) international defence actors. Thanks
to privileged contacts with our industry, these could increase their understanding of
what to expect from the Belgian market for their products. Conversely, the Belgian
industry is also offered opportunities through this cooperation with larger players
(the OEMs) to gain access to new markets for its products. Furthermore, our Defence

is represented in a wide range of specialist military fora and research institutions[122]
within NATO and the EU (EDA) which also bring to light the capability trends and
needs of our allies. Consequently, a constructive relationship between Defence and
our industry will enable our industry to respond even better to needs other than
those of our own Defence and to contribute to the consolidation of a more European
technological and industrial basis.


The different public actors, in particular thanks to their activities within the framework
of the DIRS, will foster a climate conducive to business-to-business contacts and
initiatives between the OEMs and our enterprises so as to generate additional knowhow, technology and employment.

###### “A military programme Act which will include the investments in major equipment of Belgian Defence for the duration of the strategic vision, will help generate stability and predictability for the effective realisation of a credible Belgian Defence by 2030 towards society, our allies and the business world.” (principle no. 7)


To support the pragmatic partnership between Defence, our industry and our research
institutions, as mentioned in chapter 4, our Defence will gradually increase its R&T
contribution as from 2022, with a view to reaching 2% of the defence effort in 2030
(currently this is 0.2%). This contribution is essential to give a positive impetus to this
partnership for innovation (Triple Helix model).

Besides other national research centres (academic as well as civilian and industrial), the
research institutions of Defence (including the defence laboratories (DLD), the research

centres of the KMS and the military medical laboratories and research centres) will be
important actors within this R&T policy. A unique centralised service, with national and
international structural contacts in the world of research and industry, will ensure proper
management and coordination of the R&T policy of Defence and will initiate cooperation
with other national security actors, Defences of preferential partner countries, research
centres and the industry within the framework of this policy. This R&T policy will also
be developed within a European framework to reinforce the ranking of our country
as an innovative society for defence capabilities. Different investment programmes for
innovative capabilities such as drones, satellites, unmanned naval vehicles (see chapter
5) can constitute a solid basis to realise this ambition. The European integration of the
R&T policy supported by Defence and coordinated in cooperation with the industrial
and research world can contribute to maximising the opportunities for our industries
with regard to their participation in the actual development phase of certain defence and
security systems (Development).
For Defence, integration into a European R&T policy has the advantage of indirectly
increasing the security of supply. Acting as a production and innovation centre with
regard to essential know-how and components for weapon and security systems,
our country will indeed have stronger assurances that its security needs and supply
requirements will be met. Another advantage for Defence consists in developing a better
understanding of both the opportunities for future capabilities and any technological
developments that could adversely affect our security. Furthermore, it is essential for the
economic sector and knowledge centres in this rapidly changing world to remain up-todate on the latest developments in new technologies, security evolutions and industrial
activities. Contributing to activities in these areas is the best guarantee to meet this
security need.

Involving our industry in multinational development projects, based on the closer ties
between our Defence and the industrial world, can also contribute to better account
being taken of our military operational requirements.

**g. Rationalisation of the Bodies under the Supervision of the Minister of**
**Defence**

On the one hand, the bodies under the supervision of the Minister of Defence[123] provide
services of direct relevance to the missions and personnel of Defence. On the other hand,
they play an important role in the remembrance of our military history and ensure the
management of our military heritage.
It is important that they can keep providing these services and socially relevant tasks in the
future. This is why it is necessary to make the financing of these bodies structurally viable

_123 The National Geographic Institute (NGI), the Royal Museum of the Armed Forces (KLM), the Central Office for Social and_
_Cultural Action (CDSCA), the Institute for Veterans - National Institute for War Invalids, War Veterans and War Victims_
_(IV-NIOOO), the Historical Pool of Defence and the National Memorial of the Fortress of Breendonk (NGFB)._

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

through the rationalisation of their structures and missions. These rationalisations will also
be carried out from the point of view of a Defence which increasingly focuses on its core
tasks as described above. In specific terms, this means that only military positions necessary
from a military and operational point of view will be maintained within these bodies.
This restructuring will affect the existing financing and personnel which will be subject to
systematic rationalisation.

Within the framework of this general vision we set about the task specified in the Government
agreement to evaluate the three semi-governmental bodies of Defence (NGI, CDSCA and
IV-NIOOO) and the Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and to decide on the major
directions for their future. The Government has already taken a few decisions of principle
on this subject.


###### “The Government will study the future, the place and the statute of the NGI, the KLM, CDSCA and the IV-NIOOO. Together with the two latter administrations, a working group under the supervision of the Minister of Defence will assess the pros and cons of a structural rapprochement between both semi- governmental bodies.” (Government agreement of 9 October 2014)


The services provided by CDSCA (Central Office for Social and Cultural Action) that
support the functioning of Defence in a direct way, such as the construction and rental of
accommodation and part of the social services (child care as well as moral, psychosocial,
medical social, financial or material support), will continue to be provided by this body. In
the future, CDSCA will additionally assume the social action for the benefit of the veterans of
the IV-NIOOO (the Institute for Veterans - National Institute for War Invalids, War Veterans
and War Victims). CDSCA will no longer be in charge of holiday planning through its own
travel agency. It will no longer organise welfare activities nor supply goods to servicemen
abroad. It is appropriate to maintain a limited number of military personnel in the social
services of CDSCA in the future.


###### “Along with its role in the commemorations, Defence has an important tradition with regard to the protection of heritage, particularly through the Historical Pool of Defence, the Centre for Historical Documentation and the Royal Museum of the Armed Forces. The Government wishes to continue this tradition.” (Government agreement of 9 October 2014)


T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

Besides CDSCA, the intention is to create a new semi-governmental body that will
enable the rationalisation of the remembrance and military heritage and render it more
autonomous (among other things through private-public partnerships). In the longer
run, the new “Remembrance and Military Heritage Organisation” (by 2030 at the latest)
will not employ military personnel anymore.
This organisation must ensure that the military heritage is better valorised although
this heritage remains the property of the federal authority. In this context, cooperation
agreements can also be concluded with the Communities for the operation of regional
sites.
This transversal organisation will take over the duty of remembrance and also the
management of the Belgian war graves from the IV-NIOOO and will integrate all
heritage institutions currently related to Defence (the Historical Pool of Defence,
the Royal Museum of the Armed Forces[124], the National Memorial of the Fortress of
Breendonk). It must also enable a common policy with other heritage institutions of the
federal authority[125] and independent museums[126] in order to reinforce the military and
civilian remembrance.

The Auxiliary Sickness & Invalidity Insurance Fund (HZIV) is a social security body.
This body is the best placed to take over from the IV-NIOOO both the social action for
the benefit of war veterans, war invalids and war victims and the reimbursement of their
medical expenses in a rationalised manner. Because of the decreases in the number of
beneficiaries[127] these tasks could no longer be executed in an efficient way by a separate
organisation. These tasks are more in line with the activities of the Auxiliary Fund.
Consequently, the Auxiliary Fund will continue to be able to provide these services for
the benefit of the beneficiaries in a qualitative manner.

The National Geographic Institute (NGI) is in charge of the production and distribution
of the geographic reference information for the Belgian territory. In the future, this
institution will be organised as a horizontal geo-broker that sees to it that geographical
data are easily accessible to all public entities. The NGI will examine in more detail
the opportunities for creating synergies with other public entities to rationalise its
functioning as much as possible.

All rationalisations of the bodies under the supervision of the Minister of Defence
should provide efficiency gains of a total of 20 million euros for the federal authority by
2030. This would be achieved mainly by both downsizing of personnel and decreasing
of the subsidisation necessary for these institutions. About 120 military FTE currently

-----

employed in the bodies concerned will no longer be needed in the future. This military
personnel will rejoin the headcount of Defence.
A global reform plan with regard to the semi-governmental bodies of Defence will be
approved by the Council of Ministers. The further elaboration will be based on separate
implementation files.


**h. A Sustainable Defence**

Sustainability is another important principle for the future. An action plan will be
implemented to make Defence a more sustainable organisation by 2030.


To be sustainable, Defence needs to be more energy efficient, to increase the use of sustainable
energy resources and to avoid waste in order to limit the national as well as the military
operational footprint. For expeditionary operations this means a reduced pressure on the
local population which will foster better acceptance of the military intervention and in this
way contribute to its success.

The increase of the infrastructure budgets will enable an improved energy efficiency of the
Defence infrastructure.

A sustainable Defence strives for maximum efficiency of the defence equipment life cycle,
for example by limiting spare parts and maintenance interventions which also contribute to
the efficiency and effectiveness of operational deployment.

In this matter too, an enhanced R&T policy (see above) with closer ties between Defence, the
civilian research centres and our industry can ensure that our Defence will be able to seize
any opportunity aimed at a more efficient functioning. Possible examples in this respect are
hybrid generators and vehicles.

This sustainability aspect will also be considered within the framework of the sourcing
initiatives.

### A Young Defence with a Flexible

 Personnel Policy


_People constitute the core and the added value of a military capability._

People constitute the core of a military capability. No weapon system, however effective
it may be, can contribute to our defence policy without sufficient and trained personnel.
Moreover, thanks to their motivation, creativity, empathy and adaptability to any situation,
human beings represent the core and added value of a military capability.


###### People constitute the core of a military capability.


At the beginning of 2016, Defence’s personnel
envelope numbered some 31,000 FTE (about
29,500 servicemen and 1,500 civilians). By
2030, this envelope will be downsized to
25,000 (about 24,000 military FTE and 1,000
civilian FTE). This reduction in size will be

personnel will retire over the next 10 years[128].

As shown by the chart, and despite recruitment maximisation, the workforce will already be
reduced by 6,000 FTE in 2024. Therefore, Defence will have to move towards new structures and
a new organisation at relatively short notice.
Besides the quantitative aspect of these recruitments, the recruitment policy also includes two
qualitative aspects which will have a significant operational impact for Defence. On the one hand,
Defence’s future new and more technical systems will require a larger number of skilled technical

personnel, mainly specialised non-commissioned officers. On the other hand, all possible efforts
should be made to cope with the current personnel shortage in the combat units, especially with
regard to soldiers, in order to rapidly reinforce Defence’s operational deployment capability in
the short term. Both qualitative aspects will be considered among the main recruitment outlines
for the period covered by the strategic vision.


###### “A more flexible personnel policy, with a reform of education/ training and personnel regulations based on an assessment of the current policy. With this increase of flexibility, aiming at abandoning the principle of Lifetime Employment as much as possible, Defence will become a younger organisation in general. The objective pursued is to lower the current average age of 40.6 years down to 34 years by 2030. For the years 2020 and 2025 indicative target figures related to the average age will also be fixed. In this respect attention will be paid to preserving a sufficient build-up of expertise, aimed at operational deployment. Giving new substance to the Reserve will also contribute to a more flexible personnel policy.” (principle no. 9)


**a. Abandon Lifetime Employment as Much as Possible**


###### A more flexible personnel policy will enable Defence personnel to better meet the needs of the organisation.


Principle no. 9 provides for a more flexible personnel
policy within Defence. An important way to achieve
this goal is to abandon Lifetime Employment as much
as possible. A more flexible personnel policy will
enable Defence personnel to better meet the needs
of the organisation. The increased flexibility is in line
with the general trend in society where workers change
jobs more easily, whether to take up new challenges
and favour their personal development, or to better
harmonise work and family life.


Defence is mainly in need of young military personnel with also the possibility to offer career
opportunities in the organisation to a sufficient number of servicemen to enable them to take
up technical and senior staff duties. Such duties require a build-up of expertise and ensure
the necessary continuity at the military-technical as well as the operational level within the
organisation.

needs of the organisation and his
own wishes, either switch to active
duty status (until the age of retirement) or receive support for a job outside Defence. In March
2016, a total number of 850 (out of a total of about 29,500) servicemen were employed under
the BDL regulations that were introduced in 2014. Since 2015, all soldiers enlisted have been
employed under these regulations. However, it is still possible to increase the percentages of
non-commissioned officers (for 2016: 38% BDL) and officers (for 2016: 3% BDL) and thus
further abandon the principle of Lifetime Employment for all military categories.


_Candidate-soldiers are receiving their basic education and training. Since 2015, all soldiers have been enlisted under_
_the personnel regulations for a short career. The aim is to also use these BDL personnel regulations to reduce Life Time_
_Employment within Defence for officers and non-commissioned officers._

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

Today, the BDL period includes professional education and training. According to the
general personnel regulations, it is not possible to receive academic education (academic
education for officers at the Royal Military Academy and technical-academic education for
non-commissioned officers) during this period. The period for return on investment is also
insufficient to include an extensive academic education during the 8-year BDL period. If
the BDL regulations were tailored to academic education, so that the 8-year period only
starts counting after education is completed, this would allow a further reduction of Lifetime
Employment.
A first assessment of the BDL regulations has shown that the flexibility of the personnel policy
could be further increased by enabling Defence to offer additional short-term employment
after the current BDL period. In 2016, a decision will be taken regarding the introduction
and terms of an additional BDL period. In this respect, specific accompanying measures will
have to be provided for, taking into account the higher age and more specialised profile of this
group of servicemen leaving Defence. This will drastically change Defence’s organisational
culture.

The generalisation of the BDL personnel regulations has the advantage that it guarantees
a more flexible personnel policy within Defence. The extent to which the personnel that
has been enlisted under the terms of the BDL regulations is likely to have to leave the
organisation, will depend on the needs of Defence itself, i.e. first and foremost the need
to preserve a Defence consisting of 25,000 FTE with the appropriate profiles. With the
recruitment number of 2,100 servicemen, the important number of retirements and the
possibility of an additional BDL period, a significant increase in the number of servicemen
reintegrating the civilian labour market, instead of switching over to the active duty career
(i.e. Lifetime Employment), is however only expected to happen from the period 2026 to
2030 onwards. Abandoning Lifetime Employment will only be maximised after 2030, and
only with a continued recruitment effort.

With regard to personnel leaving Defence after the end of the BDL period, Defence will
make all possible efforts to enhance their
chances on the external labour market. It will **With regard to**

Most servicemen employed under the BDL
regulations are planned to stay for a complete
(first) period of 8 years. Therefore, the first large group of BDL servicemen will not reintegrate
the labour market before 2022. According to a simulation, a maximum of 135 BDL servicemen
will leave Defence each year during the period 2022 to 2030. The introduction of a potential

However, later on this could become
a practical example of a preferential channel to absorb the outflow of the BDL personnel.
Defence will also explore the feasibility of setting up preferential channels for the outflow
towards other government services in the security sector and potentially the entire public
service.
Additionally, Defence will explore all possible employment channels in the civilian sector,
notably with the security sector, which is expected to become an important partner.
Feedback from private and public sectors to which servicemen could make the changeover
in the past, shows that the qualifications, abilities and skills acquired within Defence are
highly valued. Their strengths include loyalty, sense of discipline, planning and organisation,
social skills, flexibility, knowledge of languages and technical background. Defence can rest
assured that the members of its personnel are highly valued on the labour market, a situation
that can be further enhanced by additional preparatory education and training.

**b. A Permanent Role for Civilians within Defence**

Despite the fact that a reduced Defence will focus more on the military specificity and will
maximise the use of the opportunities on the market for support services, civilians will still
have an important role to play within Defence in 2030. Civilian jobs are expected to employ
1,000 FTE, with 50 recruits each year[130].


In the future, these civilian
personnel within Defence will have
to provide the organisation with
specialised expertise, both for the
operational capabilities and for the
supporting services of Defence.

_within Defence more rapidly. However, due to a shortage of non-commissioned officers within Defence, it will not be possible to_
_transfer this specific population to this directorate._
_130 Today, civilians within Defence are mainly civil servants covered by personnel regulations, besides a limited number of_
_contracted personnel (figures of February 2016). The civil servants covered by personnel regulations represent 1,233 FTE out of_
_the total of 1,531 FTE civilian personnel._

deployment will be part of the Military Intelligence Service, the cyber capability and the
influence capability.


_The cyber capability of Defence will be reinforced by recruiting additional civilian cyber specialists._

Within the supporting services of Defence, civilian expertise in Defence research institutions
(chiefly the Defence Laboratories and the Royal Military Academy) will remain and will
even increasingly be necessary for the development of a reinforced R&T policy (see
chapter 6). Civilian researchers within Defence will also maintain a leading role in the more
specialised education at the Royal Military Academy in the future.
Additionally, the civilian personnel of Defence will remain involved in specialised logistic
and technical support on the national territory.
The Defence Staff will further appeal to their expertise, mainly in the legal, budgetary and
human resources fields. Currently, a large number of civilian jobs within Defence belong to
the legal service. The growing juridification of society, the legal aspects of the development
and the acquisition of planned capabilities as well as the importance of conducting military
operations correctly within a complex legal framework imply that Defence will need to have
permanent access to the necessary specialised expertise in the legal field.


A legal framework will be established for a possible operational deployment of civilian
personnel such as legal advisors, based on the personnel regulations governing the Reserve.

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

Civilian jobs that help to reinforce the continuity within the organisation will also be
maintained. These will involve the control of Defence’s sourcing activities and support the
management services within the Defence Staff.

This expected evolution of civilian personnel within Defence will involve both a large relative
increase of highly qualified personnel within the organisation (level A) and a significant
decrease of civilian jobs for which no diploma or certificate is required (level D).

**c. A Younger Defence**

An important goal of principle no. 9 is the rejuvenation of Defence. According to the model
behind the table of the military and civilian recruitment figures, the current average age of
military personnel of 40.6 years will lower down to 34.1 years by 2030. Due to limitations
in recruitment, this decrease of the average age will be limited to 40.2 years until 2020, and
will then drop to 35.8 years during the period 2020-2025. The wave of retirements will be at
maximum height during this period.
However, the evolution of the average age in accordance with the current model will be
affected by additional initiatives aimed at abandoning Lifetime Employment as much as
possible and the possible evolution of the retirement age. These initiatives will be examined
in the short term.

**d. Invest Maximum Effort in Internal Recruitment**

Maximising the use of the BDL
personnel regulations will be **Promoting internal recruitment**
combined with a maximum effort

###### contributes to increasing

to make use of internal recruitment.

###### Defence’s attractiveness as an employer.

This offers more growth
opportunities in the careers of the
personnel. By internal recruitment, we mean the promotion to a higher personnel category
or to a higher salary scale within the same category. Within Defence, internal recruitment
is called “social promotion”. Social promotion may or may not be subjected to obtaining
an additional diploma. The assessment system will be adjusted in order to better evaluate
the potential of the personnel concerned and assist them for their growth opportunities
throughout their career.
Promoting internal recruitment contributes to increasing Defence’s attractiveness as an
employer. Furthermore, education/training attrition (see next chapter) is reduced to a
minimum in case of social promotion as the candidates are familiar with the organisational
culture and can rely on previously acquired skills.

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

**e. The Need to Further Reduce Attrition**

By attrition, we mean the accumulated departures of members of personnel before
the retirement age or before the end of the BDL period. Attrition within Defence
includes both education/training attrition (departure of personnel during the
education/training or application period (3 years on average)) and career attrition.
The table which contains the expected military and civilian recruitment figures takes
into consideration the attrition of the last few years. Education/training attrition
averages 50%, all military categories taken into account. Career attrition however only
represents 2%.
It is important to note that reduction of especially education/training attrition will
remain essential in the coming years to achieve the targeted medium-term personnel
envelope of 25,000 FTE.


In this context, it will be indispensable once more to take a close look at the information
given to candidates interested in starting a career within Defence, the candidates’
screening and selection as well as their education and training. Persons enlisting at
Defence need to have real perspectives of rapid operational deployment, supported by
an optimal operational preparation.


_By means of familiarisation days 16-to-26-year-old are brought in contact with the daily tasks and environment of the_
_military personnel in order to familiarise themselves with the different professions within Defence._

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

As mentioned above, strengthening internal recruitment efforts will also affect the
reduction of attrition.

Despite some local successes, the different initiatives taken to minimise attrition in
the past few years have not succeeded in reducing the flow of departures in general.
Additional (innovative) initiatives will therefore be taken.
More attention will be paid to the use of the appropriate communication channels
(including social media) in order to reach the appropriate target groups for the
recruitment of Defence. These channels need to provide applicants with realistic and
understandable information about Defence. Defence should act even more proactively
towards potential applicants. From a general point of view, Defence has to become a
more dynamic player on the labour market. Part of this could be achieved by taking
initiatives aimed at more flexible methods of payment for bottleneck professions within
Defence.
The selection procedure will place more emphasis on the practical skills acquired.
In the short term, new projects will be launched for the positions within Defence where
education/training attrition is traditionally quite high. In 2016 and 2017, the traditional
job days will be replaced by “familiarisation days”. Applicants will be offered the
opportunity to familiarise themselves with the realities of the unit, and will be assessed
based on their potential and their suitability for a specific profession.
Concerning basic education and training, initiatives have been set up recently to further
improve the progressiveness of the programme. Additional investments will also be
made to improve instructors’ education/training and the support in medical and sports
coaching.

**f. Assessment of Education/Training and Personnel Regulations**

Principle no. 9 requires an assessment of education/training and personnel regulations
aimed at their possible reform within the framework of a further increase of the flexibility
of the personnel policy.
An assessment/study of the education and training policy will be carried out in 2016.
Where appropriate, more flexibility will be introduced. Within this framework and if
feasible, an acceleration of the flow of recruits to the units will be strived for.

The current, recently implemented, personnel regulations for the military personnel
still offer many possibilities to achieve a more flexible personnel policy. These existing
opportunities will first be further analysed and applied to a maximum. If afterwards
flexibility still needs to be improved, the existing personnel regulations will be adjusted.
For example, the age requirements for recruitment could be made more flexible for (the
mostly technical) bottleneck professions within Defence.
As mentioned above, opportunities to further optimise the BDL regulations will be
examined.

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

Furthermore, the assessment system will be reviewed in order to improve competence
management with a focus on better identifying growth opportunities for the career of
the personnel.
The necessity of additional transition options between the military and the civilian personnel
regulations will be further examined.


**g. A Modern Reserve**

Chapter 5 indicated that in addition to the current focus on a mainly specialised
Reserve[131] in support of deployment for the core tasks, it will also be examined if the
non-specialised Reserve could be revaluated for the execution of specific surveillance
missions in case of an increased level of threat and for deployments in the event of
national crises or disasters (reserve companies).


Chapter 5 furthermore mentions other additional possibilities to reinforce the specialised
Reserve for the following capabilities: cyber, influence and military construction.
The increased use of civilian service providers (as a result of the sourcing policy) is also
expected to attract specific profiles for the specialised Reserve (such as technicians,

_On 14 November 2015, the associations of reservists organised a colloquium with international speakers to gather_
_ideas for the modernisation of the Reserve in our country._


_131 This is, for example, of particular importance for the medical support._

within Defence while having sufficient
training opportunities. Employers
have to receive adequate information regarding the added value of the military duties of
their employees for their civilian job. It is also necessary to examine which additional
compensation measures could be taken in order to strengthen the win-win with regard
to the Reserve, both for Defence and the employers.
A young and dynamic Reserve must equally strengthen the relations of Defence with the
population and with the enterprises.


The introduction of the BDL personnel regulations also creates possibilities for assigning
reservist jobs to personnel reintegrating civilian life and wishing to maintain relations
with Defence.

All these elements will be part of a study on a modern Reserve. The representatives of
the associations of reservists will be involved as much as possible in the conception of
this modern Reserve.

**h. Pensions**

An independent committee of experts (the National Pension Committee) is currently
examining the future evolution of the pension build-up and the retirement age,
especially for arduous occupations (thus possibly also some military positions). A list of
such arduous occupations should be drawn up in the course of 2016. Subsequently, the
Government will adopt a general point of view in this matter and then it will be possible
to determine the consequences for the different positions within Defence.
Defence will start the adjustment of the military retirement age after the advice of the
National Pension Committee. If the retirement age will be increased before 2025 this
will affect the rejuvenation of Defence, and thus also the necessity and implementation
of further sourcing.

The generalised use of the BDL personnel regulations will reduce the number of Defence
personnel retiring in the capacity of servicemen and within the Defence organisation.
This situation however is still decades away from reality. If Defence wants to strengthen
its position in society, the current retirement age should converge to a socially acceptable

T h e S t r a t e g i c V i s i o n f o r D e f e n c e – 2 9 J u n e 2 0 1 6


-----

age. Defence will have to come up with solutions to provide older employees with
’workable work’.

It will be examined to what extent it is advisable for servicemen to extend their careers
on a voluntary basis.

**i. The Essential Role of the Social Partners**

Acting as the representatives of the members of personnel and in view of their expertise,
the social partners need to be involved to a maximum extent in any further development
of the flexibility of the personnel policy, as well as in the process of modernising the
personnel regulations for the Reserve and in a socially responsible convergence of the
pensions.
The current dialogue with the social partners, which is constructive and greatly
appreciated, will therefore be carried on in the same way.

### Next Steps

The vision and the perspective are clear. The foundations are present. The work can start.

It is crucial to apply the lines of action of this vision as quickly as possible in order to secure its
effective implementation by 2030 and, with regard to rationalisation, to start several projects in
the very short term.
Following this strategic vision, an implementation plan for the geographical distribution of the
quarters for the duration of the strategic vision will be submitted to the Council of Ministers.
This implementation plan will set a precise timetable for the adjustments to the geographical
distribution of Defence. The purpose is to quickly and clearly inform the personnel concerned
about their future. It is important that trade unions, unit commanders, unit warrant officers
and unit corporals, as representatives of the personnel concerned, think along about the
implementation of those changes. They are the ones who know their personnel best. They
are also the ones who will be in charge of the actual implementation and guidance of those
adjustments.

The development of the future capability portfolio of Belgian Defence will also require additional
interactions with the EU and NATO for contributions to projects at a European level, as well as
with our strategic partner countries. This may possibly affect the final content of the capability
planning of our Defence, the aim being to align it as much as possible with our partner countries’.
The spread in time of the investments in major equipment for this vision will be laid down in a
military programme Act for the period until the end of 2030. This act will ensure the necessary
stability and predictability for the realisation of the capability portfolio. A bill will be proposed
to the Council of Ministers about four months after the strategic vision. Imposing a tight
schedule demonstrates the will to anchor the vision of the future described in this plan as much
as possible. This anchoring is essential in order to continue positioning Defence as a credible ally
within NATO and the EU and to be a reliable partner of the industry and research institutions.
But more importantly, as Defence this is necessary in order to stay a reliable pillar for Belgian
and European security.

###### “A military programme Act which will include the investments in major equipment of Belgian Defence for the duration of the strategic vision, will help generate stability and predictability for the effective realisation of a credible Belgian Defence by 2030 towards society, our allies and the business world.” (principle no. 7)


Thereafter, each specific file resulting from these plans will be submitted to the Council of Ministers.
Of course, interaction will not be limited to the Council of Ministers. The implementation of this
strategic vision will require a constant interaction between the government and the Minister of
Defence, between the Minister and Parliament and between the Minister and the Defence staff.
Defence will have to support continuous efforts in the field of communication and outreach
in order to ensure a good interaction with the public opinion in general, and with the press,
the political world and opinion leaders in particular, on the role of Defence and the necessary
evolutions the defence organisation is going through for this purpose. Society should be well
informed of the value of Belgian Defence and feel concerned with this policy domain in order to
(keep on) support(ing) the necessary recapitalisation of Defence.

###### Society should be well informed of the value of Belgian Defence and feel concerned with this policy domain in order to (keep on) support(ing) the necessary recapitalisation of Defence.

The involvement of the entire government in the implementation of the strategic vision will be
ensured by informing the working group for policy coordination “Future of Defence” at least
every two months of all implementation projects. A commonly agreed dashboard will ensure
follow-up. It will clearly show the political decisions to be taken for each project with the related
timetable.

The main ‘next step’ will be to convert this strategic vision at all levels into projects that will bring
more security, more liberty, more well-being and more prosperity to all our fellow countrymen
and women. At the same time, those projects should contribute to creating more Europe to
strengthen security in and around Europe and worldwide.

**Annex A: The Major Principles of the Strategic Vision for Belgian Defence**

§ principle no. 1§ : The **core tasks of Belgian Defence are collective defence, collective**
**security and the** **protection of Belgian citizens all over the world. Defence can also**
always be deployed by the government within the framework of national and international
missions according to the capabilities available;

§ principle no. 2§ : **the multilateral anchoring of Belgian Defence that generates security**
**based on solidarity, has also to be supported by Belgium with budgetary means;**

§ principle no. 3§ : for the duration of the strategic vision (2016-2030), we will strive towards a
**better balance within Belgian Defence, i.e.**

**• principle no. 3a:** **capabilities allowing an appropriate completion of the core tasks;**

**• principle no. 3b: a balance among the four capability dimensions (intelligence-**
cyber-influence, land, air, maritime), with **at least always one credible and**
**sustainably deployable combat capability per dimension. The** **risk sharing**
aspect is essential to an output based on solidarity and requires a sufficiently
**broad national toolbox with sufficient combat capacity in each dimension.**
This toolbox **assures the Belgian government of a lasting influence and**
**impact on international security. It makes Belgium a credible partner at**
international level. In order to generate this solidarity-based output within
a multilateral framework and in support of the national interests, an equally
solidarity-based input by means of a defence effort based on solidarity is of the
utmost importance;

**• principle no. 3c: a** **stronger emphasis on the** **strategic support capabilities**
(strategic enablers) that are indispensable to support our own combat capabilities
and that often result in a better approach to remedy the European capability gaps.
These strategic enablers can be acquired at national level or through a participation
in an international cooperation;

**• principle no. 3d: a cost structure for Defence with a strong** **decrease in the**
proportion of personnel-related costs within the Belgian defence effort;

**• principle no. 3e: a** **stronger emphasis on the** **non-kinetic and civil-military**

**Annex B: Preamble by the Government for the Strategic Vision**

Defence is an essential mission of the public authority. Investing in Defence both today and
in the future is investing in the security of our society, and in the freedom, well-being and
prosperity of all citizens.

As stated in the Government agreement, this government gives Defence back the means to
execute its tasks properly. During the last three decades Defence has continuously contributed
to the rehabilitation of our public finances by reducing the defence budget. The strategic vision
that follows gives new breathing space to Defence in order to ensure our population that the
armed forces will be able to contribute significantly to the security of our society in the years
and decades to come.

Deployments of our Defence usually take place in cooperation with other countries within the
multilateral framework of NATO, EU and UN. Our Euro-Atlantic partners expect us to make
a solidary contribution to the NATO and EU efforts to maintain peace and security in Europe.
In addition, we also have to be a solidary partner for the (civil-)military engagements of EU,
NATO and UN, which safeguard our security and our common interests by promoting peace
and stability at the borders of Europe and in the world.

That is why we as a government give a positive answer to the request of our partners to stabilise
our defence effort (defence budget and pensions) in the short term, and why we foresee an
increase in our defence effort by 2030. This effort will be situated between the current average
of the European NATO member states without the nuclear powers and the general average of
the European NATO member states. After all, a continued solidary multilateral burden and risk
sharing is only possible when we invest sufficiently in our Defence. Our country occupies an
important position within NATO and EU, as host country of their main institutions, among other
things. We want to consolidate this position by making a contribution for defence capabilities at
an appropriate level. A sufficient international operational burden sharing for Defence reinforces
the credibility of our international policy, and contributes to the safeguarding of our worldwide
interests.

With this strategic vision the government provides proper direction for the long term, which
allows Defence to respond to the security challenges of tomorrow. Our security environment is
constantly evolving and thus uncertain. It is the will of the government to maintain a broadly
deployable national Defence, since this offers the best possible flexibility to deal with these
security challenges. This will only be practically possible when we organise our Defence even
more structurally together with our closest partners. This is also a contribution to a more
European defence, which is necessary to be able to continue to safeguard the European security
and interests in a more multipolar world. This government makes a strong commitment to a
more European defence by a bottom-up European anchoring of the capabilities of our Defence.

This strategic long-term vision is necessary because of Defence’s intergenerational nature. This
government has to take decisions on investments in defence equipment that will only effectively
be used by our servicemen within several years from now.
In accordance with the guidelines of the restricted cabinet of 22 December 2015 several important
investment projects will be launched in the short term, such as the future fighter planes, the
frigates, the mine countermeasures vessels, the drones, and the combat vehicles for the land
forces. The investments in the equipment of Defence require a broad political consensus, for as a
government we are aware of the significant efforts these investments demand. The government
needs to make a clear and transparent commitment in order to be able to inform our population,
our partners, and the industry in the best way possible.

This government also provides the appropriate guidelines for the future of the personnel and
the functioning of Defence. Despite the fact that half of our servicemen will go into retirement
in the next 10 years, our operational commitment needs to remain at the appropriate level.
An important additional recruitment effort will ensure that Defence maintains 25,000 fulltime equivalents (consisting of about 24,000 military and 1,000 civilian staff members). Our
personnel policy will aim at young people and technological profiles to a maximum extent.
Defence will use civilian services through sourcing as much as possible, allowing the servicemen
to focus on the operational commitments, insofar as this results in a cost reduction. Sufficient
operating resources will be provided to make an appropriate operational level of ambition and
operational preparation possible. In the next 15 years Defence will rationalise and modernise
fundamentally, in terms of processes as well as structures. In this respect, efficiency and focus
on the key tasks are guiding principles.

In brief, this strategic vision sets the course for an evolution towards a structurally sound Defence
with the proper balance between investments, and personnel and operating expenses.

Taking into account the above-mentioned intergenerational nature this government will not
be able to bear all the efforts to get Defence on track for the future. The next governments will
also need to continue to support the progressive development of a balanced Defence based on
multilateral solidarity with a European anchoring.
Nevertheless, as a government we already take our responsibility to put Defence on the right
track. In addition to the decisions for future investments (2020-2030) 200 million euros will be
reserved during this term to invest in equipment in the short term. These funds are necessary
to start resolving the shortages in individual equipment and combat vehicles for the land forces,
to continue to ensure the operational readiness of our fighter planes, and to design the future of
our frigates. The first major sourcing initiatives will also be launched in the short term, in order
to make the transition to a Defence of 25,000 full-time equivalents feasible without having to
compromise on operational capability. During the remaining three years of this term Defence
will also recruit a sufficient number of young and technically skilled personnel.

This strategic long-term vision indicates the general direction for Defence until 2030. During
this term and the ones to come this document will be translated into separate implementation

projects that should be the building blocks for the Defence of the future. It is up to this government
to point the way ahead, and up to future governments to adjust this vision in order to provide
the best possible response to the security challenges of the future.

As a government, we are in any case convinced that this vision and the initial impetus that
we can give during this term are a positive turning point for our Defence. They open up a
new perspective on growth for a Defence that safeguards our security, freedom, well-being and
prosperity on all fronts today, and they will make it possible for Defence to continue to execute
its tasks in the future.
