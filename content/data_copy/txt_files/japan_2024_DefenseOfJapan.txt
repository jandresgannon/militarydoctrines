On the Publication of "Defense of Japan 2024"

KIHARA Minoru
Minister of Defense

The international community has entered a new era of crisis. It is now facing its greatest trial since
the end of World War II. The existing order is being seriously challenged. Japan finds itself in the
most severe and complex security environment of the post-war era.

China has been rapidly building up military capabilities while intensifying its activities in the
East China Sea, where the waters surrounding the Senkaku Islands are, as well as in the Pacific.
North Korea has been advancing its nuclear and missile development and pushing ahead with the
launch of ballistic missiles and others. Russia has been conducting intensive military activities in
the Far East encompassing the Northern Territories, while continuing its aggression against
Ukraine. Russia has also been observed engaging in joint activities with China involving aircraft
and vessels.

Amidst the most severe and complex security environment since the end of World War II, the
Ministry of Defense (MOD) and the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) are committed to protecting the
lives and peaceful livelihoods of Japanese people and defending Japan's territorial land, waters and
airspace to the end. In fulfillment of these missions, the MOD/SDF will drive the implementation
of policies expressed in the National Security Strategy of Japan, the National Defense Strategy, and
the Defense Buildup Program.

These policies consist of three major objectives. The first one is to steadily actualize a
fundamental reinforcement of defense capabilities of Japan. Building future core defense
capabilities such as stand-off and IAMD (Integrated Air and Missile Defense) must be prioritized.
Therefore, Japan is going to acquire various types of stand-off missiles earlier than originally
planned, including Tomahawk missiles and the ground-launched version of upgraded Type-12
surface-to-ship missiles. Japan will expedite the start of the construction of Aegis System Equipped
Vessels to defend herself from increasingly sophisticated ballistic missiles and other threats.
Enhancing sustainability and resiliency is another important task. Japan will thus proceed to
improve the operational availability of equipment, secure sufficient ammunition and guided
missiles, and promote focused investments to improve the resiliency of defense facilities.

The second major objective is to cooperate with our ally, like-minded countries, and other partners.
No country can now protect her own security alone. As challenges to the existing international order
continue, it is critical for Japan to deepen cooperation and collaboration with our ally, like-minded
countries, and other partners with whom Japan shares universal values and strategic interests.

The Alliance with the United States is the cornerstone of our national security policy. Japan will
steadily implement concrete measures to enhance the deterrence and response capabilities of the
Japan-U.S. Alliance.

At the same time, it is important for Japan to enhance cooperation with like-minded countries and
other partners to ensure peace and stability of the region. Japan will implement measures which
contribute to realizing the "Free and Open Indo-Pacific". To this end, Japan will proactively promote
multilateral and multilayered defense cooperation and exchanges, such as bilateral/multilateral
exercises and defense equipment and technology cooperation, taking into account characteristics and
other factors of the region and each country. Such cooperation is represented by the joint development
of next-generation fighter aircraft. This joint development aims to enhance the performance of fighters,
which constitutes the core defense capability of Japan. It will serve to the world a basis of security,
stability, and prosperity over the coming decades.

There has also been progress in multilateral cooperation centering on Japan and the United States.
Last December, Japan, the United States and the Republic of Korea began the operation of the realtime sharing of missile warning data on North Korea. Around that time, the Australian Defence Force
participated for the first time in two Japan-U.S. bilateral command post exercises: "Keen Edge" and
"Yama Sakura." Japan will promote such cooperation.

The third major objective is to reinforce our human resource base, which is an urgent one. As Japan
is in a midst of serious labor shortages, there is an increasingly fierce competition to secure human
resources. SDF personnel constitutes the core element of defense capabilities of Japan. To procure
excellent human resources in the competitive recruiting environment, we will take all necessary
measures to reinforce our human resource base without ruling out any options. These consist of the
enhancement of SDF recruitment capabilities, the effective use of human resources, the improvement
of living and working environments, and the reformation of remuneration systems.

Harassment has no place in the MOD/SDF, as an organization where people matter. Recognizing
that harassment damages the mutual trust among SDF personnel and shakes the very foundation of the
entire organization, we will continue to create a working environment of zero tolerance for harassment
of any kind by implementing effective harassment prevention measures.

"Defense of Japan 2024" describes the security environment surrounding Japan and the efforts of
the MOD/SDF as have been outlined above. In particular, we took care to comprehensively explain
our progress towards the fundamental reinforcement of defense capabilities of Japan; or in other
words, how Japan's defense and deterrence capabilities have been taking stable steps towards
reinforcement. The year 2024 marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the SDF, and
''Defense of Japan 2024'' is the 50th commemorative issue of Japan Defense White Paper. The opening
pages touch upon the 70-year history of the SDF as a special feature article.

Efforts of the MOD/SDF, including the fundamental reinforcement of defense capabilities, would
not be made possible without the understanding and support by the Japanese people and countries
around the world. I hope this white paper will help as many readers as possible to facilitate a better
comprehension of the security environment surrounding Japan and the efforts made by the MOD/SDF.

**The Concept of the Drawing on the Front Cover ~ Swordsmith ~**

Since its establishment, the MOD/SDF has been working very hard to forge its “sword” to avoid having to draw it. By forging

the “sword,” i.e., deterrence, the MOD/SDF has been deterring a military invasion of Japan. Commemorating the 70th anniversary

of the SDF’s establishment, the drawing represents steady progress in bolstering deterrence capabilities and the determination of

the MOD/ SDF to make continuous efforts, under the National Security Strategy of Japan and other security documents.



-  The Defense of Japan white paper was first published in 1970, and has been published annually since 1976. The purpose of

publishing this paper is to make the current status, issues and initiatives of Japan’s defense common knowledge for as many people

as possible, as simply as possible.

-  This edition of Defense of Japan covers the defense and security environment of Japan and the initiatives of the Ministry of Defense

(MOD) and the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) during the one-year period from April 2023 to March 2024. However, certain important

events that took place in April 2024 and beyond are also described.

-  Maps in this paper may contain omissions depending on the design and layout and may not necessarily show the entire Japanese

territory.

-  To facilitate access to the latest information even after this White Paper is published, QR codes have been included to link readers to

the relevant pages on the MOD website (created based on URLs as of June 2024). Previous editions of Defense of Japan, including

this edition, can be viewed on the MOD website, so please feel free to make use of it.

-  The photo on the back cover shows uniformed SDF personnel saluting KIMURA Tokutaro, the first Director General of the Defense

Agency, in the ceremony marking the agency’s establishment.

**as described in the Defense White Papers**
**70 Years of the SDF**

The Ministry of Defense (MOD), formerly the Defense Agency (DA), and the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) was established on July 1, 1954, and

marks its 70th anniversary in 2024.

“Defense of Japan 2024” is the 50th issue of Japan’s Defense White Paper since the first edition was published in 1970.

This feature shows a 70-year history of the MOD/SDF—which has worked in step with the public—as described in the past 50 defense white papers.

Note: The coverage of events that happened before the first defense white paper was published is based on descriptions in successive white papers up to the 2024 Defense White Paper, with a

special focus on features and other articles in the 1994 Defense White Paper (the 40th anniversary of the SDF) and the 2004 Defense White Paper (the 50th anniversary of the SDF).

I am the commander of an infantry company of the Yaeyama Area Security Force at Camp
Ishigaki, which was established in March 2023 in Okinawa Prefecture.
Ishigaki Island is the center of the Yaeyama Islands located some 400 kilometers from
Naha. Along with Miyako Island and Yonaguni
Island, Ishigaki Island is the hub of the
defense of remote islands, making us feel the
increasingly severe security environment on
the front line. For this reason, a surface-to-
air guided missile unit and a surface-to-ship
guided missile unit are also stationed at Camp
Ishigaki. The Yaeyama Area Security Force

**Achieving my original aspiration** The Great East Japan Earthquake was a major incident to learn about the existence of the SDF.

At that time, I was in 5th grade at elementary school, and when I saw SDF personnel rescuing
residents in disaster-stricken areas and helping them with outdoor cooking and bathing at
evacuation sites, I thought they were cool, and I wanted to
be someone who was needed like they were. That is why
I joined the National Defense Academy.
Currently, I make training plans for maneuvers,
shooting, winter combat skills, etc. to fulfill my duties
in national defense as a tank platoon leader, and I work

I joined the MSDF because I wanted to serve people and the nation through my work, and my grandfather, whom I admire, had been a member of the MSDF.
Currently, I belong to the 1st Maintenance and Supply Squadron at Kanoya Air Base.My main job includes loading and unloading electronic equipment on P-1

Electronic equipment is essential for the activities of patrol aircraft, and the success of
missions greatly depends on the condition of the
equipment. So I pay close attention to the wiring,
etc. when performing maintenance, and I always
check the maintenance records.
Therefore, when I see aircraft return home without

Security Environment

**Part**
###### Ⅰ Surrounding Japan

**Overview** **Chapter 1**

International Community Facing Its Greatest Trial Since WWII

⿟[States that do not share universal values or political and economic systems based ]
on such values are expanding their influence. Unilateral changes to the status quo by
force and such attempts represent a serious challenge to the existing international
order. The international community is facing its greatest trial since World War II and
entering a new era of crisis. The global balance of power is shifting dramatically and
competition among states continues, especially between the United States and China,
and is set to intensify even further in future.

⿟[Rapid developments in science and technology are fundamentally changing the ]
paradigm of security. Countries are striving to develop innovative technologies that
can become so-called game changers. The traditional military structure is undergoing
fundamental changes, as are warfare tactics and strategies.

⿟[Risks in cyberspace and other domains are becoming more serious and other security-related ]
global issues such as information warfare and climate change are emerging.

⿟[Gray zone situations involving territorial disputes are constantly occurring. The use of ]
hybrid military and non-military warfare will become even more sophisticated.

Increasingly Severe Security Situation in the Indo-Pacific Region Security Environment Surrounding Japan

⿟[These global security environment and challenges are particularly prominent in the Indo-Pacific region, where Japan is located, and are likely to ]
intensify still further in future.

⿟[Japan is facing the most severe and complex security environment since the end of World War II. It cannot be ruled out that a serious situation similar ]
to Russia's aggression against Ukraine may occur in the Indo-Pacific region in future, particularly in East Asia.

**Russia's Aggression and Defense by Ukraine** **Chapter 2**

⿟[Russia's aggression against Ukraine undermines the sovereignty and territorial integrity ]
of Ukraine. It is a serious violation of international law prohibiting the use of force and
of the United Nations (UN) Charter. Such unilateral changes to the status quo by force
have shaken the very foundation of the international order, including in Asia.

⿟[This situation, in which a permanent member of the Security Council, which is sup-]
posed to take primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security,
openly engages in military actions challenging international law and the international
order, claims innocent lives and repeatedly uses language and actions that can be
interpreted as threats involving nuclear weapons, is unprecedented. If such aggression
is tolerated, it could send out the wrong message and implication that unilateral
changes to the status quo by force are also acceptable elsewhere. Accordingly, the
international community, including Japan, should never tolerate Russia’s action.

⿟[In addition to Ukraine's strong resistance, the international community has united to ]
implement strong sanctions and ongoing support for Ukraine, leaving Russia with no Damage in Kharkiv, Ukraine (January 2024) [AFP/Jiji Press]
choice but to pay a heavy price. As an ally of the United States ― a NATO member ―
and is located on the opposite side of Europe across the Eurasian continent, Japan
must closely monitor future changes in the European situation, including their strategic impact, acknowledging that the security of Europe and the
Indo-Pacific is inseparable.

The United States - Prioritizing its Response to China’s Challenges with the Superiority of Alliances and Partnerships

⿟[The National Security Strategy and the National Defense Strategy released by the ]
United States in October 2022 positioned China as a “pacing challenge,” Russia as
an “acute threat,” and North Korea as a “persistent threat.”

⿟[China is posing the most serious challenge and strategic competition to the United ]
States, which is prioritizing efforts to address the relevant issues.

⿟[The United States recognizes that it cannot address complex and interconnected ]
challenges alone and that mutually beneficial alliances and partnerships must
underpin its national defense strategy.

⿟[In the Indo-Pacific region, the United States is committed to deepening its partnership ]
with allies, including Japan, and promoting a Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP)
through multilateral frameworks such as QUAD and AUKUS.

⿟[The United States is demonstrating its commitment to a FOIP through ongoing ]
“Freedom of Navigation Operations” in the South China Sea and allowing U.S. Navy
vessels to traverse the Taiwan Strait.

Quad Leaders’ Summit (May 2023) [Website of the Prime Minister's Office to Japan]

China - Intensifying Unilateral Changes to the Status Quo by Force and Such Attemps

⿟[China's external posture, military activities, and other activities are a matter of serious concern for Japan and the international community and present an ]
unprecedented and the greatest strategic challenge which Japan should respond with its
comprehensive national power and in cooperation and collaboration with its ally, like-minded
countries and others.

⿟[For more than 30 years, China has sustained high-level growth of its defense budget without ]
transparency, engaging in broad, and rapid improvement of its military power in qualitative
and quantitative terms with focus on nuclear, missile, naval and air forces. China will
probably have over 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030 and will continue growing its force to
2035. It has increased its production of surface combatants and submarines and built its
second indigenous aircraft carrier, Fujian. It continues to develop and deploy modern fighter
jets and wide-ranging UAVs.

⿟[China has been intensifying its activities across the entire region surrounding Japan, including ]
in the East China Sea, particularly in the area around the Senkaku Islands, the Sea of Japan,

Xi Jinping, currently in his third term as general secretary [EPA - Jiji Press]

and the western Pacific Ocean, extending beyond the so-called the first island chain to the
second island chain.

⿟[China has intensified its military activities around Taiwan. China conducted military exercises in the ]
sea and airspace in several times. It is believed that through the series of activities, China seeks to
create a fait accompli where the PLA is operating, and improve its actual combat capabilities.

⿟[China has intensified its activities in the South China Sea based on assertions, which are ]
conflicting with existing orders of the seas, and promoting the establishment of military
bases. Such actions to further promote unilateral change of the status quo by force and
turning it into a fait accompli are serious concerns to Japan. Issues surrounding the South
China Sea are directly connected to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and
represent a legitimate concern, not only for Japan, which has major sea lanes in the South
China Sea, but also for the entire international community. The third PLA aircraft carrier “Fujian,” which is China’s second indigenous one [China News Service/Jiji Press Photo]

⿟[China is further strengthening cooperation with Russia, including in military activities. It has also conducted joint bomber flights and naval navigations ]
with Russia in the vicinity of Japan. These repeated joint activities are clearly intended for demonstration of force against Japan and are a grave
concern from the perspective of the national security of Japan.

U.S.-China Strategic Competition Escalates; Tension Grows in Taiwan

⿟[The political, economic, and military competition between the United States and China has ]
become even more evident in recent years due to various concerns such as changes in the
balance of power caused by China's growing national power and various pending issues.

⿟[The overall military balance between China and Taiwan is rapidly tilting in China’s favor.]
⿟[Regarding Taiwan, China firmly maintains the principle that Taiwan is part of China and that ]
the Taiwan issue is its internal affair. China has repeatedly stated that it has not renounced
the use of force. In response to the strengthening US-Taiwan relationship, China has further
intensified its military activities around Taiwan.

⿟[North Korea's military activities are posing an even more grave and imminent threat to Japan's ]
security than ever before. They seriously undermine the peace and security of the region and
the international community. They also represent a serious challenge to the entire international
community with regard to non-proliferation of weapons including WMDs.

⿟[North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests in the past and possesses the techno-]
logical capability to mount a nuclear warhead on its ballistic missiles with their range
covering the Japanese Archipelago and to strike Japan.

⿟[In recent years, North Korea has continuously pursued missile development at an ]
extremely rapid pace, launching ballistic missiles that fly with irregular trajectories as
well as so-called "hypersonic missiles.” North Korea is also pursuing operationaliza-
tion of long-range cruise missiles designed to carry a tactical nuclear warhead.

⿟[Since 2023, North Korea has conducted launches of the “Hwasong-18”, a solid-fuel ]
propelled intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)-class as well as launches using
ballistic missile technology for the purpose of a satellite launch. North Korea is focusing
on qualitatively improving its nuclear and missile capabilities, such as diversifying its
equipment systems and acquiring intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR)

of Japan and its surrounding areas, showing its tendency to deploy the
latest military equipment in the Far East. Russia's military activities in the
Indo-Pacific region, including Japan, coupled with its strategic partnership
with China, are posing a strong security concern.

⿟[Russia has been developing and deploying various new weapons under its ]
“strong state” model. Since the start of its aggression against Ukraine, it has
also been moving to increase troop numbers and expand and reorganize its
military units.

⿟[Russia is continuing active military activities in the Northern Territories, ]
which are inherent territories of Japan, under illegal occupation. As well as
the ongoing construction of facilities for its troops in the region, Russia has
deployed new military equipment such as coastal (surface-to-ship) missiles
belonging to its Navy and fighter jets belonging to its aerospace forces. It also
conducts large-scale exercises in the surrounding seas and airspace.

###### Ⅱ Policy

**Basic Concepts of Japan’s Security and Defense** **Chapter 1**

⿟[What we must prioritize first and foremost is developing proactive diplomacy to protect the lives and ]
livelihood of Japanese nationals. On that basis, it is essential to coordinate with like-minded countries
and promote multilateral cooperation through the Japan-U.S. Alliance as a cornerstone.

⿟[At the same time, diplomacy needs to be backed by defense capabilities. As part of its strategic ]
approach, Japan will actively pursue diplomacy under the vision of a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” (FOIP)
and promote the fundamental reinforcement of its defense capabilities, including the possession of
counterstrike capabilities.

⿟[The NSS is Japan's supreme national security policy document. It provides strategic guidance for policies in wide-ranging areas, including not only ]
diplomacy and defense, but also economic security, technology and intelligence.

**(1) Redeployment of troops and territorial expansion**

**in Eastern and Southern Ukraine**

Russian forces, which failed to take control of the capital
Kyiv, on March 25, 2022, announced that previous
military action had been at “the first phase of operation”
and that the primary goal of its operation would shift to
the “liberation” of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in
eastern Ukraine, that is, pursuing expanded territorial
gains in the regions.

It is said that after withdrawing its forces from the

Kyiv area and regrouping, AFRF seized Sievierodonetsk,
the temporary capital city of Luhansk oblast, and its
surroundings from late June to early July 2022.

The AFRF concentrated its forces on seizing the

oblast on the coast of the Sea of Azov. In May 2022,
the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that then
Defense Minister Shoigu had reported to President Putin
that the AFRF completed the operation in Mariupol with
the surrender of Ukrainian units at the AISW.

As a result of the seizure of Mariupol, Russia secured

the whole coast of the Sea of Azov and the land bridge
connecting to the Crimean Peninsula.

resistance to the AFRF along the entire front line as
well as intensified its attacks on Russian positions from
April 2022, which seemed to be prepared for the future
counteroffensive.

The Ukrainian military reportedly sank a Slava
class guided missile cruiser “Moskva,” the flagship of
Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Navy, by a domestically
produced surface-to-ship cruise missile “Neptune” in
May 2022 in southern Ukraine where Russian forces
achieved relatively considerable successes. In June 2022,
General Zaluzhnyi, Commander-in-Chief of the AFU
(then), announced that the AFU had attacked AFRF units
on Zmiinyi (Snake) Island in the Black Sea, occupied in
the early stages of the war and forced them to withdraw
from the island.

These Ukrainian attacks degraded the Russian air

defense network that had been provided by the vessels
of Russian Black Sea Fleet in southern Ukraine, which
made it difficult for Russian Air Forces to conduct
operations in the area, as a result of which made it easier
for Ukraine to launch a counteroffensive in the region.

It can further be seen that the AFU used the M142 High

Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), supplied
by the United States, in action from late June 2022. The
AFU announced an attack on fuel and ammunition depots
in a Russia’s base near Nova Kakhovka, Kherson oblast,
in July 2022 and mentioned starting a counteroffensive
in the south. The Ukrainian military effectively attacked
Russian command posts and logistics bases using a longrange precision strike weapons system such as HIMARS
in the region, and interdicted bridges and other crossing
sites over the Dnieper River. Difficulties in logistics
caused by these attacks decreased fighting capabilities
and morale of Russian troops in the north of the river and
improved conditions for the Ukrainian counteroffensive.

had become vulnerable after the redeployment of its
troops to the south to prepare for the expected Ukrainian
counteroffensive, which led to Ukraine’s successful
counteroffensive in the east.

On the other hand, in the south, as a result of efforts to

cut off and undermine each AFRF unit using the Dnieper
River, the AFU forced Russian troops to withdraw and
successfully regained the northern part of the Dnieper of
Kherson oblast including Kherson, the capital city of the
oblast, in mid-November 2022.

Furthermore, there was some damage caused by

an explosion and destruction of a girder of the bridge
connecting Krasnodar of Russia and the Crimean
Peninsula of Ukraine in October 2022 Russia blames
Ukraine for Crimea bridge blast.

**(2) Russia’s Response**
Russia responded in various ways to Ukraine’s fullfledged counteroffensive, such as with troop buildups
and making its occupation of Ukrainian territory a fait
accompli.

With respect to the buildup of forces, President Putin

signed executive orders related to partial mobilization,
explained the necessity of the actions and asked people
for their support in September 2022. Regarding the
mobilization, then Defense Minister Shoigu said that he
was planning to mobilize some 300,000 reservists.

Regarding Russia’s fait accompli of the occupied

areas in Ukraine, Russia illegally “annexed” four regions
of the occupied areas in the oblasts of Luhansk, Donetsk,
Zaporizhzhia and Kherson on September 30, based on
the results of what they called a “referendum” conducted
in the area from September 23 to 27 to ask the people
whether their territory was to be “annexed” to Russia or
not.

**(1) Full-fledged Ukraine Counteroffensive**
In early September 2022, the Ukrainian military
conducted a successful counteroffensive in Kharkiv
oblast in eastern Ukraine and regained most of the
Russian-occupied area in the oblast. It is probable that
the Ukraine military strived to conceal its plan and
intent for the counteroffensive in the east, unlike the
south where the counteroffensive was conspicuous. It

In addition, AFRF has built multi layered defenses,

including trenches, anti-tank ditches and concrete
anti-tank obstacles known as “Dragon’s Teeth” and
minefields, along the entire contact line in anticipation
of counterattacks by the Ukrainian military. At the same
time, the AFRF intensify bombardments with missiles
and loitering munitions all over Ukraine. It is pointed
out that this was aimed at depleting Ukraine’s air defense
missile reserves, as well as weakening war sustainability
and the fighting spirit of Ukrainian people by damaging
power grids critical for civilian life in cold winter. While
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Human Rights (OHCHR) estimates the number
of noncombatant victims caused by Russian attack in
Ukraine amount to be over 10,000 as of November 2023,
the actual number is possibly much larger as accurate
numbers cannot be determined due to the ongoing
fighting, and the number is likely still increasing now.

**(1) Provision of Western weapons to Ukraine and**

**stagnation of Ukrainian counteroffensive**

While thrown on the defensive in the face of the
offensive on the Bakhmut front by the Russian military
and other forces, the Ukrainian military received various
equipment from Western countries, including main
battle tanks such as the “Leopard 2A6” and “Challenger
2” and air-launched long-range cruise missiles such as
the “Storm Shadow.” It seems to have been preparing
for a counteroffensive by reorganizing its new units and
training its soldiers in Europe.

The Ukrainian military is believed to have launched

a counteroffensive in early June 2023 and sequentially
recaptured multiple villages; centering on the front of
southern Zaporizhzhia oblast. However, the Ukrainian
military is also said to have suffered significant losses
in personnel and equipment as its advance was blocked
by numerous antipersonnel mines and tank mines laid
by Russian forces and anti-tank missiles from attack
helicopters.

The Ukrainian military’s counteroffensive is

reportedly meant to break through the Russian military’s
defensive line in the southern Zaporizhzhia oblast and
advance southward to the Sea of Azov, thereby cutting
off the Russian military’s land logistics route connecting
mainland Russia and the Crimean Peninsula. However,
it appears that the originally envisioned goals have not
been achieved.

The following have been pointed out as the reasons

behind the stagnation of the Ukrainian military’s
counteroffensive: the shortage of firepower such as
howitzers and trench mortars, short-range air defense
systems to protect advancing ground forces from
airborne threats, obstacle-clearing equipment to break
through minefields and trained soldiers in the Ukrainian
military.

In October 2023, the United States provided Ukraine

with the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), a
surface-to-surface ballistic missile system. Ukrainian
forces successfully attacked Russian military airfields
using ATACMS missiles. They also damaged ships
of the Russian Black Sea Fleet using domestically
produced unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and cruise
missiles. However, no major breakthrough was achieved

In January 2023, the Russian military and the private

military company (PMC) “Wagner” intensified their
offensive in the eastern Donetsk oblast. In May 2023,
they seemed to have taken control of Bakhmut, a key
transportation hub in the oblast.

Russia claims to have quadrupled its military

types of equipment, it is anticipated that the expansion of
support from Western countries will become increasingly
crucial for Ukraine’s future.

Russian forces, which had countered the Ukrainian
military’s counteroffensive with well-prepared defensive
positions and ground and air forces, allegedly intensified
their offensive in the Avdiivka and Bakhmut sectors of
Donetsk oblast and the Kupyansk sector of Kharkiv
Oblast from October 2023 onwards and seems to have
seized control of Marinka in Donetsk oblast by the end
of 2023. In February 2024, the Russian Ministry of
Defense announced that it had taken control of Avdiivka.


**5 �Russia’s Attack on Nuclear Power Stations**

**and Nuclear Facilities and the Situation**
**Surrounding Nuclear, Biological and**
**Chemical Weapons**

Russia repeatedly takes dangerous actions around nuclear
facilities in ongoing aggression against Ukraine. Russia
occupied the Chornobyl nuclear power plant near the
Belarusian border in February 2022 and also occupied
the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern
Ukraine in March 2022. In addition, Russia attacked the
Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology (the KIPT),
which has experimental reactors and handles nuclear
substances, multiple times on and after March.

In April 2022, when the Russian military conducted its

first flight test of “Sarmat” the new large intercontinental
ballistic missile (ICBM) in development, President
Putin made a statement showing off his country’s
nuclear force. Furthermore, President Putin repeatedly
mentioned nuclear weapons probably with the intention
of intimidation. For example, he said Russia would
use every possible means to bounce back threats to
the territorial integrity of the nation in his statement to
people to promulgate an executive order about partial
mobilization in September 2022. He was clearly keeping
nuclear weapons in mind in the statement. Other high
officials make similar statements repeatedly as well.

Russia has repeatedly claimed that Ukraine may use

chemical and biological weapons. However, the United
States and the United Kingdom evaluate it as showing
that Russia is preparing for the so-called “false flag
campaign.” In March, 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden
made a statement to the effect that there are certain signs
that President Putin is considering using biological and
chemical weapons in Ukraine. In May 2024, the U.S.
Department of State pointed to a suspicion that Russia
had used chemical weapons.

In addition, since late December 2023, the Russian

military has intensified its missile attacks across
Ukraine, but while the missile attacks in the winter of
2022 targeted power grids, some observers have pointed
out that the targets of the missile attacks in the winter of
2023 are military industries, with an eye on a protracted
war. This trend continues into the spring of 2024, with a
shortage of air defense equipment said to be exacerbating
damage to Ukraine.


**6** **Future Outlook**

While there is no predicting about what may happen in
the future regarding aggression against Ukraine, there
are many indications about the strategy, tactics and
human and material war sustainability of both the AFRF
and the AFU which may impact future developments.

Some difficulties in the chain of command of the

AFRF were indicated from the very early stages. It
has been pointed out that, at the start of aggression, the
AFRF ll t d th h i f d d i d

to each operational front as it is in peacetime and thus
did not have a centralized command chain covering the
entire projected force consisting of mechanized infantry
forces said to be as many as 200,000-strong and missile
units belonging to the Army, Navy, or Air Force, as
well as sea power and air power.[1] In early April 2022, a
Joint Task Force Commander was reportedly appointed
to command all actions of the AFRF. This is seen as a
measure to improve cooperation among services and
theaters. Also, in January 2023, Russia announced that
General Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff of the
AFRF, was named as the Joint Task Force Commander,
aiming to improve cooperation among services, the
quality of logistics support and command efficiency
of the unit. In May 2023, Prigozhin’s private military
company “Wagner” is said to have contributed to the
capture of Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk oblast by
deploying numerous troops. However, subsequent
discord between the military and “Wagner” led to
Prigozhin instigating an “armed rebellion” in June
2023, allowing “Wagner”’ to advance into Russia. At
one point, the “Wagner” offensive reportedly came
within 200 km of Moscow, but the situation was brought
under control through the mediation of the Belarusian
president. In an effort to prevent the recurrence of such
an armed uprising, Russia’s Defense Ministry has been
encouraging former “Wagner” soldiers to sign contracts
with the military. It has also been pointed out that the
Ministry is trying to centralize the chain of command
by managing other private military companies under the

control of the General Staff Office.

The AFU continues fighting until today undauntedly

against the AFRF which has superior quality and larger
numbers. Continuation of fighting is made possible by
several factors such as a number of reservists with combat
experience derived from the eastern front campaign since
2014, significant progress in training non-commissioned
officers who assume leading roles in battle realized with
the reorganization of the Defense Ministry and the AFU
aiming to achieve the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) standard and the introduction of rapid and highly
accurate fire coordination systems based on commercial
off-the-shelf technologies including the command and
control support software “GIS Arta” and the situational
awareness system “Delta.”

For human war sustainability, it is pointed out that

the number of casualties was 190,000 for the AFU as
of August 2023, and 465,000 for the AFRF as of May
2024.[2] In June 2023, President Putin signed a law
allowing prisoners and suspects, excluding felons, to
sign military service contracts. In October the same
year, the military personnel registration regulations
were revised to include a new provision for “special
military personnel registration,” which has facilitated
the enlistment of prisoners without requiring a physical
examination. These measures appear to be aimed at
securing military personnel by creating an environment
for deploying prisoners more quickly in actual combat
operations. Ukraine seems to be facing difficulties in
securing personnel, as President Zelenskyy revealed
that the military is requesting the mobilization of an
additional 500,000 troops in December the same year.
The AFU is supported in education and training for
recruits by Western countries.

It is pointed out that Russia’s war sustainability for

material has been undermined by hindered equipment
acquisition caused by economic sanctions against the
country. Even in this situation, the Russian military
maintains its power by various means such as the
ammunition industry operating around the clock,
diverting missiles not for ground attacks, the acquisition
of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) made in Iran,
taking over tanks from Belarus and the procurement
of artillery shells and missiles from North Korea.
Furthermore, it is pointed out that Russia is capable of

repaired or acquired domestically, it is difficult to carry

the attack range of the AFRF. Therefore, support from
foreign countries is important in the acquisition of
equipment and ammunition as well as in education and
training to change over former Soviet Union equipment
to Western equipment to maintain war sustainability.

The United States also intends to enhance the strength

of the U.S. Armed Forces in Europe. In June 2022,
the United States announced among other measures
the establishment of U.S. Army V Corps permanent
headquarters in Poland, increasing the number of U.S.
destroyers based on Spanish ports, rotation deployment
of U.S. troops in Romania and additional deployment of
an F-35 squadron to the United Kingdom.

**See** Chapter 3, Section 9-2 (Enhancement of Multilateral Security

Frameworks)

**See**

Several nations including NATO member states

provide equipment, training support and the like to
Ukraine depending on the progress of the war. At the
beginning of the war, the donor countries provided
portable anti-tank missiles and man-portable surfaceto-air missiles that seemed to contribute to preventing
front-line expansion by delaying the advancement of
Russian military armored units and reducing the strength
of airborne troops. After the AFU stopped Russia’s fullscale aggression, the countries moved towards providing
large equipment that helps suppress and secure wide areas
in ground fighting, such as tanks, armored vehicles and
howitzers, for the Ukrainian military’s counteroffensive.
In January 2023, each country announced for the first
time the provision of tanks and infantry fighting vehicles
not made by the former Soviet Union, beginning with
the delivery of German tanks to Ukraine by Poland in
February of the same year.

They also came to provide longer-range artillery to

attack enemy bases, following the concentration of
AFRF troops in the eastern Ukraine region.

Furthermore, the handing over of air defense systems

from various countries rapidly progressed as a result
of Russian armed forces commencing missile attacks
targeting all over Ukraine including civil facilities from
October 2022. In April 2023, it was reported that an air
defense system called “Patriot,” capable of coping with
ballistic missiles, was also provided.

Some NATO member states stated that they would

deliver fighter jets made by the former Soviet Union in
March 2023 and the United Kingdom and the Netherlands
stated in May that the two countries would establish an
“international union” for fighter jets acquisition and


flight training. Furthermore, the United States stated
in the G7 Hiroshima summit meeting that it would
support the multilateral initiative for the flight training
of fourth-generation fighter jets including F-16 fighters.
As of early 2024, countries including the Netherlands,
Denmark, Belgium and Norway, have offered to provide
F-16 fighters, with a total of nearly 113 fighters expected
to be delivered to Ukraine.

Among all of this support from various countries,

the contribution of the United States is prominent. The
cumulative security support from the United States to
Ukraine under the Biden administration is USD 51.3
billion, including USD 50.6 billion announced after
the start of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine (as of
May 10, 2024). The United States clearly shows a strong
supporting attitude towards Ukraine providing not
only a variety of equipment in large quantities but also
familiarization training for newly delivered equipment
and boot camp training outside Ukraine. President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the United States in
December 2022, and said support from the United States
is “an investment in global security and democracy” in
his speech to U.S. Congress appealing to the American
people to continue support. President Zelenskyy, who
had also visited the United States in December 2023,
appealed for continued support to Ukraine in a speech at
the U.S. Congress.

The United Kingdom also provided continuous

support to Ukraine through equipment support and
dispatching training instructors with the United States
and other countries from when Russia “annexed”
the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and since the regime
change from the Johnson administration to the Sunak
administration, it has continuously and actively
supported Ukraine by providing a variety of equipment
and conducting boot camp training. In particular, the
United Kingdom took the plunge to announce that it
would provide its main battle tanks in January 2023
ahead of any other country. It also provided air-launched
long-range cruise missiles. In addition, similarly to the
United States, the United Kingdom is actively disclosing
information about the Russian military movement to
counter Russia’s disinformation and contain the action
of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (AFRF)
through announcements by high officials and posting on
social media.

Format, to peacefully resolve the conflict in eastern

Ukraine. In addition, France has announced the delivery
of equipment such as wheeled combat vehicles, missile
air-defense systems and air-launched long-range cruise
missiles to Ukraine.

Germany drastically changed its defense strategy

after Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, announcing
to deliver infantry fighting vehicles and surface-to-air
missile systems and started to deliver its main battle
tanks directly to Ukraine as well as permit the transfer
of German-made main battle tanks from third-party
countries to Ukraine in January 2023. Since then,
Germany has been continuously supplying artillery
shells and air defense missiles.

Canada has been providing training support to the

AFU since 2015. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Canada
has been actively supporting Ukraine, providing military
support of more than CAD 2.4 billion as of January 2024.

The European Union (EU) has also decided to provide

military aid to Ukraine totaling 5.0 billion euros through
the European Peace Facility, an EU fund.

In addition, technical support provided by private

companies to Ukraine is also attracting attention. Satellite
internet services using a small satellite constellation
provided by U.S. companies in response to the request
from the Ukrainian government are used not only as a
means of communication for the Ukrainian people but
also are utilized to operate the Ukrainian military’s
unmanned aircraft. Moreover, it is pointed out that
some European and U.S. IT/security companies have
been supporting Ukraine’s cybersecurity since before
aggression against Ukraine began, and have successfully
reduced and localized damage from Russian cyberattacks.

While players such as NATO member states and other

countries moved towards supporting Ukraine, some
countries are taking their own measures. Türkiye, which
has deep relations with both Russia and Ukraine, shows
consideration for Russia to some extent. Concretely,
Türkiye declares support for Ukraine while basically
not implementing economic sanctions against Russia.
The country also mediates the restarting of exporting
grains from Ukraine. Hungary, which deeply depends
on Russia economically, has shown a more conciliatory
attitude toward Russia than any other NATO member, as
evidenced by its not providing weapons to Ukraine and

A United Nations general meeting resolution that
demands an immediate stop to Russia’s aggression was
adopted by approval of 141 member states, which is over

the other hand, in addition to Russia, some countries
and regions do not sympathize with this movement. For
example, six countries and regions including Belarus
and North Korea were against the resolution and thirtytwo countries including India and China abstained from
voting.

North Korea is showing its stance of standing by

Russia, for example, as it voted against the UN General
Assembly’s resolution calling for the immediate
withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine and claims
that the United States and other Western countries are
to be blamed for the conflict in Ukraine. It was also
revealed that missiles provided by North Korea to Russia
since the end of December 2023 were used against
Ukraine. Japan has strongly condemned the arms supply
from North Korea to Russia, as it could lead to further
deterioration of the situation in Ukraine and also violate
the relevant Security Council resolutions that completely
prohibit the transfer and procurement of arms and related
materials between North Korea and Russia.

While Iran has been increasingly opposed to Western

countries since its secession from the nuclear agreement
with the United States in 2018, it is enhancing its
relationship with Russia, particularly in the economic
and military domains. Iran made an argument for a

Ukraine but showed sympathy for Russia’s standpoint to
the extent of insisting that if Russia had not acted then
NATO would have provoked the war. Then President

2022. The Iranian side stated it would raise its level of
strategic relationship with Russia in various fields and
criticized sanctions against Russia by the United States
and its allies.

The United States announced in July 2022 Iran’s

plan to provide UAVs to Russia and in September
2022, pointed out that Russia was using Iran-made
UAVs for attacks as well as Intelligence, Surveillance
and Reconnaissance (ISR). The Ukrainian military also
announced that Russia conducted attacks in various
points of Ukraine using Iranian UAVs. To this, Iran
claims that the delivery of Iranian UAVs to Russia
was carried out before the aggression against Ukraine
and suggests that their purpose was not for use in war
with Ukraine. William Burns, Director of the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA), pointed out in February 2023
that Russia is considering the possibility of supporting
Iran’s missile plan and providing fighter jets in return
for Iran’s support. In November the same year, Kirby,
Coordinator for Strategic Communications at the U.S.
National Security Council, pointed out that Iran may be
considering providing ballistic missiles to Russia. While
he stated in February 2024 that he had “not been able to
confirm” reports that Iran had provided ballistic missiles
to Russia, the progress of cooperation between the two
countries must be closely observed.

China avoids direct criticism of Russia in respect of

the aggression, requesting “self-restraint and dialogue”
to both Russia and Ukraine and takes a standpoint from
which China will play constructive roles in its own ways
towards a solution to the Ukraine issues. However, China
insists that Russia’s actions are caused by the “Cold
War mentality” of the United States and other NATO
countries and that it understands Russia’s reasonable
concerns about security issues and criticizes sanctions
against Russia and equipment delivery to Ukraine from
Western countries.

In September 2022, President Xi Jinping stated that

China would strongly support Russia on issues about
mutual core benefit at the China-Russia Summit Meeting
that was held face-to-face for the first time after the
start of the aggression. He also announced in regard
to the aggression against Ukraine, that “China will
continuously maintain an objective and fair standpoint,
encourage the formation of collaborated influence in the
international community and take a constructive role
towards peaceful resolution of the Ukraine crises” in an
online China-Russia Summit Meeting in December 2022.
F th h t t d th t Chi ill l t ti


roles in peace negotiations and reconstruction after the
conflict in a document titled “China’s Position on the
Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis” published in
February 2023. Xi also rated highly Russia’s intention
to reopen dialogue with Ukraine as quickly as possible
and was opposed to unilateral sanctions without the
resolution of the United Nations Security Council in
the joint communique resulting from the meeting with
President Putin held in Russia in March 2023. In October
the same year, President Putin visited China for the first
time since the aggression against Ukraine and held a
summit meeting with President Xi Jinping, mutually
confirming the deepening relationship of trust between
the two countries. Russia, which is internationally
isolated with its aggression against Ukraine will find
its political and military cooperation with China more
important than ever.

On the other hand, it is seen that Western countries

are taking action to contain China which is deepening
cooperation with Russia. In September 2022, NATO
Secretary General Stoltenberg pointed out that China
continued to cooperate with Russia and opposed
expanding NATO even after the aggression against
Ukraine and the notion that NATO should regard China
as a challenge to international security was adequately
reasonable. The United States added Chinese entities
including companies regarded as providing satellite
images to Russian private military company Wagner
to the list of entities subject to regulations for export
from the United States. Furthermore, Antony Blinken,
U.S. Secretary of State, warned Wang Yi, Director of
the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee, during
their meeting in February 2023 that delivery of lethal
weapons to Russia would have serious consequences for
the U.S.-China relationship.

Japan, as a country neighboring both countries, must

continue to monitor with concern the trend of cooperation
between the two countries, which has deepened further
since Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an attack on

Ukraine on February 24, 2022, declaring a “special military
operation to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine.” Although Russia
conducted intensive attacks on the capital, Kyiv, the attacks
were not accompanied by military preparations necessary for a
full-scale capture and occupation of the city. In Russia’s view,
Ukrainian politics had been always divided and fragile, so Putin
probably thought that a combination of military force and insider
maneuvering could easily make Ukrainian people abandon

to the region.

In regard to Russia, the United States evaluates

that Russia poses an immediate and ongoing threat to
the regional security order in Europe and it is a source
of disruption and instability globally but it lacks the
across the spectrum capabilities of China as Russian
government has chosen to pursue an imperialist foreign
policy with the goal of overturning key elements of
the international order. Based on the above, the United
States expressed its policy to prioritize maintaining an
enduring competitive edge over China while constraining
a still profoundly dangerous Russia. Furthermore, the
Biden administration evaluates Russia’s aggression
against Ukraine as a strategic failure that profoundly
has diminished Russia’s status vis-a-vis China and other
Asian powers such as India and Japan. On the other hand,
together with NATO allies, the United States evaluates
that they are strengthening their defense and deterrence
and welcoming Finland and Sweden to NATO will
further improve their security and capabilities.

In regard to relations with North Korea, the

administration announced the completion of a review
of its policy toward North Korea in April 2021 and has
indicated that it intends to advance diplomacy with North
Korea through a “calibrated, practical approach” with
the goal of “complete denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula.” The administration has also made clear its
intention to advance its consideration in consultation
with allies and partners, such as the Republic of Korea
(ROK) and Japan, at every step of the response to North
Korea.

Regarding the Middle East, negotiations to normalize

relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia had been
underway with the mediation of the United States, which
hopes to stabilize the region. In October 2023, however,
Palestinian armed groups including Hamas conducted
military operations against Israel. In response, Israel
launched a large-scale military operation in the Gaza
Strip, an autonomous Palestinian territory. Israel has
announced its intention to continue operation in the
Gaza Strip until it achieves its objectives, such as the
destruction of Hamas and the demilitarization of the
Gaza Strip. Developments in the operation need to be
closely watched in light of the impact it will have on
future situation in the Middle East. In addition, with
regard to relations with Iran, negotiations were underway
to rebuild the nuclear agreement from which the previous
Trump administration withdrew in May 2018, but these

between the two countries improving.

The Biden administration has indicated that its

foreign policy direction will be based on international
cooperation and that its responses will be made in close
collaboration with allies and partners. Concrete moves
in this foreign policy direction are approaches by the
Quad which is a coalition of democratic partners sharing
a common vision, comprising Japan, the United States,
Australia and India. To realize a Free and Open IndoPacific (FOIP), the Japan-U.S.-Australia-India Summit
Meeting held in Hiroshima in May 2023 announced
concrete details of cooperation in areas such as climate
change and emerging technologies. AUKUS, a security
cooperation framework established in September 2021
by three countries―Australia, the United Kingdom, and
the United States―to deepen diplomatic, security and
defense cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, also held
a summit meeting in March 2023. At this meeting, it was
announced that Australia would acquire three Virginiaclass nuclear submarines from the United States in the
early 2030s and that the three countries would jointly
develop new nuclear submarines.

**See** Section 6-1 (Australia)

On the domestic political front in the United States,

a presidential election is scheduled for November
2024 and attention will be focused on how the results
will affect future U.S. security and defense policies,
especially those relating to the Indo-Pacific region.

**1** **Perception about Security Environment**

The National Security Strategy (NSS) states that the
most pressing strategic challenges to pursuing a free,

great powers that combine authoritarian governance with
a revisionist foreign policy. The NSS also showed its
recognition that the next ten years would be the decisive
decade in setting the terms of the competition with
China, managing the acute threat posed by Russia and
in its efforts to deal with shared challenges, particularly
climate change and pandemics. The NDS states that
China seeks to undermine U.S. alliances and security
partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region and leverage its
growing capabilities, including its economic influence
and the People’s Liberation Army’s growing strength and
military footprint, to coerce its neighbors and threaten
their interests. As a result, the United States regards
China’s coercive and increasingly aggressive endeavor
as the most comprehensive and serious challenge to
U.S. national security. On the other hand, the NDS
indicates that the DoD would support robust deterrence
of aggression by Russia that poses acute threats such
as its aggression against Ukraine with its allies and
partners. North Korea is mentioned as a persistent threat
continuing to expand its nuclear and missile capability
to threaten the U.S. homeland and East Asia and Iran is
mentioned as further undermining Middle East stability
by supporting terrorist groups and malicious cyber
operations. Also, the NDS shows the perception that
these competitors seek adverse changes in the status quo
using gray zone activities.

the U.S. to address shared challenges which are cross
border issues including climate change.

The NDS presents four top-level defense priorities

to support a stable and open international system and
defense commitments; namely, 1) defending the U.S.
homeland, 2) deterring strategic attacks, 3) deterring
aggression while being prepared to prevail in conflict, 4)
building a resilient Joint Force and defense ecosystem.
The NDS also indicates an idea to advance the top-level
defense priorities through 1) Integrated deterrence, 2)
Campaigning and 3) Building enduring advantages.
With regard to deterring aggression while being prepared
to prevail in conflicts a policy to prioritize the China’s
challenge in the Indo-Pacific region, then the Russia
challenge in Europe is presented. As such, attention will
be focused on how the United States will deal with these
challenges.

**3** **Engagement in the Indo-Pacific Region**


**Part**

**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


The NSS presents a stance to deepen partnerships with
allies including Japan in the Indo-Pacific region and
promote “Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP)” through
multilateral frameworks such as the Quad and AUKUS.
With regard to the relationship with Japan, the United
States reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the
defense of Japan under mutual security treaty, which
covers the Senkaku Islands. In addition, the NSS shows an
intention to expand its regional diplomatic, development
and economic engagement, with a particular focus on
Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Regarding the
relationship with India, which is the world’s largest
democratic country and a major defense partner, the NSS
states that the United States and India will work together,
bilaterally and multilaterally, to support their shared
vision of “FOIP” and that the United States will promote
prosperity and economic connectivity across the Indian
Ocean region by addressing climate change and China’s
coercive behavior with regional partners in South Asia,
including India.

The Indo-Pacific Strategy, which was released in

February 2022, clearly indicated that the United States
will continue to place the highest priority on the IndoPacific region where faces increasing challenges from
China. It also makes clear that the United States will
cooperate with allies and partners in efforts to advance
“FOIP” and strengthen regional security.

In July 2020, regarding China’s maritime expansion,

ft th U S D D d b t Chi ’


The NSS presents three lines of effort to realize a free,
open, prosperous and secure international order; namely,
1) investing in the U.S. national power, 2) building the
strongest coalition of nations and 3) modernizing and
strengthening the U.S. Military. The NSS also indicates six
pillars as concrete approaches to realize these directions:
namely, 1) breaking down the dividing line between
foreign policy and domestic policy, 2) alliances and
partnerships, 3) perception of geopolitical challenges, 4)
involvement in other areas, 5) correspondence with new
economic situations and 6) maintaining and increasing
international cooperation. On top of that, the NSS shows
the policies that the United States focuses on investment
in domestic strength as a source of American power,
positions alliances and partnerships as its most important
strategic asset and deals with strategic challenges.
Furthermore, the NSS presents a policy that the United
States will cooperate with any countries including nond i th t i illi t k t ti l ith

decision to conduct military exercises in the South
China Sea, the United States deployed two Carrier
Strike Groups in the South China Sea for the first time
in about six years and conducted naval exercises. Since
then, the United States has continued Carrier Strike
Group operations in the same region to demonstrate
continuously its commitment to promote “FOIP” to allies
in the region. In January 2022, the State Department
released a study examining China’s claims regarding
its maritime rights in the South China Sea in light of
international law. The study noted that China’s claims
over most of the South China Sea are inconsistent with
international law and gravely undermine the rule of law
in the ocean. In May 2023, the U.S.-Philippines summit
reaffirmed the applicability of the “Mutual Defense
Treaty between the Republic of the Philippines and
the United States of America” in the event of an armed
attack against the Philippines in the Pacific Ocean,
including the South China Sea. The same month, the
U.S.-Philippines Bilateral Defense Guidelines were
formulated and released for the first time to serve as a
roadmap for modernizing alliance cooperation.

As part of its activities around strengthening its

presence in the Indo-Pacific region, the U.S. Navy which
promotes Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO)[4]
deployed the USS America, an amphibious assault ship
with enhanced ability to carry F-35B fighters and other
carrier-based aircrafts to Sasebo in December 2019
and deployed for the first time the MQ-4C Triton, an
unmanned maritime reconnaissance vehicle, in Guam in
January 2020. The U.S. Air Force which promotes Agile
Combat Employment (ACE)[5] conducts ACE exercises in
the Indo-Pacific region using fighter jets and unmanned
aircraft. Furthermore, the U.S. Army which promotes
the Multi-Domain Operations concept announced in
September 2022 the deployment of a Multi-Domain Task
Force[6] in Hawaii to undertake operations simultaneously
in all domains including the aspect of human cognition.
The U.S. Marine Corps which promotes Expeditionary
Advanced Base Operations (EABO)[7] deployed its first
Marine Littoral Regiment (MLR) with capabilities to
conduct EABO activities in Hawaii in March 2022. The


12th Marine Regiment stationed in Okinawa is scheduled
to transition to the 12th Marine Coastal Regiment by
2025 and as part of this effort, the unit was redesigned
in November 2023. In addition, in March 2018, the U.S.
military brought the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson
to Vietnam, as the first U.S. aircraft carrier port call in
Vietnam in more than 40 years. Another port call in the
country was made in March 2020, by the aircraft carrier
USS Theodore Roosevelt. In 2023, various U.S. strategic
assets were frequently deployed[8] around the Korean
Peninsula, including a strategic nuclear submarine
having made its first port call in Korea in about 40 years.

The United States has continued to conduct “Freedom

of Navigation Operations” in the South China Sea and
U.S. Navy vessels and aircraft have passed through the
Taiwan Strait to show the U.S. commitment to “FOIP.”

The United States has made it clear that it intends to

continue “Freedom of Navigation Operations” in future.

In September 2023, the United States further

demonstrated its growing engagement in the region,
which has seen China’s attempt to expand its influence,
by hosting the U.S.-Pacific Island Countries Summit and
announcing initiatives to strengthen partnerships

Based on the posture towards the Indo-Pacific

described above, the United States appears to continue to
be undertaking initiatives based on its vision of “FOIP.”

In contrast, while talks between the United States

and North Korea have been conducted since their first
summit meeting in history held in June 2018, no specific
progress has been seen with regard to the dismantlement
of North Korea’s missiles and weapons of mass
destruction. The United States and South Korea took
steps including cancelling or downgrading scheduled
Joint U.S.-ROK exercises in response to the meeting.
Then Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan
expressed in regard to the U.S.-ROK exercises a
willingness to maintain U.S. Forces in the ROK, stating
that close coordination between the military activities
of the United States and the ROK will continue to
support diplomatic efforts and that the two countries
were committed to ensuring the continued combined
defense posture of U.S.-ROK combined forces and

on the same day as NDS, which had previously been
published individually, to ensure tight linkages between
each strategy.

In the NPR the DoD expresses that China is the

overall “pacing challenge” for U.S. defense planning
and a growing factor in evaluating its nuclear deterrent
and evaluates that China will become a major nuclear
power following Russia by the 2030s and the United
States will, for the first time in its history, face two major
nuclear powers. It also states that Russia continues to
emphasize nuclear weapons in its strategy, modernize
and expand its nuclear forces and brandish its nuclear
weapons in support of its revisionist security policy, while
recognizing that the Russia’s modern nuclear arsenal
presents an enduring existential threat to the United
States and its Allies and partners, and the possibility of
the limited use of nuclear weapons to avoid a defeat. The
NPR mentions that North Korea is not a rival on the same
scale as China and Russia, but it poses a persistent threat
as it expands non-nuclear capabilities as well, including
its chemical weapon stockpile, in addition to nuclear and
ballistic missiles. Furthermore, the DoD evaluates that a
crisis or conflict on the Korean Peninsula could involve
a number of nuclear-armed actors, raising the risk of
broader conflict.

The U.S. Government expressed its goal to reduce the

role of nuclear weapons, as well as its plan to pursue
engagement with other nuclear powers continuously to
mitigate nuclear risks based on its understanding of the
situation in respect of nuclear weapons as mentioned
above. The following were raised as the roles for U.S.
nuclear weapons: (1) deterrence of strategic attacks; (2)
assurance of allies and partners; and (3) for achievement
of U.S. objectives if deterrence fails, while “hedging
against an uncertain future,” which was raised as one of
roles for nuclear weapons in the NPR published under
the Trump administration in 2018, was eliminated this
time. Also, according to the NPR, under the declaratory
policy, the basic role of nuclear weapons is to deter
nuclear attacks by enemies and the United States would
only consider the employment of nuclear weapons in
extreme circumstances. Although the U.S. Government
conducted a thorough review of a broad range of options
for nuclear declaratory policy including both “No First
Use” and “Sole Purpose” policies, it concluded that those
approaches would result in an unacceptable level of risk
in light of the range of non-nuclear capabilities being
developed and fielded by competitors that could inflict

maintaining firm military readiness. The United States
and the ROK have been expanding the scope and scale
of exercises since the Yoon Suk Yeol administration of
ROK, which exhibits a firm stance against North Korea,
was inaugurated in May 2022. The reaction of Kim
Jong-un, the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission
of North Korea, towards this situation is intensifying and
he reportedly stated the aim of the United States was “to
disrupt my regime anytime,” and, to restrain the United
States on a long-term basis, “we can never abandon
nuclear weapons.”

The U.S. Government has expressed in the NSS its

intention to seek a sustained diplomatic relationship
with North Korea to achieve concrete progress towards
compete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while
it states in the NDS that the DoD will deter attacks through
forward posture of U.S. forces and nuclear deterrence
against North Korea, which continues to expand its
nuclear and missile capability and has been trying to
drive wedges among the allies At the present point, no
concrete progress can be seen in the disarmament of
North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction and missiles.
However, attention will be paid to how the United States
advances its policy toward North Korea going forward.

**Chapter**


In President Biden’s remarks at the DoD in February
2021, the President, emphasizing the importance of
technologies in national defense strategies, stated that the
United States would deal with dangers and opportunities
generated through emerging technologies, enhance
its capabilities in cyberspace and lead in a new era of
competition from deep sea to outer space. In addition,
the NDS states that the DoD will support the innovation
ecosystem to develop defense equipment through
cooperation among research institutes, private companies
and government agencies as one of the approaches to
building enduring advantages. It also aims to promote
research and development for advanced capabilities
including in directed energy and cyber as well as create
opportunities in biotechnology and quantum science.
Attention will be focused on activities in this field.

In October 2022, the DoD released the Nuclear Posture

and partners, but it indicated that the government retains
the goal of moving toward a sole purpose declaration.

Based on the understanding that the U.S. nuclear

deterrence strategies require tailored strategies for
potential adversaries, the NPR mentioned that the United
States would maintain a flexible deterrence strategy and
force posture against China, while it would bolster the
nuclear Triad[9] against Russia through fielding a modern
nuclear Triad and with flexible, tailorable nuclear forces
to deter both large-scale attacks and limited strikes. It
also indicated that the United States would work on the
replacement program for the nuclear triad, which most
systems are operating beyond their original design life,
to avoid any gaps in its nuclear deterrent, ensuring that
the United States can withstand any strategic attack,
tailor its deterrence strategies as needed, and assure
Allies in support of its extended deterrence commitments
by maintaining a modern Triad. The NPR states that,
although the submarine-launched ballistic missiles
(SLBM) loaded with low-yield nuclear warheads that
are currently in action will be maintained as flexible
and adjustable nuclear power, the sea-launched nucleararmed cruise missile program mentioned in the previous
NPR has been canceled. Also mentioned is a plan to
transfer the roles of dual-capable aircraft (DCA) from
F-15E fighters to F-35A fighters to support NATO
nuclear missions.

Moreover, the U.S. Government withdrew from the

Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty on
August 2, 2019 as the government alleged that Russia
violated the treaty. In the same month, the United States
conducted a flight test of a conventionally configured
ground-launched missile with a range of more than 500
km. In this regard, the United States has been working
on the development of intermediate-range, conventional,
and ground-launched missiles whose test launches,
production and possession had been restricted by the
treaty.

President Putin stated in his annual presidential

address to the Federal Assembly of Russia in February


2023 that the implementation of the New START Treaty
(New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), extended for
five years in February 2021 based on the agreement
between the United States and Russia, has been halted.
Attention will be focused on future movement of nuclear
arms control.

The MDR, whose contents strongly reflect the

“integrated deterrence” concept mentioned in the NDS,
expresses a concept that to protect the United States and
deter attacks, missile defenses are positioned as a top
priority area and that they offset benefits of an enemy
attack and are useful to limit damage when deterrence
has been breached. Also, the U.S. Government declares
that it will recognize attacks on any U.S. territory
overseas including Guam as attacks directed at the U.S.
mainland and states that Guam is vital as an operation
base to maintain “FOIP” and that defending Guam helps
realize integrated deterrence.

**Chapter**


In March 2024, the United States government released
the President’s request for FY2025 discretionary funding.
The President’s discretionary request for the DoD is
approximately US$849.8 billion, an approximately 4%
increase from the previous year. Regarding this budget,
the DoD has explained that it supports the continued
implementation of the NDS, which shows a policy of
prioritizing the response to multi-domain challenges
posed by China and the deterrence of strategic attacks.

Based on above, the DoD is requesting US$9.9

billion for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative to strengthen
deterrence against China in the Indo-Pacific region
and is also requesting US$143.2 billion for R&D on
innovation and modernization. The goals for military
strength include securing 1,276,700 troops - a decrease
of around 7,800 from the previous fiscal year - and in
terms of equipment, the procurement of 68 F-35 fighters.

and development of mechanization, informatization,
and intelligentization. Such military buildup in China
apparently indicates that China has given top priority
to dealing with a Taiwan contingency by improving its
capabilities to deter or deny Taiwan’s independence and
foreign military support for the Taiwanese independence
and has recently considered the improvement of
operational capabilities in more distant waters to protect
its expanding overseas interests.

Furthermore, China seems to emphasize not only

physical means but also non-physical means in military
affairs and warfare. It regards the concept of “Three
Warfare” - “Media Warfare,” “Psychological Warfare,”
and “Legal Warfare” - as part of the political work of
the military. In addition, China has set forth a policy
of coordinating military struggle closely with political,
diplomatic, economic, cultural, and legal endeavors.

As for the future goals of the development of national

defense and military forces, General Secretary Xi
Jinping’s report to the 19th CCP National Congress in
October 2017 and the defense white paper released in
2019 noted that China would try to (1) basically achieve
mechanization and make great progress in informatization
to dramatically improve strategic capabilities by 2020,
(2) basically complete the modernization of national
defense and military forces by 2035, and (3) generally
transform Chinese forces into world-class forces by the
mid-21st century.

In the 5th Plenary Session held in October 2020,

the goal year for 1st stage mentioned above, China’s
determination to achieve a struggle goal for the 100th
anniversary of the foundation of the PLA in 2027 was
announced. The new “three-step development strategy”
was stipulated in the so-called “historic resolution”
in 6th Plenary Session in 2021, which consists of the
achievement of the 100th anniversary struggle goal of
the PLA by 2027 as the first step, and achievement of the
aforementioned goals by 2035 and the mid-21st century
as the second and third steps respectively. Furthermore,
the report of 20th CCP Congress in 2022 newly stated
that elevating the PLA to world-class standards “more
quickly” is a strategic task for building a modern socialist
country in all respects, and it is possible that the CCP is
considering moving forward its target of “establishing
world-class forces,” scheduled for the mid-21st century.

However, China has recognized a wide gap between

the real military modernization level and the level


China has expanded beyond the so called the first island
chain and into the second island chain, including the
East China Sea around the Senkaku Islands, the Sea of
Japan, and even the Western Pacific, including around
the Izu and Ogasawara Islands, intensifying activities in
the entire area surrounding Japan. China is increasing
military pressure on Taiwan and also promoting the
establishment of military bases in the South China Sea.
Moreover, China is further strengthening its cooperation
with Russia, including in military activities.

China’s current external stance, military activities,

and other activities have become a matter of serious
concern for Japan and the international community,
and present an unprecedented and the greatest strategic
challenge in ensuring the peace and security of Japan and
the peace and stability of the international community,
as well as in strengthening the international order based
on the rule of law, to which Japan should respond with
its comprehensive national power including its defense
capabilities and in cooperation and collaboration with its
ally, like-minded countries, and others.

**2** **Defense Policies**


**Part**

**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


China has described the objectives of its defense policies
and the missions of its military forces as: supporting
the CCP’s leadership, China’s characteristic socialism
system, and the modernization of its socialism; defending
the nation’s sovereignty, unification and security;
backing the nation’s sustainable “peaceful development”
through protecting its maritime and overseas national
interests; building strong national defense and massive
military forces commensurate with the interests of the
nation’s security and the interests of development; and
providing strong assurances for realizing the “Chinese
dream” of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
China contends that these national defense policies are
“defensive” in nature.[1]

To develop national defense and military forces,

China has employed a policy of building the “system of
modern military power with Chinese characteristics” by
sustaining the military development under the party, the
military buildup through reforms, military promotion
based on science and technology, and law-based military
governance, by pursuing practical capabilities that
“can fight and win a war” by giving greater priority
to the civil-military fusion, by promoting the fusion


-----

required for national security, and between Chinese and
world-class military forces. Although China has not
defined what it means by “world-class forces,” it has
been pointed out that China may be trying to develop
military forces that equal or in some cases surpass the
U.S. military. Furthermore, it has also been pointed out
that China aims to build “world-class forces” capable
of “intelligentized warfare” by acquiring advanced
technology and becoming an “innovation superpower.”[2]
In light of this, it is suggested that China is planning to
offset its military power gap with the U.S. military, and
may recognize that the “intelligentization” of its forces
is a necessary condition for this. It is thought that China
will aim to build an army that can “fight and win a war”
against the U.S. military in the “intelligentized warfare”
of the future.[3]

Based on that recognition, it is expected that China

will further accelerate the military modernization
against the backdrop of national power development and
General Secretary Xi’s enhancement of his power base
in the CCP in his third term and expansion of his power
as Chairman of the Central Military Commission.[4]

**and Military Affairs**


actions. For example, the submerged transit of a Chinese
Navy submarine through Japan’s contiguous zone around
the Senkaku Islands was confirmed in January 2018, but
China did not acknowledge this. In the same way, in
the cases of submarines in the contiguous zone around
Amami Oshima Island presumed to belong to China
confirmed in June 2020 and September 2021, China did
not acknowledge this fact. On the contrary, there were
some Chinese media reports that criticized the Japanese
side by claiming they were making exaggerations.

China’s influence in the international community

has risen politically, economically, and militarily. It has
become increasingly important for China to improve
its transparency regarding defense policies and military
affairs, provide fact-based explanations about its
activities, and share and observe international rules as
a responsible country in the international community
to allay concerns about China. It is strongly hoped that
China will increase transparency through such efforts as
specific and accurate information disclosure.

**4** **National Defense Budget**


**Part**

**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


China announced that its national defense budget for
FY2024 was approximately RMB 1,665.54 billion
(approximately JPY 33,310.8 billion when the value is
mechanically converted at 20 JPY per RMB.)[5] This is
around 7.2% growth from the budget of the previous
fiscal year according to China’s announcement. China’s
announced defense budget has been increasing at a rapid
pace, and the nominal size of China’s announced defense
budget has increased approximately 32 times in the 30
years since fiscal 1994, and approximately 2.1 times in
the decade since fiscal 2014. China positions the buildup
of defense capabilities as important a task as economic
development. It is believed that China has continued
to invest resources in the improvement of its defense
capabilities in tandem with its economic development.
However, there have been many years in which the
announced annual national defense budget increase rate
exceeded the economic growth (an increase in gross
domestic product [GDP]). Attention is to be paid to how
the slowdown in China’s economic growth would affect


China has neither set out a clear and specific future
vision of its military strengthening, nor ensured adequate
transparency of its decision-making process in relation
to military and security affairs. Although China had
released a defense white paper roughly every two years
since 1998, it has not released a white paper in recent
years since “China’s National Defense in the New Era”
released in July 2019 for the first time in four years. Even
the white paper did not sufficiently clarify the specific
situation of equipment possession, procurement goals
and results, the organization and deployment of major
units, the military’s major operations and training results,
and the breakdown of national defense expenditures.

Incidents in which Chinese authorities provide factually

inaccurate explanations or refuse to admit facts regarding
Chinese military activities have been confirmed, inciting
concerns over China’s military decision-making and


According to the annual report “Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China,” U.S. DoD (2021)

There is a view that “intelligentization” of the military provides an excellent opportunity for a latecomer’s military to leap ahead in development and thereby rapidly surpass other advancedlevel militaries.

The Central Military Commission is a leading and commanding organ to China’s armed forces. Formally, there are the CCP CMC and the People’s Republic of China CMC. However, each
consists of the same members, indicating both commissions as an organ for the party to control the armed forces.

The announced defense budget of China is rapidly increasing. The budget of FY2024 is about 4.3 times larger than defense-related expenditures of Japan. Japan’s defense-related

(Note) This basically shows the defense budget within “the central government’s general public budget,” which had been named as “the central fiscal expenditures” prior to FY2014.
Year-on-year growth rate compares the budget of a given year against the initial budget of the previous year. Note that the FY2002 defense budget was calculated based on the
increased amount from the defense budget in the previous FY because only the amount and rate of growth were released. For FY2016 and FY2018-2024, the amounts of “the
central government expenditures,” which are part of the central government’s general public budget, are used because they were the only announced amounts. Figures for
year-on-year growth rate include figures announced by China.


its national defense budget.

In addition, the amount of the announced defense

budget is considered to be only a part of its actual
military expenditures. For example, it is believed
that the announced defense budget does not include
foreign equipment procurement costs or research and
development (R&D) expenses. According to an analysis
of the U.S. DoD, actual defense spending in FY2022 was
significantly higher than the announced national defense
budget.[6]

As for a breakdown of the national defense budget,

past defense white papers specified personnel, training
and sustainment, and equipment expenses for the
announced national defense budgets for FY2007,
FY2009 and FY2010-2017 (and expenses for active,
reserve and militia forces for FY2007 and FY2009).
However, no more details have been given.

is defined as a people’s force created and led by the
CCP, comprising the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the
Rocket Force, the Information Support Force, the Joint
Logistics Support Force, etc.

The PAP is designed to engage mainly in patrol,

emergency response, counterterrorism, maritime rights
protection and law enforcement, emergency rescue,
defense operations, etc. The militia is planned to
engage in economic construction, etc., in peacetime and
undertake logistic support missions in an emergency.

**(1) Military Reforms**
In recent years, China is said to have been engaged in
military reforms seen as the largest in its history.

China is also said to have largely completed central

military reforms by the end of 2016. Specifically, they
abolished the PLA’s seven Military Regions and created
five new Theaters with primary responsibility for
command of operations, namely, the Eastern Theater,
Southern Theater, Western Theater, Northern Theater,
and Central Theater. In addition, they also formed the
PLA Army (PLAA) Headquarters-ranked equally with
the PLA Navy (PLAN) and PLA Air Force (PLAAF)
Headquarters-, the Rocket Force (PLARF), the Strategic
Support Force (PLASSF), and the Joint Logistics

Support Force. Moreover, the headquarters for the entire
PLA were replaced by 15 functional sections under the
CMC, including the Joint Staff Department, Political
Work Department, Logistics Support Department, and
Equipment Development Department.

On the other hand, there are also moves to reorganize

the central-level organizations. In April 2024, the
establishment of the new “Information Support Force”
was announced. This is pointed out to be a reorganization
of the Strategic Support Force which was established at
the end of 2015. Military reforms seem to be under way
since 2017, including those at the field level.

These series of reforms are believed to be aimed at

building a more combat-ready military by improving its
ability to carry out joint operations. In addition, it has
been noted that the reorganization of the headquarters is a
means of tackling corruption at the center of the military
by decentralizing the leading organs. Persons close to
and deeply trusted by Xi Jinping are actively appointed
as members of the CMC; for example, Zhang Youxia
remained in his position as Vice Chairman of the CMC
in the 1st Plenary Session after the 20th CCP Congress
held in October 2022. Given these points, it is thought
that Chairman Xi is attempting to further enhance his
leadership in the CMC and the military.

**(2) Nuclear and Missile Forces**
China has continued independent efforts to develop
nuclear weapons and missiles for their delivery since
the mid-1950s, indicating its apparent attempt to ensure
nuclear deterrence, supplement its conventional forces
with nuclear capabilities and secure its influence on the
international community.

It is regarded that China’s nuclear strategy is to deter

any nuclear attack on its territory by maintaining a
nuclear force structure able to conduct retaliatory nuclear
attacks on a limited number of targets such as cities in
adversary countries, should China be subject to nuclear
attacks. China has explained that it is committed to “no
first use” of nuclear weapons under any circumstances,
to “unconditional negative security assurance” that it
would not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against
non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones
unconditionally, and to keeping its nuclear capabilities
at the minimum level required for national security. In


recent years, however, doubts have been expressed about
the explanation.[7]

China is aiming to modernize, diversify, and expand

its nuclear capabilities. It is investing in and increasing
the number of means to deliver nuclear weapons by land,
sea, and air, as well as increasing the production of nuclear
warheads. The number of operational nuclear warheads
in its possession exceeds 500 as of May 2023, and it
has been pointed out that it may exceed 1,000 by 2030
and continue to increase until 2035.[8] Furthermore, the
United States has requested China’s participation in the
framework of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(New START), which sets limits on strategic nuclear
forces between the United States and Russia, but China
has consistently refused to participate. It is believed that
China plans to strengthen deterrence against the United
States and will continue to place importance on nuclear
and missile capabilities in the future.

China possesses ballistic missiles of various types

and ranges, including ICBMs, SLBMs, intermediaterange ballistic missiles (IRBMs), medium-range ballistic
missiles (MRBMs), and short-range ballistic missiles
(SRBMs). The update of China’s ballistic missile forces
from a liquid propellant system to a solid propellant
system is improving their survivability and readiness.
Moreover, it is believed that China is working to
increase their performance by such means as extending
ranges, improving targeting accuracy, and employing
maneuverable reentry vehicles (MaRVs) and multiple
independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs).

China’s main ICBMs, its strategic nuclear asset, had

been the fixed-site liquid-propellant DF-5 missiles.
However, China has in recent years deployed the DF31, which is a mobile-type ICBM with a solid propellant
system mounted onto a transporter erector launcher
(TEL). In addition, China has reportedly deployed the
**DF-41, a new type of ICBM that first appeared in a**
military parade commemorating the 70th anniversary of
its founding in October 2019 and is said to have a range
of approximately 11,200 km and can carry 10 warheads.
China is also building ICBM silos and is reported to
have constructed three new launch facilities in 2022,
including more than 300 new silos.[9] In addition, it has
been pointed out that China is pursuing the development
of an ICBM equipped with a conventional warhead,

in order to be able to threaten the U.S. mainland with
conventional forces[10].

With regard to submarine-launched ballistic missiles

(SLBM), it is considered that Jin-class Nuclear-Powered
Ballistic Missile Submarines (SSBN) equipped with
**JL-2 with an estimated range of approximately 7,200 km**
are operational. Furthermore, it has been pointed out that
JL-3s, extended range SLBMs reportedly with a range of
12,000 km, have already been loaded into the Jing-class
SSBNs, making them possible to reach the mainland
United States from China’s coastal waters.[11]

China’s missile forces have been put outside the

framework of the U.S.-Russia Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces (INF) Treaty, and China holds numerous amounts
of ground-launched missiles with ranges between 500
and 5,500 km that had been subjected to the INF treaty.
It is also deemed that China is ahead of the United States
in relation to ground-launched ballistic missiles and
cruise missiles.[12] As for the IRBMs/ MRBMs covering
the Indo-Pacific region including Japan, China has the
mobile solid-propellant DF-21 and DF-26, which can
be transported and operated on TELs. These are viewed
as capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear
warheads. China possesses ballistic missiles carrying
conventional warheads with high targeting accuracy
based on the DF-21, including the DF-21D anti-ship
ballistic missile (ASBM), called “carrier killer,” which
carries conventional warheads to attack overwater
ships including aircraft carriers. The DF-26, which has
a range including Guam and is called “Guam killer,” is
considered a “second-generation ASBM” developed on
the basis of the DF-21D. Its deployment was announced
in April 2018. China also possesses the CJ-20 (CJ-10)
long-range land-attack cruise missile with a range of at
least 1,500 km, as well as the H-6 bomber that is capable
of carrying this cruise missile. It is deemed that these
missiles complement ballistic missile forces, covering
the Indo-Pacific region including Japan. In the military
parade to celebrate the 70th anniversary of its founding
in October 2019, CJ-100/DF-100, which is said to be
a supersonic cruise missile, also made its first public
appearance. The deployment of these ASBMs and cruise
missiles is expected to strengthen China’s “A2/AD”
capabilities.

Concerning SRBMs, China has deployed a large


number of solid propellant DF 16, DF 15, and DF 11
missiles facing Taiwan. It is believed that their ranges
cover a part of Japan’s Southwestern Islands including
the Senkaku Islands.

Furthermore, China is believed to be rapidly

developing multiple models of hypersonic glide vehicles

downsizing, multifunctionality, and modularization of
military units. Specifically, it is believed to be shifting
from a regional defense type to a region-wide mobility
type and is improving mobility by motorizing and
mechanizing infantry units, as well as strengthening
airborne units of the Air Force, amphibious units of the
Army and Navy, special forces, and helicopter units.

It is said that the Navy Marine Corps is still in the

process of reinforcement. It is reportedly acquiring
equipment and conducting training necessary to become
an expeditionary force. On the other hand, it repeatedly
conducts training for amphibious operation including
using civilian RORO vesseles.[17] It is also pointed out
that these activities suggest that Navy Marine Corps
troops are to be flexibly utilized in multiple roles in a
scenario surrounding Taiwan.[18]

The Chinese Army is reportedly has been conducting

trainings that focus on combined combat operations
and incorporating mock confrontation drills to improve
its ability to conduct practical operations. China has
conducted on a regular basis Stride, Firepower, and
Sharp Sword maneuver-exercises that cut across multiple
regions. They are aiming at verifying and improving the
capabilities necessary to deploy army troops to remote
areas, such as long-distance maneuvering capabilities of
the Army, and logistical support capabilities that include
mobilizing militias and public transportation. The U.S.
DoD has pointed out that the Chinese Army conducted
multiple large-scale 24-hour exercises at exercise
areas across the country in 2022, including exercises
to respond to U.S. and Taiwanese military activities.[19]
These facts suggest China’s attempt to improve its
practical operational capabilities.

The above described PAP consists of internal security

corps, which are organized and established based
on administrative divisions such as provinces and
autonomous regions, mobile corps, which do not have
fixed areas in charge and perform missions across different
areas, and the Coast Guard, described later, which is said
to safeguard national sovereignty, security, and maritime
interests as well as implements law enforcement. The
PAP is said to own various equipment such as armored
vehicles, rotary-wing aircraft, and heavy machine guns.


in July 2021. The vehicle reportedly flew approximately
40,000 km in over 100 minutes, and did not strike its
target, but came close.[14] In addition, it has been pointed
out that multiple warheads can be attached to the
aforementioned new ICBM, the DF-41, and that China
is testing an intercontinental range HGV. Furthermore,
it has been pointed out that it is highly likely that the
launch vehicle is derived from the DF-41. It will not
only be capable of significantly extending the effective
range of HGVs compared to the DF-17, but will also
be capable of carrying larger, heavier hypersonic glide
vehicles. These weapons are said to be more difficult for
missiles to intercept because they fly low at very high
speeds and are highly maneuverable.

China seems to be building a missile defense system

and is believed to be focusing on developing related
technologies, such as the “HQ-19” ballistic missile
defense system. It is believed that China has been
conducting missile interceptor tests in the mid-course
phase since 2010. It has been pointed out that this is an
attempt to acquire capabilities to respond to IRBMs and
other missiles.[15] Cooperation with Russia has also been
noted, with joint missile defense computer exercises
“Aerospace Safety” having been held in 2016 and 2017.
In May 2019, two surface-to-air missile systems “S-400s”
introduced from Russia were reportedly deployed near
Beijing. In October of the same year, Russian President
Putin stated that Russia was helping China build a
“missile-attack early warning system.” Furthermore, the
U.S. DoD has pointed out the possibility that China has
at least three early warning satellites in orbit as of 2022.[16]
Given that ballistic missile defense technology has the
potential to be applied to missiles capable of destroying
satellites, attention will focus on future Chinese missile
defense trends.

the PLA, and is developing capabilities for readiness,
mobility, and counter-terrorism operations.[20]

**(4) Naval Forces**
The naval forces consist of three fleets: North Sea Fleet,
East Sea Fleet, and South Sea Fleet. China’s naval forces,
which own a larger scale of ships exceeding the U.S.
Navy and are said to be the largest navy in the world.[21]
The Chinese Navy is rapidly modernizing, increasing
production of surface combatant vessels such as the
Jankai II-class frigates, which are highly capable of fleet
air defense and anti-ship attack, and the Renhai-class
destroyers, which are the largest in the Chinese Navy,
and domestically produced Yuan class-submarines,
which has its strength on quietness, as well as reinforcing
landing ships and aircraft carriers.

The Renhai-class destroyer is said to be equipped

with a vertical launch system (VLS) with 112 launch
cells, almost twice the number of launch cells as the


new Luyang III class destroyer. This VLS is said to
be capable of launching long-range land-attack cruise
missiles and YJ-18 anti-ship cruise missiles with a
supersonic terminal attack capability, as well as ASBMs.
It has also been pointed out that the destroyer is being
considered as a launch vehicle to defend against ballistic
missiles in the mid-course phase,[22] and that this suggests
a plan for capability of carrying anti-ship HGVs. At least
eight Renhai-class destroyers have been in service by
April 2024, and they may become the key to the Chinese
Navy’s long-range missile capabilities in the future.

As for landing ships, large Yusheng-class landing

ships have been launched one after another. The No.1
warship “Hainan” was commissioned in the Southern
Theater in April 2021, the No. 2 warship “Guangxi” was
commissioned in the Eastern Theater in December of the
same year, the No. 3 warship “Anhu” was commissioned
in 2022, and the No. 4 warship is said to have already
been launched. Furthermore, it has been pointed out that
Type-076 landing ships may be built following on from
the Yushen-class landing ships.

In addition, China is currently operating two aircraft

carriers and is in the process of building a third. The

first aircraft carrier, Liaoning, was commissioned in
September 2012, and the first domestically produced
aircraft carrier (China’s second aircraft carrier),
Shandong[23], was commissioned in December 2019,
operating in the South China Sea, East China Sea,
and Pacific Ocean, respectively. Moreover, the second
domestically built aircraft carrier (China’s third aircraft
carrier) **Fujian, which was launched in June 2022, is**
believed to be larger than the Liaoning and Shandong
and equipped with an electromagnetic catapult system
capable of operating fixed-wing early warning aircraft.
This has been pointed out to improve operational
capabilities for the carrier-based aircraft. It has also
been pointed out that China has plans to build nuclearpowered aircraft carriers.

China is believed to have been developing and

deploying unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and
unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) that are available
for military purposes. Such equipment is considered
an asymmetric force that is relatively inexpensive, yet
capable of interfering with the enemy’s ability to gain
superiority at sea and in the water.

Given these developments concerning the naval forces,

China appears to be steadily building up capabilities for
conducting operations in more distant waters in addition
to near sea defense. It has also been pointed out that in
the near future, the PLA Navy will have the capability

surface combatant ships, and its anti-submarine warfare
(ASW) capabilities of surface combatants and fixed and
rotary wing aircraft are significantly improved, while it
continues to lack a robust deep-water ASW capability.[24]
It is necessary to continue to monitor the related
developments.

The People’s Armed Police Force (PAP), one of

China’s armed forces other than the military, has the
Coast Guard, which is said to be the world’s largest
maritime law enforcement agency, under its umbrella.

In recent years, the Coast Guard s vessels have become
larger and more armed. At the end of December 2023,
the China Coast Guard possessed 159 ships[25] with full
load displacement of 1,000 tons or more, including two
10,000-ton-class patrol ships, among the world’s largest
ones. The operations of vessels equipped with a gun-like
armament were observed as well. It is pointed out that
the newer ships are significantly larger and more capable
than older ships, and are equipped with helicopter
facilities, high-capacity water cannons, guns ranging
from 20mm to 76mm, and other equipment, so that they
are able to withstand long-term operations and engage in
distant-water activities.[26]

The enhanced cooperation between the PLA and the

China Coast Guard has also been confirmed. In July 2018,
the China Coast Guard that had been conducting maritime
surveillance operations under the direction of the State
Council’s Ministry of Public Security was transferred
to the PAP as the PAP Coast Guard and is currently
operated under the PAP, which receives unified guidance
and command from the Central Military Commission.
After the transfer, former naval officers were reportedly
given major Coast Guard posts, indicating enhanced
cooperation between the military and Coast Guard. It
has been noted that retired naval destroyers and frigates
were delivered to the Coast Guard, suggesting that the


military has been supporting the Coast Guard in terms
of equipment as well as personnel. It has been pointed
out that the military forces and the Coast Guard have
conducted joint exercises. The enhanced cooperation
between the PLA and the PAP including the Coast Guard
is believed to be intended to steadily strengthen their
joint operational capabilities through the enhancement
of cooperation.

Amid such a situation, in June 2020, “Law of the

People’s Republic of China in the People’s Armed
Police Force (PAP Law) was revised, and “protection of
maritime interests and law enforcement” were added to
the duties of the PAP. The revised version also stipulates
that the PAP shall be centrally and uniformly guided
by the Central Committee and the Central Military
Commission (CMC) of the People’s Republic of China.
The Coast Guard Law of the People’s Republic of
China (Coast Guard Law), which stipulates the Coast
Guard’s responsibilities and authority including the use
of weapons, was newly enacted in January 2021 and
entered into force in February 2021. The Coast Guard
Law includes problematic provisions in terms of their
inconsistency with international law. The Coast Guard
Law must not be allowed to infringe on the legitimate
interests of the relevant countries including Japan.
Furthermore, it is completely unacceptable that the law

would increase tensions in maritime areas such as the
East China Sea.

It is pointed out that, among the militia, whose status is

China’s armed force other than the military, the so-called
maritime militia is playing the role of the front guard
for supporting China’s maritime interests. The maritime
militia is said to operate in the South China Sea, etc. and
consist of fishermen and residents of isolated islands.[27]

Given the China’s emphasis on the necessity of “fully

exerting the overall power of the military, police and
militia” on the seas, attention should be paid to these
asymmetrical forces, too.

domestic J 10 fighter. The J 15 carrier based fighters,
which are also carried on the aircraft carriers “Liaoning”
and “Shandong,” are said to have been copied from the
Russian Su-33. China is deploying J-20 fifth-generation
fighters and developing J-31 (J-35) fighter. It has been
pointed out that J-31 (J-35) fighter could be the base for
developing the replacement for the J-15 carrier-based
fighter.

As China is continuing the modernization of its

bombers as well, the Air Force has increased the number
of **H-6 bombers, which are capable of carrying long-**
range land-attack cruise missiles with nuclear capability.
In an attempt to improve bombers’ long-range operation
capabilities, the Air Force has reportedly begun to
operate H-6N bombers that can take advantage of aerial
refueling to fly longer. It is believed to be developing
a new long-range stealth bomber called H-20. It is also
pointed out that China is developing an air-launched
ballistic missile with nuclear capability to be carried by
such bombers. Moreover, it has also been pointed out
that China is developing a stealth bomber.

China is also making continuous efforts to improve

China’s air forces consist mainly of the Navy’s air units
and the Air Force. As for fourth-generation fighters,
China has introduced from Russia the Su-27 and Su30 and the Su-35 latest fourth-generation fighter. China
is also developing its own domestic modern fighters.
China has started the mass production of the J-11B
fighter, a suspected copy of the Su-27, and the J-16

**27 In addition, it is pointed out that while the maritime militia often rents fishing vessels from companies or individual fishermen, China has built a state-owned fishing fleet in the South**

China Sea for the maritime militia. It is also pointed out that the Hainan provincial government, adjacent to the South China Sea, ordered the building of 84 large militia fishing vessels
with reinforced hulls and ammunition storage, which the militia received by the end of 2016, along with extensive subsidies to encourage frequent operations in the Spratly Islands. Since
this maritime militia unit recruits military veterans as its members to create a unit on par with a career soldier unit, it is reported that salary is paid separately from its commercial fishing

capabilities which are essential for operations of modern
air power by introducing the H-6U and IL-78M aerial
refueling tankers and the KJ-500 and KJ-2000 early
warning and control aircraft. Since July 2016, China has
promoted the deployment of the indigenously developed
Y-20 large transport aircraft. The Y-20U, an aerial
refueling tanker based on this transport aircraft, has also
been deployed since June 2021.

China is rapidly developing a variety of domestic

unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), including high-altitude,
long-endurance (HALE) UAVs for reconnaissance and
other purposes as well as those capable of carrying
weapons such as missiles. Some of these are deployed
and actively exported. In fact, it is suggested that the
Chinese Air Force has created a UAV unit for attack
missions and frequently used UAVs for reconnaissance
and other purposes in waters and airspace surrounding
China. In 2023, the KVD-002 unmanned aircraft, which
is expected to be used in support of army helicopters, was
unveiled for the first time. Moreover, it has been noted
that China is improving “Swarm” technology to operate
a large number of small low-cost UAVs.

Given such modernization status of the air forces,

it is believed that China is steadily improving not only
its defense capabilities for its national airspace but
also capabilities for conducting combat operations and
supporting ground and maritime forces in more distant
areas.

**(6) Space, Cyber, and Electromagnetic domain**

**capabilities**

Information gathering, and command and communication
in the military sector have increasingly relied on satellites
and computer networks. As such, China stated that “outer
space and cyberspace have become new commanding
heights (capture point) in strategic competition among all
parties,” indicating that it has recognized the importance
of taking on information mastery in wartime when it
must protect its own information systems and networks
while neutralizing those of its adversaries.

Regarding the space domain, it is believed that

China is also planning to improve its ability to conduct
military operations in space, given the fact that China’s
administrative organizations and state-owned enterprises
involved in space utilization are said to have close
cooperative ties with the military.[28] Specifically, China
has rapidly increased the number of satellites available
for military purposes in recent years. For example, the
“BeiDou” global satellite positioning system, which is
called a Chinese-version GPS and pointed out as available
for ballistic missiles and other guided weapons systems,
started its global operation service in late 2018, and it is
deemed that the launch of all satellites constituting the
BeiDou system was completed in June 2020.

In the cyber domain, China appears to be strengthening


-----

its cyber operations capabilities against networks,
and the U.S. DoD has pointed out that China has the
ability to carry out cyber attacks that cause localized
and temporary disruption to critical infrastructure in
the United States.[29] Such an ability is considered to
strengthen China’s “A2/AD” capabilities. It has been
noted that current major military training of China
always contains cyber operations covering both attacks
on and defense of command systems. The militia as a
part of China’s armed forces reportedly includes “cyber
militias” with excellent cyber domain capabilities.

With regard to electromagnetic spectrum domain, the

presence of aircraft equipped with electronic warfare
pods and having electronic warfare capabilities has been
pointed out, including not only the Y-8 electronic warfare
aircraft that frequently flies around Japan, but also J-15
carrier-based aircraft, J-16 fighters, and H-6 bombers.

**(7) China’s “Intelligentization” of its Military Forces**
The “intelligentized warfare” advocated by China is
said to be integrated warfare deployed in the land,
sea, air, space, electromagnetic spectrum, cyber, and
cognitive dimensions using intelligentized weapons and
equipment and corresponding operational methods based
on IoT information systems. The “cognitive dimension”
is believed to be recognized as important in the future
aspects of warfare.

Also, in respect of “intelligentized warfare,” it is

pointed out that the PLA

・ has recognized that new technologies will increase

the speed and tempo of future warfare, and that
operationalization of AI will be necessary to improve
the speed and quality of information processing
by reducing battlefield uncertainty and providing
decision making advantage over potential adversaries.

・ is exploring next-generation operational concepts for

intelligentized warfare, such as attrition warfare using
intelligentized swarms.

・ considers unmanned systems to be important

intelligentized technologies, and is pursuing greater
autonomy for unmanned land, sea, and air assets to
enable swarm attacks, optimized logistics support,
as well as dispersed intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (ISR) operations.[30]


**(8) Efforts to Develop Joint Operational Capabilities**
In recent years, initiatives have been under way to improve
joint operational capabilities in areas from the front
line to logistics. The CMC Joint Operations Command
Center is believed to have been established under the
initiatives for the CCP to carry out decision making at the
highest strategic level. The five new theaters established
in February 2016 are seen as representing permanent
joint operation headquarters. Attention will be focused to
movement towards integration in personnel affairs as well;
for example, General He Weidong who has experienced
as a commanding officer of a joint force as Commander
of the Eastern Theater Command was assigned as Vice
Chairman of the Central Military Commission in October
2022. In recent years, China has implemented joint
service trainings giving priority to practicality and other
drills to improve its joint operational capabilities. These
drills are apparently designed to secure the effectiveness
of the abovementioned organizational reforms and other
initiatives to improve joint operational capabilities and
are expected to continue to progress in the future.

**(1) General Situation**
Recently, China is believed to be aiming to build up
capabilities for operations in more distant waters and
airspace, including those to project power to waters
including the so-called second island chain, beyond
the first island chain. In such efforts, China has rapidly
expanded and intensified its activities in the maritime and
aerial domains using its naval and air powers. In waters
and airspace surrounding Japan, particularly, Chinese
naval vessels, and naval and air force aircraft suspected as
conducting training and information gathering activities
have been observed frequently, along with Chinese
naval ships heading for the Pacific and Indian Ocean
and numerous China Coast Guard vessels operating
under the name of protecting maritime interests. Their
activities include China Coast Guard vessels’ intermittent
intrusions into Japan’s territorial waters, and dangerous
acts that could cause unintended consequences, such
as the directing of fire-control radar at Japanese SelfDefense Forces (SDF) ships and aircraft,[31] Chinese

Moreover, it is believed that another Chinese naval vessel directed a fire-control radar at a helicopter mounted on an MSDF destroyer on January 19. Projecting fire-control radar is normally

**(2) Military Activities in Japan s Surrounding Waters**

**and Airspace**

The Chinese Navy and Air Force have in recent
years expanded and intensified their activities in the
surrounding sea areas and airspace of Japan, including the
area surrounding the Senkaku Islands. These activities
include those allegedly based on China’s unilateral
claim on the Senkaku Islands, and cases involving the
one-sided escalation of activities, creating a situation
of great concern to Japan. The Air Self-Defense Force
(ASDF) has continued to make frequent scrambles
against Chinese aircraft, as indicated by an all-time high
of 851 scrambles in FY2016. China has also continued
naval vessels’ passage through waters near Japan for
navigation to distant waters such as the Indian Ocean, as
well as activities viewed as training of maritime and air
forces making forays to the Pacific and the Sea of Japan.


military fighters abnormally close approach to Japanese
SDF and U.S. military aircraft, and the establishment[32]
of the “East China Sea ADIZ” and other activities that
could infringe upon the freedom of overflight. These
activities have become a grave matter of concern and
are extremely regrettable. Furthermore, flying objects
that were confirmed within Japanese territorial airspace
are strongly presumed to be unmanned reconnaissance
balloons flown by China. In the South China Sea, China
is moving forward with militarization, expanding and
intensifying its activities in the air and sea space in the
area, and creating a fait accompli of unilateral changes
to the status quo by force. It is strongly hoped that China
will act on the basis of the principle of the rule of law
and play active roles in the region and the international
community in a more cooperative manner.

December 2022. The aircraft carrier Shandong was
first confirmed operating in the Pacific in April 2023,
and then again in September and October of the same
year. During the deployment of these aircraft carriers
into the Pacific Ocean, several cases have been observed
where they have passed through the Bashi Channel from
the South China Sea, or through the waters off the main
island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island from the East
China Sea. In addition, the landing and takeoff of shipborne fighter aircraft in the Pacific Ocean has also been
frequently confirmed.

Through this expansion into the Pacific, China seems

to be aiming to improve the operational capabilities of
its maritime forces, including aircraft carriers, and its
ability to carry out operations in distant waters.

Regarding air forces, a naval aircraft was first

confirmed advancing into the Pacific Ocean in 2013, and
an air force aircraft advancing into the Pacific Ocean was
confirmed in 2015, and since 2017, expansion into the
Pacific Ocean involving passage through the airspace
between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima
Island has become even more active. Furthermore, the
types of military aircraft that pass through this airspace
are becoming more diverse year by year. Bomber
flights have also been confirmed, and the U.S. DoD
has indicated that the Chinese military is believed to
be conducting training exercises and other activities
targeting the United States and its allies.[33]

Flight patterns of Chinese military aircraft have

also been changing. Flights from the East China Sea to
the Pacific Ocean, passing between the main island of
Okinawa and Miyakojima Island, and from the direction
of the Bashi Channel to the Pacific Ocean, both with
the return trips on the same shuttle routes, have been
repeatedly made. In 2016, H-6K bombers and other
aircraft were confirmed as flying around Taiwan. In
August 2017, H-6K bombers were confirmed as flying
to waters off the Kii Peninsula after advancing to the
Pacific Ocean via waters between the main island of
Okinawa and Miyakojima Island for the first time.

Through frequent long-distance flights of bombers

and other aircraft, including advancements to the Pacific,
and their advanced flight paths and composition, China
is thought to be demonstrating its presence around areas
including those surrounding Japan, and planning further
enhancements to more practical operational capabilities.

Additionally, activities considered planned to improve


sea and air joint operational capabilities in more distant
areas, such as what seemed to be air-to-ship attack drills
including advancements to the Pacific Ocean, have been
seen in recent years. China is expected to further expand
and intensify naval and air activities in the Pacific Ocean.

**C． Activities in the Sea of Japan**
In the Sea of Japan, China’s military activities of
maritime and air forces have been intensifying, including
joint activities with the Russian military.

As for naval forces, they have been sailing into the

Sea of Japan occasionally, such as navigating toward
distant waters for trainings. Intelligence-gathering ships
have also been frequently confirmed passing through
the Tsushima Strait. Since 2013, China and Russia
have conducted joint exercises “Maritime Cooperation”
regularly in the Sea of Japan. Since 2021, joint maritime
patrols with Russian ships have been carried out three
times. Each time vessels that participated in the joint
exercises in the Sea of Japan joined in the patrols after
the exercises.


-----

Regarding aircrafts, activities in the Sea of Japan

have increased since it was confirmed in January
2016 that Chinese military aircraft passed through the
Tsushima Strait for the first time. The types of military
aircraft flying in this airspace are also becoming more
diverse, and in March 2024, a WZ-7 reconnaissancetype unmanned aerial vehicle was confirmed flying for
the first time. China has carried out seven joint flights
of bombers with Russia since 2019; in every case, the
bombers flew over the Sea of Japan, and a case in which
PLA aircraft passed through Russian airspace and moved
into the Sea of Japan directly was observed.

China is anticipated to continue to expand and intensify

its activities in the Sea of Japan also in the future.

**(3) Activities of Chinese Ships Including Coast Guard**

**Vessels in the East China Sea (including Areas**
**around the Senkaku Islands)**

China Coast Guard vessels have been seen almost every
day in the contiguous zone of the Senkaku Islands, Japan’s
inherent territory, and repeatedly intruded into Japan’s
territorial waters. Since the activities of China Coast
Guard vessels based on China’s own assertion conducted
in Japan’s territorial waters around the Senkaku Islands
are violating international law, Japan has been strongly
protesting against these activities and requested them
to leave many times. Despite Japan’s strong protests,
however, Chinese Coast Guard vessels continued to
intrude into the Japanese territorial waters in FY2023.
Almost every month in 2023, China Coast Guard vessels
entered Japan’s territorial waters. During these intrusions,
Chinese Coast Guard vessels continuously navigated
in Japan’s territorial waters for more than 80 hours, the
longest time ever, from the end of March to the beginning
of April 2023. Incidents occurred in which China Coast
Guard ships attempted to approach Japanese fishing boats
when those Japanese boats were navigating in Japanese
territorial waters near the Senkaku Islands.

In the past, a China Maritime Surveillance vessel

intruded into Japan’s territorial waters for the first time in
December 2008. Since then, China Maritime Surveillance
vessels and China Fisheries Law Enforcement Command
vessels have gradually intensified their activities in
the Japanese territorial waters. Such activities have
intensified greatly since September 2012, when the
Japanese Government acquired three of the Senkaku
Islands (Uotsurishima Island, Kitakojima Island, and
Minamikojima Island).

China is seen to be steadily strengthening an operational

posture intended to use Coast Guard vessels to intrude
into Japan’s territorial waters. For example, the number
of vessels involved in each territorial sea intrusion was
about two to three until around 2016, whereas in recent
years, the number of four-vessel intrusions has increased.

like armament have repeatedly intruded into the Japanese
territorial waters. In 2023, Chinese Coast Guard vessels
were confirmed to be active in the contiguous waters
around the Senkaku Islands, with the number of active
days reaching 352 days and the total number of active
vessels reaching 1,282, both the highest ever.

Cases indicating the improvement of China Coast

Guard vessels’ operational capabilities have been also
confirmed. From February to July 2021, China Coast
Guard vessels were seen in the contiguous zone of the
Senkaku Islands for a record 157 consecutive days.

In December 2012, a fixed-wing aircraft of the State

Oceanic Administration was identified as the first Chinese
aircraft to intrude into Japan’s airspace around the
Senkaku Islands. In May 2017, it was confirmed that an
object that appeared to be a small drone was flying above
a China Coast Guard vessel intruding into the Japanese
territorial waters around the Senkaku Islands. This flight
also constitutes an invasion of Japan’s territorial airspace.

China has thus relentlessly continued attempts to

unilaterally change the status quo by force in the sea area
around the Senkaku Islands, leading to a grave matter of
concern. Japan cannot accept China’s actions to escalate
the situation.

In addition, in the East China Sea, China continues

to engage in unilateral resource development activities
even though the boundaries between Japan’s Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ) and continental shelf and those of
China have not yet been demarcated. Since June 2013, it
has been confirmed that construction work is progressing
on a new offshore platform in addition to the four offshore
platforms installed on the Chinese side of the JapanChi “M di Li ” i th E t Chi S i t th


“2008 Agreement” on resource development in the East
China Sea, and Japan has repeatedly protested against
the ongoing unilateral development by China, and at the
same time strongly requested that the work be halted.

In July 2023, a buoy was found within the Japan’s

EEZ on the east side of the geographical median line
in the East China Sea. The buoy was believed to be
installed by China. Japan has lodged a protest with
China regarding this matter, and is also demanding its
immediate removal.

and Total Incursions into the Territorial Waters Around the
Senkaku Islands by Ships Belonging to the China Coast Guard
Bureau, etc.)

**(4) Trends of Activities around Taiwan**
China has intensified military activities around Taiwan.
According to announcements from the Ministry of
National Defense of Taiwan, entry into airspace around
Taiwan has been increasing since September 2020. The
total number of aircraft that entered was over 970 in
2021, and that number increased significantly from 2021
to over 1,700 aircraft in 2022 and 2023. Furthermore,
the Ministry announced that other aircraft such as attack
helicopters, air refueling tankers, and UAVs have been
reportedly observed entering the airspace since 2021, in
addition to conventional fighters and bombers. Taiwan’s
Minister of National Defense stated at the Legislative
Yuan in May 2023 that Chinese naval vessels are
deployed in the waters surrounding Taiwan, and that
since around the end of 2022 they have been regularly
deployed also in eastern Taiwan.

Furthermore, since August 2022, China has frequently

surrounding Taiwan.

On August 2, 2022, China announced the setting of

six training areas surrounding Taiwan, and conducting “a
series of integrated military operations” around Taiwan,
in conjunction with the visit of Nancy Pelosi, Speaker
of the U.S. House of Representatives (then) to Taiwan.
China launched nine ballistic missiles on August 4, 2022,
five of which landed within the Japan’s EEZ, an another
landed at the closest point to Japanese territory, which
was about 80 km from Yonagunijima Island. This is a
serious issue relating to Japan’s security and the safety of
its people and was perceived as a threat to local residents.
In addition, some of the missiles passed over Taiwan.
After that, the PLA continued the large-scale military
exercise covering subjects such as joint blockage, sea
and ground attack, air superiority combat, and antisubmarine warfare in air space and sea space around
Taiwan for about one week. It is probable that, in this
military exercise, China may have rehearsed some parts
of a Taiwan invasion operation, such as the blockade
of Taiwan, ground/ship attacks, the acquisition of sea/
air superiority in wartime, and gray-zone situations,
including cyber attacks and “cognitive warfare.”

In addition, in response to then President Tsai Ing
wen’s meeting with Kevin McCarthy, then Speaker of
the U.S. House of Representatives on April 5 (local time)
during her visit to the United States as a stopover for her
tour of Central America in April 2023, China conducted
large-scale military exercises in the sea and airspace
around Taiwan from April 8 to 10, involving numerous
naval vessels and aircraft, including the aircraft carrier
“Shandong.” China announced that simulated joint
accurate attacks to important targets in Taiwan and the sea
area around Taiwan and joint blockage by several services
were executed in these exercises. It is viewed that China
may have rehearsed some parts of a Taiwan invasion
operation, following the exercise in August 2022.

In August 2023, in response to then Vice President

Lai Ching-te’s stopover in the United States on the way
to South America, China conducted military exercises
and deployed numerous ships and aircraft on the 19th
of the same month. China announced that this military
exercise practiced the coordination of ships and aircraft,
as well as the acquisition of air and sea superiority. Part
of the invasion strategy against Taiwan was probably
rehearsed here as well. It was pointed out, however, that

the exercise was small in scale compared to those in
August 2022 and April 2023.

In addition, in May 2024, in response to Lai’s

inauguration as president on the 20[th], China conducted
a large-scale military exercise from the 23rd to the 24th
in the sea and airspace around Taiwan, including remote
islands such as Kinmen Islands. A large number of naval
vessels and aircrafts was involved.

Furthermore, according to an announcement by

Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense, the Chinese
military has repeatedly entered the airspace east of
China-Taiwan “Median Line[34]” in the Taiwan Strait
since Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.

It is believed that through the series of activities

around Taiwan, China seeks to create a fait accompli that
the Chinese military is continuously operating there and
improve its actual combat capabilities.

These intensified military activities indicates a

situation, where a possibility could not be excluded that
tension between China and Taiwan rises in the military
sense. The stability of the situation surrounding Taiwan
is important not only for Japan’s national security, but
also for the stability of the international community,
and Japan needs to pay close attention to it with an even
greater sense of urgency.


**(5) Trends of Activities in the South China Sea**
China has also been intensifying its activities based on
assertions, which are conflicting with existing laws and
orders of the seas, in the South China Sea, including
waters around the Spratly Islands and the Paracel Islands,
over which territorial disputes exist with neighbors,

**Chinese Military Trends Concerning Taiwan**


Since the Chinese military conducted an exercise including ballistic
missile launches following then Speaker of the U.S. House of

**Commentary**

Representatives Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August 2020, it has been
pointed out that China has been intensifying its naval and aircraft
activities around Taiwan. Here, we will look at the Chinese military’s
movements around Taiwan from August 2022 to the end of 2023,
focusing on the activities of aircraft and naval vessels, based on
announcements from Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense (MND).

The first topic is aircraft activities. Since August 2022, the

number of aircraft entering Taiwan’s airspace announced by
Taiwan’s MND has been increasing. From January to July 2022,
there were approximately 620 aircraft entering the airspace,
and from August to December, there were approximately 1,110,
bringing the total number of aircraft entering the airspace in 2022
to nearly double the number (approximately 970) of that in 2021.
The same level of activity was maintained in 2023. Since August
2022, the Chinese military has been continuously conducting
activities that cross the “median line” of the Taiwan Strait. Following
the Chinese military exercise conducted in response to the visit to
the United States by then vice president Lai Ching-te, Chinese
military aircraft began to fly for longer distance alongside of the
east side of the “median line”after crossing the “median line”.

Based on the flight track chart released by Taiwan’s MND, it

appears that the operating airspace of Chinese military aircraft
has traditionally been centered on Taiwan’s southwest. However,
from August 2022 onwards, in addition to the aforementioned
flights crossing the aforementioned median line, activities moving
from Taiwan’s southwest airspace into the western Pacific Ocean
seem to be increasing. Regarding activities in the Western Pacific,
the Chinese military conducted aircraft training using the aircraft
carrier Shandong in 2023. During a military exercise coinciding with
then president Tsai Ing-wen’s visit to the United States in April of
the same year, it was announced that J-15 carrier-based aircraft
entered Taiwan’s eastern airspace for the first time. Regarding the
Western Pacific deployment of the Shandong in September of the
same year, Taiwan’s defense minister pointed out that the Chinese
military conducted war-gaming training with the aircraft carrier as
an opposing force. These training are believed to have practiced a
pincer attack on Taiwan from the east and west and preventing thirdcountry intervention. In addition, it was announced that the Chinese
military’s reconnaissance drones and surveillance and attack drones
have circled Taiwan multiple times since April 2023. It has been
pointed out that the airspace in which Chinese military aircraft
operate is gradually expanding from the conventionally established

t f T i ’ th t i t T i


Regarding the types of aircraft involved, the activities of fighters,

bombers, manned mission support aircraft such as intelligencegathering aircraft, as well as the activities of unmanned aircraft
since September 2022 have also been announced. As for military
exercises around Taiwan, the ratio of unmanned aircraft and
manned mission support aircraft increased in the April 2023
exercises compared to the August 2022 exercises, suggesting that
the content of the exercises has deepened to a more practical level.

The next topic is the status of naval vessel activities. Previously,

the number of Chinese military vessels that Taiwan’s defense
claimed to have confirmed in the waters surrounding Taiwan had
remained at three to four per day since late September 2022.
However, following military exercises in April 2023, the average
daily number of Chinese military vessels confirmed by the end of the
same year increased to approximately 5.8. Furthermore, Taiwan’s
defense minister has pointed out that since the end of 2022,
Chinese military vessels have been regularly deployed in Taiwan’s
eastern waters. As a matter of fact, since March 2023, it has been
announced that patrol helicopters, which appear to be carrier-based,
have been operating intermittently on the eastern side of Taiwan in
addition to the conventional western side operations. In this way, the
Chinese military is believed to be increasing the number of naval
ships deployed to the waters surrounding Taiwan and building up
the posture of constant deployment to encircle Taiwan.

Given these developments, the Chinese military seems to seek a

fait accompli that its aircraft and naval vessels are regularly operating
in the sea and airspace surrounding Taiwan, and improve its actual
combat capabilities through measures such as increasing operational
proficiency and intelligence gathering in the sea and airspace
surrounding Taiwan. Due to this escalation of coercive military
activities by China, concerns about the peace and stability of the
Taiwan Strait are rapidly growing not only in the Indo-Pacific region,

including Japan, but also in the entire international community.

including some member states of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

Since 2014, on seven features of the Spratly Islands

(Fiery Cross Reef, Subi Reef, Mischief Reef, Cuarteron
Reef, Gaven Reefs, Hughes Reef, and Johnson South
Reef), China pressed ahead with large-scale and rapid
land reclamation. The Philippines-China arbitration
award issued in July 2016 denied the “historic rights”
as the basis of the “nine-dash line” claimed by China,
and determined the illegality of China’s activities such
as land reclamation. However, China has made it clear
that it would not comply with this decision and is
currently continuing military activities while promoting
the development of military facilities, such as batteries,
and various kinds of infrastructure that can be used for
military purposes, including runways, ports, hangars,
and radar facilities, to militarize these features.

On Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs, called the

Big Three of the Spratly Islands, China has developed
batteries for anti-aircraft guns, missile shelters,
underground storage facilities pointed out to be
munitions storage, large ports capable of accommodating
combatant ships and runways available for takeoff and
landing of fighters and bombers.

Chinese military activities have been frequently

pointed out at Fiery Cross Reef, Subi Reef, and Mischief
Reef. In May 2020, it was reported that Y-8 patrol aircraft
and Y-9 early warning aircraft may have been deployed
on a rotational basis to Fiery Cross Reef. Additionally, in
April 2018, it was reported that anti-ship cruise missiles
and surface-to-air missiles were deployed on Fiery Cross,
Subi and Mischief Reefs for military training and that
radar jamming systems were deployed on Mischief Reef.

On the other four features, it is pointed out that the

construction of facilities, such as harbors, helipads, and
radars, has made progress and that what appears to be
large anti-aircraft guns and a close-in weapon system
(CIWS) may have already been deployed. Furthermore,
in December 2022, it was reported that new construction
activities were being carried out on the other four features
in the Spratly Islands.

If these features of the Spratly Islands are used for

full-scale military purposes, it could significantly change
the security environment in the Indo-Pacific region.

China carried out the militarization of the Paracel

Islands before that of the Spratly Islands. China has
reportedly extended the runway to nearly 3,000 m on


Woody Island since 2013. Since 2015, fighter jets such
as the J-11 and J-10 have been deployed, and since 2016,
the presence of equipment that appears to be surface-toair missiles has been confirmed. In August 2023, new
construction activities were reported to be underway on
Triton Island.

In recent years, Chinese vessels have allegedly been

conducting what are likely to be survey activities in
Scarborough Shoal, where a standoff took place between
Chinese and Philippine government ships in April
2012. It is pointed out that new land reclamations on
the shoal might be seen in the future. It is also pointed
out that if China conducts land reclamations and installs
radar facilities, runways, and other infrastructure on
Scarborough Shoal, it could possibly increase its ability
for situation awareness and power projection capabilities
in the surrounding sea area and ultimately enhance its
operational capabilities throughout all the areas of the
South China Sea.

Also, it has been pointed out that if China were to

consider bastion operations (fortification) to enhance the
survivability of new types of long-range SLBMs capable
of hitting the U.S. mainland, the South China Sea would
be the suitable choice.[35] Attention must continue to be
paid to the situation in the South China Sea going forward.

The activities in the sea and airspace in the area are

expanding and intensifying as well. For example, in 2016
after the Philippines-China arbitral award, Chinese Air
Force H-6K bombers conducted “combat patrol flights” in
the airspace near Scarborough Shoal in July and August,
and the Chinese Ministry of National Defense announced
that these patrols would be “regularized” in the future. In
September, a joint Chinese-Russian naval exercise called
“Maritime Cooperation 2016” was held in the South
China Sea for the first time. It was reported in December
that a H-6 bombers flew along the “nine-dash line.

In 2020, when the establishment of new administrative

regions called “Xisha (Paracel) District” and “Nansha
(Spratly) District” under Sansha City, Hainan Province
was unilaterally announced, in July, China conducted
simultaneous military exercises in three sea areas
(South China Sea, East China Sea, and Yellow Sea)
and is believed to have launched middle-range ballistic
missiles in August.

These vigorous activities of the Chinese military have

been remarkable even in recent years. Since May 2021,
there have been frequent reports of training exercises

involving carrier-based aircraft takeoff from and landing In this way, it appears that China seeks to expand its
on the aircraft carrier Shandong. In December of the same presence and enhance war-sustaining and other joint

class landing ships conducted a series of exercises in the
South China Sea, and that exercises were conducted at
several locations on Hainan Island facing the South China
Sea. It was pointed out that the latter exercises in particular
were possibly exercises simulating an amphibious
operation using Hainan Island against Taiwan.

In addition, there were incidents in which Chinese

naval vessels or other ships approached or obstructed
U.S. military vessels operating in the sea and airspace
of this region, as well as incidents in which Chinese
military aircraft approached U.S. military aircraft.[36] In
October 2023, the U.S. Department of Defense released
videos of 15 cases in which Chinese military aircraft
took dangerous actions against U.S. military aircraft
flying over the East China Sea and South China Sea.


In this way, it appears that China seeks to expand its

presence and enhance war-sustaining and other joint
operational capabilities including military and other
means in the South China Sea.

Such activities conducted by China based on its own

assertions, which are conflicting with existing laws and
orders of the seas, further advance unilateral changes to
the status quo by force and efforts to create a fait accompli.
Japan is deeply concerned about these activities, and
the concern is shared with the international community,
including the United States and other G7 Member States.

The issues surrounding the South China Sea are

directly related to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific
region and are a legitimate concern not only for Japan,
which has major sea lanes in the South China Sea, but
also for the entire international community. Countries
concerned, including China, are urged to refrain from
unilateral actions that heighten tension and act on the

**(6) Trends in the Indian Ocean and Other More Distant**

**Waters**

The Chinese Navy is considered to be shifting towards
“protection missions on the far seas” and has been
steadily increasing its capabilities to conduct operations
in more distant waters, such as the Indian Ocean, in
recent years. Progress has been seen in the Navy’s
development of such equipment as large combatant ships
and replenishment ships and in its operational initiatives,
such as deployment to distant sea areas and securing
bases for this purpose.

Since December 2008, Chinese naval vessels have

been deployed off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf
of Aden to take part in international counter-piracy
efforts. The dispatched vessels have conducted joint
training exercises with the militaries of other countries
in the Indian Ocean and elsewhere.[37] In 2023, they
conducted joint exercises with the Russian and South
African navies in the waters off Durban in eastern South
Africa in February, and with the Pakistan navy in the
northern Arabian Sea in November. In March 2024, they
conducted joint exercises with the Russian and Iranian
navies in the northern Indian Ocean. Retrospectively
in May 2015, China and Russia had conducted a joint
naval exercise called “Maritime Cooperation” in the
Mediterranean Sea and elsewhere.

China has also deployed a space observation support

ship in the southern Pacific and dispatched a military
hospital ship to waters including the southern Pacific
as well as those near Latin America under “Mission
Harmony.”

In September 2015, five Chinese naval vessels

reportedly sailed in the high seas of the Bering Sea and
in U.S. territorial waters near the Aleutian Islands. In
September 2022 and August 2023, Russia announced
that Chinese vessels participating in joint navigation


with Russia sailed through the Bering Sea. China has
deployed the vessels such as the polar research vessel
Xue Long 2 to the Arctic Ocean in total 13 times since
1999;[38] moreover, in January 2018, China published
a white paper entitled “China’s Arctic Policy,” which
mapped out a policy of active involvement in Arctic
initiatives, including efforts to build a “Polar Silk Road”
through the development of Arctic sea routes. It is
pointed out that China could take advantage of scientific
survey and commercial activities to increase its presence
including military activities in the Arctic sea.[39]

Additionally, China has been remarkably trying to

secure overseas outposts such as harbors. For example, in
August 2017, China began to operate a “support base” for
logistics support of the PLA in Djibouti facing the Gulf of
Aden. The Chinese military is said to be considering and
planning to establish military logistics facilities in multiple
countries, including Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand,
Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates,
Kenya, Equatorial Guinea, Seychelles, Tanzania, Angola,
Nigeria, Namibia, Mozambique, Bangladesh, Papua New
Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Tajikistan.[40] China has
been promoting its “Belt and Road” Initiative (BRI) whose
main purpose is advertised as establishing an economic
zone in regions including the Eurasian continent, with the
Chinese military possibly taking on the role of the shield
behind the initiative by such means as the stabilization of
areas via counter-piracy activities and the improvement
of counter-terrorism capabilities in coastal states through
bilateral and multilateral exercises. While it is thought
that the initiative includes a strategic intention to expand
its influence in the region, it is possible that the initiative
will further improve the PLA’s operational capabilities
in the Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean and elsewhere. For
example, China’s support for the construction of port
infrastructure in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and
other Indian Ocean countries as well as Pacific island
countries including Vanuatu could lead China to secure
outposts available for its military purposes.

**37 In addition to military exercises, port calls to countries along the Indian Ocean coast are also frequent.**
**38 In 2012, Xue Long became the first polar research vessel to sail across the Arctic Ocean. In 2013, the cargo freighter Yong Sheng became the first Chinese commercial ship to cross the**

Arctic Ocean. Canadian scientists took part in Xue Long’s voyage to the Arctic Ocean in 2017, and they succeeded for the first time in trial navigation of the Arctic Northwest Passage (along
the north coast of Canada). Furthermore, its second polar research vessel Xue Long 2 completed its first Arctic Sea cruising in September 2020, and China is promoting research and
construction of a heavy icebreaker.

**39 According to the annual report “Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China,” U.S. DoD (2019)**


-----

of the Chinese Navy and Air Force, it is believed that they
have been expanding military capabilities to cover distant
waters beyond China’s near seas.

Given these objectives of China’s water and airspace

activities and recent trends, it is believed that China plans
to further expand the sphere of its activities, and further
intensify its operations in waters surrounding Japan,
including the East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean, as
well as in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean.

**7** **International Military Activities**


**Belt and Road Initiative**


A concept for an economic sphere proposed by President Xi Jinping. The
“Silk Road Economic Belt” (“One Belt”) and the “21st Century Maritime
Silk Road” (“One Road”) were announced in September and October 2013,
respectively. Since then, the two concepts are collectively referred to as the
“Belt and Road” Initiative.

**(7) Objectives of Activities in Waters and Airspace**
The development and activities of Chinese naval and
air forces, descriptions in defense white papers, China’s
geographical conditions and globalizing economy, and
other factors indicate that the recent water and airspace
activities of the Navy, Air Force and other Chinese
organizations have the following objectives:

The first is to intercept operations by adversaries in

waters and airspace as far as possible from China in
order to defend its territorial land, waters and airspace.
Behind this objective is an increase in the effectiveness
of long-range attacks due to recent progress in science
and technology.

The second is to develop capabilities to deter and

prevent Taiwan’s independence. China maintains that
it will not allow any foreign intervention in solving the
Taiwan issue and realizing the unification of China.
To ensure the prevention of foreign intervention in the
Taiwan issue, China needs to enhance its operational
capabilities at sea and airspace as Taiwan is surrounded
by the sea in all directions.

The third is to weaken the control of other countries on

islands and China’s one-sided claims on their sovereignty
and marine interests, by means of various surveillance
activities and the use of force in the waters and airspace
surrounding these islands. Such activities of China are
considered to also have the purpose of creating a fait
accompli as part of the reasons for unilaterally changing
the status quo and justifying China’s claims based on its
own concept of “legal warfare.”

The fourth is to acquire, maintain, and protect its

maritime rights and interests. China is engaged in oil
and gas drilling as well as fishing and navigating in the
East and South China Seas. In order for these activities
to continue safely and stably, the Chinese military is
believed to be playing a role as a backstop, deterring the
activities of maritime law enforcement organizations of
other countries through its military presence.

The fifth is to defend its sea lanes of communications.

In the background is the fact that its sea lanes, including its
oil transportation routes from the Middle East, are essential

In recent years, the PLA has been indicating its positive
attitude on nontraditional security missions such as
peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief, and counterpiracy, dispatching numerous units for
such overseas missions.

China has vowed to consistently support and actively

participate in UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKOs),
increasing its presence in UN PKOs.

According to the UN, as of the end of November 2023,

China had a total of 2,267 personnel including troops and
police members - the largest number of peacekeepers
among the permanent members of the UN Security
Council - engaged in the United Nations Mission in South
Sudan (UNMISS). The Chinese share has remained the
second largest, after the U.S. share, since 2016.

Moreover, China has been actively participating in

counter-piracy activities off the coast of Somalia and in
the Gulf of Aden as well as humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief activities.

It is pointed out that factors behind such Chinese

attitude include the growing need for protecting and
promoting China’s national interests overseas following
the expansion of national interests beyond its national
borders, China’s attempt to verify military capabilities
including units’ long-distance deployment, its intent
to raise its status by demonstrating its will to fulfill its
responsibilities to the international community, its hope
to diffuse the military’s peaceful and humanitarian
images, and its attempt to enhance relations with PKO
regions including African countries.

inter theater exercises, and large exercises including
distant ones, as well as night-time exercises and joint
exercises with other countries, in order to strengthen its
operational capabilities.

In the education spectrum as well, the PLA aims

to train soldiers who have the ability to execute joint
operations. It was reported in 2017 that the PLA National
Defense University began training to develop human
resources capable of directing joint operations.

China has been developing defense mobilization

systems and others in order to effectively utilize private
resources in case of emergencies, including wars. The
military use of civilian resources includes civilian ships’
transportation of military equipment. As such initiative
generally augments China’s forces available for military
missions and is expected to proactively be promoted in
the future, the initiative’s implications for the Chinese
military forces’ operational capabilities should be
watched closely.

in the technology area. China promotes two way
technological exchanges where military technologies
are utilized for developing the national economy while
civilian technologies are absorbed for national defense
development. It also seems interested in absorbing
foreign technologies available both for military and
civilian purposes. It is pointed out that China’s civilmilitary fusion policy gives priority to initiatives in seas,
outer space, cyber, artificial intelligence (AI), and other
emerging areas for China. The U.S. DoD has pointed out
that civil-military fusion includes six mutually related
efforts: (1) fusion of China’s defense industrial base with
its civilian technology and industrial base, (2) integration
and use of scientific and technological innovation across
military and civilian sectors, (3) human resources
development and mixing of military and civilian expertise
and knowledge, (4) incorporation of military requirements
into civilian infrastructure and use of civilian structures for
military purposes, (5) use of civilian services and logistics
capabilities for military purposes, and (6) expansion and
deepening of China’s defense mobilization system in a
manner that includes all relevant aspects of society and
economy for use in competition and war.[43][,][44]

In addition, in recent years, China has reportedly

promoted the standardization of civilian products for
their military adoption from the production stage under
the civil-military fusion policy. This initiative is expected
to allow the military to utilize civilian resources more
effectively.

As the growth rate of defense spending has slowed in

recent years, the civil-military fusion policy is expected
to become increasingly important for China, which
must balance building up its defense and its economy.
In addition, in order to realize the aforementioned
“intelligentized warfare” advocated by China, it
is key to acquire advanced civilian technologies,
including so-called game-changing technologies, that
would dramatically change future warfare. Therefore,
because China’s civil-military fusion policy is seen
as an indispensable means to achieve this, this policy,
including its relationship to “intelligentized warfare,”
must continue to be monitored with serious concern.

Under the State Administration of Science, Technology
and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND) of the
Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, a
department of the State Council, China’s main national
defense industry had consisted of 10 corporations to
develop and produce nuclear weapons, missiles and
rockets, aircraft, vessels, information systems and other
military equipment. It is pointed out that China was the
fourth largest weapon supplier in the world as of 2022.[41]

While China imports highly sophisticated military

equipment and parts that it cannot produce domestically
from other countries such as Russia, it is believed that
China places emphasis on the enhancement of its military
industrial sector, including the domestic production of
equipment, to modernize its military. It has been pointed
out that China is acquiring technologies ambitiously
not only through domestic technology research and
development and foreign direct investment, but also via
illegal means in the form of secret information theft.[42]

China’s civil-military fusion policy has been evident

China-led multilateral mechanisms in many fields such
as security, growth, and development[45] to influence
political decisions in other countries through efforts such
as winning over foreign politicians.[46]

At the same time, China recognizes that a peaceful

and stable international environment is necessary for
maintaining sustainable economic development and
enhancing China’s overall national power. Based on such
recognition, China has advocated building a “community
of shared future for mankind” and referred to promoting
the building of “a new type of international relations President Xi Jinping and President Putin holding a China-Russia summit meeting in October

On the military front, since the 1990s, China has

purchased modern weapons from Russia, including
fighters, destroyers, and submarines. Russia is currently
the largest supplier of weapons to China.[47] Although
China-Russia arms transactions in value in recent years
have been lower than in some past period, China has
apparently continued to indicate its strong interests in
importing advanced Russian defense equipment and in
joint equipment development with Russia. For example,
China has introduced what are believed to be the latest
fourth generation Su-35 fighters and the S-400 surface-toair missile system from Russia. China has been reported
as the first country to import the Russian S-400. It is also
suggested that Russia has concerns about competing
with China in arms exports taking into consideration
China’s improvement of technological power.

Military exchanges between China and Russia take

place in such forms as routine mutual visits by senior
military officers and bilateral and multilateral exercises.
For example, China and Russia have been conducting
large-scale joint naval exercises called “Maritime
Cooperation” since 2012, including the first in the South
China Sea in 2016 and the first in the Baltic Sea and the
Sea of Okhotsk in 2017.

In addition, moves indicating deepened China-Russia

relations have been confirmed in recent years. In the two
countries’ “first joint strategic flight” of bombers in July
2019, their bombers joined in the Sea of Japan and flew
to the East China Sea. In September the same year, China
and Russia signed a series of documents on cooperation in
the military and military technologies.[48] In October 2021,
as a continuation of the joint naval exercise “Maritime
Cooperation 2021,” a total of ten Chinese and Russian
warships conducted joint navigation around Japan under
the title “First Maritime Joint Patrol.” Furthermore, at
the China-Russia Defense Ministers’ online meeting
held in November the same year, both sides agreed to
expand cooperation in areas such as “strategic exercises”
and “joint patrols.” The joint statement issued after the
China-Russia summit meeting in March 2023 specified
that the two countries would regularly conduct “joint
patrols” and “joint exercises” at sea and in the air.

Supporting these trends, China and Russia have

continued to mutually participate in military exercises
since 2018. In 2018, the Chinese military participated


in Vostok 2018, which is considered the largest post
Cold War exercise by the Russian military, followed by
Tsentr 2019 in 2019, Kavkaz 2020 in 2020, and Vostok
2022 in 2022.[49] The Russian military also participated in
“Western Joint-2021” conducted by the Chinese Army’s
Western Theater Command in 2021, and in “Northern
Joint-2023” conducted by the Northern Theater
Command in 2023. China likely regards these exchanges
as an opportunity to learn about how to operate Russianmade weapons and the operational doctrine of the
Russian Armed Forces, which have combat experiences.

Furthermore, bombers of Russia and China have

flown long distance jointly around Japan a total of seven
times since the joint flight in July 2019 mentioned above,
namely, in December 2020, November 2021, May and
November 2022, and June and December 2023. Among
others, the joint flight in May 2022 was with stronger
provocation than ever because it was intended for
demonstration of force against Japan, which was holding
a Japan-U.S.-Australia-India summit meeting at that
time. During joint flights in November of the same year,
it was said that a Chinese aircraft landed at an airfield in
Russia for the first time, and a Russian aircraft landed
at an airfield in China for the first time. In June 2023,
joint flights were conducted over a two-day period for
the first time, and flights involving a total of 20 fighter
jets were also confirmed, showing the diversification of
their activities.

Regarding activities by Chinese and Russian

naval vessels, in addition to the aforementioned joint
navigation in October 2021, joint navigations around
Japan were carried out by Chinese and Russian naval
vessels centering on participating warships of the
aforementioned “Vostok 2022” in September 2022 and
by Chinese and Russian naval vessels centering on
participating warships of the aforementioned “Northern
Union-2023” from July to August 2023. During the joint
navigation conducted in 2023, it is said that more than
50 combat training exercises were conducted. Before
and after the joint navigation, ships participating in it
made port calls to each other’s countries for the first
time, which indicated a diversification of their activities.
Moreover, in June 2022, naval vessels of both countries
navigated separately one week apart around Japan in
almost an orbital manner.

Under these principles, China, while agreeing to UN
Security Council resolutions until 2017 to enhance
sanctions on North Korea, cooperated with Russia in
proposing a draft resolution including lifting some of the
sanctions based on UNSC resolutions recently. In May
2022, China exercised its power of veto with Russia to
a draft resolution for sanctions proposed by the United
States in response to North Korea’s launching of ICBMclass ballistic missiles.

Although China has vowed to have seriously observed

its international obligations, it has been pointed out
that Chinese ships have been involved in illicit shipto-ship transfer prohibited by the UN Security Council
resolutions.

**4** **Relations with Other Countries**


In July 2016, an arbitration award based on the United

Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)
adjudicating the Philippines’ case against China in
the South China Sea was rendered, accepting most
of the Philippine claims. Under these circumstances,
in recent years there have been frequent reports of
sabotage activities against Philippine ships by vessels
belonging to the Chinese Coast Guard. In November
2022, the Philippines announced that China Coast Guard
interrupted a Philippine navy boat that collected a floating
object and tried to take it back with them, and the Chinese
ship then took it by force. Since August 2023, there have
been numerous reports of the Chinese Coast Guard and
others allegedly interfering with Philippine ships and
other vessels attempting to replenish the Philippine
warship Sierra Madre stranded on the Second Thomas
Shoal. Of these, collisions between Chinese Coast Guard
vessels and Philippine vessels are said to have occurred
in October and December 2023, and March 2024. In
September 2023, the Philippine Coast Guard issued a
statement criticizing the Chinese side after the Chinese
Coast Guard installed a floating barrier on Scarborough
Shoal, and later announced that the Philippine Coast
Guard had removed it.

China and Vietnam have territorial disputes and

oil drilling issues in the South China Sea. In August
2023, it was reported that a Vietnamese fishing boat
was damaged in the Paracel Islands after being sprayed
with water from a vessel believed to be a Chinese Coast
Guard vessel. Meanwhile, in the demarcated maritime
boundary waters of the Gulf of Tonkin, the militaries of
both countries have been conducting regular joint naval
patrols since 2006. In November 2023, the Vietnamese
military participated for the first time in the multilateral
exercise “Peace and Friendship-2023” hosted by the
Chinese military in Southeast Asia.

China and ASEAN have continued talks to discuss the

formulation of the Code of Conduct of Parties in the South
China Sea (COC). In July 2019, China announced at the
Chinese and ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ meeting that they
had completed the first reading of the Single Draft COC
Negotiating Text. Subsequently, a second reading was
initiated. At the August 2021 ASEAN Foreign Ministers’
Meeting, it was noted that a provisional agreement on
the Preamble had been reached. In the Joint Statement
of the ASEAN-China Special Summit in November of

**(1) Relations with Southeast Asian Countries**
As for its relations with countries in Southeast Asia,
reciprocal summit-level visits and other activities
continue to be actively carried out. China is also actively
involved in multilateral frameworks such as ASEAN Plus
One (China), ASEAN Plus Three (Japan, China and the
ROK), East Asia Summit (EAS) and ASEAN Regional
Forum (ARF). Furthermore, China has developed
bilateral relations through infrastructure development
support, etc., under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
On the military front, there seems to be moves that China
has made efforts toward military confidence building,
such as the first ASEAN-China Maritime Field Training
Exercise, which took place in October 2018.

Moreover, the possibility of China using part of

Cambodia’s Ream Naval Base exclusively has been
pointed out. Concerning this matter, the Cambodian side
denied the existence of such a fact, saying that hosting
foreign military bases is against its Constitution. In
addition, in June 2021, Cambodia’s Minister of National
Defense acknowledged that China had contributed to
the development of the Ream Naval Base. However, he
stated that access to the base facilities was not limited
to China alone. Against this backdrop, a Chinese naval
vessel reportedly entered the Ream Naval Base in

relations with Sri Lanka. To Sri Lanka, which is located
at a strategic point in the Indian Ocean and supports the
BRI, China has provided massive economic and technical
cooperation in infrastructure development, including for
railroads, ports, and airports. On the other hand, in July
2017, an agreement was reached to lend interests for 99
years to Chinese enterprises at the Port of Hambantota,
which is being constructed with Chinese loans. Some
have noted that this constitutes what has been described
as a “debt trap.” President Wickremesinghe took office
in July 2022, and continues discussions with creditor
countries including China to resolve the debt problem.
Chinese tracking ship Yuan Wang 5 reportedly operated
by the PLA Strategic Support Force entered the Port of
Hambantota in August 2022.

**(4) Relations with European Countries**
For China, the European Union (EU) countries are
increasingly in its presence especially in the economic
field.

European countries possess more advanced military

technologies than China or Russia regarding information
and communication technology, avionics/aeroengines, air
independence propulsion (AIP) systems for submarines,
and elsewhere. The EU countries have maintained their
arms embargo on China since the Tiananmen Square
incident in 1989, and China has requested them to lift the
embargo.[50] If the EU arms embargo on China were lifted,
sophisticated military technologies could be transferred
to China and to third countries via China, dramatically
changing the secuårity environment in the Indo-Pacific
and other regions.

China’s recent rise has attracted attention from NATO

as well. The new strategic concept announced at a
NATO summit meeting in June 2022 states that “China’s
ambition and coercive policies challenge NATO’s
interests, security, and values,” and expressed concern
over rapid enhancement of nuclear forces, absence of
transparency, and malicious hybrid and cyber activities.
Based on this, it mentioned that NATO will be engaged
with China for the alliance’s security interests, and to
prevent China’s coercive actions to divide the NATO.

China’s relations with European countries, including

EU discussions on the arms embargo on China and
NATO’s policy on engagement with China, should be
continuously watched.

**(2) Relations with Central Asian Countries**
The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, located in
the western part of China, is situated next to Central
Asia. Therefore, China is deeply concerned about
the political stability and security situations, such
as terrorism by Islamic extremists, in Central Asian
states. Such concerns of China appear to be reflected in
China’s tightened border control and its engagement in
the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and the
stabilization of Afghanistan. Moreover, China is strongly
interested in Central Asia, with a view to diversifying its
supply sources and procurement methods for resources.
China promotes cooperation in the energy field with
Central Asian countries, such as the construction of oil
and natural gas pipelines between China and Central
Asian nations.

**(3) Relations with South Asian Countries**
China has a close relationship with Pakistan under their
“all-weather strategic partnership,” and mutual visits
by their summit leaders take place frequently. Their
cooperation in the military sector, including bilateral
exercises, exporting weapons, and transferring military
technology, is also deepening. As the importance of
sea lanes increases for China, it is believed that the
importance of Pakistan is rising for China accordingly,
partly because of the geopolitical features of Pakistan
which faces the Indian Ocean.

Although economic ties between China and India are

strengthening, the two countries have not demarcated
their borders in areas such as Kashmir and Arunachal
Pradesh.

In May 2020, a clash between Chinese and Indian

forces occurred near the China-India border in Ladakh,
India, and tensions between the two countries escalated
with the first deadly clash in 45 years on June 15
of the same year. Since then, China and India have
regularly held commander-level meetings based on the
management agreement for the Line of Actual Control, a
temporary border between the two countries. Currently,
the countries are still continuing efforts to gradually ease
tensions.

been moving to enhance military relations with Fiji and
Tonga. While China has been enhancing relations with
Pacific island nations, Australia and some other countries
have expressed concerns about such Chinese moves.

**(5) Relations with Middle East and African Countries,**

**and Pacific Island countries**

China has been enhancing its relations with Middle
Eastern and African nations in the economic realm. In
recent years, it has also strengthened military relations
with them. Not only intensive interactions among state
leaders and senior military officials but also arms exports
and exchanges between military forces are actively
conducted. China also actively dispatches personnel
to undertake UN PKO in Africa. Some suspect that
underlying these movements could be China’s aim to
ensure a stable supply of natural resources and to secure
overseas bases in the future.

China is Australia’s biggest trade partner. However,

the relations of the two countries have deteriorated, such
as China’s successive restriction on importing Australian
beef and other goods, since April 2020 when Australia
suggested the necessity for an independent investigation
into the origin of COVID-19 in China. Subsequently,
however, with the change of government in Australia, an
improvement in the relations has been sought.

China has also been boosting its relations with Pacific

island countries by providing them with proactive and
continuous economic support and medical services
deploying a military hospital ship. China is reportedly
promoting resources development in Papua New Guinea
and has repeatedly approached it about concluding
an agreement on defense and police cooperation.
Moreover, it was announced in April 2022 that China

China’s major arms export destinations include Pakistan,
Bangladesh, and Myanmar. China has also been
reportedly exporting arms to Algeria, Nigeria, and other
African countries, countries in Southeast Asia including
Thailand and Cambodia, Saudi Arabia, and other Middle
Eastern countries.[51]

Some claim that China has transferred weapons to

foreign countries in order to strengthen its strategic
relationships with friendly nations, enhance its influence
in the international community, and secure natural
resources. China has not participated in some of the
frameworks for international arms export control, and
some point out that missile-related and other technologies
have been transferred from China to other countries.

in November 2022. However, they made no concessions
in areas of conflict such as the Taiwan issue, human rights
issues, and on trade issues. United States Armed Forces
shot down a Chinese reconnaissance balloon that was
detected over the U.S. homeland in February 2023. The
U.S. Government communicated to China that the flight
was a clear violation of its sovereignty and of international
law, and postponed Secretary of State Blinken’s visit to
China scheduled in the same month. China insisted that
it was a privately owned weather observation airship
that strayed into U.S. territory due to force majeure and
expressed strong discontent with the shooting down of the
balloon by the United States and protested against it.

Against this backdrop, exchanges between the U.S.

and China, including between their military authorities,
slowed down, but efforts have been made to resume
exchanges since then. In November 2023, President Biden
held a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the
first time in about a year. They agreed to resume high-level
dialogue between military authorities, which the Chinese
side appears to have suspended in response to the shooting
down of its spy balloon. Additionally, they agreed to
resume consultations between their military authorities,
which had been suspended by China as a countermeasure
when then-House Speaker Pelosi visited Taiwan. In
December of the same year, a video conference was held
between the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff
and the Chief of the Joint Staff of the PLA, and exchanges
between the U.S. and China are gradually resuming.

Meanwhile, in the field of sensitive technologies and

critical technologies, where U.S.-China competition
is particularly conspicuous, the United States has
become increasingly wary of China. China promotes the
“intellectualization” of the PLA; for example, General
Secretary Xi of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),
stated in his report in the 20th CCP Congress in October
2022 that China “holds fast to merge and develop
mechanization, informatization, and intellectualization.”
Based on these movements, the Biden administration puts
effort into protecting and fostering sensitive technologies
and key technologies recognizing that U.S. security will
be threatened as a result of the strengthening of Chinese
military power due to leakage of sensitive and key


technologies from the United States and its allies. Aimed at
strengthening the competitiveness of the United States in
the semiconductor field, the “Creating Helpful Incentives
to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act”
was passed in August 2022 to support semiconductor
manufacturing companies in the United States financially,
while making it compulsory that the supported companies
agree with the Secretary of Commerce not to enhance
advanced semiconductor manufacturing facilities in
countries of particular concern including China for ten
years. In addition, the administration announced the
enhancement of Export Administration Regulations
related to semiconductors in October 2022 to limit the
ability of China to obtain and manufacture technologies
and products used in advanced military systems to
increase the accuracy and speed of military decision
making. In 2023, the Biden administration continued
to add companies that support the modernization of
China’s military to the Entity List,[1] which regulates
exports from the U.S.[2] In August of the same year, the
administration issued a presidential directive restricting
investment in China in three areas of national security
concern: semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum
technology information, and artificial intelligence.

On the other hand, China criticizes these measures

taken by the United States as malicious blockage of
Chinese companies. Moreover, in response to the
tightening of regulations by the United States and other
foreign countries, China has been enforcing a series of
countermeasures, such as laws and regulations, since
2020. In September 2020, China implemented its
Unreliable Entity List in response to the U.S. Entity List.
In December of the same year, China’s Export Control
Law entered into force to control the export of technology
and the like related to China’s national security and
interests. As further pushing back against the United
States measures, in January 2021, China passed new
rules to protect its firms from “unjustified extra-territorial
application of foreign legislation and other measures.”
In addition to this, in June 2022, China announced the
entry into force of the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law
and implemented sanctions against U.S. individuals
and organizations, including the former U.S. Secretary

For example, in February 2023, the U.S. government added Chinese aerospace-related companies and organizations to the Entity List because of their support for the Chinese military’s

law. The study concluded that China s claims over most
of the South China Sea are inconsistent with international
law and gravely undermine the rule of law in the ocean.
In February 2023, during a defense ministerial meeting
between the United States and the Philippines, the two
countries agreed to add four new cooperation bases
within the Philippines, in addition to the existing five,
under the “Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement
(EDCA)” to facilitate the rotational deployment of
U.S. forces. In this way, the administration is showing
its stance to further enhance cooperation with countries
surrounding the South China Sea.

Additionally, the United States has sought to enhance

military efforts in the South China Sea. It has continuously
conducted the Freedom of Navigation Operations, carried
out joint exercises in July 2020 by deploying two Carrier
Strike Groups for the first time since 2014, and even after
President Biden took office, in February 2021, conducted
similar exercises several times in order to confront China’s
excessive claims on maritime interests. The United States
has also conducted joint training with partner countries
including Japan, the United Kingdom, Australia, the
Netherlands, Canada, Singapore, Indonesia, and the
Philippines. Responding to these American efforts, China
has criticized the United States for hindering the peace and
stability of the region. Additionally, there have been cases
of Chinese naval vessels approaching and interfering with
U.S. naval vessels sailing through the South China Sea and
elsewhere, as well as cases of Chinese fighter jets allegedly
approaching U.S. military aircraft. For example, the
U.S. Department of Defense has recorded more than 180
dangerous flights by Chinese military aircraft against U.S.
aircraft in the East China Sea and South China Sea from
2021 to 2023 and has pointed out that the Chinese military
has carried out approximately 100 dangerous actions
against the militaries of U.S. allies and other nations.[4]

Going forward, while forming free and open order

based on the rule of law is important in the South
China Sea, the military tensions may rise. Japan, which
promotes the vision of a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”
(FOIP) with the United States, will have to pay great
attention to the situation.

With regard to the issues over the South China Sea,
the United States is concerned about such dimensions
as obstruction to the freedom of navigation in sea
lanes, restrictions on the activities of U.S. Forces, and
the worsening security situation in the entire region.
The United States has requested China comply with
international norms and has repeatedly criticized China’s
unilateral and assertive actions. On the other hand, China
expresses opposition saying the United States is the largest
threat to peace and stability in the South China Sea, and
confrontation between these two countries is deepening.

China has been advancing into the South China Sea

taking advantage of the power vacuum there since the
1950s, and promoting the militarization of the Paracel
Islands. It has also been conducting rapid reclamation
of the Spratly Islands on a large scale since 2014. Even
after the illegality of the Chinese activities such as land
reclamation was determined at the Philippines-China
arbitration in 2016, China has made it clear that it would
not comply with the decision and has been promoting its
plan to militarize the area.

**See** Section 2-2-6 (5) (Trends of Activities in the South China Sea);

Section 7 (Southeast Asia)

**See**

The United States has been criticizing China’s action

about issues concerning the South China Sea hitherto
and conducted Freedom of Navigation Operations and
other activities.

The Biden administration has continued to show its

consistent and strict deterrence stance against China.
For example, it stated that the United States will reject
China’s claims about maritime interests in the South
China Sea and stand up together with Southeast Asian
countries facing China’s pressure. Antony Blinken,
U.S. Secretary of State, stated again in July 2021, on
the fifth anniversary of the ruling of the arbitral tribunal
to Philippines v. China, that the United States demands
China comply with the obligations of international law.
In addition, in January 2022, the U.S. Department of
State released a study examining China’s maritime
claims in the South China Sea in light of international


China upholds the principle that Taiwan is a part of
China and that the Taiwan issue is its internal affair.


-----

China maintains that the One China principle is the
underlying premise and foundation for dialogue between
China and Taiwan. China is also strongly opposed to any
foreign intervention in the unification of China as well as
any move towards the independence of Taiwan and has
repeatedly stated that it has not renounced the use of force
in respect of the Taiwan issue. “The Anti-Secession Law,”
enacted in March 2005, clearly lays out China’s policy of
not renouncing the use of force, providing that in the event
that possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be
completely exhausted, the state shall employ nonpeaceful
means and other necessary measures to protect China’s
sovereignty and territorial integrity. General Secretary
Xi stated in the report to the 20th Party Congress held
in October 2022, in respect of cross-strait issues, China’s
position to “continue to strive for peaceful reunification
with the greatest sincerity and the utmost effort” while
he stated again “resolving the Taiwan issue and realizing
China’s complete reunification is a natural requirement
for realizing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” and
“we will never promise to renounce the use of force, and
we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary.”

On the other hand, the United States stated in the NSS

that it has an abiding interest in maintaining peace and
stability across the Taiwan Strait, opposes any unilateral
changes to the status quo from either side, does not
support Taiwan independence, and remains committed
to the “One China” policy which is guided by the Taiwan
Relations Act (TRA), Three Joint Communiqués, and
the Six Assurances. Based on this, the United States also
makes it clear that it intends to uphold its commitments
under the TRA to support Taiwan’s self-defense, and to
maintain the United States’ capacity to resist any resort
to force or coercion against Taiwan.

The Biden administration has positioned China as

America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge as
well as the only competitor with the intent and power
to reshape the international order and has made clear its
diplomatic stance to contain China through cooperation
with allies and partner countries on issues concerning
Taiwan and other matters. For example, since the start
of Biden administration, the importance of “peace and
stability across the Taiwan Strait” has been repeatedly
mentioned at international meetings such as the JapanU.S. summit meetings, the G7 Summit, and the U.S.-EU
summit meetings. Furthermore, the Biden administration
has been promoting efforts to enhance Taiwan’s
international standing, including calling on UN member

t t t t T i ’ i f l ti i ti i


the UN system.

The United States has decided to sell weapons to

Taiwan based on the TRA. Since the inauguration
of the Biden administration also, the United States
has continued to sell weapons such as self-propelled
howitzers, aircraft-launched missiles, and maintenance
and repair packages for air defense missile systems.
The Biden administration also continued to have U.S.
warships and aircraft pass through the Taiwan Strait
periodically. Moreover, then President Tsai Ing-wen
acknowledged that the U.S. military was visiting Taiwan
for training purposes in an interview with U.S. media in
October 2021. In March 2023, U.S. Secretary of Defense
Austin testified at a congressional hearing that the U.S.
National Guard was training Taiwan’s military.

Moreover, not only the U.S. government but also

the U.S. Congress has indicated its intention to further
enhance support for Taiwan. Congressional delegations
of the United States including then Speaker of the
U.S. House of Representatives Pelosi, visited Taiwan
repeatedly and met with then-President Tsai and others,
and exchanged views on strengthening U.S.-Taiwan
relations and other matters during 2022. Moreover, the
FY2023 National Defense and Authorization Act (NDAA)
includes approvals for the Taiwan Enhanced Resilience
Act to enhance security cooperation with Taiwan, and
military financing of up to US$10 billion over five years
from 2023 to 2027, among other items. The FY2024
NDAA includes provisions for providing comprehensive
training and advice to Taiwan’s military and establishing
an institutional capacity-building program.

In response to this proximity between the United

States and Taiwan, China has further stepped up its
military activities around Taiwan, including conducting
military exercises around it when VIPs from the United
States and Taiwan visited each other.

**See** Section 2-2-6(4) (Trends of Activities around Taiwan);

[Commentary] (Chinese Military Trends Concerning Taiwan)

While the Biden administration is clarifying its stance of

supporting Taiwan in the military-related area, it is deemed
unlikely that China, which position Taiwan issues as “the
core of the core interests,” will show a compromising
attitude towards the U.S. stance. It is viewed that the U.S.China conflict over Taiwan may become more apparent.
Stabilizing the situation surrounding Taiwan is important
not only for Japan’s security but also for the stability of
the international community. Therefore, it is necessary

and public and private organizations involved in wartime
mobilization to optimize the efficiency of the mobilization
system in the event of an emergency. Regarding naval
capabilities, in addition to Kidd-class destroyers which
were imported from the United States, Taiwan possesses
the indigenously built “Tuo Chiang” stealth corvette,
among other vessels. Taiwan is currently promoting a
national shipbuilding program to independently build its
own military vessels, which includes plans to build eleven
mass-produced Tuo Chiang-class corvettes by 2026 and
ultimately about eight submarines, including the first
submarine, which was launched in September 2023.
Regarding air capabilities, Taiwan possesses F-16 fighters
(F-16V upgraded from A/B), Mirage 2000 fighters,
Ching-kuo fighters, and other assets. In November 2021,
Taiwan’s first unit composed of F-16V fighters upgraded
from F-16A/B fighters was established at Chiayi Air
Base, and the deployment of fighters capable of carrying
longer-range missiles is being strengthened, including
the new F-16V fighters scheduled to be introduced from
the United States.


Taiwan had conscription from 1951, but later

transitioned to a volunteer system, with conscription
ending by the end of 2018. Since then, while the fourmonth mandatory military training for males aged
18 to 36 had been maintained, the Tsai administration
revived one-year obligatory military service for males
of conscription age starting in January 2024. The Army
formed seven new infantry brigades, primarily consisting
of compulsorily conscripted soldiers, for a total of 12
brigades by 2023, and began accepting soldiers with
one-year mandatory conscription from January 2024.
The new conscription system has strengthened the
training content beyond what was required under the
previous military training obligations, and specifically, it
requires enhanced training in operating new equipment
and participation in practical training.

On the other hand, since China has consistently

expressed its intention of not renouncing the use of force
to Taiwan, the country may make a decision on military
options such as air and maritime blockade, limited use of
force, air and missile operations, and invasion of Taiwan.

If that happens, it is deemed that China will deter or
delay any potential interventions by the United States.
It was reported in December 2021 that an unpublished
report submitted from the Ministry of National Defense
of Taiwan to the Legislative Yuan described a postulated
Chinese process for invading Taiwan as follows: China
will assemble its military forces on the Chinese coast
under the guise of exercises and use “cognitive warfare”
to cause panic among the Taiwanese people. Then, naval
vessels will be gathered in the Western Pacific to prevent
foreign military intervention. Next, under the strategy of
transformation from exercises to war, the Rocket and Air
Forces will launch ballistic and cruise missiles to attack
Taiwan’s key military facilities, while the Strategic
Support Forces carry out cyber-attacks on Taiwan’s
key military systems. Finally, after gaining sea and air
superiority, landing operations by amphibious assault
ships, transport helicopters, and more will be carried out,
thus achieving total control of Taiwan before foreign
forces intervene.

In response to such moves of China, Taiwan under

then President Tsai Ing-wen has put forth defense
strategy called as “Resolute Defense and Multi-domain
Deterrence” preventing the invasion from China at
the farthest points possible within its territory with a
multi-layered defense posture, which combines major
equipment such as fighters and vessels with asymmetric
force. According to the 2019 Taiwan Defense Report, this
strategy proposes a defense concept comprising “force
protection” to contain the initial destruction caused
by the enemy and ensure integrity of military power
through mobility, concealment, dispersion, deception,
camouflage, and other tactics, “decisive battle in littoral
zone” to gain a partial superiority by air assets and shorebased firepower, and deploying integrated forces in order
to intercept and destroy the enemy’s landing forces, and
“destruction of enemy at landing beach” to destruct the
enemy at breathing, landing beach and coastal areas by
integrating forces, firepower and prepositioned barriers
of three services during the enemy’s landing and
maneuvering operations on shore, and give them no places
to set foot on.[7] This is believed to be aimed at exhausting
the operational capabilities of the Chinese military and
preventing or reducing the landing of Chinese troops in
the face of the overwhelming gap in military strength


between China and Taiwan, as well as delaying an invasion
by the Chinese military and buying time until intervention
by the U.S. military. It is believed that Taiwan plans to
constrain any Chinese military invasion from a long
distance by expanding the development and production of
domestically produced asymmetric capabilities and longrange weapons, as well as introducing high-performance,
long-range weapons from the United States, in order
to successfully execute “Resolute Defense and Multidomain Deterrence.” Taiwan is currently strengthening
its domestic development of sea and air capabilities, longrange missiles, and the like. In November 2021, a special
budget bill for the expansion of sea and air capabilities
was passed, and it was decided to invest 240 billion
Taiwan dollars (approximately 950 billion yen) over five
years for the acquisition of self-developed equipment.
In addition to these, Taiwan has decided to acquire from
the United States the “M142” (HIMARS) high mobility
artillery rocket system, the “RGM-84L-4” (Harpoon)
surface-to-ship missile system, and the “AGM-84H”
(SLAM-ER) long-range air-to-surface missile.

In September 2023, the 2023 National Defense

Report was released for the fourth time under the Tsai
administration, announcing national defense policy
initiatives and other issues. The report also included a
new section on China’s normalization of harassment and
threats as a security issue, pointing out that since 2022,
China’s military actions against Taiwan have become
more frequent and diverse, including the crossing of
the “median line” across the Taiwan Strait by Chinese
military assets, the establishment of a no-sail/no-fly zone
around Taiwan, and practical military exercises, and it
expressed Taiwan’s strong vigilance against normalized
activities of the PLA, claiming that China is stepping up
its threats against Taiwan. In response to these Chinese
threats, the report maintains the defense strategy of
“Resolute Defense and Multi-domain Deterrence”
while adding a new section on “Defense in Depth” in its
explanation of the strategy, which specifically includes
a preemptive strike against a gathering invasion force,
expansion of the defense space in coordination with
the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy, and enhancement of the
combat capability of the duty and reserve forces as well
as the ability to mobilize residents, demonstrating a
posture of working to create a multi-layered defense line

In addition to this, Taiwan annually conducts the “Han

Kuang” large-scale military exercise that simulates an
invasion by Chinese forces. It is believed that the Taiwan
military’s defense strategy has been verified through this
series of drills. In recent Han Kuang exercises, training
exercises, such as anti-landing and interception drills, as
well as training focused on gray zone strategies, such as
cyber warfare and joint training between the Navy and
the Coast Guard, have been conducted. It was reported
that the content of the 2023 “Han Kuang 39” exercises
was set based on the invasion of Ukraine, the increased
activity of Chinese naval vessels on the eastern side of
Taiwan, etc. Although some exercises were cancelled
due to a typhoon, exercises for anti-landings, critical
infrastructure protection, wartime disaster prevention
through military-civilian cooperation, and the eastern
deployment of surface-to-ship missiles were conducted.

According to the 2023 Report on Military and

Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic
of China” released by the U.S. Department of Defense in
October 2023, the PLA’s capabilities to invade Taiwan
have been assessed as follows:

-  The PLA Army organized six combined arms brigades

capable of carrying out amphibious operations,
comprising four brigades in the Eastern Theater the
operational range of which includes Taiwan, and two
brigades in the Southern Theater.

-  In order to achieve maritime superiority within the

First Island Chain and prevent intervention by third
countries, the PLA Navy is deploying new attack
submarines and surface combatants with an antiaircraft capability. While it has not invested in landing
ships and craft considered to be enough in number for
large-scale assault on Taiwan, it may intend to make
up for the shortage with civilian transport ships and
other vessels.

-  The PLA Air Force has acquired advanced aircraft to

conduct air and ground-attack operations. It also has
a high Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance
(ISR) capability to support military operations in
the event of a Taiwan invasion. Furthermore, it is
improving its ability to operate further from China
through enhanced refueling capabilities.

-  The PLA Rocket Force intends to degrade Taiwan’s

defense and break the will to fight through missile
attacks against high-value targets including Taiwan’s
military facilities.
In addition to this, it is pointed out in the report

that the Strategic Support Force would conduct cyber
and psychological warfare in the event of a Taiwan
invasion, and the Joint Logistic Support Force would be
responsible for integrated logistical support missions.

The military capabilities of China and Taiwan are

generally characterized as follows:
(1) Regarding ground forces, while China possesses

an overwhelming number of troops, its capability of
landing and invading the main island of Taiwan is
limited at present. In recent years, however, China
has been steadily improving its landing invasion
capabilities through building and commissioning large
landing ships, and it is also improving transportation
capabilities by mobilizing civil transport ships and
the like. Confronting this, in recent years, Taiwan
also has been taking actions to improve anti-landing
capabilities such as by conducting enhanced training

While China has continued to increase its defense budget
by a significant margin, Taiwan’s defense budget, at
approximately 434.5 billion Taiwan dollars for FY2024,
has remained almost unchanged for nearly 20 years.
China’s announced military budget in the same year
totals approximately 1,665.54 billion yuan, roughly 17
times the amount of Taiwan’s in terms of U.S. dollars
based on exchange rates announced by the Taiwanese
Central Bank. It is pointed out that China’s actual
defense expenditure has been larger than the published
defense budget, indicating that the China-Taiwan defense
expenditure gap could be greater.

(2) In regard to China’s naval and air forces, the PLA

Navy and PLA Air Force are being rapidly reinforced
both in terms of quality and quantity. This includes
the launching of the second domestic-built aircraft
carrier which reportedly could be equipped with an
electromagnetic catapult system, and operational
deployment of J-20 fifth-generation fighters. While
Taiwan strives to enhance its naval and air forces by
passing special budgets for them, the capability gap
is expanding in an advantageous direction for China.

(3) Regarding missile strike capabilities, China has

many missiles including short-range ballistic

missiles (SRBMs) and multiple launch rockets and
other assets with enough range to strike Taiwan. In
response, Taiwan has strengthened its missile defense
capabilities by introducing PAC-3 missiles from the
United States and increasing the number of Taiwan’s
own Tien Kung III missile sites. However, limitations
to this response have been pointed out when it comes
to dealing with a saturation attack. In addition, Taiwan
is enhancing stand-off attack capabilities, including

ballistic missiles (SRBMs) and other missiles capable
of flying at low altitudes with irregular trajectories in
a simultaneous process of promoting the development
of ICBM-class ballistic missiles covering a range of
the whole U.S. territory, rapidly improving related
technologies and operational capabilities and diversifying
their launch platforms to include rail-launched and
submarine-launched types. At the same time, North
Korea has been striving to expand more practical
SRBM capabilities. Furthermore, since Chairman Kim
mentioned the development of “ultra-modern tactical
nuclear weapons including intermediate-range cruise
missiles” in January 2021, North Korea announced that
it had succeeded in conducting test launches of longrange cruise missiles and launched ballistic missiles
in what it called training for “tactical nuclear weapons
operation units.”

The background for North Korea’s series of

development and launches appears to be that in addition
to acquiring nuclear deterrent capabilities through the
possession of nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic
missiles for the maintenance and survival of the regime,
North Korea aims to acquire the means to be able to
respond in an armed conflict that could occur between
itself and the United States as well as ROK forces in
which conventional forces or tactical nuclear weapons are
used.[4] North Korea repeatedly stated it would enhance its
military power including nuclear weapons and missiles
according to the “five-year plan for the development of
the defense science and the weapon system” (hereinafter
“five-year plan”)said to have been presented at the 8th
Congress of the Korean Workers Party (KWP) in January
2021,[5] and it is likely that it is focusing efforts on research
and development (R&D) and enhancement of operation
capabilities for various weapons under this five-year plan.

**(2) Military Capabilities**
The North Korean Army comprises about 1.10 million
personnel, and roughly two-thirds of them seem to be
deployed along the DMZ. The main body of the army


**Part**

**Chapter**


**1** **General Situation**

North Korea has continued to enhance its military forces
consistently in the situation of south-north division,[3]
however, reduction in military assistance from the
former Soviet bloc due to the end of the Cold War, its
sluggish economy and modernization of ROK Forces
have resulted in much of its equipment being outdated,
and there is significant qualitative disparity between
North Korea’s conventional forces and those of the
ROK’s military and U.S. Forces Korea. Nevertheless,
while North Korea is concentrating on strengthening
its nuclear and missile capabilities, it also seems to be
focusing on maintaining a certain military foundation
for its conventional forces by continuously conducting
research, development, and training.

North Korea’s military forces are comprised mainly

of ground forces, with a total troop strength reaching
roughly 1.28 million personnel. It still maintains a
large-scale military force, including artillery units
deployed near the DMZ. North Korea also retains
special operations forces and the like on a large scale for
information gathering and sabotage. In addition, many
military underground facilities seem to exist all over the
land, which is a peculiarity of North Korea.

Furthermore, North Korea is believed to be intensively

building up its WMD and ballistic missiles. In recent
years, North Korea has repeatedly launched short-range


North Korea has been building up its military capabilities in accordance with the Four Military Guidelines, consisting of extensive training for all soldiers, modernizing all military forces,
arming the entire population, and fortifying the entire country, adopted at the 5th plenary meeting of the 4th KWP Central Committee in 1962.

For example, at the 8th Congress of the KWP in January 2021, Chairman Kim stated that North Korea would “develop tactical nuclear weapons which can be used for various missions
according to the purpose of operational duty and target of strike in a modern war” and “thoroughly contain, control and handle various military threats on the Korean peninsula which
inevitably accompany the nuclear threat on our own initiative.” He also stated in September 2022 that North Korea “will be enhancing tactical nuclear operation measures relentlessly,
realize higher level of diversity of applying means, and strengthen nuclear combat posture from multiple directions.”

There was no direct reference to the name “five-year plan for defense scientific development and weapons system development” in North Korea’s announcement at the same Congress of
the KWP in January 2021. However, when there was an announcement of the launch of a long-range cruise missile on September 13 of the same year, the North Korean media mentioned
it publicly for the first time by stating that this missile development project was significant for “achieving the key objectives of the five-year plan for the development of defense science and

is infantry, but the army also maintains armored forces
including at least 3,500 tanks and artillery. North Korea
is believed to deploy long-range artillery along the
DMZ, such as 240 mm multiple rocket launchers and
170 mm self-propelled artillery guns, which can reach
cities and bases in the northern part of the ROK including
Seoul. It has also been pointed out that, in recent years,
North Korea has been developing and operating various
multiple rocket launchers with extended ranges.

The Navy retains about 790 ships and boats with a total

displacement of approximately 100,000 tons and is chiefly
comprised of small naval vessels such as high-speed
missile craft. Also, it has about 20 of the former model
Romeo-class submarines, about 30 midget submarines
and about 140 air cushioned landing crafts, the latter two
of which are believed to be used for infiltration and other
actions of the special operations forces. In September
2023, the Navy launched a new submarine that appears
to be a modified Romeo-class submarine and dubbed it a
“tactical nuclear attack submarine.”

The Air Force has approximately 550 combat aircraft,

most of which are out-of-date models made in China
or the former Soviet Union. However, some fourthgeneration aircraft such as MiG-29 fighters and Su25 attack aircraft are also included. North Korea has
a large number of outdated An-2 transport aircraft as
well, which are believed to be used for transportation of
special operations forces.

Moreover, North Korea retains a large-scale special

operations force[6] as so-called asymmetric capabilities.
Also, it is likely in recent years that it has been strengthening
its cyber forces as asymmetric forces as well in order to
steal military secret intelligence and funds for developing
nuclear weapons and missiles and develop capabilities to
attack critical infrastructure of other countries.

**3** **WMD and Missiles**


2022, in particular, it has forced through launches with
an unprecedented frequency. North Korea resumed
launches of intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM)class and longer-range ballistic missiles which it had not
launched since 2018. At the same time, North Korea likely
intends to enhance further surprise attack capabilities,
making identification of signs of launch, detection, and
interception difficult by launching ballistic missiles
that can fly at low altitudes with irregular trajectories
as well as by launching these missiles from a variety
of platforms such as Transporter-Erector-Launchers
(TELs)[7], submarines, and trains.

Since 2023, North Korea has conducted launches of

solid-fuel propelled ICBM-class and IRBM-class ballistic
missiles as well as launches using ballistic missile
technology for the purpose of a satellite launch. North
Korea is focusing on qualitatively improving its nuclear
and missile capabilities, such as diversifying its equipment
systems, and acquiring intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (ISR) means that complement its nuclear
and missile operational capabilities.

Furthermore, given its technological maturity obtained

through a series of nuclear tests, North Korea is assessed
to possess the technological capabilities to mount a
miniaturized nuclear warhead, at least, on such ballistic
missiles as Nodong and Scud ER (Extended Range),
with their range covering the Japanese Archipelago and,
thereby, to strike Japan. In addition, North Korea has
repeatedly expressed its intention to further strengthen
its nuclear capability.

**(1) Nuclear Weapons**
**a. The Current Status of the Nuclear Weapons Program**
Considering that North Korea has conducted six nuclear
tests so far, it is conceivable that North Korea has made
considerable progress in its nuclear weapons program.

North Korea possesses nuclear reactors,[8] including a

5MWe graphite-moderated reactor and an experimental
light water reactor, as well as a reprocessing plant and
uranium enrichment facilities in Yongbyon. The 5MWe


**Part**

**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


The launches of ballistic missiles and other missiles
by North Korea have continued; moreover, from early


James Thurman, then Commander of the U.S. Forces Korea, stated, “North Korea possesses the world’s largest special operations force of over 60,000” in his speech at the Association of
U.S. Army in October 2012. Additionally, the 2022 Defense White Paper of the ROK notes about North Korea’s Special operations force, “The forces are estimated at approximately 200,000
strong.”

The signs of a launch from a fixed launcher are easy for the adversary to detect and are vulnerable to attack by the adversary. TEL was developed mainly by the former Soviet Union,
among others, in order to make the detection of launch signs more difficult and increase survivability. According to the U.S. DIA’s “North Korea Military Power” of October 2021, North Korea
possesses a maximum of 100 TELs for Scud B and Scud C, 100 TELs for Nodongs, and 50 TELs for IRBMs (Musudans). As for a TEL-mounted missile launch, it is deemed difficult to detect
individual specific signs in advance concerning the detailed location and timing of the launch. This is because it is operated by being mounted and transported on a TEL, and furthermore,
military-related underground facilities are thought to exist all over North Korea.

Nuclear reactors are classified into graphite-moderated reactors, heavy water reactors, and light water reactors, depending on the moderator used. Graphite-moderated reactors and heavy


-----

graphite moderated reactor was thought to have been
out of operation since 2018, but some have pointed out
that it resumed operation in July 2021.[9] If it had actually
resumed operation, it has been noted that it would be able
to produce about 6 kg of plutonium per year (enough to
produce one to 1.5 nuclear warheads). It has also been
pointed out that the experimental light water reactor has
been undergoing test operations since October 2023. [10]

With regard to plutonium, a fissile material[11] that can

be used for nuclear weapons, North Korea has suggested
several times that it has produced and extracted
plutonium.[12] Because the restarting or startup of the
reactors could lead to the production and extraction of
plutonium by North Korea, those activities are causes of
great concern.

As for highly enriched uranium that can also be

used for nuclear weapons, in June 2009, North Korea
declared the commencement of uranium enrichment.
In November 2010, North Korea disclosed its uranium
enrichment facility to American nuclear specialists
and later announced that it was operating a uranium
enrichment plant equipped with thousands of centrifuges.
The expansion of this uranium enrichment plant has
been suggested in recent years; in this regard, North
Korea could have increased its enrichment capabilities.
Furthermore, it is also pointed out that there are some
uranium enrichment facilities that have not been
disclosed by North Korea. The series of North Korean
behaviors related to uranium enrichment indicate the
possibility of the development of nuclear weapons using
highly enriched uranium in addition to plutonium.[13]

In general, facilities used for uranium enrichment

are more secretive in appearance than reactors used for
plutonium production, and it is difficult to ascertain their
activities from the outside. On the other hand, plutonium
has a smaller critical mass than uranium, and it is pointed
out that it is easier to make nuclear weapons smaller and


lighter. In light of both these advantages, North Korea
may continue to promote the development of both
plutonium and uranium types of nuclear weapons.

North Korea conducted nuclear tests on October

9, 2006, May 25, 2009, February 12, 2013, January 6,
2016, September 9, 2016, and September 3, 2017. It is
highly likely that North Korea has made strides in its
nuclear weapons program, while miniaturizing nuclear
weapons to be loaded on ballistic missiles, collecting the
necessary data through these nuclear tests. For example,
in September, 2017, it was announced that Chairman Kim
had visited North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons Institute and
had seen a hydrogen bomb capable of being loaded into
an ICBM, in addition to which, following North Korea’s
sixth nuclear test that was forced through on the same
day, North Korea announced that it “successfully carried
out a test of H-bomb for ICBM.”[14]

In regard to miniaturization of nuclear weapons small

enough to be mounted on a ballistic missile, considering
the fact that the United States, the former Soviet Union,
the United Kingdom, France, and China succeeded in
acquiring such technology by as early as the 1960s as
well as the North Korean technological maturity that is
estimated to have been reached through its previous six
nuclear tests, it is assessed that North Korea, concerning
its ballistic missiles with their range covering the
Japanese Archipelago, has already miniaturized its
nuclear warheads to mount. There have also been reports
that North Korea possesses approximately 30 nuclear
warheads—overall enough fissile material to produce 50
to 70 nuclear warheads.[15]

Furthermore, it is likely that North Korea has been

preparing for other nuclear tests, as has been suggested
that North Korea has been working on restoring its
northern nuclear test site since March 2022, which it
officially announced it had blown up in 2018.

from natural uranium. This process is called enrichment. Generally, a large-scale enrichment facility that combines thousands of centrifuges is used to boost the U235 concentration to
nuclear weapon levels (over 90%).

**12 North Korea announced in October 2003 that it had completed the reprocessing of 8,000 used fuel rods that contain plutonium from a 5MWe graphite-moderated reactor, and in May 2005**

that it had completed extraction of an additional 8,000 used fuel rods. The 2022 Defense White Paper of the ROK estimates that North Korea possesses around 70 kg of plutonium.

**13 The 2022 Defense White Paper of the ROK assesses that North Korea possesses a substantial amount of highly enriched uranium (HEU). It has been noted that a uranium enrichment facility**

different from the one in Yongbyon exists in Kangson.

**14 The yield of the sixth nuclear weapons test in 2017 was estimated to be the largest ever, with a maximum yield of approximately 160 kt. Given the size of the estimated yield, the possibility**

cannot be discounted that the test was of a hydrogen bomb. North Korea also insisted that its fourth nuclear test, conducted in January 2016, was a hydrogen bomb test. However, given
that the yield of that test is estimated at 6 to 7 kts, it is difficult to conceive that this was a hydrogen bomb test as generally defined.

state nuclear forces are exposed to any danger. From
these factors, it is possible that North Korea assumes a
possible use of nuclear weapons in an actual combat.

In fact, North Korea has repeatedly launched missiles,

allegedly, for practical training; for example, it launched
missiles in “tactical nuclear operation units” training
several times from late September to October 2022 and
exploded test warheads simulating nuclear warheads
above the targets in what was called “comprehensive
tactical training for simulated nuclear counterstrike”
among others in March 2023. North Korea also announced
in March 2023 that Chairman Kim received explanation
about tactical nuclear weapons from the department in
charge and “instructed about weaponizing of nuclear
weapons,” giving direction to expand the production of
weapon-grade nuclear materials and nuclear weapons.

**b. Background of the Nuclear Program and Future**

**Outlook**

North Korea’s ultimate goal appears to be maintaining
its existing regime. It has been developing nuclear
weapons to accomplish this goal through constructing its
own nuclear deterrence to counter U.S. threats, including
threats with nuclear weapons. These perceptions are
obvious as can be seen in Chairman Kim’s speech[16] that
North Korea can never abandon its nuclear weapons
because the objective of the United States is to collapse
“our government.” It is likely that North Korea will
continue to focus on advancing development of nuclear
weapons and long-range missiles capable of attacking
the whole U.S. territory in order to acquire deterrence
against the United States.

On the other hand, amid its confrontation with the

Yoon Suk Yeol administration of the ROK, which
pursues a strict policy toward North Korea, North Korea
has described the ROK as its “principal enemy” and has
repeatedly stated that it will not exclude the ROK from
being a potential targets of its nuclear attack. North Korea
has shown its stance to pursue development of tactical
nuclear weapons for deterrence against the United States
as well as with a view to dealing with a possible armed
conflict on the Korean Peninsula.

In September 2022, North Korea passed “the law on

the state policy on the nuclear forces” that stipulates
mission and command and control of its nuclear forces
as well as conditions of using its nuclear weapons. The
law notes the main mission of nuclear forces are “to
deter a war.” If deterrence fails, its nuclear forces “shall
carry out an operational mission for repulsing hostile
forces’ aggression and attacks and achieving decisive
victory of the war.” Chairman Kim justified his nuclear
development, saying that by promulgating this law, “our
status as a nuclear power irreversible.” Furthermore, it
is stipulated in the law that nuclear weapons can be used
when an attack deemed imminent, regardless if it is a
nuclear or conventional, on “leadership” or “important
strategic objects” and, in particular, that a “nuclear
strike” will be conducted automatically and immediately
in the case that “command and control system over the

Furthermore, it is possible that North Korea will

conduct additional nuclear tests in the near future to arm
ICBM-class ballistic missiles with multiple warheads
and operationalize tactical nuclear weapons, pursuing
further miniaturization of nuclear weapons.[17]

**(2) Biological and Chemical Weapons**
North Korea is an extremely closed regime. In addition,
most materials and technology used for manufacturing
biological and chemical weapons are for both military
and civilian uses, which in turn facilitates camouflage.
For these reasons, details of the status of North Korea’s
biological and chemical weapons development and


**16 Chairman Kim stated in his speech at the Supreme People’s Assembly held in September 2022 that “while the United States aims to have us remove our nuclear weapon, its final goal is**

even forcing us to abandon our executive ability for the right to self-defense or to weaken it, and to disrupt my regime anytime” and “we can never abandon nuclear weapons, ... no matter
what difficulty we may face.” Furthermore, at the Supreme People’s Assembly held in September 2023, Chairman Kim stated in his speech that Article 58 of Chapter 4 of the Socialist
Constitution of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea clearly states that “the country will advance the development of nuclear weapons to guarantee the country’s right to survival and
development, deter war, and safeguard peace and stability in the region and the world,” and that “the Republic’s nuclear forces construction policy has been made permanent as the basic
law of the Republic so that no one can interfere with it no matter what.”

**17 Chairman Kim mentioned “progressing R&D project to complete multiple independently-targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) technology” and “further development of downsizing and weight**

arsenals are unclear. However, with regard to chemical
weapons, North Korea is suspected to have several
facilities capable of producing chemical agents and
already a substantial stockpile of such agents. North
Korea is also thought to have some infrastructure for

the production of biological weapons. Possession of
sarin, VX, mustard and other chemical weapons and of
anthrax, smallpox, pest, and other biological agents that
could be used as biological weapons have been pointed
out.

the Russian short-range ballistic missile “Iskander” and
is deemed able to fly at a lower altitude with an irregular
trajectory than conventional ballistic missiles. Some
have pointed out that SRBM A can be mounted with a
nuclear warhead.[20]

converted from ordinary freight cars. They have external
similarities with SRBM A, and it is possible that they
were developed based on that missile. North Korea has
announced that it was a firing exercise by the “railwayborne missile regiment” and has also expressed its
intention to expand the units in the future.
(ii) SRBM B (referred to as a “new weapon” or “tactical

guided weapon” by North Korea)

SRBM B has a maximum flight distance of about 400 km,
the longest ones achieved and is believed to be capable
of flying at lower altitudes with an irregular trajectory
than conventional ballistic missiles. Regarding TELs,
various types can be confirmed in images published by
North Korea.
(iii) SRBM C (referred to as a “super-large multiple

rocket launcher” by North Korea)

SRBM C has a maximum flight distance of approximately
400 km, the longest ones achieved. Some of the intervals
between launches were estimated less than 1 minute,
suggesting that North Korea is trying to improve the
continuous fire capability required for saturation attacks
and the like. Chairman Kim mentioned that they can
be loaded with tactical nuclear warheads.[21] Regarding
TELs, various types can be confirmed in images
published by North Korea.
(iv) SRBM D (referred to as a “new-type tactical guided

missile” by North Korea)

It has been suggested that the SRBM D was developed
based on the SRBM A. It is capable of flying at lower
altitudes with an irregular trajectory than conventional
ballistic missiles, and their maximum range could reach
about 750 km.

In addition, North Korea carried out two launches

of what could have been SRBMs on July 31, 2019
and another two a couple of days later, on August 2.
Furthermore, the analysis is ongoing regarding the details
of two missiles launched on November 2, 2022, that flew
approximately 150 km and 200 km, respectively.

**(d) Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM)**
North Korea is believed to possess one Gorae-class
submarine (displacement of approximately 1,500
tons) that is capable of carrying and launching a single
submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) and is
being operated mainly as a test vessel. Additionally, in
September 2023, a submarine called a “tactical nuclear
attack submarine” appeared, which is believed to be a
modified version of an existing Romeo-class submarine.
Chairman Kim Jong-un has stated that he intends to
convert all existing medium-sized submarines into
submarines capable of carrying tactical nuclear weapons.
In January 2021, Chairman Kim mentioned the goal of
possessing nuclear-powered submarines, so it is believed
that North Korea will continue to focus on building them
along with modifying the Romeo-class submarines.

North Korea has been developing SLBMs to be

mounted on these submarines, and in May 2015, it
announced the first successful test launch of an SLBM.[24]
North Korea is believed to be seeking to diversify its
ballistic missile strike capabilities and improve its
survivability.
(i) SLBM “Pukguksong” (referred to as “Pukguksong”

type by North Korea)

This is an SLBM launched from a Gorae-class
submarine. Judging from the images and footage
that it has made public so far, North Korea may have
succeeded in operating the “cold launch system,” in
which the missile is ignited after it is ejected into the
air. Moreover, it appears, based on observations such as
the shape of the flame coming out of the missile and the
color of the smoke, that the solid fuel-propelled system
has been adopted. If launched with a normal trajectory,
this missile is expected to have a range of over 1,000 km.
(ii) SLBM “Pukguksong-3” (referred to as

“Pukguksong-3” by North Korea)

This SLBM is different from the “Pukguksong” SLBM
launched in October 2019, and if launched with a normal
trajectory, it could have a range of about 2,000 km. The
characteristic radial exhausts of solid fuel-propelled
engines are identifiable on images published by North
Korea. The SLBM in question could potentially have
been launched from an underwater launch test equipment.

In addition, North Korea unveiled possibly new,

SLBMs marked as “Pukguksong-4” and “Pukguksong-5,”
the launches of which have not yet been confirmed, at


The Scud ER is a ballistic missile that has an extended

range due to the extension of the Scud’s body as well
as the reduction in weight of the warhead, among other
factors. The range of the Scud ER is estimated to reach
approximately 1,000 km, and it appears that a part of
Japan falls within this range. Regarding the two ballistic
missiles that were launched on December 18, 2022,
North Korea announced that their launch was for an
important test for development of a “reconnaissance
satellite” and released images. These missiles could have
been ballistic missiles based on Scud-ER.

Furthermore, North Korea is also developing a

ballistic missile that appears to be an improvement of
the Scud missile. This ballistic missile was launched on
May 29, 2017. A day later, North Korea announced that
it had successfully conducted the new development and
test launch of a ballistic rocket incorporating a precision
navigation guidance system.

In addition, while the images released by North

Korea show that the ballistic missile was launched from
a continuous-tracked TEL and had what appears to be
small wings on its warhead, i.e., characteristics different
from those of existing Scud missiles, the shape other
than the warhead and length are similar to existing Scud
missiles. Another similarity is that it can be confirmed
that the missile has straight-line exhausts characteristic
of a liquid fuel-propelled engine. It has also been noted
that this ballistic missile is equipped with a Maneuverable
Re-entry Vehicle (MaRV).
**(c) Nodong**
The Nodong is a liquid fuel propelled single-stage
ballistic missile and is operated on a TEL. It is assessed
to have a range of about 1,300 km, reaching almost all
of Japan.

Although the details of Nodong’s performance have

not been confirmed, Nodong may not be able to carry
out precise strikes on specific target installations, as
it is likely based on Scud technology. However, it has
been suggested that North Korea is working to increase
the Nodong’s accuracy. A launch aimed at enhancing
accuracy by improving the shape of the warhead
(whose range is deemed to reach approximately 1,500
km through the weight reduction of the warhead) was
confirmed for the first time in the images published by
North Korea a day after the launch of one Scud and two
Nodong missiles on July 19, 2016.

respectively.[25]

(iii) New Type of SLBM
This is a new type of SLBMs that have been launched
since October 2021 and has a maximum flight distance
of approximately 650 km, the longest ones achieved.
Regarding the September 2022 launch, North Korea
announced later that it had conducted a training exercise
to launch a ballistic missile loaded with simulated
tactical nuclear warhead at a “water reservoir underwater
launch site” in the northwestern region and revealed the
existence of a “water reservoir underwater launch site
construction” plan.

Based on images released by North Korea, it is

possible that the missile was developed based on the
SRBM A, as it has external similarities with that missile.
**(e) Ballistic Missile Modified from the SLBM (referred to**

**as “Pukguksong-2” by North Korea)**

This is a solid-fuel propellant ballistic missile and is a
modified version of the SLBM “Pukguksong” for ground
launch. If it were launched with a nominal trajectory, the
firing range is assessed to surpass 1,000 km. A day after
the launch in February 2017, North Korea announced that
it was developed as a ground-to-ground ballistic missile
based on the results of the August 2016 SLBM launch.
It also announced a day after the launch in May 2017
that it had again successfully conducted the test launch
of the missile and that Chairman Kim had authorized its
“operational deployment.”

Moreover, the launch by a “cold launch system,” in

which the missile is ignited after it is ejected into the air
from a continuous-tracked TEL, and the characteristic


radial exhausts of solid fuel propelled engines, can be
confirmed from each of the images that North Korea
released.

and “Pukguksong” Series Ground-launched Ballistic Missiles)

**(f) Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM)-Class**
(i) “Hwasong-12” type (according to North Korea’s

designation)

To date, North Korea has launched four liquid fuelpropelled IRBM-class ballistic missiles. One of these
ballistic missiles was launched on each of May 14,
2017 and January 31, 2022, and based on their flight
patterns, it is presumed that they were launched with a
lofted trajectory. Had they been launched with a nominal
trajectory, the maximum firing range is assessed to
be close to approximately 5,000 km. In addition, the
straight-line exhausts characteristic of a liquid fuel
propelled engine can be confirmed from the images
released by North Korea a day after the launch.

On August 29 and September 15, 2017 respectively,

a single “Hwasong-12” missile was launched, and each
flew over Japan’s territory in the vicinity of the Oshima
Peninsula and Cape Erimo (both in Hokkaido). In view of
their flight paths, “Hwasong-12” missiles appear to have
demonstrated a certain level of function as IRBMs.[26]

North Korea also launched a missile passing over

Aomori Prefecture, Japan, on October 4, 2022. It is
presumed that this missile was a ballistic missile with a
range over that of an IRBM, based on the flight distance
of around 4,600 km achieved at that time. North Korea
announced later that a “new type of surface-to-surface
long-range ballistic missile” was launched. From images

**25 In addition, at the military parade on April 25, 2022, what may have been a new type of SLBM that has not previously been made public by North Korea was unveiled, but it was not named,**

and no details have been released.

**26 North Korea repeatedly launched the Musudan that is believed to be a ballistic missile in 2016. Although the missile launched in June of the same year flew a certain distance on a lofted**

trajectory, the fact that there were two successive launch failures in October would suggest that there may still be obstacles remaining towards the operationalization of the Musudan
and that North Korea may be concentrating on the development and operationalization of the “Hwasong-12” as an IRBM instead. It is pointed out that the range of the Musudan is up to


-----

released at the time, although the date of photography was
not mentioned, the straight-line exhausts characteristic
of a liquid fuel propelled engine and the TEL similar
to ones for the “Hwasong-12” missile were visually
confirmed. On the other hand, since the shape of the
warhead and engine structure were different to that of
the “Hwasong-12,” the possibility that the missile North
Korea launched at that time was a new type of IRBMclass ballistic missile cannot be ruled out.
(ii) New solid fuel-propelled Intermediate-Range

Ballistic Missile (IRBM) class ballistic missiles

North Korea launched a solid fuel-propelled IRBM-class
ballistic missiles each on January 14 and April 2, 2024.
Images released by North Korea showed that the ballistic
missile launched on January 14 had a conical warhead,
while the ballistic missile launched on April 2 had a
flattened warhead. Details of the launches, including
whether these ballistic missiles were hypersonic
weapons, are currently being analyzed.
**(g) Intercontinental-Range Ballistic Missile (ICBM)-**

**Class**

(i) ICBM-class “Hwasong-14” (according to North

Korea’s designation)

North Korea launched “Hwasong-14,” on July 4 and 28,
2017. From the flight pattern, it is presumed that the two
missiles were launched with a lofted trajectory. If they
were to have been launched with a normal trajectory, it
is estimated that they would have a maximum range of
at least 5,500 km. The images suggest that the missiles
were of two-stage configuration.

Furthermore, on the day following the July 28 launch,

North Korea asserted that the “nuclear bomb detonation
device” had functioned normally, and the safety of the
warhead in an atmospheric reentry environment had
been maintained.
(ii) “Hwasong-15” (according to North Korea’s

designation)

On November 29, 2017, North Korea launched
“Hwasong-15” with a lofted trajectory. In a “major
report” on the day of the launch, North Korea made a
“government statement,” declaring that it had successfully
conducted a test launch of the “Hwasong-15,” a newly
developed type of ICBM with the capability to strike
all areas of the U.S. mainland and asserting that it had
completed development of its state nuclear force.


Moreover, another Hwasong 15 missile was

launched with a lofted trajectory on February 18, 2023.
Then on the following day, North Korea announced that
“ICBM launch training” had been conducted and that
“the reliability of the weapon system was reconfirmed
and verified.”

“Hwasong-15” is loaded on a nine-axle TEL, and

from released images, two-stage configuration and
its straight-line exhausts characteristic of a liquid fuel
propelled engine can be confirmed.[27]

Moreover, the range of “Hwasong-15” is estimated to

be over 14,000 km based on the trajectory of maximum
altitude around 5,700km and flight distance around
1,000km when it was launched in February 2023,
depending on factors such as its warhead weight. In this
case, the range would cover the whole U.S. territory
including the East Coast.
(iii) “Hwasong-17” (according to North Korea’s

designation)

North Korea launched one ballistic missile on both
February 27 and March 5, 2022. Both are estimated
to have been launched with a lofted trajectory, flying
approximately 300 km, and reaching maximum altitudes
of approximately 600 km and 550 km, respectively.
North Korea announced the day after each launch that
they were “reconnaissance satellite” development tests,
but it is believed that the missiles launched were of the
“Hwasong-17” type.

The ICBM-class missile launched on March 24 the

same year, recorded a lofted trajectory of maximum
altitude over around 6,000 km and flight distance over

**Chapter**


**27 Based on the released images, the “Hwasong-14”-type ICBM-class ballistic missiles have the following in common with the “Hwasong-12”-type IRBM-class ballistic missile: (1) the**

configuration of engine system (one main engine and four auxiliary engines); (2) the shape of the lower part of the propulsion system (conical shape); and (3) the straight-line flame of
liquid-propulsion systems can be confirmed. Based on the respective ranges that can be estimated for the missiles and other matters, it can be assumed that Hwasong-14 type was possibly


-----

around 1,100 km, greatly exceeding the trajectory and
distance of “Hwasong-15” launched in November 2017.
North Korea announced on the following day that it
conducted test launching of “Hwasong-17.”[28] While
North Korea repeatedly launched missiles after that,
the launches on May 4 and 25, and November 3 and 18,
2022, and March 16, 2023, are presumed to be of the
ICBM-class ballistic missile “Hwasong-17.” The range
of “Hwasong-17” is estimated to be over 15,000 km
based on the past flight trajectories depending on factors
such as its warhead weight. Furthermore, North Korean
media later reported on the launch on November 18, 2022,
stating that the “final test launch” of “Hwasong-17” was
successfully conducted.

From released images, “Hwasong-17” is presumed to

be two-stage, and the straight-line exhausts characteristic
of a liquid fuel propelled engine can be confirmed. The
missile is mounted on an 11-axle TEL, believed to be
the largest in North Korea’s possession, and its size is
thought to exceed that of the existing “Hwasong-15”type. It has been suggested that this raises the possibility
that North Korea pursues a greater yield from increased
warhead weight and multiple warheads, which are
generally considered difficult to intercept.[29]
(iv) “Hwasong-18” type (according to North Korea’s

designation)

On April 13, July 12, and December 18, 2023, North
Korea launched a single ICBM-class ballistic missile
“Hwasong-18.” The Hwasong-18 is a new three-stage
solid-fuel propelled missile, and during its launch on

Image officially released by North Korea when it launched an ICBM-class ballistic missile

“Hwasong-18” [Korea News Service/Jiji]


April 13, it is estimated to have flown about 1,000 km
while changing direction to the left (i.e., north). North
Korea announced this launch as its “first test launch,”
and images released by North Korea show the missile
was launched by so-called a “cold launch system,” in
which the missile is ignited after being ejected into the
air, and from a TEL assumed to be the same as the 9-axle
TEL shown for the first time in the military parade in
February 2023. Radial exhausts, a typical characteristic
of solid fuel-propelled engines, can be confirmed from
each of the images that North Korea released.

The Hwasong-18, was also launched as a “test launch”

on July 12 of the same year, with a flight distance of
approximately 1,000 km and a maximum altitude of over
approximately 6,000 km, and depending on the weight of
the warhead carried, the range of the Hwasong-18 could
exceed 15,000 km. Regarding the launch on December
18 of the same year, North Korea announced that it was
a launch training “with the purpose of inspecting the
readiness of North Korea’s nuclear war deterrence and
confirming its maneuverability, combat capability, and
reliability.”
**(h) Taepodong-2**
Taepodong-2 is a long-range ballistic missile launched
from a fixed launch pad. It is believed to use in its first
stage, four engines, each of which was developed based
on the technologies of Nodong, and the same type of
engine in its second stage. Its range is estimated to be
approximately 6,000 km for the two-stage type, while
the range of its three-stage variant can be more than

**28 North Korea also launched a ballistic missile shortly prior on March 16, 2022, but it is presumed to have not flown properly, and other details, including the type of missile, are still being**

analyzed.

**29 Eleven Hwasong-17s and five launchers that may be TELs for as-yet unannounced new ICBM-class missiles (later, North Korea announced the launching an ICBM-class ballistic missile**

they called Hwasong-18 from a TEL that was viewed identical to this one) were shown in what was called the “ICBM column” at the military parade in February 2023. Since the number
of missiles significantly increased from the four Hwasong-17s and four Hwasong-15s shown at the previous parade (in April 2022), it is pointed out that North Korea was showing off its


-----

approximately 10,000 km assuming that the weight of the
warhead is not over approximately 1 ton. Taepodong-2
missiles and its variants have been launched a total of
five times by February 2016.
**(i) Chollima-1 (according to North Korea’s designation)**
“Chollima-1” is what North Korea claims to be a “new
satellite-carrying rocket” intended to launch a “military
reconnaissance satellite.” “Chollima-1” is launched from
a fixed launch pad and is three-stage configuration.

North Korea used “Chollima-1” to conduct a total

of three launches using ballistic missile technology for
the purpose of a satellite launch in May, August, and
November 2023, with the first two launches believed
to have failed. As for the November launch, analysis
in cooperation with the United States and the ROK
confirmed that the object launched at that time was
orbiting Earth.[30]

**(j) Ballistic Missiles Referred to as “Hypersonic Missiles”**
On January 5 and 11, 2022, North Korea launched
one ballistic missile each day, which it referred to as
a “hypersonic missile”. Both missiles are believed to
have flown at lower altitudes than conventional ballistic
missiles. In particular, the missile launched on January 11
may have flown at a maximum speed of approximately
Mach 10 with an irregular trajectory that included
horizontal maneuvers.[31]

Based on images released by North Korea, it is

confirmed that the missiles were launched from a
wheeled TEL and that they had a conical warhead and
were equipped with an engine appearing to be a liquidfuel propulsion system. It has been pointed out that its
conical warhead may have been based on Maneuverable
Re-entry Vehicle (MaRV)-related technology. In any
case, based on announcements to date, it is clear that
North Korea continues to pursue the development
and enhancement of hypersonic missiles and the
like in an attempt to breach other countries’ missile
defense networks. It is necessary to monitor its future
technological progress, including its application of these
technologies on longer-range missiles and moves for
the development of a possible ballistic missile with a
flat warhead (referred to as the “Hwasong-8” by North
Korea), which was launched on September 28, 2021


with the designation of being a hypersonic missile.

In addition, the aforementioned new IRBM-class

ballistic missile launched on January 14, 2024, is
currently under analysis, including whether it was a
hypersonic weapon.
**b Other Missile Forces under Development by North**

**Korea**

**(a) Cruise missiles**
While North Korea has been supposed to develop and
retain anti-ship cruise missiles with relatively shortrange including ones modified from Chinese-made
cruise missiles, in recent years it stated its intention
to develop new cruise missiles which are supposed to
load tactical nuclear weapons on them. For example,
Chairman Kim mentioned the development of “ultramodern tactical nuclear weapons including intermediaterange cruise missiles” in January 2021. In fact, North
Korea announced that it successfully conducted a test
launch of a newly developed long-range cruise missile
in September 2021, then that a long-range cruise missile
that is believed to be of another type was launched in
January 2022. These cruise missiles were repeatedly
launched after that and announced as launches of
“strategic cruise missiles” said to be deployed in the
“tactical nuclear weapons operation unit.” It is clear
that these missiles have come to be known as “Strategic
Cruise Missile Hwasal-1” and “Strategic Cruise Missile
Hwasal-2” respectively. According to North Korea’s
statement, these cruise missiles flew up to 2,000 km. It

**30 The launched object separated into several parts, the first of which is presumed to have fallen into the Yellow Sea approximately 150 km west of the Korean Peninsula, the second into the**

East China Sea approximately 350 km west of the Korean Peninsula, and the third passed over the airspace between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima island and into the Pacific
Ocean approximately 1,000 km west of Okinotorishima, outside Japan’s EEZ, all of which are presumed to have fallen outside the predicted drop zones.

**31 It is presumed that the ballistic missile lunched on December 23 2022 was the same as the ballistic missiles launched on January 5 and January 11, 2022 that North Korea referred to as**

hypersonic missiles. In addition, a missile with an appearance similar to the Hwasong-8 was unveiled at an exhibition titled “Armed Equipment Exhibition 2023” in July 2023 and a military


-----

was also announced that strategic cruise missiles were
launched from submarines in March 2023 and January
2024 and from a patrol ship in August of the same year.

In January 2024, North Korea also test-fired a cruise

missile it called “Pulhwasal-3-31,” but details of the
missile, including the differences with the conventional
“Hwasal,” remain unknown.

While many of the details, including their actual

performance, are still unknown, it is obvious that North
Korea pursues implementation not only of ballistic
missiles but also of long-range nuclear capable cruise
missiles. If the series of the announcements about flying
distances and the like are factual, there is a need for
concern, as these missiles pose threats peace and stability
in the region.
**(b) “New Type of Tactical Guided Weapon”**
On April 17, 2022, North Korea announced that a “new
type of tactical guided weapon” was launched. The
missile announced at that time was seen at the military
parade on April 25, and also later appeared in North
Korean media. It can also be confirmed that the missile
is transported on a three-axle wheeled TEL and radial
exhausts, a typical characteristic of solid fuel propelled
engines. This missile is believed to be one of the
weapons that North Korea is developing as potentially
tactical nuclear weapons, in aiming to deal with armed
conflicts that may occur with U.S. Forces and ROK
Forces involving conventional forces and/or tactical
nuclear weapons. This belief is based on North Korea’s
announcements stating that these missiles are significant
in drastically improving long-range artillery firepower
and strike capabilities on each front and enhancing
“effectiveness of tactical nuclear weapons operation.”
**c Trends in Ballistic Missile Development**
North Korea has driven ballistic missile development
and attempted to improve related technologies and
operation capabilities quite rapidly and in continuous
manner. These trends have the following characteristics.
**(a) Improvement of missile-related technologies**
(i) Improvement of concealment and promptness
North Korea appears to be seeking to improve its ability
to conduct surprise attacks by enhancing concealment and
promptness to make it difficult to detect signs of a launch.

North Korea has repeatedly launched missiles from

various platforms such as TELs, submarines and railway
cars in recent years. Using these platforms, launchers
can be concealed, and missiles could be launched
from any position. It appears that North Korea aims to

k id tifi ti f i f l h d t ti d


interception difficult, by improving concealment.

In addition, particularly since 2019, North Korea has

repeatedly launched ballistic missiles using solid fuel.
It is therefore believed that North Korea is proceeding
with the development of solid-fueled ballistic missiles.
Generally, solid fuel-propelled ballistic missiles are
relatively easier to store and handle. Additionally,
since they come preloaded with solid fuel, they can be
quickly reloaded onto launchers and relaunched in a
relatively short time. In this respect, they are considered
militarily superior. Such characteristics are expected to
contribute to improving the ability to conduct surprise
attacks. While in the past solid fuel propelled ballistic
missiles developed and retained by North Korea were
mainly short-range missiles, Chairman Kim raised the
development of solid fuel propelled ICBMs as a task
in January 2021 and has actually launched solid fuel
propelled ICBM-class ballistic missiles as well as new
solid fuel-propelled IRBM-class ballistic missiles, so
future developments need to be closely watched.
(ii) Enhancement of penetration capabilities for Ballistic

Missile Defense (BMD)

North Korea is advancing the development of ballistic
missiles that fly at low altitudes with irregular trajectories
in an attempt to breach other countries’ missile defense
networks. The SRBM A, SRBM B, and SRBM D, as
well as rail-launched ballistic missiles and a new type
of SLBM with a similar outline to the SRBM A, with
irregular trajectories, are believed to be capable of flying
at lower altitudes than conventional ballistic missiles.

Furthermore, North Korea raised the development

of “hypersonic gliding flight warheads” as one of its
priority targets. Actually, it has launched several types of
missiles it called “hypersonic missiles” since September
2021. In this way, North Korea is persistently pursuing
missile development to make interception difficult and to
breach missile defense networks.
(iii) Developing long-range missiles
North Korea consistently pursues development of
SRBMs flying with irregular trajectories as well as
long-range missiles with ranges covering the United
States. North Korea’s ICBM-class ballistic missiles
Hwasong-17 and -18 are thought to have a range of over
15,000 km depending on the weight of its warhead, etc.
In such a case, the whole U.S. territory including the
East Coast is within its range.

For the operationalization of these ballistic missiles,

it is said that technology to protect the re-entry vehicle
f th t l hi h t t t d d i

-----

the atmospheric re entry of the warhead is required.
Although North Korea announced that the reliability of
warheads in the re-entry environment had been proven
after launching ICBM-class missiles “Hwasong-14” and
“Hwasong-15” in 2017, careful analysis is still needed
to determine whether this technology actually has been
established.

On the other hand, should North Korea make further

progress in the development of long-range ballistic
missiles, it may unilaterally come to have a recognition
that it has secured a strategic deterrence against the
United States. If North Korea has such a false sense
of confidence and recognition regarding its deterrence,
it could lead to an increase and escalation of military
provocations by North Korea in the region, a situation
that Japan needs to be deeply concerned about.
**(b) Enhancement of missile operation capabilities**
North Korea has launched ballistic missiles in various
patterns such as multiple and simultaneous launches,
consecutive launches at very short intervals and multiple
launches from various locations at specific targets.

First, there have been some cases since 2014 in

which it launched multiple missiles from unprecedented
locations, cutting across the Korean Peninsula, in the
early morning and late at night using TELs. In recent
years, North Korea has conducted launch drills and
other training combining SRBMs with various types
of artillery, showing that it has the capability to launch
multiple missiles simultaneously at a given time and
place.

Second, North Korea attempts consecutive launches

at very short intervals. For example, the SRBM C which
North Korea refers to as a “super-large multiple rocket
launcher” is thought to be developed in order to enhance
continuous fire capabilities. In fact, from 2019, there
was a case, in which two SRBM C were launched at
estimated intervals of less than one minute.

Third, there have been some cases since 2019, in

which North Korea launched multiple ballistic missiles
and other weapons from various places and hit specific
targets.

Through these launches, North Korea is believed to be

pursuing the enhancement of practical missile operation
capabilities with saturation attack and the like in mind.


**(4) Future Trends in Weapons Development**
Chairman Kim specifically mentioned the development
of various weapons as future military objectives at the
8th Congress of the KWP in January 2021. The goals
presented at this time are believed to be included in the
“five-year plan.”

With regard to nuclear weapons and missiles,

Chairman Kim also mentioned “tactical nuclear
weapons” as further advancement of nuclear technology,
miniaturization and weight reduction of nuclear weapons
and development of tactical weapons. He also stated that
North Korea would promote the production of “supersized nuclear warheads,” improve its hit rate on targets
within a 15,000 km range and upgrade its “preemptive
and retaliatory nuclear strike capabilities.” In addition,
North Korea mentioned the promotion of research and
development of multi-warhead technology, “hypersonic
gliding flight warheads,” nuclear-powered submarines,
“underwater-launched strategic nuclear weapons” and
solid fuel-propelled ICBM, demonstrating its stance of
relentlessly pursuing increasingly complex and diverse
modes of attack. In addition, besides the nuclear and
missile capabilities, development of reconnaissance
means, including military reconnaissance satellites and
unmanned reconnaissance aerial vehicles, was also
mentioned.

In fact, since this year, North Korea has launched

missiles repeatedly as if to advance the process of the
development plan presented at the Congress.

Furthermore, these objectives seem to have a certain

degree of priority. North Korea stated that the hypersonic
missile R&D project was “belonging to the five high
priority challenges in the strategic weapons division of
the five-year plan” when it launched a missile referred
to as “hypersonic missile Hwasong-8” in September
2021. North Korea stated in December 2022 that the
“captive firing test of high-thrust solid-fuel engine” was
completed successfully and that Chairman Kim rated
this highly, saying, “another significant problem has
been solved to realize the five high priority challenges
in the strategic weapons division of the five-year plan,”
and stated that he expected to “show another new
strategic weapon” in the shortest period of time.[32] At a
meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party
of Korea in December 2023, Chairman Kim stated that
the launching of satellites would mark “the realization

**Chapter**


**32 Chairman Kim also stated in the 6th plenary meeting of 8th Central Committee of KWP at the end of the same month that North Korea will develop “another ICBM system” with the mission**


-----

of the prerequisite task of modernizing the Republic s
armed forces, as set out at the 8th Congress of the Party.”
From these statements, North Korea is believed to be
promoting research and development while prioritizing
the realization of “hypersonic gliding warheads,” solidfuel-propelled ICBMs, and the launch of “military
reconnaissance satellites” in its “five-year plan.”

On November 21, 2023, North Korea launched the

“Malligyong-1,” which it claims is a “reconnaissance
satellite,” using the aforementioned “Chollima-1,” and it
insisted that it had accurately entered its orbit. Regarding
this “reconnaissance satellite,” North Korea had been
publicly disclosing its activities toward its launch since
2022. On February 27 and March 5 of the same year,
North Korea launched ICBM-class ballistic missiles,
claiming that they were tests for the development of a
“reconnaissance satellite,” and later made public footage
of Chairman Kim’s inspection of the “reconnaissance
satellite,” during which he stated that the purpose of
military reconnaissance satellites is to obtain real-time
military information on the ROK, Japan, and the Pacific
Ocean, that a large number of “reconnaissance satellites”
would be deployed within the “five-year plan” period,
and that to that end, the Sohae Satellite Launching
Station in the Tongch’ang-ri district would be renovated
and expanded.

In May, August, and November 2023 and May 2024,

North Korea went ahead with launches using ballistic
missile technology for the purpose of a satellite launch
from the vicinity of Tongch’ang-ri on the west coast of
North Korea towards the south, after giving advance
notices of the durations and drop zones. The launches
in May and August 2023 and May 2024 are believed
to have failed to deploy satellites, but as for the launch
in November 2023, it was confirmed that the object
launched at that time is orbiting Earth. The details of
what functions this object is performing are still being
analyzed.

At the December 2023 Plenary Meeting of the Central

Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, Chairman
Kim Jong-un mentioned the launches of three additional


reconnaissance satellites as a goal for 2024 and is

expected to continue to conduct launches using ballistic
missile technology for the purpose of a satellite launch
in the future.

Furthermore, Vice Department Director of the Central

Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party (KWP) Kim
Yo-jong stated in December 2022 and February 2023,
“try right now” and “the frequency for us to use the
Pacific Ocean as our shooting range” was dependent on
the action of U.S. Forces in refuting views questioning
North Korea’s acquisition of atmospheric re-entry
technologies for ICBM-class ballistic missiles. It is
pointed out that this was suggesting the possibility for
North Korea to decide to verify whether its ICBM-class
missiles can tolerate practical use through launching
them towards the Pacific Ocean if North Korea escalates
provocation in the future.

In addition, North Korea showed its stance to pursue

the diversification of its nuclear delivery systems through
the statement made in March and April 2023 and January
2024 that it had tested weapons called an “underwater
nuclear attack boat,” namely “Haeil”, and a weapon
described as an “underwater nuclear weapon system”.

In this way, North Korea constantly focuses on the

R&D of related technologies in line with the “five-year
plan,” while claiming that these are “defensive” actions
and making the situation a fait accompli. It is possible
that North Korea may continue to repeatedly launch
various missiles and the like to accomplish the “five-year
plan.”

launched 59 ballistic missiles, the highest number ever in a single
year. Although the number of launches in 2023 was not as high as
in 2022, North Korea launched new solid-fuel propelled ICBM-class
ballistic missiles as well as a “military reconnaissance satellite”
using “Chollima-1”, what North Korea claims to be a “new satellitecarrying rocket.” Thus, North Korea seems to be focusing on
improving its nuclear and missile capabilities in a qualitative sense.

The Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea held in 2021 provides

a glimpse into the blueprint for the currently observed direction of
North Korea’s nuclear and missile development. At the Congress in
2021, Chairman Kim mentioned specific goals, such as reducing
the size and weight of nuclear weapons, the development of tactical
nuclear weapons, “super-sized nuclear warheads”, “hypersonicgliding flight warheads,” and solid-fuel propelled ICBMs, and the
operation of “military reconnaissance satellites.” North Korea
appears to be systematically strengthening its nuclear and missile
development and operational capabilities to achieve these goals.

Looking at the situation of North Korea’s actual launches, we

can see that technological progress has been made to a certain
extent in line with these development goals. In particular, regarding
ICBM-class ballistic missiles, North Korea launched the liquid fuelpropelled “Hwasong-17” and the solid fuel-propelled “Hwasong-18”
in March and December 2023, respectively, as launch training,
indicating that their test launch stage had been completed.

Furthermore, there is a possibility that the goals mentioned

at the 2021 Workers’ Party Congress are not all of North Korea’s
development goals, and the boundaries of the development goals may
expand depending on the development situation. In the past, there
have been cases where weapons systems that were not explicitly
mentioned at the 2021 Workers’ Party Congress were later found
to be included in the development goals, as evidenced by remarks
made during inspections by Chairman Kim. It is believed that both
the production of transporter erector launchers (TELs), which was
mentioned by Chairman Kim during his military factory tour in August
2023, and the renewal of IRBM capabilities, which was mentioned
by him during the IRBM solid fuel engine test in November 2023, are
also development goals. From 2023 to 2024, Kim Jong-un inspected
factories producing various types of TELs and it was reported that
in January 2024 the production of TELs for strategic missiles was
making progress. Since 2024, North Korea has also launched new
solid-fuel propelled IRBM-class ballistic missiles.

North Korea has been developing and launching various types of

stance toward the ROK. Continuing on from 2022, North Korea
has conducted short-range ballistic missile launches with high
frequency since 2023, including launches purported to be training
for a “tactical nuclear operations unit.” In April and August 2023,
it was reported that Chairman Kim checked a front-line offensive
operation plan and discussed military action guidelines for frontline troops at meetings of the Central Military Commission (CMC) of
the Workers’ Party of Korea, with images of Chairman Kim pointing
to what appears to be a map of the ROK . The December 2023
Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of
Korea described its relations with the ROK as “relations between
two states hostile to each other” and referred to North Korea’s
readiness in a contingency to mobilize all means, including nuclear
weapons, to conquer the entire territory of the ROK.

Domestically, North Korea seems to be making progress in

legislation on its nuclear weapons. In September 2022, North
Korea adopted “the law on the state policy on the nuclear forces,”
which sets forth the conditions for the use of nuclear weapons. And
in September 2023, it amended the Socialist Constitution of the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, stipulating that it would
develop nuclear weapons to a higher level to deter war. Thereby,
North Korea is believed to have indicated to the international
community its direction toward possessing and developing nuclear
weapons as its external stance.

As these examples show, throughout the year, North Korea has

sought to improve its missile-related technologies and operational
capabilities, which are believed to be aimed at 1) acquiring
deterrence against the United States through the possession of
nuclear and long-range missiles and 2) developing tactical nuclear
weapons and various missiles as their delivery systems that enable
North Korea to deal with an armed conflict against U.S. and ROK
forces. In particular, regarding the development of tactical nuclear
weapons and their delivery means, it has been suggested that
North Korea is attempting to compel its adversaries to fear the
possibility of it using nuclear weapons as a military response in
the event of a war and aiming to take the lead in managing the
escalation of the situation. If North Korea becomes more confident
in its ability to manage situations at all stages of a conflict, its
military provocations could escalate further.

**(2) Economic Conditions**
In the economic domain, North Korea has been facing
chronic stagnation and energy and food shortages due
to the vulnerability of its socialist planned economy
and diminishing economic cooperation with the former
Soviet Union and East European countries following
the end of the Cold War. Furthermore, it faces enhanced
independent sanctions by countries including Japan and
the United States and sanctions based on UN Security
Council resolutions adopted in response to nuclear tests
and ballistic missile launches.[33]

Furthermore, it is believed that COVID-19 infections

and natural disasters largely affected North Korea’s
economy from 2020. However, North Korea declared


victory over and eradication of COVID 19 in August

2022. It is now considered that restrictions have been
somewhat relaxed, as evidenced by North Korea inviting
representatives from China and Russia to its military
parade in July 2023.

In January 2021, Chairman Kim presented a new

“five-year plan for national economic development”
based on self-reliance and self-sufficiency. Regarding
this plan, Chairman Kim had stated in 2023 that the task
was to “establish a decisive guarantee for the completion
of the five-year plan,” but in 2024, looking back over
the three years from 2021, he said that “he has become
confident that the five-year plan can be fully completed.”
Thus, even under difficult circumstances, it is believed
that North Korea continues to consider rebuilding the
economy in accordance with “the plan” important.

a situation that threatens the safety of Japanese fishing boats operating in the EEZ. In this sea area, the Fisheries Agency and the Japan Coast Guard are working together to conduct strict
surveillance vigilance and control in the waters around Japan, including issuing warnings to foreign fishing vessels engaged in illegal fishing. See the Cabinet Office Annual Report, “The

Nevertheless, as North Korea is unlikely to carry out any
structural reforms that could lead to the destabilization of
its current ruling system, it will face various challenges
in making fundamental improvements to its current
economic situation. Furthermore, it has also been pointed
out that amid the difficult economic and food situation,
the regime is wary of social unrest caused by the influx of
information from abroad and is further strengthening its
ideological control. This is notable from the perspective
of the stability of the regime.

North Korea is presumed to be evading the UN Security

Council sanctions by conducting ship-to-ship transfers
prohibited by the UN Security Council resolutions.[34]
The final report of the UN Security Council’s Panel of
Experts assisting the North Korea Sanctions Committee
(“Final Report of the Panel of Experts submitted pursuant
to resolution 2680 (2023)”), released in March 2024,
pointed out that, between January 1 and September 15,
2023, approximately 1.02 million to 1.52 million barrels
of refined petroleum products, exceeding the annual
limit of half a million barrels, may have been illegally
transported to North Korea with North Korean-flagged
tankers.

continued goal of complete denuclearization of the
Korean Peninsula.” Although the United States clearly
stated, in the National Security Strategy (NSS) published
in October 2022, that it will seek sustained diplomacy
with North Korea to make tangible progress towards
complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,
progress such as formal restarting of dialogue has not
been seen, and the relationship between the United
States and North Korea remains deadlocked.

Although North Korea voluntarily declared to stop

“the test launch of inter-continental ballistic rockets” in
April 2018, no progress has been seen in the U.S.-North
Korea relationship. Then, in January 2022, Chairman
Kim ordered North Korean officials to “promptly
examine the issue of restarting all temporarily suspended
activities” based on the assessment that the “hostile policy
and military threat by the United States have reached a
danger line that cannot be overlooked anymore.” In fact,
North Korea restarted launching ICBM-class ballistic
missiles from February 2022. Chairman Kim stated
that North Korea will thoroughly prepare for long term
confrontation against the United States.[35]

**(2) Relations with the ROK**
The three inter-Korean summit meetings in 2018 led
to major progress in inter-Korean relations, including
an agreement on the “Panmunjom Declaration,” which
confirms, among other matters, that the two parties
agreed to completely cease all hostile acts against each
other in every domain and confirmed the common goal
of realizing a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. The summit
meetings also led to an agreement on the “Pyongyang
Joint Declaration of September 2018,” which refers to
the ending of military hostilities, and the “Agreement on
the Implementation of the Panmunjom Declaration in the
Military Domain,” which prescribes concrete measures
to ease inter-Korean military tensions. However, there
has been no progress in inter-Korean relations since the
breakdown of the U.S.-North Korea summit meeting in
2019.

Furthermore, in April 2022, after President Yoon

Suk Yeol, who demonstrates a strict stance against
North Korea, assumed the presidency in the ROK,
Kim Yo-jong, Vice Department Director of the Central

**(1) Relations with the United States**
In June 2018 at the historic U.S.-North Korea summit
meeting, Chairman Kim presented his intention to work
towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula. However, the second U.S.-North Korea
summit meeting in February 2019 ended without any
agreement being reached between the two countries.
After that, while North Korea stated that the United States
is its “biggest enemy,” it has shown a stance that the key
to establishing a new U.S.-North Korea relationship is
withdrawal of hostile policy towards North Korea by the
United States.

In April 2021, the United States announced that it

had completed a review of its policy towards North
Korea and that it would explore diplomacy with North
Korea under a “calibrated practical approach” with the

engaging in illicit ship-to-ship transfers.

Committee of the KWP, stated in her press statement
that while the ROK was not a main enemy and that the
north and the south were of the same nation who should
not fight each other, if the ROK selected a military
confrontation, “our nuclear combat forces will fulfill
their duty.” Chairman Kim also stated in his speech
in July 2022 that if the ROK conducted preemptive
strikes, North Korea would retaliate immediately and
the “Yoon administration and his armed forces will be
annihilated.” North Korea’s attitude to the ROK began
to turn harsh. Regarding its military activity involving
a series of missile launches, North Korea announced
it had conducted training of “tactical nuclear weapons
operation units,” hypothetically targeting airfields in the
ROK in October 2022. Moreover, until December of the
same year, North Korea repeatedly conducted shelling
towards the area in which military exercises are banned
by the military agreement between the south and north
Korea.

In November 2023, in response to North Korea’s

launches using ballistic missile technology for the
purpose of a satellite launch, the ROK suspended some
clauses of the “Agreement on the Implementation of the
Panmunjom Declaration in the Military Domain” and
resumed the reconnaissance and surveillance activities
against North Korea along the Military Demarcation
Line it had conducted in the past. In response, North
Korea declared the complete abandonment of the
agreement. In December of the same year, Chairman
Kim described the relationship between North Korea
and the ROK as “the relationship between two hostile
nations” and mentioned the necessity of “keeping pace
with the powerful military actions of the Korean People’s
Army to subjugate the whole territory of the south” in
contingency as an important task in the external sector.
In addition, in January 2024, North Korea and the ROK
conducted firing drills on both sides of the North Limit
Line (NLL), including around Yeonpyeong Island
(Yeonpyeongdo).

**(3) Relations with Other Countries**
While North Korea has been repeating hardline
statements against the United States and the ROK, it
appears to be seeking to strengthen cooperation with
China and Russia, with the North Korean Foreign
Ministry stating that the relationships between China,
North Korea and Russia “play a central role in protecting


peace and stability not only in the Korean Peninsula and
the surrounding region but also in the world.”
(i) Relations with China
China is a vital political and economic partner for North
Korea and maintains a degree of influence on North
Korea. The “Sino–North Korean Treaty of Friendship,
Co-operation, and Mutual Assistance” signed in 1961
is still effective, and China is currently North Korea’s
biggest trade partner. In 2021, trade volume between
China and North Korea was very large, accounting for
over 90% of North Korea’s total trade (excluding trade
between North Korea and the ROK),[36] suggesting North
Korea’s dependence on China.

In regard to the situation in North Korea and its

nuclear issue, China has stated that the issues should be
resolved through dialogue and consultations based on
the concept of a “dual-track approach” (denuclearization
of the Korean Peninsula and the transition from the
armistice mechanism to a peaceful mechanism) and the
principle of phased and synchronized actions. In recent
years, China has demonstrated a stance of defending
North Korea’s repeated provocations through exercising
its power of veto with Russia over a draft UNSC sanction
resolution proposed by the United States for North
Korea’s launching of ICBM-class ballistic missiles,
and it stated that the current worsened situation on the
Korean Peninsula was caused by the United States.

The China-North Korea summit meeting was held five

times from March 2018 to June 2019. In October 2022,
Chairman Kim sent a congratulatory telegram to General
Secretary Xi Jinping on his reelection. In September 2023,
General Secretary Xi sent a congratulatory telegram to
Chairman Kim on the 75th anniversary of the founding
of North Korea in which he conveyed China’s desire to

forces not only its Army but also its Navy and Air Force
in order to establish an omni-directional defense posture.
The ROK Forces are focused on building the “Korean
three-axis system” consisting of kill chain, Korea Air
and Missile Defense (KAMD), and Korea Massive
Punishment and Retaliation (KMPR). In January 2023,
President Yoon stated that the KMPR is the most
important part of the “Korean three-axis system.”[37]
Amid this, in December of the same year, the ROK
military’s first reconnaissance satellite, which the ROK
Ministry of National Defense positions as the foundation
of the “Korean three-axis system,” was launched in the
United States. The strategic command for the effective
integrated operation of forces in the system is scheduled
to be established in 2024.

In terms of ballistic missiles, the ROK appears to have

operationally deployed Hyunmoo-2 missiles with an
estimated range of 300-800 km and other missiles. The
ROK also promotes the development of “high power”
type missiles; for example, it is said that a test launch of
Hyunmoo-4 missile with a two-ton warhead and 800 km
firing range was successfully conducted in 2020, and a
missile under development that is said to be Hyunmoo-5


and equipped with a heavier warhead was announced
in October 2022.[38] Moreover, the ROK announced that
it successfully conducted a test launch of a submarinelaunched ballistic missile (SLBM) in 2021.

With regard to cruise missiles, the ROK appears to

have operationally deployed the Hyunmoo-3 surface-tosurface cruise missile, which is believed to have a range
of about 500-1,500 km, and the Haeseong series ship-toship/ship-to-surface cruise missiles, which are believed
to have a maximum range of 1,000-1,500 km.

Furthermore, the ROK has been actively working

on equipment export in recent years. In particular, in
2022, the annual export resulted more than doubled that
of 2021 on a contract basis, reaching US$17.3 billion,
including a large-scale export contract with Poland
that is striving to enhance its defense capabilities after
Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. Although the value
for the 2023 contract was about $14 billion, down from
the previous year’s record high, the number of export
partners reportedly increased from 4 to 12 countries.

Defense spending in FY2024 (regular budget)

increased by about 4.2% from the previous fiscal year

At the summit level, the ROK stated in the Washington

Declaration of the U.S.-ROK summit meeting[41] in April
2023 that the country recognized the importance to
trust the U.S. commitment for extended deterrence and
reaffirmed the ROK’s commitment to its obligations
under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (NPT). The U.S.-ROK Nuclear Consultative
Group (NCG), whose establishment was announced at
the summit meeting, held its inaugural meeting on July
18, 2023, and on the same day, a U.S. strategic nuclear
submarine made its first port call in the ROK in about
40 years.

While the United States and the ROK had aborted or

reduced the scale of U.S.-ROK joint military exercises
from 2018, considering the progress of dialogue with
North Korea, both countries have been expanding
the scope and scale of the exercises since the Yoon
administration was established in May 2022. The regular
command post exercises have been changed to the form
that the Freedom Shield (FS) exercise is conducted in
first half of a year and the Ulchi Freedom Shield (UFS)
exercise is in the latter half. In the UFS exercise from
August to September 2022, a field training was resumed
in parallel with command post exercises for the first time
in four years. In March to April 2023, in cooperation
with the FS exercise, largescale joint field training
“Warrior Shield” was conducted with U.S. bombers,
aircraft carrier and amphibious assault ship deployed.
In addition, the UFS exercise was held in August of the
same year continuing on from the 2022 exercise, and
field training was conducted on a larger scale than the
2022 UFS exercise.

Regarding the deployment of U.S. strategic assets

around the Korean Peninsula, a U.S.-ROK maritime
exercise involving the U.S. aircraft carrier Ronald
Reagan and a U.S.-ROK air exercise involving U.S.
B-1B bombers were conducted in 2022.[42] In 2023,
U.S. strategic assets, including the aforementioned U.S.
strategic nuclear submarine, were alledgedly deployed
17 times, a significant increase from five in 2022.

At the same time, the two countries deal with such

issues as the transition of operational control (OPCON)


**Part**

**Chapter**


The United States and the ROK have taken various steps
to deepen the U.S.-ROK Alliance in recent years. The
two countries regularly confirm the strengthening of the
U.S.-ROK Alliance at various levels.

As specific undertakings through the Security

Consultative Meeting (SCM), a consultative body
headed by the defense ministers of both countries,
the two countries approved the “Tailored Deterrence
Strategy,” designed to enhance deterrence against North
Korean nuclear and other WMD threats, at the 45th U.S.ROK SCM in 2013.

At the 46th SCM in 2014, the two countries

agreed on “Concepts and Principles of the ROK-U.S.
Alliance Comprehensive Counter-missile Operations
(4D Operational Concept)” to tackle North Korean
ballistic missile threats. At the 47th SCM in 2015, the
implementation guidance on the 4D Operational Concept
was approved.

Recently, at the 53rd SCM in 2021, the United States

and the ROK approved new Strategic Planning Guidance
(SPG) for the first time in 11 years and agreed to update
their operation plans based on the SPG. Moreover, at the
54th SCM, the first for the Yoon administration in 2022,
both countries agreed to several measures to enhance
extended deterrence such as strengthening deployment
of U.S. strategic assets[39] around the Korean Peninsula[40]
and regularly conducting tabletop exercises including a
North Korea nuclear use scenario. At the 55th U.S.-ROK
SCM in 2023, the “2023 Tailored Deterrence Strategy,”
revised for the first time in 10 years, was approved, and it
was confirmed that it reflects guidelines for how to utilize
all categories of U.S. military capabilities, including
U.S. nuclear capabilities, as well as ROK’s conventional
capabilities.


**39 According to the ROK “Defense White Paper 2022,” U.S. strategic assets are the military capabilities provided by the United States that effectively deter external attack and provocations and**

ensure an overwhelming response. They include the U.S. nuclear triad (ICBMs, strategic bombers, and strategic submarine ballistic nuclear (SSBNs)), as well as some conventional forces
(aircraft carrier strike groups, B-1B bombers, and cruise-missile nuclear submarines [SSGNs]).

**40 The ROK stated that it will increase the frequency and intensity of deployment of U.S. strategic assets to a level equivalent to permanent deployment.**
**41 President Biden stated in the joint press conference after the U.S.-ROK summit meeting that the United States will not station nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula.**
**42 Other than this, U.S.-ROK air force training was conducted with B-52H bombers and F-22 fighter jets deployed around the Korean Peninsula in December 2022. The name of the U.S.-ROK**

air force training conducted from October to November 2023 was changed from “Vigilant Storm” to “Vigilant Defense,” but no announcement was made about deployment of U.S. strategic

to the ROK and the realignment of U.S. Forces Korea.

For the transition of OPCON to the ROK, aiming to

complete the transition by December 1, 2015, the two
countries have reviewed the approach of transitioning
from the existing combined defense arrangement of the
United States and ROK Forces, to a new joint defense
arrangement led by the ROK Forces and supported by
the U.S. Forces.

Nevertheless, based on the increasing seriousness

of North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats, the two
sides decided at the 46th SCM in 2014 to re-postpone
the transition of OPCON and to adopt a conditionsbased approach, i.e., implementing the transition
when conditions such as the ROK Forces’ enhanced
capabilities are met. At the 50th SCM in October 2018,
it was decided that following the transition of OPCON,
a ROK military officer will serve as the commander of
the Future Combined Forces Command, replacing the
current arrangement of a U.S. military officer serving as
the commander of the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces.

Initial Operational Capability (IOC) verification was

conducted as the first step to evaluate ROK Forces’
capability in combined command post exercise in August
2019, and the important role of the exercise to verify
IOC was confirmed. Furthermore, Full Operational
Capability (FOC) evaluation was conducted as the
second step in the UFS exercise in 2022, and at the
54th SCM in November 2022, it was confirmed that the
FOC evaluation was successfully conducted and that all
assessment tasks met the criteria.[44]

ROK Forces stated that the United States and the

ROK comprehensively consider the results of combined
evaluation about ROK Forces’ military capabilities
of leading U.S.-ROK combined defense and ability to
respond to North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats,
which are necessary for the transition of OPCON, then
steadily promote evaluation of the Future Combined
Forces Command according to procedures for each of the
steps. The 55th U.S.-ROK SCM in 2023 also discussed
the future direction toward the transition of OPCON to
the Future Combined Forces Command.

With regard to the realignment of the U.S. Forces

Korea, an agreement had been reached in 2003 on
the relocation of the U.S. Forces’ Yongsan Garrison


located in the center of Seoul to the Pyeongtaek area,
south of Seoul and on the relocation of the U.S. Forces
stationed north of the Han River to the south of the river.
Subsequently, however, the agreement has been partially
revised, due to various factors, including: in relation to
the postponement of the transition of OPCON, it After
the China-ROK foreign ministers’ meeting in August
2022, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China insisted
that the ROK government stated the policy of “One
Restriction” in which the ROK limits the operation of
the THAAD already deployed to U.S. Forces Korea,
in addition to the “Three Nos” (no participation in the
United States’ missile defense system, no consideration
for additional THAAD deployment, no development of
Japan-U.S.-ROK security cooperation to military allies)
that the ROK government is said to have announced
externally in 2017.has been necessary for some U.S.
Forces personnel to remain at Yongsan Garrison; and it
was decided that the counterfires forces of U.S. Forces
Korea would remain in their location north of the Han
River to counter the threat of North Korea’s long-range
rocket artillery.

In July 2017, the U.S. Eighth Army headquarters

relocated to the Pyeongtaek area; in June 2018 the
headquarters of U.S. Forces Korea and UN Command,
and in November 2022, the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces
Command Headquarters also relocated to the same area.

Concerning defense burden sharing, whereby the ROK

government bears a portion of the total stationing costs
of the U.S. Forces Korea to ensure a stable stationing
environment, in March 2021, the United States and
the ROK reached an agreement on the 11th Special
Measures Agreement (SMA). This agreement is valid for
six years from 2020 to 2025. Total amount for FY2020
remains unchanged at the FY2019 level and 13.9%
increase for FY 2021, compared to FY2020, while for
FY2022-FY2025 the rate of increase in the ROK defense
spending from the previous year will be applied.

the strategic security interests of China. Although
both countries agreed in October 2017 to continue
communicating on the THAAD-related issues that China
was concerned about through channels established
between their respective military authorities, conflicting
views still remain.[46] The Yoon administration has made
it clear that the THAAD issue is a matter relating to the
sovereignty and security of the ROK and that it will
respond consistently and resolutely based on national
interests and principles. Attention will be focused on
future trends in China-ROK relations.

**(2) Relations with Russia**
The ROK and Russia have agreed on cooperation in
the areas of military technology, defense industry, and


military supplies. Both countries held Defense Strategy
Dialogue in August 2018 and agreed to promote the
dialogue to vice minister level and, in November 2021,
also agreed to set up hotlines between Navies and
between Air Forces.

The ROK has implemented sanctions against Russia

and provided military supplies and other resources to
Ukraine in a show of solidarity with the international
community following Russia’s aggression against
Ukraine since February 2022. Although the ROK still
maintains a cautious attitude to deliver lethal weapons
to Ukraine, President Yoon suggests possible support
outside the scope of humanitarian and economic ones
when Ukraine civilians receive attacks in a largescale.
An attention will be focused on what measures the ROK
will take based on the situation in Ukraine and in terms
of stably managing the relationship with Russia.

not only for the use of nuclear or other WMDs, but also
in the event of invasion using conventional weapons,
where the survival of the country itself is imperiled.

In June 2020, for the first time, Russia released a

policy document, “Basic Principles of State Policy of
the Russian Federation on Nuclear Deterrence,” which is
equivalent to the so-called nuclear doctrine. Criteria for
the use of nuclear weapons are the same as the criteria
described in the military doctrine, but the document
clarifies the conditions for Russia to newly proceed to
the use of nuclear weapons. In the “Basic Principles,”
it is explained that, in addition to the “individual states

**Chapter**


Russia has promoted full-scale military reform since 1997
by presenting the three pillars of reform: downsizing;
modernization; and professionalization. By January
2021, joint strategic commands were placed instead of
four military districts (Western, Southern, Central and
Eastern Districts) as well as the Northern Fleet (in charge
of units facing the Arctic) and the military forces have
been jointly operated under each District Commander in
this system. However, since the commencement of the
aggression against Ukraine in February 2022, Russia
shows some movements to increase strength as well as
to enlarge and reorganize units.

Defence Minister Shoigu proposed to increase total

strength to 1.5 million troops, establish two military
districts in Moscow and Leningrad, reorganize several
existing brigades into divisions, newly deploy one
corps to the Finland border region, and other measures
to President Putin at the Ministry of Defence staff
conference expanded meeting in December 2022. At
a meeting in December 2023, it was reported that the
number of the military personnel had reached 1.15 million
during the year and that two combined arms armies, a
mixed aviation corps, four divisions, 18 brigades, and 28
regiments had already been newly formed. On February
26, 2024, President Putin signed a presidential decree on
the reestablishment of military districts, which stipulated
the creation of the Moscow Military District and the
Leningrad Military District.

As for the navy, in May 2023 the Commander-in
Chief of the Russian Navy expressed his recognition
that “a strong navy directly commanded by the General
Headquarters of the Navy is necessary,” and it has been
pointed out that during the same year, each fleet of the
Navy was withdrawn from the subordination of the
military districts and returned to direct subordination
to the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy from
corresponding military districts. This is believed to be
because the Russian Navy placed more importance on

Russian Ministry of Defence announced that four new
Tu-160 strategic bombers were delivered in 2023.

As for non-strategic nuclear forces, Russia is working

to deploy various non-strategic missiles such as the
surface-to-surface missile system **“Iskander,” which is**
believed to be capable of carrying either conventional or
non-strategic nuclear warheads, the sea-launched cruise
missile system “Kalibr,” the air-launched cruise missile
Kh-101, and the air-launched ballistic missile “Kinzhal.”
Russia places these missiles as “non-nuclear deterrence
by precise guided weapons,” and considers them
important. In particular, Russia has been promoting the
deployment of warships capable of carrying the “Kalibr”
submarine-launched cruise missile (SLCM) system in
the Far East. It is necessary to closely watch this trend
because it could have a major impact on the security
environment around Japan.


**2** **New Types of Weapons**

Russia has opposed ongoing missile defense system
build ups by the United States domestically and abroad
in recent years.

Russia announces that it develops the following

various advanced weapons in order to penetrate missile
defense systems deployed in the United States and other
countries, that can be countermeasures for Russian
ballistic missiles which are the foundations of Russia’s
nuclear forces.

・ Hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) “Avangard,” which

is claimed to be capable of flying at speeds greater

particular, it has been pointed out that in Ukraine, various

being deployed on the front lines and used against the
Ukrainian military’s GPS-guided artillery shells and
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

**5** **Trends Related to the AFRF (General)**


**Part**

**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


Russia has conducted research and development for
equipment based on its State Armament Program (GPV).
However, it is pointed out that several factors, such as the
need to cover the loss of equipment from the aggression
against Ukraine, and very low availability of machine
tools and various parts due to economic sanctions, are
hindering the continuation of the GPV.

Land Forces continue tests for advanced equipment

such as T-14 tanks and Koalitsiya-SV self-propelled 155
mm howitzers.

The Aerospace Force announced that deployment

of the pre-production model of the so-called “fifthgeneration fighter” Su-57 was started, and that it is
putting effort into integration of unmanned aircraft and
manned aircraft for UAV development.

The Russian Navy plans to increase the rate of

modernization of its equipment to 70% by 2027. Because
the development of surface vessels for coastal waters is
being completed, the Navy will now move on to building
surface vessels for the open sea.

**4** **Space and Electromagnetic Domain**


Since 2010, the AFRF has been conducting large-scale
round-robin exercises in each military district, with the
objective of verifying the combat readiness of the military
districts, etc.[2] These exercises are helping to improve the
long-distance mobilization capability of the AFRF. In
2022, the strategic command and staff exercise Vostok
2022 was conducted in the Eastern Military District with
over 50,000 troops, and 14 countries including China
and India participated. Zapad 2023 scheduled for 2023
in The Western Military District, was canceled.

Among exercises for nuclear and missile forces, in

February 2022, just prior to the start of the aggression
against Ukraine, a large-scale missile exercise was
conducted across Russia as a “strategic deterrence forces
exercise” using strategic nuclear forces such as ICBMs
and SLBMs as well as missile forces capable of carrying
conventional or tactical nuclear warheads (Iskander,
Kalibr, Kinzhal, and Zircon). In addition, a similar
missile exercise for strategic nuclear forces also was
conducted as “strategic deterrence training” in October
2022 and in October 2023.

In the Arctic Region, Russia is developing coastal

surveillance radar networks for enhanced vigilance and
surveillance. At the same time, Russia is rebuilding
airfields and deploying Tu-22M medium-range bombers
and MiG-31 interceptor fighters, while also deploying
surface-to-air missiles and surface-to-ship missiles to
develop sufficient preparedness for dealing with airborne
threats from the north and attacks from ships. Along
with these developments, Russia has built a large-scale
residential facility for personnel at the base in two places
within the Arctic Region.

In addition to the development of such military

facilities, the AFRF has also been conducting such


The AFRF has also been stepping up its activities in
the realms of space and electromagnetic spectrum in
recent years. Russia is believed to be promoting the
development of anti-satellite weapons such as the
“Nudol” anti-satellite missile system. In November
2021, Russia announced that it would conduct a satellite
destruction test using an anti-satellite missile. Since 2013,
Russia has put satellites into both low and geostationary
orbits to conduct rendezvous and proximity operations
(RPO), which have repeatedly been observed engaging
in frequent RPO with other countries’ satellites on
geostationary orbits.

activities r4 as various exercises by naval vessels,
strategic nuclear deterrence patrols by SSBN, and
patrol flights by long-range bombers. For example, the
comprehensive Arctic expedition “Umka-2022” was
held in the Chukchi Sea in 2022. The tactical exercise
“Finval-2023” was held in the Bering Sea, outside the
Arctic Ocean, in addition to the Chukchi Sea, and the
AFRF is believed to be strengthening its defense posture
in the Arctic by expanding the area in which it conducts
exercises. In addition, Tu-95 bombers flew over the
Barents Sea and Norwegian Sea in June 2023, and some
believe that these activities were conducted to contain
Finland, which had joined NATO in April of the same
year, and Sweden, which had joined in March 2024.

Russia thus appears to be stepping up military

activities, so close scrutiny of developments in this

of the AFRF in the Far East region while also keeping in
mind the trends of units in other regions.

**(1) Nuclear Forces**
As for strategic nuclear forces in the Far East region,
approximately 30 Tu-95 bombers are deployed in
Ukrainka, and it is reported that the Russian Ministry of
Defence has plans to deploy Tu-160 long-range bombers
newly in the Far East, so it will be necessary to keep
e4 on future deployment trends of these bombers. As
for maritime nuclear forces, four Borey-class SSBNs
equipped with SLBMs are deployed in and around the
Sea of Okhotsk. Russia plans on deploying five Boreyclass SSBNs to the Pacific Fleet in the future.

**(2) Ground Forces**
The Eastern Military District now consists of 31 brigades
and two divisions with approximately 80,000 personnel
in total, including motorized rifles (mechanized infantry),
tanks, artillery, surface-to-surface missiles, material
and technology security (logistics), and air defense, as
well as a marine brigade equipped with amphibious
operations capability. The Eastern Military District
has introduced new equipment, such as the “Iskander”
surface-to-surface missile system, “Bal” and “Bastion”
surface-to-ship missiles, and the “S-400” surface-to-air
missile system.

Russia newly established the Eastern Military District
and the Eastern Joint Strategic Command in 2010.
Land Forces, the Pacific Fleet, and the Air Force and
Air Defense Units have been placed under the Military
District Commander, who conducts unified operation of
these services. Meanwhile, in December 2023, Russian
media reported that command of each fleet, including the
Pacific Fleet, was transferred from the Military District
Commanders to the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy.
It will be necessary to continue to closely monitor the
trends in the Russian military’s chain of command,
organizational restructuring, and changes in its joint
operational posture since the aggression against Ukraine
from the perspective of how the Russian military will
reflect the lessons it learned in Ukraine in its operational
posture.

The current presence of the AFRF in the Far East region

is significantly smaller than it was at its peak. However,
a considerable scale of military forces, including nuclear
forces, still remains in the region. In recent years, Russia
has also been deploying the latest equipment in the Far
East. It announced that the percentage of new equipment
in the Eastern Military District was 56% as of December
2021.

the capability of the Russian Navy to actively operate

However, today, after more than thirty years have

aggression against Ukraine. Some consider that Russia’s
influence on the former Soviet area will decline still
further in the wake of the aggression against Ukraine.

Russia strengthens military cooperation with Belarus

along with the start of the aggression against Ukraine.
Belarusian President Lukashenko asked President Putin
to modernize his country’s aircrafts to allow them to

Putin agreed. It was announced in February 2023 that
Belarusian forces deployed surface-to-surface missile

tactical nuclear weapons that Russia had delivered to the
Belarusian territory was completed in October.

Russia positions the development of bilateral and
multilateral cooperation with former Soviet republics
as one of its most important foreign policy objectives.
Russia considers that its vital interests are concentrated
in the region. It deploys its troops in the Collective
Security Treaty Organization[3] (CSTO) members
Armenia, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan, as well as Moldova
(Transnistria), Georgia (South Ossetia, Abkhazia),

withdraw from the Nagorno Karabakh Republic, which
had unilaterally declared independence on Azerbaijan’s
territory and had been exercising effective control
over the region. After being attacked by Azerbaijani
forces, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic surrendered in
September and signed an agreement for the dissolution of
the republic by January 2024. Following the dissolution,
nearly 80,000 of the 120,000 Armenian residents of the
republic are believed to have fled to Armenia.

As a result of this conflict, the Nagorno-Karabakh

Republic, which had been exercising effective control
over 4 part of Azerbaijan’s territory for more than 32
years since the end of the Soviet Union, disappeared.

The Russian armed forces, stationed as peacekeeping

forces in the republic, were unable to prevent the military
conflict, which caused Armenia, a CSTO member state
and Russia’s military ally, to lose trust in Russia, and
some believe this has exposed the decline of Russian
influence in the region.

Russia is also seen to be strengthening its cooperation

with North Korea. In September 2023, Chairman Kim
Jong-un visited the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russian
Far East and held the first summit meeting with President
Putin in four years. He also visited Komsomolsk-onAmur and was briefed on the Su-57 fifth-generation
fighter jet, and then he visited Vladivostok, where he
was briefed on the Udaloy-class destroyer “Marshal

**(2) Relations with European Countries**
Through the framework of the NATO-Russia Council
(NRC), Russia has worked with NATO as an equal
partner in the areas of common interest, such as by
participating in certain decision-making processes.
However, following the Ukrainian crisis in 2014,
NATO and European countries suspended their practical
cooperation with Russia thereafter, including that in
the military domain, except for the NRC’s ambassadorlevel meetings. Moreover, with the aggression against
Ukraine, the relationship between Russia and European
countries is the tensest it has been since the Cold War
era.

Russia recognizes that the significance of the AsiaPacific region is increasing within its multi-pronged
foreign policy and considers it strategically important to
strengthen its status in the region from the viewpoint of
socioeconomic development in Siberia and the Far East,
and security. In Asia, in addition to its relations with
China, Russia assigns an important role to its Special and
Privileged Strategic Partnership with India. In December
2021, in conjunction with the annual summit meeting,
the inaugural 2+2 Dialogue of the Foreign and Defence
Ministers was held in New Delhi. As for military
arrangements, another example of the ongoing wideranging military cooperation between Russia and India
is the joint exercise “INDRA,” which has been taking
place since 2003 with the involvement of the armies and
navies of both countries, with their air forces also taking
part in the recent years. Furthermore, Russia is working
to strengthen its relations with ASEAN, and conducted
the Naval Cooperative Exercise with ASEAN countries

are stated definitely. Above all, for Syria, the AFRF
has continued to secure the Tartus Naval Base and
Khmeimim Air Base in Syria since September 2015 to
conduct operations to support the Assad administration.
In operations in Syria, Russia has conducted bombings
using fighter bombers and long-range bombers, as well
as attacks using cruise missiles from surface ships
and submarines deployed in the Caspian Sea and the
Mediterranean Sea. It has been pointed out that Russia
maintains a military presence in Syria and is building

cooperation with neighboring countries such as Türkiye,
Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. Taking this into account,

especially Syria, cannot be ignored.

Russia is increasing its influence over both the Syrian

situation and peace in Libya, while at the same time
coordinating its interests with Türkiye. In May 2020, the
United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) announced
that Russian MiG-29 fighters were delivered to Libya
after military aircraft insignia had been removed in Syria
and accused of Russia’s involvement in creating the
war situation in Libya using private military companies
(PMCs) that the Russian government supports. It has
been also noted that approximately 2,000 personnel from
PMCs under the General Staff of the Russian Ministry of
Defence are operating in Libya.

In December 2020, the Russian government

announced an agreement with the government of
Sudan to set up a naval base on the Red Sea in Sudan,
northeastern Africa. If a base of the Russia Navy were to
be established in Sudan in the future, it is believed that
deployment capabilities of the AFRF would be improved
in the direction of the Indian Ocean.

In January 2022, the Malian military spokesman

stated that Russian instructors had been dispatched to
the country under a bilateral agreement to train Mali’s
military, and It is reported that 1,000 personnel from
PMCs under the General Staff of the Russian Ministry of
Defence are operating in Mali.


In February 2023, warships of the Russian Navy

Northern Fleet including an Admiral Gorshkov-class
frigate conducted a joint naval exercise with navies of
China and South Africa in the Indian Ocean east of South
Africa, for the second time since 2019.

Australia announced to promote (1) deeper informationand technology-sharing, (2) foster deeper integration
of security and defense-related science, technology,
industrial infrastructure and supply chains and (3)
deeper cooperation on a range of security and defense
capabilities. Furthermore, as concrete initiatives, they
clarified: (1) support for Australia to acquire at least
eight nuclear-powered submarines[2] and (2) technical
cooperation for advanced capabilities (cyber, artificial
intelligence [AI]), quantum technology and undersea
capabilities).

In April 2022, Australia, the United Kingdom and the

United States announced in relation to aforementioned
(2) that they would deepen their cooperation regarding
hypersonics and counter-hypersonic capabilities, electronic
warfare, defense innovation and information sharing.

In addition, Australia has announced its intention

to advance cooperation with the United States on the
introduction of Tomahawk cruise missiles and standoff
missiles, as well as on the development of hypersonic
missiles for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).

In March 2023, the leaders of Australia, the United

Kingdom and the United States held a summit meeting
in the U.S. and announced that they will deliver
conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines for

presence of their nuclear-powered attack submarines
(SSN) as early as 2027 at the HMAS Stirling on western
Australia and the Royal Australian Navy will also be on
board to conduct practical training. The second phase
is to acquire up to five U.S. Virginia-class submarines
in the early 2030s. In the third phase, AUKUS partners
will deliver a trilaterally-developed submarine (SSNAUKUS) for both Australia and the U.K. They will
incorporate the cutting-edge submarine technologies
of the U.S. to the U.K.’s next-generation design. The
two countries intend to build the submarines in their
domestic shipyard.

In December 2023, Australia, the U.K. and the U.S.

held an AUKUS defense ministers’ meeting and confirmed
the progress of support for Australia’s acquisition of
nuclear-powered submarines and advanced technology
cooperation. During the meeting, it was announced that:
Australian Navy crew would begin operations in Guam in
2024 to acquire nuclear-powered submarine maintenance
skills in support of the Submarine Rotational Force –
West (SRF-West) that will be established off the west
coast of Australia. The three countries will conduct joint
experiments and exercises with uncrewed maritime
systems and share and process maritime data in real
time to improve their the maritime domain awareness
and all three countries will promote the technological
development of quantum sensing to improve undersea
positioning capabilities and to accelerate technological
development of submarine-based undersea vehicle as
part of efforts to further develop the SSN-AUKUS.

In April 2024, an AUKUS defense ministers’ joint

statement was issued, confirming cooperation in the
acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines under

vessels, in addition to exchanges and cooperation in the
political areas.

Meanwhile, Australia has been clearly showing its

wariness towards China by explicitly conveying its
stance on China given the military use of South China
Sea and its expansion to Pacific island countries.

The Australian government has been expressing strong

concerns over China’s reclamation and construction
activities in South China Sea and opposing any unilateral
attempt to change or influence the status quo through
militarization or coercive actions on disputed features.
It has also expressed its intent to continue exercising its
rights to freedom of navigation and overflight.

In April 2020, Australia had suggested the necessary

for an independent investigation into the origin of novel
coronavirus outbreak in China. China successively
imposed trade blockages on Australian beef and other
products, leading to a rapid deterioration of the AustraliaChina relations.

Subsequently with the change of government in

Australia, the two countries resumed diplomatic and
security dialogue and the first Australia-China defense
ministers’ meeting in about three years was held in June
2022. In November 2023, Prime Minister Albanese
visited China and met with President Xi Jinping and
Prime Minister Li Qiang. This visit of Australian Prime
Minister to China was the first time in seven years.

On the other hand, according to the Australian

government, in November 2023, there was an incident
which had resulted in the injury of an Australian diver.
When the diver on the Royal Australian Navy frigate;

against North Korea’s illicit “ship-to-ship transfers”,

and had injured the Australian diver. The Australian
government expressed serious concerns to the Chinese
government, describing the Chinese navy’s activity as
dangerous and unprofessional, but the Chinese Ministry
of Foreign Affairs insisted the Chinese military had
consistently conducted professional operations in
accordance with international law and practice.

policy. In response to the spread of communism in East
Asia and the descending British influence in the AsiaPacific after World War II, Australia strengthened its
alliance with the United States, mainly possessing U.S.made high-performance land, sea and air equipment.
Australia has dispatched its troops to U.S.-led wars and
conflicts, such as the Vietnam War, the Gulf War and
military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Since 1985, the two countries have been regularly

convening the foreign affairs and defense ministerial
consultations or AUSMIN (Australia-United States
Ministerial Consultations), to discuss major diplomatic
and security issues. In July 2023, AUSMIN was held
in Australia and in their joint statement, both countries
noted that the U.S.-Australia alliance has never been
stronger and committed to expanding collaboration
between the two countries, as well as with regional
partners and institutions, to ensure an Indo-Pacific that
is open, stable, peaceful, prosperous and respectful of
sovereignty.

In November 2011, the United States and Australia

announced the “Force Posture Initiative,” a framework
for the rotational deployment of the U.S. forces to
Australia as part of the U.S. rebalance policy during
the Obama administration. Since 2012, the U.S. Marine
Corps has been deployed on a rotational basis to northern
Australia, including Darwin. Additionally, the U.S. Air
Force has been deploying B-52 strategic bombers and
F-22 fighter jets to Australia as needed to conduct joint
exercises and training with the RAAF. In July 2023, the
rotational deployment of the U.S. Army landing craft
took place for the first time during the U.S.-Australia
joint exercise “Talisman Sabre.” The United States and
Australia have also indicated their intention to deploy
the U.S. Navy patrol and reconnaissance aircraft on a
rotational basis in Australia in the future.

Since 2005, the U.S. Forces and ADF have biennially

conducted “Talisman Sabre” to improve interoperability
and strengthen ties among participating countries. In
2023, it was the largest exercise ever, with 13 countries
participating, with Indonesia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea
and Tonga participating for the first time. The exercise
was conducted in the land, maritime and air domains,
including amphibious operations and land combat
training.

the Australia-Philippines defense ministers’ meeting in
February 2023, it was concurred that this meeting would
be held annually from the following year. Australia has
been participating in the U.S.-Philippines joint exercise
Balikatan since 2014 and in August 2023 it conducted
its first Australian-Philippines amphibious exercise,
Exercise Alon, which included scenario training for
reclaiming enemy-captured island. Additionally, in
November the same year, Australian and the Philippines
forces conducted Maritime Cooperative Activity in the
water and air around the Philippines for the first time.

Regarding Pacific Island countries, the Albanese

Government criticized the former Morrison Government
for failing to intervene in the signing of a framework
agreement between Solomon Islands and China on
security cooperation in April 2022 and announced a
basic policy to strengthen engagement with Pacific
Island countries. Based on this policy, the government
announced the establishment of Australia Pacific
Defence School to provide training programs for
members of Pacific Island countries and security forces
and the establishment of a framework to support the
development of climate-resilient infrastructure for these
countries for which climate change is a critical issue.

Australia plays a leading role in assisting these

countries in fields such as security maintenance, natural
disasters response and maritime patrol. In addition, in
the field of maritime patrol, Australia still regularly
deploys ADF assets to the South Pacific to assist with
patrol activities. Australia has provided 18 Guardianclass patrol boats to Pacific island nations.

Australia has been deepening its relations with

Indonesia in the security and defense fields following
the signing of the Lombok Treaty, a security cooperation
framework, in November 2006 and the elevation of their
relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership
in August 2018. The bilateral relationship has been
strengthened through initiatives such as the regular

noted for its strategic significance. Its armed forces had
control over the government following the collapse of
the socialist regime in 1988. However, with an economic
slowdown caused by the economic sanctions imposed by
the West, the transition to civilian rule was completed
based on the road map to democracy.

Myanmar’s parliamentary election was conducted in

November 2020, and the National League for Democracy
(NLD) secured an overwhelming single majority in both
houses with the number of seats significantly higher
than the previous election. However, in February 2021,
then State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and her party’s
senior members were detained by Myanmar’s military,
which was claiming election fraud, and the armed forces
declared a state of emergency to carry out a coup d’état,
and powers were handed over to the commander-inchief. The State Administration Council (SAC) chaired
by Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces
Min Aung Hlaing was formed by the Armed Force.

Then, in April of the same year, although the Committee

Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) instituted by
Pro-Democracy Group declared the establishment of the
National Unity Government (NUG), the Armed Forces
designated them and others as Terrorist Organizations.
After the ASEAN Leaders’ Meeting held the same month
with the presence of a Myanmar military representative,
a “Five-Point Consensus” was agreed to, recognizing
ASEAN’s proactive and constructive role in promoting
a peaceful resolution. In August of the same year, SAC
announced the establishment of an “interim government”
with the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar Armed
Forces as the “provisional prime minister.”

Since late October 2023, fighting has intensified in

the northeast, with three ethnic armed groups launching
large-scale attacks on the Armed Force, and the Armed
Force retreating from several towns. In early January
2024, the ethnic minority side revealed that more than
2,300 Armed Force soldiers, including generals, had
surrendered in the eastern region. Meanwhile, in midJanuary, the Armed Force and Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Affairs announced that the Armed Force and the three
ethnic armed groups had reached a ceasefire agreement
in northern Myanmar, mediated by China. The details of
this ceasefire agreement have not been publicized, and its
effectiveness remains to draw attention.

At the ASEAN Summit meeting held in May 2023, the

Malaysia’s first defense white paper, which was published
in December 2019, finds its potential to serve as a bridge
between the vast Pacific and Indian Oceans as the country
is divided in two territories—Peninsular Malaysia, and
Sabah and Sarawak, on the island of Borneo—located
between the two oceans. The white paper also recognizes
the fact that, while Malaysia’s strategic location and natural
resources are blessing ones, they also pose a security
challenge to itself. Given these attributes, Malaysia has
historically been affected by the political dynamics of
major powers, and even today, Malaysia sees in its defense
white paper that uncertain U.S.-China relationship is the
most important strategic challenge for Malaysia.

In connection with the recent continued anchoring of

Chinese vessels around South Luconia Shoal, over which
Malaysia claims sovereignty, Malaysia has announced
that its Navy and maritime law enforcement agencies
would conduct around-the-clock monitoring, and that
Malaysia would protect its sovereignty.

Along with this expression of protest and strengthening

of its maritime defense capabilities, the Minister of
Defense reportedly announced the decision to establish a
new naval and air base near the airport in Bintulu, which
is close to James Shoal and South Luconia Reef.

Malaysia has also striven to bolster its defense posture

in eastern Malaysia including carrying out live-fire
missile exercises in Sabah state, on Borneo in eastern
Malaysia in July 2019.

In particular, as well as conducting bilateral exercises

with the U.S. such as CARAT and SEACAT, Malaysia
has been promoting military cooperation including
capacity building in the maritime security field.

Malaysia also prioritizes defense relations based

on the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA)[3]
and has established the headquarters of the Integrated

over the escalation of the conflict and violence was issued.
In January 2024, Special Envoy of the ASEAN Chair on
Myanmar Alounkeo visited Myanmar and held talks with
current “regime” officials, including Senior General Min
Aung Hlaing and ethnic armed groups.

Myanmar has maintained a good relationship with

China since the two countries established diplomatic
relations in 1950 and the country is regarded as a
major supplier of equipment. Myanmar has also
received Chinese aid for pipeline construction and
the development of Kyaukpyu Port. In January 2020,
President Xi Jinping became the first Chinese leader to
visit Myanmar for 19 years and affirmed China’s policy
of promoting economic cooperation through the The
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

Myanmar maintains a cooperative relationship with

Russia in the military field since the period of the
past military regime, and Russia was a destination for
students from Myanmar and a supplier of major defense
equipment. In July 2022, the Commander-in-Chief visited
Russia, and discussed promotion of defense cooperation
with the Deputy Defense Minister. Furthermore, in
September 2022, the Commander-in-Chief met President
Putin for the first time, in Vladivostok, to exchange
views on cooperation in all sectors, emphasizing their
good bilateral relations.

Cooperative relations with North Korea, including

weapons trades, were maintained under Myanmar’s military
regime in the past. Following the transition to democracy,
although Myanmar denied its military ties to North Korea,
the report issued by the Panel of Experts of the UN Security
Council Sanctions Committee on North Korea in March
2018 reported that the country received a ballistic missile
system and other weapons from North Korea.

A report published by the United Nations Human

Rights Council in May 2023 indicated that from
February 2021, when the military launched its coup, until
December 2022, at least $1 billion worth of weapons and
components for manufacturing them were exported from
foreign countries to Myanmar. This included Myanmar’s
imports such as Su-30 fighter jets from Russia and JF-17
fighter jets from China.

location and rich natural resources have also provided a
strong temptation to expansionist powers. Traditionally,
the Philippines has positioned resolving internal armed
conflicts as its greatest security concern, but it has begun
to shift its focus to strengthening territorial defense
against the backdrop of the recent dismantling and
weakening of domestic anti-government armed groups
and rising tensions in the South China Sea.

The Philippines, with a historically close relationship

with the United States, has maintained a cooperative
relationship with the U.S. under Mutual Defense Treaty
and Military Assistance Agreement, even after the
withdrawal of the U.S. Forces in 1992.

In February 1998, the two countries signed a Visiting

Forces Agreement (VFA), which prescribed the legal
status of U.S. military personnel when the U.S. Forces
conducts combined military exercises or other related
activities in the Philippines.

Furthermore, in April 2014, the two countries signed

the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA),
which allows enhanced cooperation in disaster relief,
rotational deployment of the U.S. Forces, construction
and improvement of agreed locations in the Philippines
by the U.S., and U.S. Forces’ prepositioning of equipment
and others. In March 2016, the two countries agreed on
five bases of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP)
for carrying out defense cooperation under the EDCA.
Although former President Duterte notified the United
States its intention to terminate the VFA in February
2020, he decided to withdraw the notice in July 2021.
In recent years, the two countries have been conducting
various military exercises, including large-scale exercise
Balikatan, amphibious exercise KAMANDAG, and
maritime exercise Sama Sama.

President Marcos, who took office in June 2022,

met with President Biden of the U.S. for the first time
in person in September 2022 in New York. The two
leaders discussed the situation in the South China Sea
and underscored their support for freedom of navigation
and overflight and the peaceful resolution of disputes.
In February 2023, defense ministers of the U.S. and the
Philippines announced the agreement to designate four
new bases for the EDCA. These four bases consist of
three in northern Luzon Island near Taiwan and one on
Palawan Island facing the South China Sea. Furthermore,
in May 2023, the U.S.-Philippines Bilateral Defense
Guidelines were adopted and released for the first time,

U.S. and the Philippines.

In September 2023, the U.S.-Philippines joint

navigation, which had ended under the Duterte
administration, was carried out, with a U.S. destroyer
and a Philippines frigate conducting joint navigation in
the South China Sea. In November, in the water and air
surrounding the Philippines, including the South China
Sea, they carried out Maritime Cooperative Activities.
Thus, the defense cooperation between the two countries
has begun to progress again since the inauguration of the
new administration.

The Philippines and China have competing claims over

the sovereignty in the Spratly Islands and Scarborough
Shoal of the South China Sea. In January 2013, seeking a
settlement under international law, the Philippines started
arbitral tribunal proceedings pursuant to UNCLOS
against China. In July 2016, the final award was rendered,
accepting nearly all of the Philippines’ submissions. The
Government of the Philippines released a statement that it
welcomed the award by the arbitral tribunal and strongly
affirmed its respect for the decision.

The conflicts between the Philippines and China over

the South China Sea dispute were observed even after
2020 during which the COVID-19 infections became
a global pandemic. The Philippines protested that a
Chinese military vessel had directed fire-control radars at
a Philippine Navy ship in February 2020, and that China
had established administrative districts on islands in the
South China Sea in April of the same year. In his policy
speech in July 2022, President Marcos emphasized that
he would not allow any attempt by foreign power to
take even one square inch of the Philippines’ sovereign
territory. Furthermore, in the same month, the Department
of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines released a statement
commemorating the sixth anniversary of the award.

In January 2023, President Marcos met with President

Xi Jinping during his state visit to China. They agreed
to appropriately manage the differences between the two
countries regarding the South China Sea issue through
peaceful means, and also agreed to establish a direct
communication mechanism between the diplomatic
authorities of the two countries. However, since then,
there have been frequent reports of obstructive activities
by Chinese Coast Guard vessels and other vessels
against the Philippine vessels in areas such as the Spratly
Islands.

For example, the Philippines government announced

that in December 2023, The Philippines supply ship
and the Philippines Coast Guard Vessel were obstructed
by the Chinese Coast Guard vessel and others through
dangerous maneuvers such as intentional collisions and
firing of water cannon near the Second Thomas Shoal
in the Spratly Islands, where the Philippines warship
Sierra Madre was stranded. The Philippines’ supply
ship, escorted by a Philippines Coast Guard Vessel,
was attempting to replenish the supplies of the stranded
warship. In response, President Marcos condemned the
action by the Chinese vessels towards the Philippines
vessels and their personnel, pointing out that it was
aggression and provocation, and a clear violation of
international law. The same month, Defense Minister
Teodoro held a telephone conversation with U.S.
Defense Secretary Austin. During the conversation, it
was reiterated that the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense
Treaty extends to both countries’ armed forces, public
vessels, and aircraft -including those of its coast guardanywhere in Pacific, to include the South China Sea.

Given its limited land area, population, and resources,
Singapore’s existence and development depend on
the peace and stability of the region in a globalized
economy. Singapore highly prioritize its national
defense, with defense spending accounting for about
10% of its national budget. In October 2022, the
Digital and Intelligence Service was established as the
fourth service of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF),
integrating existing command, control, communications,
computers, intelligence, and cyber capabilities.

Singapore emphasizes the importance of cooperative

defense cooperation agreements with countries within
and outside the region.

With the aim of contributing to peace and stability in

the region, Singapore supports United States’ presence in
the Asia-Pacific. Since signing the 1990 Memorandum
of Understanding (November 1990), Singapore has been
allowing the United States to use military facilities in
the country. In addition to the port calls to Changi Naval
Base by U.S. aircraft carriers, the rotational deployment
of Littoral combat ships (LCSs) began in 2013. In 2015,
the P-8 patrol aircraft of the U.S. Forces were deployed
to Singapore for around one week for the first time. The
two countries have committed to continue carrying out
similar deployments routinely. In addition, Singapore
conducts combined exercises with the U.S., such as
CARAT and SEACAT.

Singapore has strong economic ties with China,

and the two countries also conduct bilateral naval
exercises. In October 2019, the two countries signed
the enhanced Agreement on Defence Exchanges and
Security Cooperation (ADESC), which formalized
existing defense cooperation, including regularization of
dialogue and exercises. On the other hand, diplomatic
relations with China have been strained partly due
to Singapore’s advocacy of the ruling of the arbitral
tribunal to Philippines v. China when it comes to the
resolution of the South China Sea disputes and partly
due to Singapore’s defense cooperation with Taiwan.

In March 2020, Singapore and Australia signed

the Treaty on Military Training and Training Area
Development in Australia. This treaty enables the
Singapore Armed Forces to access Australia’s training
area which will be newly developed.

Based on its viewpoint that the sea is closely associated
with the national construction and defense, Vietnam has
established the objective of becoming a strong marine
country, particularly prioritizing the modernization of
its military forces and law enforcement forces at sea
as well as ensuring the capability for maritime domain
awareness, maritime independence, sovereign rights,
jurisdiction and national interests at sea.

Vietnam deploys its omni-directional diplomatic

policy and intends to actively participate in international
and regional cooperation in order to build friendly
relations with every nation. In March 2016, Vietnam
opened an international port in the Cam Ranh Bay, which
is located in a strategically important location, and Navy
vessels from many countries including Japan have called
at the international Cam Ranh Bay port.

Vietnam and the United States have strengthened their

military relations in recent years. This has taken such forms
as combined training with the U.S. Navy and port calls by
U.S. Navy vessels in Vietnam. In 2017, mutual visits were
conducted by the leaders of both countries and an agreement
was reached on the deepening of defense cooperation. In
March 2018, the USS Carl Vinson became the first U.S.
aircraft carrier to visit Vietnam since the Vietnam War.
In September 2023, during U.S. President Biden’s first
visit to Vietnam as president, he met with then President
Thưởng and agreed to upgrade the bilateral relationship to
a comprehensive strategic partnership. In this context, the
United States committed to continue to support Vietnam in
building an independent defense capability.

mentioned its plan to build three aircraft carrier battle
groups. The country’s first domestically built aircraft
carrier “Vikrant” was commissioned in September 2022.
This brings the total number of Indian Navy’s aircraft
carriers to two, including “Vikramaditya”, which was
modified after purchasing it from Russia. In June 2023,
the first exercise involving both aircraft carriers was
held. India has also placed emphasis on the operation of
submarines and is proceeding to enhance them.

The Air Force is operating French-made Rafale and

Mirage 2000 fighters, as well as Russian-made Su-30MKI
fighters and domestically produced Tejas light fighters.
Meanwhile, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is making it
difficult for India to repair parts for Russian-made fighter
jets and transport aircraft. It is working to inventorize
these parts and also produce them domestically. An inter
governmental agreement was signed in September 2023
between India and Russia for enabling manufacture of
Russian origin spares in India. As for its air defense
system, India has introduced the Russian-made “S-400”
surface-to-air missile system, as well as the Israeli-made
Heron MKII unmanned aircraft for ISR purposes.

In addition, India is a nuclear-weapon state with

approximately 164 nuclear warheads as of January 2023,
and while it maintains the nuclear doctrine[4] published
in 2003 and policies including the unilateral moratorium
on nuclear tests announced immediately after the
nuclear test in 1998, it has been promoting development,
performance improvement, and deployment of various
ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. In 2022, India
succeeded in launching a supersonic cruise missile
BrahMos (extended range) from a Su-30MKI fighter
jet, launching the IRBM Agni-III, Agni-IV, and Agni-V,
launching a ballistic missile from nuclear submarine
INS Arihant, and other activities. In June 2023, India
successfully conducted a nighttime launch test of the
“Agni Prime,” which it calls a new generation ballistic
missile, followed in December by the training launch of
the “Agni-I,” a short-range ballistic missile.

In March 2022, the European Council adopted the

Strategic Compass laying out a common strategic vision
for security and defense policies in the next five to ten
years. The document stated that the EU will establish a
fully operational EU Rapid Deployment Capacity of up
to 5,000 troops by 2025 for use in rescue and evacuation
operations. In response to the adoption of the Strategic
Compass, the EU conducted “LIVEX23,” the EU’s first

the “EU Rapid Deployment Capacity.”

**3** **Cooperation between NATO and the EU**


**Part**

**Ⅰ**

**Chapter**


The EU is strengthening its security initiatives under the
Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the
Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP)[1].

In December 2017, the Permanent Structured

Cooperation (PESCO) was launched as a defense
cooperation framework comprising 26 of the member
states. NATO made it clear that it promotes developing
new capabilities in aviation and maritime domains,
training and support for armed forces and sharing expertise
of specific domains such as the cyberspace domain
through this framework. Therefore, the strengthening of
Europe’s defense capabilities is expected.[2]

Furthermore, the EU is enhancing its engagement

to the Indo-Pacific region, disclosing its first IndoPacific strategy in April 2021 followed by a joint
communication detailing it in September 2021. This
joint communication states that the growing tensions
resulting from China’s significant military buildup and
show of force in the East China Sea, South China Sea,
and Taiwan Strait have a direct effect on security and
prosperity in Europe. To achieve the aim of a rules

Advancements have been seen in cooperation between
NATO and the EU in addressing unprecedented
challenges efficiently.

The third Joint Declaration on EU-NATO cooperation

was signed in January 2023. In light of Russia’s
aggression against Ukraine, NATO and the EU stated in
the declaration that they were at a key juncture for EuroAtlantic security and stability, and that China’s growing
assertiveness and policies present challenges that need to
be addressed. In addition, it was stated that NATO would
further strengthen their cooperation in existing areas in
order to deal with the security threats and challenges
evolving in scope and magnitude, and that NATO and the
EU would enhance and deepen cooperation especially to
deal with growing geostrategic competition, resilience
issues, protection of critical infrastructure, emerging
and disruptive technologies, space, security implication
of climate change as well as foreign information
manipulation and interference.


The EU, although it has a property of non-binding multilateral cooperation, introduced the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), which covers all areas of foreign and security
policy based on the Treaty of Maastricht, which took effect in 1993. In June 1999, the European Council decided to implement the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) to offer
peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance activities in conflict areas, as a part of the CFSP framework. The Treaty of Lisbon, made effective in 2009, renamed the ESDP to CSDP and clearly
positioned it as an integral part of the CFSP.

The Macron administration presented in November

2022 the National Strategic Review 2022 (Revue
Nationale Stratégique 2022) that showed an analysis of
the security environment home and abroad, as well as its
strategic goals and priorities for 2030. The administration
also stated that the relationship with Russia transferred
from potential competition to an open opposition, and
its relationship with China transfers to a more intense
contest. In addition, the review indicated enhanced
strategic autonomy and secured nuclear deterrence as
France’s strategic objectives to be achieved by 2030.

Since France has territories in the Indo-Pacific region,

it is the only EU member state that has continuous
military presence in the region, with approximately
7,000 personnel and vessels permanently stationed.
France places importance on commitment to the
region. The Defense Strategy in the Indo-Pacific,
which was published in June 2019, states that China’s
growing influence is shifting the balance of power in
the Indo-Pacific region and highlights the importance
of strengthening partnerships with the United States,
Australia, India, and Japan[4]. The National Strategic
Review 2022 mentioned above stated that France will
strategically strive to build partnerships with countries
in the Indo-Pacific region, including Japan, and play
the role of a balancing power in order to maintain the
strategic stability of the region.

In line with its policy of active engagement in the

Indo-Pacific region, France dispatched an aircraft
carrier group and other units to the region in 2019 and
2021 and conducted the multilateral exercise “ARC 21”
with Japan, the United States, and Australia in 2021.
In addition, from June to August 2023, the French Air
and Space Forces conducted a mission for large-scale
power projection to the Indo-Pacific called “Pégase
23,” showcasing its capability to swiftly deploy from its
mainland to the region to deal with various crises and
regional instabilities. France has conducted monitoring
and surveillance activities against illicit maritime
activities including ship-to-ship transfers with North
Korean flagged vessels since 2019. In 2023, the frigate

the DCP23 emphasizes human resources, science and
technology, innovation, and enhanced cooperation

Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.

In response to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, the

United Kingdom, in collaboration with related countries
and NATO, is strengthening its security presence in
the Nordic and Baltic Sea regions. In September 2023,
Carrier Strike Group(CSG) led by HMS Queen Elizabeth,
was dispatched to the Nordic waters. In December of the
same year, the naval and air forces conducted activities
mainly in the Baltic Sea to safeguard important undersea
infrastructure. In addition, more than 20,000 British
troops are scheduled to be deployed across Northern
Europe in 2024.

The United Kingdom remains committed to the Indo
Pacific region. In July 2023, the U.K. participated in
the multilateral exercise “Talisman Sabre 23” hosted
by the United States and Australia. In October, the U.K.
participated in “Bersama Lima” held in Malaysia, the
exercise based on the Five Power Defence Arrangements
(FPDA).[3] These underlines the U.K.’s commitment in
strengthening relationships with the regional partners.
In December of the same year, the U.K. announced that
the CSG, scheduled to be deployed to the Indo-Pacific in
2025, would call on Japan.

In addition, the U. K. has conducted monitoring and

surveillance activities in waters around Japan, against
illicit maritime activities such as ship-to-ship transfers
with North Korean flagged vessels since FY2018. In
early January 2023, HMS Spey conducted monitoring
and surveillance activities.

**2** **France**

Since the end of the Cold War, France has focused on
maintaining independence of its defense policies, while
having led initiatives to enhance the defense structure and
capability in Europe. It has worked on the development
of its military capacity by streamlining and integrating

France also prioritizes its involvement in the Middle

East and Africa. The French military has been operating
in Iraq since 2014, providing military support to Iraqi
security forces fighting ISIL. The French military
has been participating in the European Maritime
Awareness in the Strait of Hormuz (EMASOH) since its
establishment in 2020.

In Africa’s Sahel region, France launched “Operation

Barkhane” in 2014 and the operation of European Special
Forces “Takuba” in 2020 as counter-terrorism measures
centered on Mali. However, both operations ended in
2022 due to deteriorating relations with Mali and other
reasons. Meanwhile, the French military was transferring
troops from Mali to Niger but was forced to withdraw
from Niger following the military takeover there in July
2023. After 10 years of counter-terrorism operations in
the Sahel region, the only French military presence in
West Africa, including Sahel, was in Chad, Senegal, and

solving global issues, the elements of systemic rivalry
and competition have increased. Regarding defense
spending, the government clarified its policy of setting it
at 2% of GDP on average over multiple years.

Furthermore, in November the same year, the German

Ministry of Defense announced the Defense Policy
Guidelines 2023 based on said strategy. Recognizing
that Germany must become the backbone of deterrence
and collective defense in Europe, the policy stated that
the core missions of the German Bundeswehr would
return to national and collective defense. In particular,
it underlined Germany’s responsibility to make an evergreater contribution to the defense of NATO’s eastern
member states, and Germany decided to station one
brigade permanently in Lithuania.

Germany’s defense budget for 2024 is 51.9 billion

euros, the highest amount since the creation of the
Bundeswehr, with 19.8 billion euros coming from
special funds. Collectively, this total equates to 2.1%
of Germany’s GDP. The special funds will be used to
fund important procurement programs. So far, Germany
has concluded contracts to procure F-35A fighter
jets and CH-47F transport helicopters and has begun
procuring the “Arrow” missile defense system. The
Eurofighter electronic warfare program, involving radar
development, is also underway.

As for the brigade’s permanent presence in Lithuania,

a roadmap was signed by German Defense Minister
Pistorius and then Lithuanian Defense Minister
Anusauskas in December 2023. The brigade will
comprise three combat battalions with a strength of
approximately 5,000 personnel and is scheduled to be
deployed from 2025.

Regarding the Indo-Pacific as well, the German

government formulated the Policy guidelines for the
Indo-Pacific in 2020 and announced that it would
strengthen its involvement in security policy in this
region. In recent years, Germany has continued to
dispatch assets to the Indo-Pacific region to strengthen
its presence, while at the same time placing emphasis on
cooperation with partner countries that share common
values, such as Japan.

In July 2023, the Bundeswehr participated for the

first time in the multilateral exercise “Talisman Sabre
23” hosted by the United States and Australia, aiming to
strengthen multilateral cooperation and interoperability
in the region. In addition, following the dispatch of the
German frigate “Bayern” in 2021, two naval vessels are

While Germany has been implementing a large-scale
reduction of its military personnel since the end of the
Cold War, it has been gradually expanding the dispatch
of its federal forces overseas. At the same time, Germany
has advanced the reform of its armed forces to enable
them to execute multiple responsibilities encompassing
conflict prevention and risk management in the context
of multilateral organizations, including NATO, the EU,
and the UN.

However, following Russia’s aggression against

Ukraine, Germany made major changes in its security
policy, acknowledging that it was at a “watershed
era (Zeitenwende).” Specifically, it provided arms to
Ukraine, imposed strict economic sanctions against
Russia, increased its defense spending as a ratio of GDP
to over 2%, strengthened its contribution to NATO, and
established a special fund equivalent to 100 billion euros
for the Bundeswehr.

In June 2023, the German government announced

the first comprehensive national security strategy that
considered security as part of all policy areas, not just
the diplomatic and military. The government assessed
Russia as the most significant threat in the Euro-Atlantic

traditionally supports the activities of the United Nations,
and the Trudeau administration has expressed its stance
that contributing to the UN Peacekeeping Operations
(PKO) is of utmost importance.

Concerning its involvement in the Indo-Pacific region,

in November 2022, Canada announced its first IndoPacific Strategy as a comprehensive road map to deepen
its engagement in the region over the next decade. In
the strategy, China is mentioned as an “increasingly
disruptive global power” and that it is looking to shape the
international order into a more permissive environment
for China’s interests and values. The strategy also
states that Canada will challenge China if it engages in
behavior that undermines Canada’s national interests or
those of its partners in the region. On the other hand,
Canada showed its intention to cooperate with China to
find solutions to global issues such as climate change.

In addition, Canada has clarified its strategic

objectives such as promoting peace, resiliency, and
security of the region and expanding and deepening
security relationship with allies and partners including
Japan. Canada has also stated its intention to continue
monitoring and surveillance activities against illicit
maritime activities[5] including ship-to-ship transfers
with North Korean flagged vessels, which started in
April 2018. In 2023, Canada conducted monitoring and
surveillance activities by patrol aircraft in early April
and early October. On the other hand, Canadian warships
have passed through the Taiwan Strait[6] several times
since 2018 in accordance with international laws and
Canada has stated that it strengthens its naval presence
in the Indo-Pacific region, including by increasing the
number of frigates. In 2023, Canada crossed the Taiwan
Strait three times, while it had only crossed just once the
previous year, Canada’s future involvement in the region
should be closely watched.


**4** **Canada**

In a National Defence Policy paper published in June
2017, the Department of National Defence of Canada
showed its recognition that the United States is “still
unquestionably the only superpower,” while also stating
the view that a degree of major power competition has
returned among China, Russia, and others, which is
causing the growing importance of deterrence again.
In accordance with this understanding of the security
environment, Canada places importance on its own
national land and the North American region on the
basis of the national defense policy. Based on the
idea that global security has a direct connection with
Canadian defense, Canada positions active international
contribution as a basis of the national defense policy.
In terms of the building-up of defense capability, the
Canadian defense policy focuses on the fields of space,
cyberspace and intelligence. It also stated plans to
increase the national defense budget, which once declined
in the 2010s, by more than 70% in 10 years, and the
Regular Force by 3,500 (to 71,500) military personnel.
Furthermore, Canada released the Arctic and Northern
Policy Framework in September 2019, indicating a
policy to enhance Canada’s military presence in the
region, based on the recognition that strategic, military,
and economic importance of the region is increasing.
Canada has also been conducting “Operation Nanook”,
a military exercise in the Arctic region, since 2007.

Canada regards the United States as its most

important ally and conducts air defense, space defense,
and maritime patrolling and monitoring activities in
North America jointly with the United States through
the North American Aerospace Defense Command
(NORAD). As a founding member, Canada also places
importance on its relationship with NATO, and has been
actively participating in NATO-led operations. Canada

Hezbollah, a pro Iranian armed group in Lebanon, and
other groups have intensified in northern Israel. The
Israeli military has responded with airstrikes against
Hezbollah sites.

Yemen’s Houthi rebels have also sporadically

launched missiles and drones toward Israel.

To strengthen its deterrence in the Middle East, the

United States is increasing its military assets, such as
dispatching aircraft carrier strike groups and aircraft,
and conducting activities such as intercepting drones and
missiles launched by the Houthis.

**4** **Situation in the Gulf Region**


Amid this situation, the United States scaled down its

troops stationed in Iraq to 2,500 members by January
2021 and ended the combat duty of its forces in Iraq
at the end of December of the same year. The mission
of the U.S. Forces moved to advising, training, and
information collecting.

From April the same year, it was reported that part of

the fighters and air defense assets deployed in the Gulf
region by the Trump administration were pulled out.
The presence of U.S. Forces in the Gulf region had been
shrinking since the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan
left the area in September 2021, with the absence of U.S.
aircraft carriers continuing for some time. However,
since the outbreak of conflict between Israel and
Palestinian militants in October 2023, the aircraft carrier
USS Dwight D. Eisenhower has been dispatched to the
Middle East region and U.S. aircraft and air defense
assets have also been additionally deployed to the same
region, thus the presence of U.S. military has been
enhanced.

**(2) Maritime Security in the Gulf Region**
Since May 2019, sporadic events affecting the navigation
safety of civilian vessels have occurred in the waters of
the Middle East.

Amidst rising tensions in the Middle East, countries

continue carrying out efforts to safeguard maritime
security in the region. The United States proposed the
Maritime Security Initiative in July 2019 and established
the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC)
with its command center opened in Bahrain in November.
The IMSC has been joined by 12 countries, including
the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain,
Albania, Lithuania, Estonia, Romania, Seychelles,
Latvia, and Jordan, in addition to the United States (as
of March 2024).

Furthermore, in January 2020, eight European

nations – France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece,
Belgium, Germany, Italy, and Portugal – issued a joint
European declaration of support for the creation of the
European Maritime Awareness in the Strait of Hormuz
(EMASOH). This mission commenced full operations in
February of the same year.

Furthermore, in response to the frequent attacks on

**(1) Military Trends in the Gulf Region**
Various situations including military activities are created
in the Gulf region in relation to the changes related to the
final agreement concerning the nuclear issues of Iran, the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).[1] Since
May 2019, the United States has announced the dispatch
of carrier strike groups and bomber units in response to
Iran’s threats to its own troops and interests. The United
States deployed troops in Saudi Arabia in July 2019 for
the first time in around sixteen years since 2003.

In the midst of this, Iran announced its shooting down

of a U.S. unmanned reconnaissance aircraft over the
Straits of Hormuz in June 2019. In July of the same year,
the United States announced that a U.S. amphibious
assault ship had shot down an Iranian drone over the
Strait of Hormuz in July of the same year.

Since October the same year, there have been multiple

attacks by militant organizations on U.S. military bases
in Iraq. The United States pointed out Iran’s involvement
in the attacks, and conducted an aerial bombing of the
base of an armed organization said to be supported by
Iran. In addition, in January 2020, the United States
killed Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force of Iran’s
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), who was
operating inside Iraq with the militant organization’s
leaders, as a deterrent to further attack plans. Although
Iran attacked Iraqi bases hosting U.S. Forces in Iraq with
a ballistic missile in retaliation for the killing, after that,
both countries clearly showed a willingness to avoid
escalation.


JCPOA decided that Iran would reduce its enriched uranium stockpile and the number of centrifuges, ban the production of weapons grade plutonium, and accept IAEA inspections, among
other measures, in exchange for ending the sanctions of previous UN Security Council resolutions and the U.S. and EU’s nuclear-related sanctions. In May 2018, the U.S. President Trump
(then), announced the U.S. secession from JCPOA, and in November of the same year, the United States resumed all its sanctions and successively added further sanctions. In this situation,
Iran announced that while it would not withdraw from JCPOA after May 2019, it would suspend its compliance with JCPOA step by step. Although Joe Biden, the new president of the United

a multinational security operation under Combined Task
Force 153, the mission of which is to conduct maritime
security and capacity building activities from the Red
Sea to the Gulf of Aden. Furthermore, on January 12,
2024, U.S. and British forces, supported by Canada, the
Netherlands, Australia, and Bahrain, attacked Houthi’s
military bases. Since then, U.S. Forces have continuously
attacked Houthi’s military bases, including joint attacks
with British forces.

stabilization of Syria.

**6** **Situation in Yemen**


In Yemen, following anti-government protests that
occurred from February 2011 and international pressure
afterward, then President Ali Abdullah Saleh agreed to
resign. Through the election held in February 2012, then
Vice President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi was elected as
the new president.

Meanwhile, the confrontation intensified between the

government and the opposition insurgent group Houthis,
based in northern Yemen. As the Houthis invaded
the Yemeni capital of Sana’a and other locations, the
President requested support from Arab countries. In
response, in March 2015, coalition forces led by Saudi
Arabia began air strikes against the Houthis. In response,
the Houthis also launched attacks on the mainland
of Saudi Arabia with ballistic missiles, UAVs, cruise
missiles, and other weapons.

In December 2018, a cease-fire in Hodeidah city, host

to the biggest port in Yemen, was agreed upon between
the Houthis and the Yemen government. However, the
cease-fire was implemented to only a limited degree.
In November 2019, the Yemeni Government and the
Southern Transitional Council (STC), a separatist group
in southern Yemen, signed the Riyadh Agreement[2] in the
capital of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh. Then, the new cabinet
was established in December 2020. President Hadi newly
established the “Presidential Leadership Council,” and
announced that he would transfer all of his authority in
April 2022. The council comprises delegates of all the
political powers in Yemen, except the Houthis, and aims
to strengthen the governance of the government and
conclude the negotiation with the Houthis.

In the same month, the UN Secretary-General’s

Special Envoy for Yemen announced that the parties
to the armed conflict agreed on a two-month ceasefire
throughout Yemen. Although it was announced that the
ceasefire agreement had not been renewed in October
after it was first renewed in June and August of the
same year, large-scale armed conflicts, aerial bombings
by the coalition of the willing, and cross-border attacks
by the Houthis have rarely occurred in Yemen since the
ceasefire became effective. Against this backdrop, an
agreement was reached in December 2023 to proceed

In Syria, violent conflicts have continued since March 2011
among Syrian government forces supported by Russia and
Iran, Syrian opposition groups supported by Türkiye, and
other organizations. Although it has been pointed out that
Russia has been redeploying some of the troops stationed
in Syria to Ukraine since the start of Russia’s aggression
against Ukraine, it seems that Syrian Government
forces control most of the country, and the situation is
advantageous to the Assad administration as a whole.

In these circumstances, a trend is observed in which

the Syrian government, and Arab countries and Türkiye
that have supported the opposition, attempt to improve
diplomatic relations. For example, in May 2023, a
meeting of Arab League foreign ministers decided to
allow the return of Syria, whose membership had been
suspended in 2011, and President Assad attended the
summit held in the same month.

According to an estimate by the Office of the

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
(OHCHR) in June 2022, more than 300,000 citizens died
in a series of clashes from March 2011 to March 2021 in
the situation in Syria.

As for Al Qaeda, based primarily in Afghanistan, it is

believed to have been weakened, as many of the group’s
senior members were killed through U.S. operations.
However, they continue some actions such as issuing
statements.

Concerning international counterterrorism measures,

international cooperation has grown even more important
as terrorism threats have diffused and deepened on the
diversification of terrorist attacks and the improvement
of terrorist groups’ attack capabilities.

**2** **Trends of Activities in Africa**

Organizations related to ISIL and/or Al-Qaeda are active
in Africa. For example, in some areas of West Africa
such as Mali and other parts of the Sahel region, conflicts
between terrorist organizations as well as vigorous
terrorist activities are observed. In central and southern
Africa, the ISIL’s “Central African Province” had been
active since April 2019, mainly in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and northern Mozambique. In
May 2022, an armed group in Mozambique that had
previously issued a statement of criminal activity under
the name of the ISIL’s “Central African Province”
made a criminal declaration under the name of the
ISIL’s “Mozambique Province” and began operating
as a new branch of ISIL. In eastern Africa, Al-Shabaab
continuously hinders political processes in Somalia.

European and other countries have been providing

counter-terrorism operations and are supporting

training against such terrorist organizations’ actions.
For instance, in the Sahel region, the French military
took the lead in conducting counterterrorism operations
against Islamic extremists from 2013 to 2022. In
Mozambique, anti-terrorism operations were conducted
by dispatching troops from neighboring countries,
and in November 2021, an EU training mission began


operations. However, since December 2023, there are
signs that ISIL’s activities in “Mozambique Province”
have increased.

**3** **Trends of Activities in the Middle East**


Since 2013, ISIL had become powerful by taking
advantage of the unstable situation in Iraq and Syria, and
unilaterally declared the establishment of the “Islamic
State” in 2014. From that year, the U.S. led Coalition
forces conducted airstrikes and education/training
missions for local groups in Iraq and Syria. In 2019, the
United States announced that it and the Coalition forces
had liberated 100 percent of ISIL-controlled areas in the
two countries. Although the United States announced
the death of ISIL’s leader in February and November
2022, ISIL announced the appointment of a new leader
in March and November 2022 respectively and is
believed to still be active in Iraq and Syria. Under these
circumstances, the U.S. Forces have been continuously
stationed in both countries as part of efforts to prevent
the resurgence of ISIL.

In Afghanistan, while the Taliban are expanding their

controlled area, the ISIL Khorasan Province has been
continuously conducting terrorist attacks mainly in the
capital city of Kabul and eastern Afghanistan since 2015.
When the Taliban, which is in a cooperative relationship
with Al-Qaeda, took control of Kabul in August 2021,
the United States completed the withdrawal of U.S.
Forces but declared it would continue counterterrorism
operations from afar.

Even after the withdrawal of U.S. Forces, the ISIL

Khorosan Province is actively continuing terrorist
attacks in Kabul and other areas, although the number of
attacks is on the decline. The United States announced
in August 2022 that it has killed Al Qaeda’s leader with
a drone attack in Kabul, the capital city of Afghanistan.

**(2) Quantum Technology**
Quantum technology is positioned as an important
technology which brings innovation to society by applying
quantum mechanics, which operates in the microscopic
world of atomic nuclei and electrons. In its National
Defense Science and Technology Strategy published in
2023, the United States cited quantum technology as key
and declared its intention to strengthen collaboration and
technological innovation with its allies. Conversely, in
its 14th Five-Year Plan published in 2021, China stated
its intention to accelerate cutting-edge technologies like
quantum computers and communications and enhance
military-civilian collaborative development in the
quantum technology field.

Quantum cryptographic communication, which is

considered to be cryptographic communication that
cannot be deciphered by a third party, is being studied
in many countries. China has built a 4,600 km quantum
cryptographic communication network consisting of the
quantum cryptographic communication satellite “Mozi”
and a ground communication network between Beijing
and Shanghai. In 2022, quantum encryption services
were provided to the Communist Party and government
agencies in Hefei.

It has been pointed out that in the future, quantum

sensors could be used for tracking missiles and aircraft,
as well as for more advanced gyros and accelerometers.[3]
In 2023, the United States successfully demonstrated
magnetic navigation using quantum magnetic sensors as
an alternative to the Global Positioning System (GPS)
and has also been developing a satellite equipped with
quantum gyros to develop inertial navigation using
quantum inertial sensors.

Quantum computers are said to be able to calculate

problems that would take even a supercomputer an
enormous amount of time in a short time and are
expected to be applied in fields such as decryption.
On the other hand, post-quantum cryptography (PQC),


which cannot be decrypted by quantum computers, is
being researched in many countries. The United States
is urging all domestic organizations to prepare for a
transition to PQC ahead of the establishment of the PQC
standard scheduled for 2024.

**(3) Cutting-Edge Information and Communication**

**Technology**

As a mobile communication infrastructure, the 5thGeneration Mobile Communication System (5G)
services have been launched in various countries
since 2019 and research on wireless communication
technologies beyond 5G is also underway.

In the Department of Defense 5G Strategy published

in 2020, the United States declared that 5G was a
strategic technology and that it would promote its
introduction and ensure its safety. The United States has
been evaluating 5G at air force bases and elsewhere. In
2022, the United States established a team to handle 5G
and next-generation wireless communications and began
new initiatives such as Open Radio Access Network
(Open RAN)[4] and secure and scalable spectrum sharing[5]
for 5G and beyond.

Conversely, in its 14th Five-Year Plan for Digital

Economy Development announced in 2021, China,
announced its intention to expand and match 5G and
optical fiber and strengthen research and development
into 6G. In 2023, Huawei announced a product with
communication speeds ten times faster than 5G
(equivalent to 5.5G).

**(4) Additive Manufacturing Technology**
Additive manufacturing technology, as typified by 3D
printers, is expected to be applied to each military sector
in various countries, due to low manufacturing cost and
parts procurement that does not rely on inventory.

The United States, in announcing the “Use of Additive

Manufacturing Technology” in 2021, stated that it would
enhance the independence and readiness of its military
services and has installed 3D printers on some of its
surface ships and submarines. China is also utilizing 3D
printers to manufacture parts for military aircraft. Russia
is developing 3D printers for drone production.

defense industry. They also take on a variety of initiatives
to maintain and strengthen their defense production
base, such as supporting the participation of domestic
companies in government programs and promoting
exports.

In the National Defense Industrial Strategy (NDIS)

announced in January 2024, the United States set out
four long-term strategic priorities to build a strong
defense industrial base fit for the times: resilient supply
chains, workforce readiness, flexible acquisition and
economic deterrence. The United States also outlined
its intention to promote various initiatives to achieve
these priorities, such as strengthening cooperation with
allies and friendly nations, providing financial support to
companies and improving procurement methods.

The United Kingdom published its Defence and

Security Industrial Strategy (DSIS) in order to construct
a more productive and strategic relationship with
domestic defense industries in 2021. The DSIS orders
the government to take on some initiatives such as largescale procurement reforms, toughening of supply chains
and accelerating export permissions in order to strengthen
defense as a critical strategic asset. Furthermore, the
United Kingdom published the Defence Supply Chain
Strategy in 2022 and stated to aim to build up robust
defense supply chains to enable the military to respond
to the current severe security environment.

Australia created a new office of Minister for Defence

Industry in 2016. Australia also supports small and
medium sized enterprises participating in the defense
industry and keeps up with financial support through the
Office of Defence Industry Support established in 2021 as
a One-Stop organization to support the defense industry.
Furthermore, in its Defence Industry Development
Strategy (DIDS) announced in February 2024, Australia
set out seven Sovereign Defence Industrial Priorities
(SDIPs) and decided to strengthen cooperation with the
defense industry, for example by providing vocational
training and subsidies to businesses, as well as promoting
public-private exchanges, to realize these projects.

In March 2024, the EU announced its first European

Defence Industry Strategy (EDIS), which sets numerical
targets for defense-related trade within the EU and the
proportion of joint procurement and presents a series of
actions, including financial support and strengthening
relationships with other countries, to enhance the
competitiveness and readiness of the European defense
industry

the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) mediates between
companies owning innovative technology and the DoD
to make the most of cutting-edge technologies from
the civilian field in the resolution of challenges in the
security sector. The DIU has produced contracts with
over 450 companies mainly in six fields, including AI,
autonomous technology and the cyber field. In FY2023,
the DIU moved 10 consumer solutions suggested by
companies from the prototype stage to the production
stage.

China is promoting Civil-Military Fusion (CMF) as a

national strategy. General Secretary Xi Jinping stated in
his report to the 20th Congress of the Chinese Communist
Party (CCP) in October 2022 that China would build up
a series of new growth engines such as next-generation
information technologies, artificial intelligence (AI),
biotechnology, new energy, new materials and such
through promoting integrated development of strategic
emerging industries and clustered development.

In response to the recent utilization of dual-use

technologies in defense equipment development, the
governments of the United Kingdom and Australia,
as well as NATO, have been funding innovative
research and development in the private sector to
acquire advanced civilian technologies. The United
Kingdom is strengthening its investment in the
Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA), which
invests in innovations boosting security in industry and
academia. It also established the Advanced Research
and Invention Agency (ARIA) in January 2023 with
the aim of investing in groundbreaking research with
the potential to have a significant impact on society. In
Australia, an organization called the Advanced Strategic
Capabilities Accelerator (ASCA) was established in
July 2023 to replace the existing Defense Innovation
Hub and the Next Generation Technologies Fund. The
ASCA aims to collaborate with Australian industry and
research institutions to rapidly provide the capabilities
needed by the Australian military. Meanwhile, NATO
established the Defence Innovation Accelerator for the
North Atlantic (DIANA) in April 2022 with the aim of
enabling member states to work with the private sector
and academia to make advanced new technologies
available for Western security.

Furthermore, foreign countries recognize the defense

industrial base as an essential element of their national
defense and have organized systems to implement their
policies through the publication of policy documents

of capabilities and higher self containment of domestic
defense industry through their Defence Industry
Development Act and their Defence Science and
Technology Innovation Promotion Act enforced in
2021. Furthermore, the Defense Acquisition Program
Administration (DAPA) announced a policy to procure
equipment taking into consideration the ripple effects for
domestic industries and a policy to promote cooperation
between foreign companies and domestic companies
as well as the use of domestic products by foreign
companies.[6]

Each country exports equipment strategically because

trading equipment strengthens the relationship between
two trading countries as well as the base for defense
technology and the defense industry. For example, the
United Kingdom announced in the DSIS that it would
support exporting with cross-ministerial effort from
different government offices such as the Department
for International Trade and the Home Office. The


United States, Russia, Europe and China are still the
top four in terms of export value of military equipment,
while Australia formulated its export strategy.[7] The
ROK established an export support organization,[8] and
financially supports research and development for
export. Various countries proactively promote military
equipment export using a variety of measures.

SDA and cyber defense capabilities. In addition, The
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the National
Reconnaissance Office and U.S. Space Command are
working on a commercial asset protection framework,
including the sharing of space threat information.

As for organizations, the United States inaugurated

the U.S. Space Command as a new regional unified
combatant command based on the Strategic Command’s
component in charge of space missions in 2019.
The United States created the Space Force under the
Department of the Air Force as the sixth military branch,
with approximately 16,000 personnel. In 2023, the
U.S. Space Force established the U.S. Space Forces
Europe and Africa to strengthen space capabilities

China has been promoting space development since the
1950s and has been further intensifying its space activities,
including landing an unmanned probe on the far side of
the moon, completing the space station “Tiangong,” and
advancing plans for a lunar base. In 2023, China launched
a number of satellites, including the positioning satellite
“BeiDou” and the earth observation satellite “Yaogan,”
and is also working to build a satellite constellation for
rapid information gathering and communication.

While traditionally emphasizing international

cooperation and the peaceful use of space, it is
pointed out that China proactively used space for
military purposes, including information collection,
communications and positioning through satellites. For
example, the possibility of military use has been pointed
out for “BeiDou” for aircraft and vessel navigation and
guidance of missiles, and for “Yaogon” for electronic and
image reconnaissance. Regarding carrier rockets such
as the “Long March” series, the Chinese state-owned
enterprises that developed and produced them are said
to be also developing and producing ballistic missiles,
and it is believed that the development of carrier rockets
could also be applied to the development of ballistic
missiles.

It is pointed out that China recognizes counter space

operations as a means to deter and confront the United
States’s intervention to regional conflicts[2] and carries out
ASAT weapons development and the like. In addition to
the satellite destruction test in 2007 mentioned above
and the “non-destructive” test of an ASAT missile in
July 2014, it is also pointed out that China continues
to acquire and develop various ASAT capabilities and
related technologies such as ground-based lasers and
space robots.[3]

China is thus expected to focus on space development

through close cooperation between government, military
and private sectors. The United States estimates that


According to the “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China,” the U.S. DoD (2023)


-----

China pursues space capabilities the same as or higher
than those of the United States.[4] It is also pointed out that
the number of Chinese military satellites under operation
is larger than that of the United States.[5]

In terms of policy, China insists that space is key to

international strategic competition and that the safety
of space is a strategic safeguard for nation building and
social development. It also reveals the principle that it
accelerates development of the aerospace domain. In
the white paper titled “China’s Space Program: A 2021
Perspective” issued in January 2022, it was emphasized
to “build China into a space power” and it stated that
China promotes the space industry. Moreover, the policy
to “accelerate the construction of space development
power” was raised in General Secretary Xi Jinping’s
report to the 20th Congress of the CCP in October 2022.

In terms of organization, the creation of an information

support force was announced in 2024, which has been
noted as a reorganization of the Strategic Support Forces
established at the end of 2015. Prior to 2024, the Strategic
Support Forces was said to have been tasked with space,
cyber, and electronic warfare.

Regarding ASAT weapons, in November 2021, the

Russian Ministry of Defence announced that it had
successfully destroyed a Soviet satellite in orbit in an
experiment.

In regard to Russian policies, Russia released in

2016 the Federal Space Program for 2016-2025 as a
specific future guideline for space activities, including
the development and deployment of domestic space
satellites and crewed flight programs.

From an organizational perspective, ROSCOSMOS is

in charge of space activities related to Russia’s scientific
and economic areas, while the Russian Ministry of
Defence is involved in space activities for security
purposes. The Russian Aerospace Forces, into which
the Air Force and the Aerospace Defence Forces were
integrated in August 2015, conduct actual space activities
for military purposes and manage facilities for launching
satellites.

While Russian space activity has been reduced since
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia has
continued to be active in space in recent years, even after
its aggression against Ukraine. For example, Russia is
working on the multi-satellite constellation plan Sfera
to complete a constellation of over 600 satellites for
observation and communication by 2030. Furthermore,
Russia has decided to extend its participation in the
International Space Station until 2028 and has revealed
a development plan for its own space station, with each
module scheduled to be launched between 2028 and
2030.

In addition, Russia has used its space capabilities

for military operations in Syria. Russian Minister of
Defense Shoigu revealed at a meeting of the Ministry
of Defence in 2019 that he has become aware of the
need to rebuild the country’s military satellites based
on this tactical experience. In 2023, Russia launched
the military satellite “Lotos-S1,” which is believed to
be for electronic reconnaissance, the radar observation
satellite “Kondor-FKA,” and the positioning satellite

General Control Center and reports information obtained
by reconnaissance satellites to the Central Military
Commission of the Workers’ Party (CMC) and, in
accordance with the CMC’s instructions, provides the

**5** **Republic of Korea (ROK)**

The ROK’s space development is promoted based
on the Fourth Basic Space Development Promotion
Plan announced in December 2022 under the Space
Development Promotion Act implemented in 2005. The
plan mainly aims to double the space-related budget,
promote the space industry and establish an aerospace
agency. The Ministry of National Defense has stated
that it will acquire surveillance, reconnaissance and
early warning satellites to strengthen its space-related
capabilities.[6]

In May 2023, the ROK conducted the third launch

of its domestically produced Nuri rocket. In December
2023, the ROK military’s first reconnaissance satellite
was launched in the United States and is scheduled
to be operational during the first half of 2024. In
addition, civilian commercial satellites have been
launched domestically using the Agency for Defense
Development’s solid-fuel propulsion space projectile
technology. The ROK Ministry of National Defense has
stated that the country is close to securing the capability
to rapidly put small satellites into low orbit.

Among organizations, the Korea Aerospace Research

Institute leads research and development as an
implementation agency. Furthermore, the Korea Agency
for Defense Development is engaged in the development
and use of various satellites. Also, to secure space
surveillance capabilities above the Korean Peninsula,
the country created its first space force in 2019 and
reinforced and reorganized the unit into the Air Force
Space Operation Battalion in 2022.

India is promoting space development, such as manned
space missions and lunar exploration missions.

India unveiled its Space Policy 2023, outlining its

intention to focus on providing public goods and services
using space technology and building a fair regulatory
framework to promote effective use of space by public
and private sectors for socio-economic and security
purposes. As for bilateral cooperation, the 2021 IndiaRussia Joint Statement announced the strengthening
of cooperation with Russia in the fields of space and
military technology. In 2023, India and the United
States established the India-U.S. Defense Acceleration
Ecosystem for defense technology innovation, with
Indian companies signing joint research and development
agreements with the U.S. Space Force.

India is also operating a regional navigation satellite

system called “Navigation Indian Constellation (NavIC)”
for the purpose of positioning around the country and
launched its second-generation positioning satellite in
2023.

Regarding ASAT weapons, Prime Minister Modi

announced in 2019 that the country successfully tested a
missile to destroy a low-orbit satellite.

The EU allocated 14.88 billion euros to its space policy
in its medium-term budget plan from 2021 through
2027. To promote the space industry and strengthen
security, the EU is promoting robust PNT, precise Earth
observation, enhanced space surveillance and tracking
capabilities, and secure satellite communication services.
It is also working to develop military PNT and spacebased autonomous situational awareness.

In 2023, the EU published its Space Security and

Defense Strategy, which stated that it would strengthen
the use of space capabilities in security and defense, and
it plans to develop new Earth observation services and
provide initial SDA services. The EU also announced
an agreement not to conduct DA-ASAT missile tests
and is conducting penetration tests on satellite-mounted
systems to understand the vulnerabilities of satellite
systems to cyber-attacks.

NATO indicated its recognition that space is the

cyberspace and that armed attacks in space could trigger
NATO’s right to collective self-defense. In its new
strategic concept published in 2022, NATO stated that
it would strengthen its ability to operate effectively in
the space and cyber domains. In 2023, NATO launched
an initiative called “persistent surveillance from space,”
aiming to strengthen ISR through the integrated use
of public and private satellites. Additionally, a NATOcertified Space Center of Excellence (Space COE) began
operation and is expected to complement the efforts
of the NATO Space Center through means such as
education, training, and concept development.

In the United Kingdom, the Space Command was

officially launched in 2021 and will be responsible for
conducting space operations, training and developing
space-related personnel, and providing space capabilities.
The Defense Space Strategy announced in 2022
stated that the United Kingdom will invest 1.4 billion
pounds over the next 10 years in areas such as ISR and


satellite communications. In 2023, the United Kingdom
established a unit where the Space Command will take
on part of the U.S. Space Force’s SDA mission, thereby
strengthening the UK’s space operations capabilities and
cooperation with the United States.

France announced its National Defense Space

Strategy in 2019, stating that it aims to establish a
space command and strengthen its threat recognition
and space situation monitoring capabilities. In the same
year, France established a space command under the Air
Force. In 2020, the Air Force was renamed the Air and
Space Force, adding activities to ensure free access to
space and freedom of action in space to its duties. In
addition, in the “Military Programming Act 2024-2030”
enacted in 2023, France stated that it aims to establish

have a cyber command unit.[8] The cyber command unit is
believed to be responsible for conducting offensive cyber
activities, including inserting malware into command
and control systems of adversaries,[9] and is said to have
approximately 1,000 personnel.

Moreover, Russia revealed, in its National Security

Strategy released in July 2021, its perception that space
and information space are under active development as a
new domain for military action and declared to reinforce
its sovereignty in the information space as a national
priority. In 2019, Russia enacted the so-called Sovereign

**Chapter**


In recent years, supply chain attacks via vulnerabilities
in products used on a daily basis and business partners
with lax security, as well as cyber-attacks on industrial
control systems such as critical infrastructure, have also
attracted attention.

Supply chain attacks by circumventing conventional

security measures are a concern because they invade
trusted organizations and software during the supply
process ranging from procuring product parts to selling
them to infiltrate targeted organizations. In 2023,
the United States and the United Kingdom issued a
warning that the ransomware actor “cl0p” had infiltrated
government networks by exploiting vulnerabilities in
software used by government agencies.

Cyberattacks on industrial control systems are a

growing concern for critical infrastructure in particular,
as the use of IT has made these systems easier targets
for attacks, due to their transition from proprietary
specifications and closed systems to open systems.
In 2022, European security companies pointed out
that in the Russian cyberattack on Ukrainian power
transmission and substation facilities, the attackers were
attempting to penetrate industrial control systems inside
the IT network and deploy destructive malware.

As for space systems, satellite communications

services were disrupted in 2022 due to a Russian cyberattack on a satellite communications operator. As a
result, countries are strengthening security measures
through new advisories and guidelines on satellite
communications and in Europe and the United States,
penetration tests and hacking competitions are being
conducted to clarify the vulnerabilities of space systems.


According to the statement made by Russian Minister of Defence Shoigu in an information session for Duma, the lower house, in February 2017. He said that the Russian military has a
cyber command for countering political propaganda in the context of Russia’s ongoing information war with Western countries. However, the minister fell short of naming the command.

cyber cooperation, as well as working to ensure mutual
cyber security support among member states. In 2023,
an operator-level exercise was held to strengthen
information-sharing and situational awareness among
member states to cope with cyber-related crises.

At the NATO Summit in 2014, an agreement was

reached that NATO’s collective defense applies to cyberattacks against member states. In addition, at the 2023
NATO summit, it was decided to integrate political,
military and technological aspects of cyber defense to
ensure military-civilian cooperation in peacetime, crises
and emergency situations and further strengthen national
cyber defense, including critical infrastructure.

On the organizational front, the NATO Cyber Security

Centre is protecting NATO’s own networks and the Cyber
Domain Operations Center is coordinating operational
actions in the cyber domain, ensuring freedom of action
and providing threat resilience. In 2023, NATO launched
the Virtual Cyber Incident Support Capability (VCISC)
to counter malicious and significant cyber activities.

Furthermore, in 2008, the NATO Cooperative

Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) was
authorized to serve as a research and training institution.
The CCDCOE published the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on
international law applicable to cyber operations in 2017
and an initiative to revise the manual to version 3.0 is
ongoing. In 2023, the CCDCOE held the cyber defense
exercise “Locked Shields,” and NATO held the cyber

the cyber threat environment through best practices and
partnerships and set action goals such as operational
model implementation and capability acquisition. In
addition, the “2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security
Strategy,” published in 2023, established a roadmap for
Australia to become a global cybersecurity leader by
2030.

In its 2023 Defence Strategic Review, Australia stated

that it should broadly strengthen its cyber capabilities
to support integrated domain operations and in its 2024
National Defence Strategy and Integrated Investment
Program, it stated that it would improve its defense
capabilities, including cyber capabilities, over the 10
years leading up to 2034.

On the organizational front, cybersecurity capabilities

across the government have been centralized through
the establishment of the Australian Cyber Security
Centre (ACSC), which addresses major cybersecurity
issues related to government agencies and critical
infrastructure. In 2022, Australia announced the creation
of a permanent joint task force of 100 cyber personnel
selected from the Department of Communications and
the Australian Federal Police to prevent cyber-attacks
before they occur. The Minister for Cyber Security has
clearly declared to adopt an offensive cyber defense.

The Australian Defence Force created the Information

Warfare Division under the Joint Capabilities Group in
2017 and established the Defence Signals Intelligence
and Cyber Command (DSCC) under the division in
2018. In 2019, the Royal Australian Air Force offered to
recruit cyber skills officers to protect networks, data and

2015, France stated that it would protect its fundamental
interests in cyberspace and strengthen its response
to cybercrimes. In addition, in its “Strategic Review
of Cyber Defense” in 2018, it clarified its cyber crisis
management process.

On the organizational front, France established

its Cyber Defense Command under the Chief of the
Defence Staff in 2017 and announced a plan to increase
the Command’s personnel to around 5,000 by 2025 to
strengthen its cyber defense capabilities. In addition, the
“Military Planning Law 2024-2030,” enacted in 2023,
aims to establish a center of excellence (research base)
to develop tactics, methods and procedures for cyber
missions.


In addition, the National Cyber Force: Responsible
Cyber Warfare Practices,” published in 2023, stated that
it would disrupt terrorist activities, counter APT threats
and mitigate election interference and would pursue
efforts to enhance the National Cyber Force’s scale,
capabilities and functional integration going forward.

On the organizational front, in 2016, the National

Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) was newly established
under the Government Communications Headquarters
(GCHQ) to promote public-private partnerships for
responses to national cyber incidents. Moreover, the
13th Signal Regiment was established in 2020 for the
protection of military networks. The National Cyber
Force was also established.

In the Russian Forces, there are reportedly five

electronic warfare brigades.[5] They mainly consist of the
Land Forces and possess multiple types of electronic
warfare equipment. Furthermore, Russia is further
developing and deploying electronic warfare (EW)
systems equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) such as
the EW system Bylina that controls many EW equipment
in an integrated manner and the EW system Palantin that
reportedly can interfere with radio communications and
electronic reconnaissance systems within a radius of

During the invasion of Ukraine, Russia s electronic

warfare equipment appears to have been effective in
interfering with the navigation of Ukrainian drones[6] and
degrading the guidance accuracy of GPS-guided missiles

drones, Russia is installing jammers on armored vehicles
and taking measures to suppress drones’ communications.

The United States revealed its perception, in the

National Strategy for the Arctic Region issued in October
2022, that the competition with Russia and China in the
Arctic Region is intensifying.[6] Moreover, on the security
front, the U.S. Government stated that it would deter the
threats against the U.S. mainland and allies by enhancing
the capabilities required to protect national interests in
the Arctic Region, and reduce the risk of unintentional
escalation through coordinating a common approach with
allies and partners. In October 2018, the United States sent
an aircraft carrier to the Arctic Region for the first time in
27 years for air drills in the Norwegian Sea. And, in May
2020, United States and United Kingdom warships took
part in activities in the Barents Sea for the first time since
the end of the Cold War. In March 2021, a B-1 bomber
landed for the first time inside the Arctic Circle. In March
2022, the U.S. Navy conducted the exercise “Ice Exercise
2022” that involved the participation of two Los Angelesclass nuclear submarines as well as the Royal Canadian
Navy, Royal Canadian Air Force and British Royal Navy.

Aside from coastal states in the Arctic Ocean, 13

countries including Japan, China, the ROK, the United
Kingdom, Germany, and France, have observer status
in the Arctic Council. China shows a stance to be
proactively involved in the Arctic Sea. It is pointed out
that China could take advantage of scientific survey and
commercial activities to increase its presence including
military activities in the Arctic Sea.[7] As of early 2023,
China was operating three icebreaking research vessels:
“Xue Long,” “Xue Long 2,” and “Sun Yat-sen University
Polar.” China is said to have deployed its first autonomous
underwater vehicle (AUV) in the Arctic Ocean during its
Arctic expedition in October 2022.[8]

**See** Chapter 3, Section 2-2-6 (Maritime and Airspace Activities)


resources in the Arctic Ocean have gained momentum
in line with a decline in sea ice. The eight arctic circle
nations consisting of Canada, Denmark, Finland,
Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States
established the Arctic Council in 1996 to promote
cooperation for common challenges such as sustainable
development and environment protection.[5]

From the perspective of security, the Arctic Ocean has

traditionally been used for the deployment of strategic
nuclear forces and as their transit route. With the decrease
in sea ice in recent years, ships have been able to
navigate for a longer period of time and more extensively
than before. It has therefore been considered that the
region could be used for deploying maritime forces or
maneuvering military forces using military maritime
transport capabilities in future. In this situation, moves
to deploy new military capabilities in the ocean are seen.

Russia upgraded its Northern Fleet to military

district level in January 2021, and its maritime doctrine,
announced in July 2022, positioned the Arctic Ocean as
an area of vital importance. Russia is promoting efforts
to establish a system to protect its national interests in the
Arctic region. Its various policy documents clearly state
Russia’s interests and the role of the Russian military in
the Arctic. Furthermore, Russia is proceeding to develop
a radar surveillance network as well as reconstructing
airfields and deploying surface-to-air and surface-to-ship
missiles along the Arctic coast. In terms of its activities,
Russia is intensifying its activities in the Arctic Ocean,
such as conducting strategic nuclear deterrence patrols
with Ballistic Missile Submarine Nuclear-Powered and
patrol flights with long-range bombers. The Pacific Fleet
conducted the comprehensive Arctic expedition “Umka2022” in the Chukchi Sea in September 2022 and a
tactical exercise “Finnval-2023” in the Bering Sea in
addition to the Chukchi Sea in September 2023, in which

Russia was supposed to be the chair country of the Arctic Council for two years from May 2021. However, in March 2022, the remaining seven Arctic region countries stated that they would
stop participating in all the meetings of the Council with Russia as the chair country because of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. Norway assumed the chairmanship in May 2023, and
an agreement was reached to restart the working group.

The United States revealed its perception about Russia that the country made vast investment for its military presence in the Arctic Region in the last decade, while it also built up new
economic infrastructure in the region and attempted to limit free navigation through excessive claims to territorial waters. The United States has pointed out that Russia’s aggression against
Ukraine has heightened geopolitical tensions even in the Arctic Region, created new risks of unintended conflict, and hampered cooperation. It also recognized that China has emphasized
its intention to amplify its influence and play greater roles in the Arctic Region through expanding its economic, diplomatic, scientific, and military activities. The United States also pointed
out that China doubled its investment for mining of important mineral resources in particular in the last decade, and conducted research of dual use for military application in the Arctic
Region.

V National Security Objectives of Japan

-  Japan will continue to be a nation capable of protecting its sovereignty and independence, autonomously determining its domestic and foreign policies, and defending its territory and the safety of life, person, and the properties of its nationals.
Japan will deter contingencies and the like. If by any chance a threat should reach Japan, Japan will defeat the threat and minimize the damage caused, and bring it to an end on a favorable term.

-  Japan will proactively ensure, through its security policy, an international environment in which its own economy can grow. Japan will work to achieve a virtuous cycle of security and economic growth.

-  Japan will ensure the self-reliance, advantages, and indispensability of its economy.
Japan will achieve a new balance in international relations, especially in the Indo-Pacific region. Japan will prevent the emergence of situations conducive to unilaterally changing the status quo, and redouble efforts to secure a stable, predictable, free and open
international order based on the rule of law.

-  Japan will generate an environment in which the international community can coexist and co-prosper through multilateral cooperation.

2004 NDPG specified two security objectives: (i) to

prevent direct threats from reaching Japan, and should
a threat arise, to eliminate the threat and minimize the
damage caused; and (ii) to improve the international
security environment and ensure that no threats are
posed to Japan. To achieve these objectives, Japan would
combine three approaches in an integrated manner, namely
through (i) its own efforts, (ii) cooperation with the ally,
and (iii) cooperation with the international community.
The document stated that with regard to Japan’s approach
to its defense capabilities, the effective parts of the “Basic
Defense Force Concept” would be retained while placing
a greater emphasis on Japan’s “response capabilities” and
recognizing that “multifunctional, flexible, and effective
defense capabilities” were required to respond to the new
threats and diverse contingencies.

qualities of readiness, mobility, flexibility, sustainability,
and versatility would be built and supported by advanced
technological and intelligence capabilities that took into
account trends in the levels of military technologies.

**5** **2013 NDPG**


2013 NDPG[7] was formulated against the backdrop of an
increasingly severe security environment surrounding
Japan in which the defense capabilities that underpinned
the various activities of the SDF could no longer be
guaranteed to be adequate in “quality” and “quantity”
in view of the increasing number and longer duration of
situations that required a response by the SDF, including
so-called “gray-zone” situations.

2013 NDPG took these considerations into account

and stipulated the enhancement of Japan’s deterrence
and response capabilities by placing greater emphasis
on joint operations, improving the operational level of
equipment and its employment, and by ensuring that the
defense capabilities that underpinned various activities
would be adequate both in “quality” and “quantity.” To
this end, it was determined that capability assessments
would be conducted from the viewpoint of joint
operations with a focus on the functions and capabilities
of the SDF as a whole, in order to identify the functions
and capabilities that should be of particular focus from
a comprehensive perspective. Harnessing the results of
these capability assessments would allow Japan to adapt
to the ever-changing security environment surrounding it
and efficiently develop its defense capabilities in a wellbalanced manner. In addition, its logistical support base
would be extensively reinforced to establish a posture
that ensures its most effective operation.

In the above ways, 2013 NDPG sought to develop a

“Dynamic Joint Defense Force,” a more effective defense
force capable of conducting a variety of activities in a
swift and flexible manner.

**6** **2018 NDPG**

2018 NDPG[8] was formulated with the aim of building

2010 NDPG[6] was formulated based on the facts that (i)
large-scale military forces, including nuclear forces, had
continued to exist in the area surrounding Japan, and
many states were modernizing their military capabilities
and intensifying their various activities; (ii) the period
of time from the emergence of signs of a threat to the
actual occurrence of a situation had tended to be shorter

technology, and there was a need to respond seamlessly

on the “operation of defense capabilities” as well as
the ability to actively carry out various activities to

been formulated six times since 1976.

The NDS states that the most consequential responsibility

of the Government of Japan is to resolutely defend to
the end the lives of Japanese nationals and their peaceful
livelihood as well as Japan’s territorial land, waters, and
airspace and that it is the very heart of Japan’s national
security. It adds that the international community, of which
Japan is a member, is facing serious challenges, and has
entered into a new era of crisis. The NDS maintains that one
cannot rule out the possibility of serious events taking place
in the future in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly in East
Asia, that might shake the foundation of the stable post-war
international order. It then states that amid the most severe
and complex security environment since the end of WWII,
Japan needs to face the grim reality and fundamentally
reinforce Japan’s defense capabilities, with a focus on
opponent capabilities and new ways of warfare, to protect
the lives and peaceful livelihood of Japanese nationals.

In addition, in April 2023, the Headquarters for the

Promotion of Realization of Fundamental Reinforcement
of Defense Capabilities was established under Defense
Minister in order to ensure thorough management of
the progress of initiatives, etc. to be implemented from
FY2023 onward and to ensure effective and efficient

**KEY WORD**

**New ways of warfare**

In addition to the traditional forms of invasion through air, sea, and land, new
ways of warfare have emerged with the combination of massive strikes by
missiles with enhanced precision strike capabilities, hybrid warfare including
information warfare, asymmetric attacks leveraging the domains of space,
cyber, and electromagnetic spectrum and with unmanned assets, and
public remarks that could be interpreted as threat using nuclear weapons.
Whether or not to be able to respond to these new ways of warfare is a major
challenge in building future defense capabilities.


documents. The Headquarters held six meetings by April
2024. Under its leadership, the MOD/SDF will forge
ahead with the fundamental reinforcement of its defense
capabilities through both thorough progress management
of projects and shorter and more streamlined processes
for procurement and accounting.

The NDS states that to protect one’s own country from

opponents, it is necessary to have deterrence capability,
thereby making them realize that unilateral changes to
the status quo by force are difficult and that it is also
necessary to build one’s own defense capability focusing
on opponent capabilities. This statement is based on
the following recognition. The military background for
Russia’s aggression against Ukraine was that Ukraine
did not possess sufficient capabilities to deter Russian
aggression. Also, while no country can defend its own
security by itself alone, there is a renewed recognition
of the importance of cooperation with allies who have

the intention and capability to respond to invasions
jointly. Also worth paying attention to in this event is
that a country with strong military capability has one day
come to possess the intention to launch an aggression. A
threat materializes when the capability to inflict harm is
combined with the intention to do so; accurately gauging
other’s intent from outside is inherently difficult. When a
state’s decision-making process is opaque, there always
exists conditions under which threat may materialize.

**See** Fig. II-2-2-2 (Implementation Architecture for Fundamentally

Reinforcing Japan’s Defense Capabilities); and Reference 2

**See**

(National Defense Strategy)

**1** **Japan’s Basic Defense Policy**

Defense capability, which forms the very foundation
of the defense of Japan, is the ultimate guarantor for
ensuring Japan’s security. It will deter threats from
extending to Japan, and in the case that a threat does
reach Japan, it will disrupt and defeat the threat, thereby
demonstrating Japan’s resolve and capability to defend
itself to the end. The NDS states that Japan must clearly
demonstrate the intention that Japan will never tolerate
unilateral changes to the status quo by force and such
attempts in any situation. It adds that to this end, Japan
must fundamentally reinforce defense capabilities with
a focus on opponents’ capabilities and the ways they
prosecute warfare and actively adapt to new ways of
warfare.

Then the NDS sets out three defense objectives for

Japan:
(i) To shape a security environment that does not tolerate

unilateral changes to the status quo by force

(ii) To deter, through cooperation and collaboration with

our ally, like-minded countries and others, unilateral
changes to the status quo by force and such attempts
and to bring the situation under control at an early
stage

(iii) To take primary responsibility to deal with invasion

of Japan, if any, and to disrupt and defeat it, while
receiving support from the ally and others
The NDS explains that in dealing with the threat

of nuclear weapons, U.S. extended deterrence, with
nuclear deterrence at its core, is essential. It then states
that Japan will defend itself to the end in all situations
through the combination of its own efforts to achieve the
three defense objectives mentioned above and extended
deterrence and others provided by the United States.

Th th NDS t t th h t hi i


these defense objectives, as well as basic ideas behind
them:
(i) To fundamentally reinforce Japan’s defense

capabilities, which constitute the core of national
defense, and reinforce the defense architecture of the
whole country in an effort of strengthening of Japan’s
own architecture for national defense

(ii) To further reinforce joint deterrence and response

capability of the Japan-U.S. Alliance by further
strengthening cooperation with the United States, our
ally

(iii) To reinforce collaboration with like-minded countries

and others with whom Japan cooperate to uphold and
reinforce a free and open international order

**(1) First Approach: Strengthening Japan’s Own**

**Architecture for National Defense**

**a. Fundamental Reinforcement of Japan’s Defense**

**Capabilities**

With a fundamentally reinforced defense capability,
Japan should be able to take primary responsibility to
disrupt and defeat invasion against Japan. This means
that Japan will possess a capability that makes the
opponent realize that the goal of invasion of Japan is
not achievable by military means, and that the damage
the opponent will incur makes the invasion not worth
the cost. If Japan possesses such defense capability, this
capability, coupled with that of the United States, will be
able to deter not only an invasion against Japan, but also
deter unilateral changes to the status quo by force and
such attempts in the Indo-Pacific region. This will help
foster a security environment where such forcible actions
are not tolerated. This is why Japan will fundamentally
reinforce its defense capabilities.

In addition, Japan’s fundamentally reinforced defense

capabilities must be able to respond to new ways of
warfare. As for the functions and capabilities required
for this purpose, Japan will first strengthen (i) stand-off
defense capabilities and (ii) integrated air and missile
defense capabilities, in order to disrupt and defeat
invading forces from a long distance, thereby deterring
invasion against Japan itself. Should deterrence fail and
invasion of Japan occur, Japan will leverage, in addition
to capabilities (i) and (ii), manned and unmanned assets
and strengthen its (iii) unmanned defense capabilities, (iv)
cross-domain operation capabilities, and (v) command
and control and intelligence-related functions, in order
to ensure asymmetric advantage while gain superiority

**Commentary** **Counterstrike Capabilities**

**Q. What are counterstrike capabilities? Why are they necessary?**
Counterstrike capabilities are the SDF’s capabilities that leverage

**Commentary**

stand-off defense capabilities and other capabilities. In cases where
an armed attack against Japan has occurred and ballistic missiles,
etc., have been used as the means of such an attack, counterstrike
capabilities enable Japan to mount effective counterstrikes against
the opponent’s territory in accordance with the Three New Conditions
for the “use of force” as a minimum necessary self-defense measure
that cannot be avoided to prevent such an attack.

In recent years, there has been a dramatic improvement in

missile-related technologies such as hypersonic weapons and
practical missile operational capabilities such as saturation attacks
in the area surrounding Japan. As the quality and quantity of missile
forces are being significantly enhanced, and missiles are being
launched repeatedly, missile attacks on Japan have become a real
threat, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to respond to them
fully with the existing missile defense network alone. For this reason,
it is necessary for Japan to possess counterstrike capabilities in
order to prevent further armed attacks by the opponent by means
of its counterstrike capabilities while defending against incoming
missiles with its missile defense network.

Having the counterstrike capabilities will deter armed attacks

themselves. Moreover, should missiles be launched by an opponent,
Japan will be able to prevent further armed attacks by the opponent
by means of its counterstrike capabilities, thereby protecting the lives
and peaceful livelihood of Japanese nationals.
**Q. Don’t counterstrike capabilities go against the**

**exclusively defense-oriented policy?**

The exclusively defense-oriented policy means that defensive force
is used only in the event of an attack, that the extent of the use of
defensive force is kept to the minimum necessary for self-defense,
and that the defense capabilities to be possessed and maintained
by Japan are limited to the minimum necessary for self-defense. It
is Japan’s basic strategy of defense.

Japan’s counterstrike capabilities are used in cases where an

armed attack involving ballistic missiles and the like has occurred
against Japan. They are used in accordance with the Three New
Conditions for Use of Force as a minimum necessary self-defense
measure that cannot be avoided to prevent such an attack.

The exclusively defense oriented policy and Japan’s counterstrike

capabilities are logically consistent in that both allow for a minimum
necessary measure for self-defense to be taken in the event of an armed
attack. The Japanese Government intends to remain committed to the
exclusively defense-oriented policy as Japan’s basic strategy of defense.
**Q Doesn’t the use of counterstrike capabilities constitute**


Counterstrike capabilities fall within the purview of the Constitution,
international law, and domestic law; they can be used only when the
Three New Conditions for Use of Force are met. Needless to say,
preemptive strikes, namely striking first at a stage when no armed
attack has occurred, remain impermissible, and Japan will not do so.
**Q. Can counterstrike capabilities be used in a Survival-**

**Threatening Situations?**

A situation will not be unconditionally confirmed as Survival-Threatening
Situations whenever an armed attack on another country having a close
relationship with Japan occurs. It will be confirmed as such when such
an attack threatens Japan’s survival and poses a clear danger in terms
of fundamentally overturning people’s right to life, liberty, and pursuit of
happiness. Japan is allowed to use force if there are no other appropriate
means available to repel the attack, ensure Japan’s survival, and protect
its people and if such a use of force is limited to the minimum extent
necessary as a measure for self-defense.

If a survival-threatening situation is confirmed, the Japanese

Government will decide on the use of counterstrike capabilities on a
case-by-case basis. Such a decision will be made in view of the actual
situation, in accordance with the Three New Conditions for Use of
Force, and from the perspective of what measures to be taken as long
as they are the absolute minimum measures that are unavoidably
necessary to prevent attacks by guided missiles, etc. if no other
means are available.

(Reference) *1: Unified opinion of the Japanese Government (answer read

by Defense Agency Director General FUNADA Naka on behalf
of Prime Minister Hatoyama Ichiro (February 29, 1956))
If Jpan were in imminent danger of an illegal invasion,
and the method of invasion were a missile attack against
Japan’s national territory, I simply cannot believe that the
spirit of the Constitution requires that we merely sit and
wait to die. In such a case, I believe that we should take
the absolute minimum measures that are unavoidably
necessary to defend against such an attack, so that in
defending against a missile attack, for example, if no other
suitable means are available, striking the missile base
should be legally acceptable and falls within the range of
self-defense.

mobile deployment capabilities and civil protection and
(vii) sustainability and resiliency to operate in a swift as
well as persistent manner to crush to the opponent’s will
to invade.

Japan will need to promptly realize the fundamental

reinforcement of its defense capabilities as when
and how unilateral changes to the status quo occur
is hard to predict. First, by FY2027, five years after
the formulation of the NDS, Japan will strengthen its
defense capability to the point where Japan is able to
take primary responsibility for dealing with invasions
against this nation, and disrupt and defeat such
threats with the support of its ally and others. The top
priorities for the next five years are twofold: first, to
maximize effective use of its existing equipment, Japan
will improve the number of operationally available
equipment, secure sufficient ammunitions and fuel, and
accelerate investment in improving the resiliency of key
defense facilities; and second, Japan will fundamentally
strengthen its core capabilities for future operations.
By approximately ten years from now, Japan will make
further efforts for achieving these defense objectives and
will reinforce its defense capabilities to the point where
Japan is able to disrupt and defeat invasion much earlier
and at places further afield.

A key to deterring invasion against Japan is

counterstrike capabilities that leverage stand-off defense
capability and other capabilities. In recent years, in
Japan’s surroundings, there have been significant
improvement of missile forces in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, and missiles themselves have been
repeatedly launched. Missile attacks have become a
palpable threat. Under these circumstances, Japan will
continue its steadfast efforts to both qualitatively and
quantitatively enhance its missile defense network;
however, it will become increasingly difficult to fully
address missile threats with the existing network alone.
For this reason, Japan needs counterstrike capabilities:
capabilities which enable Japan to mount effective
counterstrikes against the opponent to prevent further
attacks while defending against incoming missiles by
means of missile defenses.

Counterstrike capabilities are the SDF’s capabilities

that leverage stand-off defense capability and other
capabilities. In cases where armed attack against Japan has
occurred, and as part of that attack ballistic missiles and
other means have been used, counterstrike capabilities
enable Japan to mount effective counterstrikes against
th t’ t it C t t ik d


minimum necessary measure for self defense and in
accordance with the Three New Conditions for Use
of Force. By possessing such capabilities to mount
effective counterstrikes, Japan will deter armed attack
itself. If an opponent ever launches missiles, it will be
able to prevent the opponent’s further armed attacks by
counterstrike capabilities, while protecting itself against
incoming missiles by the missile defense network,
thereby defending the lives and peaceful livelihoods of
Japanese nationals.

As counterstrike capabilities fall within the purview

of Japan’s Constitution and international law they do
not change Japan’s exclusively defense-oriented policy;
and, they can be used only when the above-mentioned
Three New Conditions are fulfilled. Needless to say,
preemptive strikes, namely striking first at a stage when
no armed attack has occurred, remain impermissible.
While the basic division of roles between Japan and the
United States will remain unchanged, as Japan will now
possess counterstrike capabilities, the two nations will
cooperate in counterstrikes.
**b. Reinforcing the Defense Architecture of the Whole**

**Country**

To defend Japan, the SDF needs to be strong. National
defense cannot be achieved without a whole-ofcountry approach. For this reason, in addition to
fundamentally reinforcing defense capabilities, Japan
will build an overall national defense architecture
by integrating Japan’s national power – diplomatic,
intelligence, economic, and technological – as well as by
systematically combining all policy means. To enhance
the whole-of-government undertaking, it is essential to
break down sectionalism within the Government. Japan
will enhance the comprehensive defense architecture that
draws upon Japan’s national power. This undertaking is
an indivisible part of the fundamental reinforcement of
defense capabilities. The national government will also
promote cooperation with local governments and private
entities.

**(2) Second Approach: Joint Deterrence and Response**

**by the Japan-U.S. Alliance**

The second approach is to further strengthen the JapanU.S. Alliance. The Alliance with the United States
is a key pillar of Japan’s security, and fundamental
reinforcement of Japan’s defense capabilities will lead to
more effective employment of U.S. capabilities and will
further strengthen deterrence and response capabilities

resolve and capabilities, Japan and the United States
will deter unilateral changes to the status quo by force
and such attempts. In addition, if an invasion against
Japan occurs, Japan-U.S. joint response will disrupt the
invasion.

The first measure to this end is to strengthen Japan
U.S. joint deterrence and response capabilities. Japan’s
NDS and the United States’ National Defense Strategy
are well aligned in prioritizing the prevention of unilateral
changes to the status quo by force through integrating all
approaches and means. Accordingly, from the viewpoint
of reinforcing readiness and resiliency, imposing cost on
opponents, and deterring invasion against Japan, Japan
will further deepen discussion with the United States
on their roles, missions, and capabilities and further
reinforce joint deterrence capabilities of both countries
in an integrated manner.

The next is to reinforce alliance coordination

functions. To conduct aligned joint response of Japan
and the United States, Japan will further upgrade the
overall coordination functions centered on the Alliance
Coordination Mechanism (ACM). In addition, in order
to enhance collaboration with like-minded countries
and others centered around the Japan-U.S. Alliance,
Japan will promote closer operational coordination by
leveraging the ACM and others.

Furthermore, as efforts to reinforce the foundation for

allied response, Japan will reinforce the foundational
elements that support effective allied response in all
phases, including information security, cybersecurity,
and defense equipment and technology cooperation.

The last is measures to support the stationing of

the U.S. Forces in Japan. Japan will promote various
measures to provide stable support for the stationing of
the U.S. Forces in Japan, such as steady implementation
of the realignment of the U.S. Forces in Japan and the
initiatives to reinforce the readiness and resiliency of the
U.S. Forces in Japan, while optimizing the bilateral joint
posture to respond to the severe security environment.

**(3) Third Approach: Collaboration with Like-minded**

**Countries and Others**

The third approach is to enhance collaboration with
like-minded countries and others. In order to respond to
unilateral changes to the status quo by force and such
attempts and to ensure Japan’s security, it is extremely
important to reinforce collaboration with not only our
ally but also as many countries as possible. From such


perspective, Japan will promote efforts to contribute
to realizing the vision of a FOIP. Moreover, Japan
will proactively promote multilateral and multilayered
defense cooperation and exchanges, taking into account
characteristics and other factors of the region and each
country. In doing so, while promoting collaboration
with like-minded countries and others, Japan will pay
attention to communication with China and Russia.

**2** **Key Capabilities for Fundamental**

**Reinforcement of Defense Capabilities**
**(Seven Priority Areas)**


The NDS lays out the basic concepts and contents of
the seven functions and capabilities necessary for the
defense of Japan, which are derived from the basic
policies and the comprehensive operation concept in
line with them. The seven functions and capabilities
are (i) stand-off defense capabilities, (ii) integrated air
and missile defense capabilities, (iii) unmanned defense
capabilities, (iv) cross-domain operation capabilities, (v)
command and control and intelligence-related functions,
(vi) mobile deployment capabilities/civil protection, and
(vii) sustainability and resiliency.

The NDS notes that Japan will need to promptly realize

the fundamental reinforcement of its defense capabilities.
It states that by FY 2027, five years after its formulation,
Japan will strengthen its defense capabilities to the point
at which Japan is able to take the primary responsibility
for dealing with invasions against its nation, and disrupt
and defeat such threats while gaining the support of
its ally and others. In studying ways to fundamentally
reinforce Japan’s defense capabilities, the Government
has considered, from many different angles, whether it
can protect the lives and livelihoods of the people of
Japan to the end. In so doing, it has examined gaps in
the country’s defense capabilities and compiled a list of
the necessary defense capabilities. As priorities for the
next five years, the list includes improving the number
of operationally available equipment, securing sufficient
ammunition and fuel, and investing in improving the
resiliency of key defense facilities to maximize effective
use of the existing equipment, as well as fundamentally
strengthening its core capabilities for future operations,
such as stand-off defense capabilities and unmanned
defense capabilities.

Fig. II-2-2-5 Measures, etc. for Protection of the Life, Person, and Property of Japanese Nationals


**Protection of Life, Person and Property of Japanese Nationals and Measures for International Security Cooperation**

Measures for protection of life, person and property of Japanese nationals

・Not only an invasion of Japan, but also large-scale terrorist attacks, attacks on critical infrastructure including nuclear power plants, large-scale disasters, and infectious disease crises are

serious threats, and Japan will respond to them with its utmost efforts.

Measures for security cooperation against global challenges

・For the peace and security of Japan, and from the perspective of proactive contribution to peace, Japan will make efforts toward resolving conflicts and confrontations around the world,

provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief in the event of large-scale international disasters caused by climate change, and proactively respond to global challenges such as non-
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

**Defense Production and Technological Bases as a Virtually Integral Part of Defense Capabilities**

・Defense production and technology bases constitute an indispensable foundation for securing the stable research, development, production, and procurement of equipment in Japan and

for incorporating cutting-edge technologies necessary for new ways of warfare into defense equipment. These bases are virtually defense capabilities themselves, and their reinforcement
is essential.

・Japan will promote initiatives such as building a strong and sustainable defense industry necessary for a new way of warfighting, dealing with various risks, and expanding sales channels.

**Strengthening the Foundation for Uniformed SDF Personnel, the Core of Japan’s Defense Capabilities, to Demonstrate Their Abilities**

Reinforcing the human resource base

・The MOD/SDF will secure necessary uniformed SDF personnel, the core of Japan’s defense capabilities, and create an environment that enables them all to demonstrate their own abilities

to their fullest while maintaining high morale and pride.

Transforming the medical function

・The MOD/SDF will transform the SDF medical force—which has been placing importance on sustaining the health of uniformed SDF personnel—into an organization that saves the lives of

unformed SDF personnel who carry out their missions in a contingency in spite of danger.

**5** **Disaster Relief Dispatches and Others**

**(1) Disaster Relief Dispatches**
Prefectural governors or other officials[10] may request
the Minister of Defense, or an officer designated by the
Minister,[11] to dispatch SDF units, etc., in the event of a
disaster[12] if they deem such a dispatch necessary in order to
protect lives or properties. Upon such a request, the Minister
or the designated officer will, in principle, make a judgment
based on a comprehensive evaluation of three conditions—
urgency, non-substitutability, and public nature—and
dispatch the units if it is deemed necessary for the SDF to
respond to the disaster. This procedure is based on the idea
that prefectural governors and other officials should grasp
the overall conditions of the disaster and their own disaster
relief capabilities first, and then decide whether to make
a request for the SDF disaster relief dispatch. However,
under circumstances of particular urgency when there is no
time to wait for a request, the Minister of Defense or the
designated officer may discretionarily dispatch units, etc.
without waiting for such a request.

**Airspace**

The Minister of Defense may order SDF units to take
the necessary measures to make the intruding aircraft
land or withdraw from the territorial airspace of Japan
(by guiding intruders away, issuing radio transmission
warnings, using weapons, etc.) when a foreign aircraft
intrudes Japan’s territorial airspace in violation of
international law, the provisions of the Aviation Law,
or other relevant laws and regulations. It is a violation
of Japanese airspace when objects of foreign countries,
even if they are unmanned aircraft (including balloons),
intrude into our airspace without permission. The
Japanese Government has traditionally considered that
the use of weapons during scrambles responding to
intrusions into Japanese airspace is permissible only when
such measures fall under the requirements of legitimate
self-defense or necessity, assuming that such intrusions
are made by manned and military aircraft. Given that
the use of weapons against unmanned aircraft, including
balloons that intrude into Japanese airspace, would
not directly harm people, the Japanese Government in
February 2023 clarified its interpretation of Article 84 of
the Self-Defense Forces Law, which concerns the use of
weapons against unmanned aircraft, as follows: In such
a case where the safety of aircraft cannot be ensured if
the situation left as it is, and when deemed necessary to

from Afghanistan—involved removing restrictions
on the means of transportation, reviewing the safety
requirements for implementation, and expanding the
scope of primary transportation recipients.

The Minister of Defense can also rescue Japanese

nationals and others by protecting or recovering them

Foreign Affairs if there is a threat of harm to life or body
and all of the following are satisfied:

currently working on maintaining public safety and

-  The country concerned[14] provides consent for the

weapons); and

-  Coordination and cooperation with the competent

authorities of the country concerned is expected to be
ensured to carry out the rescue measures as smoothly
and safely as possible in response to anticipated
dangers.

Transport of Japanese Nationals and Others Overseas);

Overseas)

**(2) Activities that Contribute to the Defense of Japan**
“Activities that contribute to the defense of Japan”
are determined on a case-by-case basis and may
include the following: (1) intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance (ISR) activities including ballistic
missile surveillance; (2) transportation and logistics
activities in Important Influence Situations; and (3)
bilateral/multilateral exercises to enhance capabilities
required for defending Japan.

**(3) Decision on Protection Missions**
When the Minister of Defense receives a request from
the U.S. Forces, and other forces, the Minister makes
a decision on his/her initiative whether the relevant
activities fall under “activities that contribute to the
defense of Japan” and whether protection is necessary,
by considering the objective and details of the activities,
capability of the unit, and surrounding circumstances as
well as the impacts on the SDF’s regular duties.


Based on Article 95-2 of the SDF Law, SDF personnel is
authorized to protect weapons and other equipment[15] of
the units of the U.S. Forces and other forces[16] currently
engaged in activities that contribute to the defense of
Japan in cooperation with the SDF. The basic principles
of this Article, and the involvement of the Cabinet in
applying this Article are set forth in the Implementation
Guidelines,[17] which is outlined below:

**(1) Purpose of Article 95-2**
Protection under this Article can be applied to weapons
and other equipment of the units of the U.S. Forces
and foreign armed forces, and other such organizations
currently engaged in activities that contribute to the
defense of Japan in cooperation with the SDF (including
bilateral/multilateral exercises but excluding activities
carried out in places when combat activities are currently
occurring). This Article allows very passive and limited
use of weapons to the minimum extent necessary to
protect what can be evaluated as important material
means which constitute the defense capability of Japan
from infringements not amounting to an armed attack.


**(4) Involvement of the Cabinet**
Requests for protection from the U.S. Forces, and other
forces should be deliberated by the NSC prior to the
decision by the Minister of Defense in the following
cases. However, in urgent cases, the Minister should
promptly report to the NSC.

-  First request from the U.S Forces and other forces.

-  Request for protection in the territory of a third

country.

-  Other requests deemed particularly important.

In addition, in case it is recognized that an asset

protection is necessary in Important Influence Situations,
the Basic Plan which stipulates its necessity should be
approved by the Cabinet upon the deliberation in the
NSC.

**See** Part III, Chapter 2, Section 2-4 (Asset Protection for the U.S.

Forces and Other Forces); Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1-2-1

**2 �International Peace Cooperation Assignments**

The International Peace Cooperation Act[22] is aimed
at active contribution by Japan to international peace
efforts centered on the United Nations. The Act serves
to set forth a framework for the implementation of
International Peace Cooperation Assignments so
that Japan can promptly make contribution to United
Nations Peacekeeping Operations (UN PKO)[23] and
Internationally Coordinated Operations for Peace
and Security.[24] The Act also sets forth procedures for
taking measures to extend contributions in kind to these
operations.

includes introduction of active cyber defense in cases
where there is a threat of a serious cyber attack that
does not necessarily lead to an armed attack but raises
national security concerns.

In FY2024, projects are being planned to implement

policies to ensure cybersecurity of information systems of

**3** **Communication and Cooperation with**

**Relevant Countries**

**(1) United States**
As a result of a comprehensive review of what measures
Japan should take to ensure the safe navigation of Japanrelated vessels in the Middle East, Japan has started to
implement efforts as Japan’s independent initiative without
participating in the International Maritime Security
Construct led by the United States, considering the need
for ensuring a stable supply of crude oil, relations with the
United States and relations with Iran. At the same time,
to ensure safe navigation in the Middle East region, the
SDF has been cooperating closely with the United States
in various ways. In the information gathering activities,
the SDF will also appropriately cooperate with the United
States as an ally, while observing the government’s policy
of conducting navigation safety measures independently
from any other country’s initiatives. For this reason, an
MSDF officer has been dispatched to the U.S. Central
Naval Command in Bahrain as a liaison officer to share
information with the U.S. Forces.

In addition, in November 2023, when a ballistic missile

was launched from the Houthi-controlled area of Yemen
toward the Gulf of Aden at the time of the temporary
hijacking of the Liberian-flagged tanker Central Park
operated by a British company, the U.S. promptly shared
information with Japan about the launch.


Crew members of DAPE engaged in information gathering activities

In the Middle East, high tensions persist and, based
on the fact that each country is continuing its own
activities, including the “International Maritime Security
Construct” by the United States and other countries, since
2020, the Japanese Government has been extending the
SDF’s activity period by about one year every year.

In light of the need to ensure the safety of navigation

for Japan-related vessels, if it is deemed before the
expiration of the period that activities by the SDF are no
longer necessary, then, in addition to concluding these
activities at that point and without waiting for the end
of the activity period, the National Security Council will
consider how to respond if there is a significant change
in the situation.

It is important to gain the understanding of the coastal
states, including Iran, regarding the information gathering
activities that Japan is undertaking as an independent
initiative and Japan has been explaining these activities
to them with transparency. In addition, the coastal states
play an important role in ensuring safe navigation in
the Middle East region. Japan has been reaching out to
the coastal states to gain their understanding of Japan’s
efforts.

whether unmanned aerial vehicles can in future serve as
replacements for some of its missions, such as monitoring
and surveillance currently conducted by piloted aircraft.
With this background, MSDF will further promote the
study, such as planning to verify its takeoff and landing
at the MSDF’s Kanoya Air Base (Kagoshima Prefecture)
after April 2024, for full-scale introduction of unmanned
aerial vehicle in the future. The MSDF and JCG have
been sharing information acquired by unmanned aerial
vehicles as required and will continue to promote
measures to further strengthen cooperation.

Besides, in December 2022, in order to reinforce such

capabilities as constant surveillance, etc., ASDF newly
organized the Reconnaissance Group which operates
RQ-4B (Global Hawk) aircraft in ASDF Misawa Air
Base (Aomori Prefecture). In June 2023, the third Global
Hawk arrived, completing the initial planned structure.

In recent years around Japan, Chinese military vessels

have become increasingly active in the waters around
the Senkaku Island, and China Coast Guard vessels have


repeatedly intruded into Japan s territorial waters around
the Senkaku Islands. In addition, Chinese military vessels
navigate in the Japan’s territorial and contiguous waters.
Additionally, the aircraft carriers of the PLA have also
continued their activities and in April 2023, three ships,
including the aircraft carrier “Shandong” were confirmed as
navigating in the waters around Hateruma Island (Okinawa
Prefecture). This was the first time that the “Shandong”
was confirmed navigating in the Pacific Ocean.

Furthermore, it was confirmed that after implementing

various exercises in the Sea of Japan in July 2023,
Chinese and Russian military vessels had jointly
navigated in the waters near Japan, such as passing
through the Soya Strait and the waters between Okinawa
Island and Miyako Island (Okinawa Prefecture) from
late July to August.

The Ministry of Defense (MOD)/Self-Defense Forces

(SDF) will continue to take all measures, including
monitoring and surveillance, with a strong sense of
urgency to staunchly protect Japan’s territorial land,

the SDF will also respond through maritime security
operations and public security operations in coordination
with the JCG. In the event of an armed attack by other
countries, the SDF will respond through defense
operations, which are its main duty. As the situation in the

**(1) General Situation**
To never tolerate unilateral changes to the status quo
by force, it is important for the related organizations to
cooperate to take action based on decision-making by the
Government as a whole during peacetime. For this reason,
the Government as a whole will conduct simulations
and integrated training and exercises to improve the
effectiveness of responses, while establishing coordination
procedures on a regular basis. In addition, with regard to
the protection of critical facilities such as nuclear power
plants and response to infringements that do not lead to
external armed attacks or armed attack situations in areas
surrounding remote islands, Japan will conduct training
and exercises between the police, JCG and the MOD/SDF

**Chapter**


**(1) Basic Concept**
With respect to foreign submarines navigating underwater
in Japan’s territorial waters,[7] an order for maritime
security operations will be issued. The submarine will
be requested to navigate on the surface of the water and
show its flag, in accordance with international law and
in the event that the submarine does not comply with
the request, the SDF will request it to leave Japan’s
territorial waters.


-----

**(2) Response by the MOD/SDF**
The MSDF is maintaining and enhancing capabilities
for: expressing its intention not to permit any navigation
that violates international law; and responding in shallow
water areas by detecting, identifying and tracking foreign
submarines navigating under the territorial waters of
Japan.

In November 2004, the MSDF observed a submerged

Chinese nuclear-powered submarine navigating under
Japanese territorial waters around the Sakishima Islands
(Okinawa Prefecture). In response to this incident, the
MSDF issued an order for maritime security operations
and continued to track the submarine with MSDF vessels
until it entered the high seas. In addition, in January 2018,
underwater navigation by a Chinese submarine was
confirmed for the first time through Japan’s contiguous
zone in the vicinity of the Senkaku Islands (Okinawa
Prefecture).

Furthermore, on September 2021, a submarine

presumed to be Chinese was confirmed to be navigating
underwater through the Japanese contiguous zone in
the vicinity of Amami Oshima Island (Kagoshima
Prefecture) and monitoring and surveillance operations
were carried out by MSDF destroyers and patrol aircraft.
Although this submarine did not intrude into territorial
waters, such submarine activity should be closely
monitored by Japan. Under international law, a foreign
submarine must display its flag while navigating in
the territorial waters of a coastal state. The SDF will
maintain a vigilant monitoring and surveillance posture
to ensure that activities in violation of international law
are not permitted.

vessels (unidentified vessels). However, in the event
that it is deemed extremely difficult or impossible for
the JCG to respond to a situation, an order for maritime
security operations will be issued and the situation will
be handled by the SDF in cooperation with the JCG.

**(2) Responses by the MOD/SDF**
In light of the lessons learned from the cases of an
unidentified vessel off the Noto Peninsula (Ishikawa
Prefecture) in 1999, an unidentified vessel in the sea
southwest of Kyushu in 2001 and other similar incidents,
the MOD/SDF have been making various efforts. In
particular, the MSDF has been taking steps such as
establishment of the MSDF Special Boarding Unit[8] and
equipment of destroyers with machine guns. In addition,
based on “the manual for jointly dealing with suspicious
vessels” formulated by the then Defense Agency and the
JCG in 1999, the MSDF has regularly conducted joint
training with the JCG to strengthen coordination.

stand-off missiles with various different characteristics,
forcing the opponent to make a complex response. In
addition, the MOD/SDF will, while acquiring necessary

**KEY WORD**

**Stand-off Defense Capabilities**

The capabilities to deal with naval vessels and landing forces that
invade our country, including islands, from outside the threat zone. To
conduct anti-ship and anti-ground attacks from outside the threat zone,
these capabilities include guided missiles with a longer range and high
survivability, capable of avoiding interception and effectively disrupting an
attack on Japan while ensuring the safety of SDF personnel.


domestic manufacturing system of made-in-Japan standoff missiles to acquire necessary and sufficient quantities
as soon as possible. Further, the MOD/SDF will promote
initiatives to secure a series of functions necessary to
operate stand-off missiles, including the collection of
targeting information and command and control. After
building a practical operational capability for standoff missiles, the MOD/SDF will accelerate research,
development and mass production initiatives and swiftly
acquire the capability to operate more advanced standoff missiles.

Specifically, in FY2023, the MOD/SDF began the

mass production of Upgraded Type-12 SSM (surfacelaunched variant) for early deployment to troops. The
initial plan was to deploy them in FY2026, but this has
been accelerated by one year and the deployment is to
begin in FY2025. Further, to ensure survivability, the

development of Upgraded Type-12 SSM (surface-, shipand air-launched variants) is continuing so that they can
be launched from various platforms (ground, naval ship
and aircraft). With their delivery expected to begin in
FY2026, the mass production of hyper velocity gliding
projectiles for the defense of remote islands began in
FY2023 and the research project continues. In addition,
the development of Upgraded hyper-velocity gliding
projectiles for the defense of remote islands, which began
in FY2023, continues. Further, research into hypersonic
missiles[3] has been conducted since FY2023. From
FY2024, their manufacturing system has been expanded
to acquire mass production and others from an early stage
and in an effort to extend the range of various guided

**(2) Strengthening of Unmanned Defense Capabilities**
Compared to manned equipment, unmanned assets
have major advantages, such as minimizing casualties
and allowing for long-term continuous operation.
Furthermore, combining these unmanned assets with
artificial intelligence (AI) and manned equipment can
be a game-changer that fundamentally transforms force
structure and ways of warfare, enabling Japan to gain
asymmetrical superiority in the air, sea and underwater
domains.

For this reason, these unmanned assets will be

effectively utilized not only for information gathering
and monitoring and surveillance, but also for a wide
range of missions including combat support.

The acquisition of RQ-4B (Global Hawk) began in

FY2015 to enhance the constant surveillance capability
over a wide area and the third RQ-4B arrived at ASDF
Misawa Air Base (Aomori Prefecture) in June 2023,
completing the initially planned system. In addition,
since May 2023, a MQ-9B (Sea Guardian) has been
on trial operation at the Hachinohe Air Base (Aomori
Prefecture) of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force
(MSDF) and from April 2024, its takeoffs and landings
are to be verified at the Kanoya Air Base (Kagoshima
Prefecture) of the MSDF.

Other demonstrations are underway for transport

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and reconnaissance
UAV (for mid-range) (upgrading) with upgraded
capabilities. In February 2024, transport UAV were used
to demonstrate the transportation of supplies to the ship.

In the FY2024 budget, the MOD/SDF will acquire

upgraded UAV (for mid-range)[6] to enhance intelligence,
surveillance, reconnaissance and targeting (ISRT)
capabilities as well as obtaining USV with proven
operational records in various countries as test equipment
to quickly acquire knowledge of unmanned surface
vehicles (USV) operations and promote the development
of domestically produced USV. The MOD/SDF will also
conduct research into multi-purpose combat-support
USV with low observability that selectively carry
functions such as monitoring and surveillance and antiship missile launch to support manned naval vessels. In
addition, the MOD/SDF will begin to develop unmanned
amphibious vehicles, as unmanned assets capable of
landing on any shore of islands, transporting supplies


LOA signing ceremony to advance Tomahawk acquisition (January 2024)

missiles. Besides, while utilizing the ground equipment
of Upgraded Type-12 SSM, the MOD/SDF will begin to
develop new stand-off missiles with improved anti-ship
and anti-surface capabilities, such as long-range flying
performance, precision guidance performance, etc.

As well as acquiring mass-produced ammunition

for these domestically produced stand-off missiles, the
introduction of foreign-made stand-off missiles will be
implemented and continued.

In this case, given a certain amount of time required to

maintain the necessary quantity of domestically produced
stand-off missiles, the U.S.-made Tomahawk, which is
already in mass production, are to be acquired as soon
as possible. The initial plan was to acquire up to 400
Tomahawks from Block V[4] in FY2026 and FY2027, but
given the more severe security environment, negotiations
were held with the U.S. side to accelerate the acquisition.
As a result, some Block V will be changed to Block IV,[5]
which will be acquired from FY2025, one year earlier
than originally planned and by adding Tomahawk launch
capabilities to naval vessels and promoting personnel
training, sufficient capabilities will be swiftly secured
before establishing a system to boost the production of
domestically produced stand-off missiles.

In terms of command and control, the MOD/SDF

plans to promote the development of functions, such
as those necessary to smoothly implement centralized
command activities, with stand-off missile operations as
the core.

and performing other missions from the sea to ground
units.

Japan is also co-developing the next-generation

fighter aircraft with the United Kingdom and Italy,
aiming to complete its development by 2035 and also
planning to begin developing UAV that will collaborate
with this next-generation fighter aircraft and support
it autonomously. In December 2023, Japan and the
United States agreed to conduct joint research into AI
technology, which is expected to be applied to this UAV.
Japan will cooperate with the United States and other
countries concerned to enhance its unmanned asset
defense capabilities.

**(3) Strengthening of Mobile Deployment Capabilities**
Given the geographical characteristics of Japan, which
stretches 3,000 km from east to west, north to south and
includes numerous islands, for responding to an invasion
of Japan, Japan needs to build the capacity to ensure that
its routinely deployed units remain operational at all
times and that the necessary units (personnel, equipment,
supplies, etc.) are swiftly maneuvered and deployed


and air superiority and disrupt the access and landing of
units invading Japan.

To this end, Japan will reinforce the SDF’s maritime

and air transportation capabilities by acquiring various
transportation assets such as transport vessels, transport
aircraft, transport helicopters, etc. and also maximize
its use of civilian transportation capabilities, including
Private Finance Initiatives (PFI).

Specifically, the SDF Maritime Transport Group

(tentative name) will be newly formed as a joint unit
to improve the capability of mobile deployment to the
southwest region. Moreover, the acquisition of transport
assets like transport ships and helicopters, etc. to be used
for rapid transport of troops and supplies to the islands in
the southwestern region and elsewhere will be promoted.
Furthermore, PFI vessels will continue to be secured to
avoid creating a vacuum in the transportation system
utilizing civilian vessels and the integrated transportation
system will be strengthened by using civilian vessels.

In addition, to ensure smoother and more effective

transport and supplies for units by the aforementioned
capabilities, Japan will strengthen its integrated logistics


infrastructure to make this possible, to secure maritime seaport facilities and the like as operational infrastructure

in the future.

With regard to the operation of the GSDF V-22

(Ospreys), the MOD/SDF has determined that Saga
Airport is the best airfield for deployment and the
governor of Saga Prefecture expressed acceptance of
this arrangement. In May 2023, the MOD/SDF signed
a real estate purchase contract with the Saga Prefecture
fishery cooperative federation and acquired the planned
camp location.[7]

The MOD/SDF began construction of the GSDF

Camp Saga (tentative name) in June 2023 and will
continue to work on the early deployment of the GSDF
Ospreys to a site adjacent to Saga Airport in an effort to
strengthen capabilities for the defense of remote islands,
which is an urgent issue, thereby establishing a structure
that enables integrated operation with the Amphibious
Rapid Deployment Brigade located in Sasebo City,
Nagasaki Prefecture and others.

On the other hand, the MOD/SDF has newly created

an airlift wing equipped with V-22 Ospreys at Camp
Kisarazu (Chiba Prefecture) in 2020 or later with
consideration of the time needed to deploy the aircraft
to Saga Airport and has begun provisional deployment
of V-22 Ospreys.

**See**

(Commentary: Counterstrike Capabilities)

**(2) Responses by the MOD/SDF**
Cases involving ballistic missiles launched against Japan
as an armed attack will be dealt with by issuing a defense
operation order for armed attack situations. On the other
hand, if such a situation is not yet acknowledged as
an armed attack, Japan will take destructive measures
against ballistic missiles, etc.

Currently, Japan’s ballistic missile defense (BMD)

is basically an effective multi-layered defense system
with the upper tier interception by Aegis-equipped
destroyers and the lower tier by PAC (Patriot Advanced


Capability) 3, both interconnected and coordinated
by the Japan Aerospace Defense Ground Environment
(JADGE).[12]

As a response against ballistic missiles, the Joint Task

Force-BMD will be formed with the Commander of the
Air Defense Command serving as its Commander and
effective defenses will be taken under a unified command
through JADGE.

North Korea has forcefully conducted three nuclear

tests since 2016. Especially since the beginning of 2022,
North Korea has repeatedly launched ballistic missiles

also confirmed that the object launched in November
was now orbiting the Earth. In response, the MOD/SDF
issued a shoot-down order for ballistic missiles, etc.,[13]
deployed PAC-3 units in Okinawa Prefecture and took
other necessary measures to prepare for any contingency.
In addition, the MOD promptly shared information
about the launches with the government of Japan and
related agencies and has taken other measures including
collecting and analyzing related information.

The MOD/SDF continues to carefully monitor

the concrete actions of North Korea toward the
dismantlement of weapons of mass destruction and
missiles and conducts the necessary collection and
analyses of information, monitoring and surveillance
activities and other necessary activities while closely
cooperating with the United States and other countries.

Further cooperation with the U.S. Government

including the U.S. Forces in Japan is essential for
efficient and effective operation of the BMD system.
Thus, related measures including constant real-time
sharing of BMD operational and relevant information
and the expansion of BMD cooperation have been agreed
upon at the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee
(2+2 Meeting).

Furthermore, Japan has closely cooperated with the

United States in responding to ballistic missiles, by
means such as receiving Shared Early Warning (SEW)[14]
from the U.S. Forces and sharing intelligence gathered
by assets including transportable BMD radar (TPY-2
radar) and Aegis-equipped destroyers deployed in Japan
by the U.S. Forces.

**(3) Initiatives to Reinforce Integrated Air and Missile**

**Defense Capabilities**

Japan began developing the BMD system in 2004 to be
fully prepared for the response against ballistic missile
attacks and other attacks and necessary amendments
were subsequently made to the Self-Defense Forces Law
in July 2005. To date, Japan has steadily built up its own
defense system against ballistic missile attacks, by such
means as installing ballistic missile defense capability
to the Aegis-equipped destroyers and deploying PAC-3.


To deal with future threats posed by increasingly

advanced and diverse ballistic missile attacks, Japan
and the United States have jointly developed advanced
interceptor missiles for BMD (SM-3 Block IIA),[15] the
successor to Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IA to be
mounted on Aegis-equipped destroyers and acquired
them since FY2017.

In addition, the interception capabilities of SM-3

Block IIA have been enhanced against ballistic missiles
equipped with interception avoidance measures such as
a decoy and ballistic missiles launched with an intention
to avoid being intercepted by taking a higher than normal
trajectory (lofted trajectory).[16] In November 2022, the
MSDF conducted its first SM-3 Block IIA launch test
and the Aegis destroyer Maya successfully intercepted
the target.

Furthermore, the Cabinet approved the development

of two Aegis system-equipped vessels instead of the
land-based Aegis system (Aegis Ashore) in December
2020, to respond more flexibly and effectively to the
increasingly severe security environment surrounding
Japan. These vessels are to be maintained by the MSDF,
which will have capabilities equivalent to or above
those of the most advanced Aegis-equipped destroyers,
such as SM-3 Block IIA for ballistic missiles and SM-6
for HGVs, etc. and have improved seaworthiness and
habitability while reducing manpower. The construction
of these vessels is to begin in FY 2024.

With regard to PAC-3, the MOD has been working

for procurement of the enhanced capability type, PAC3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) and started its
deployment at the end of FY2019. Introduction of PAC3 MSE will realize the extension of interception altitude
from less than 20 km to tens of km, meaning that the
coverage of protection (area) will expand more than
twice compared to the conventional PAC-3.

On the other hand, to use optimum means to

effectively and efficiently counter airborne threats,
which are growing increasingly diverse, complex
and enhanced including the emergence of HGV and
minimize damage, it is necessary to establish a structure
to conduct integrated operation of various equipment for
missile defense and air defense equipment that each SDF

**(2) Japan U.S. BMD Technical Cooperation, etc.**
The Government commenced a Japan-U.S. cooperative
technical research project on a sea-based upper-tier
system in FY1999. In FY2006, Japan-U.S. cooperative
development[19] of advanced interceptor missiles for BMD
began, leading to the deployment of SM-3 Block IIA.

In addition, at the Japan-U.S. “2+2” meeting in January

2023, the two countries agreed several matters including
beginning discussions on potential joint development of
a future interceptor.

Based on this, Japan and the United States decided to

jointly engage in developing a Glide Phase Interceptor
(GPI) as an asset that will help ensure intercept
opportunities and secure interception by dealing with
HGVs as far away as possible.

controls are maintained. Based on these circumstances, it was decided that the prior consent of Japan could be given to the third party transfer of the SM-3 Block IIA under certain
conditions. This decision was formally announced in the Joint Statement of the Japan-U.S. “2+2” in June 2011. The Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology

If an armed attack is carried out against Japan, which
is an island country, aerial attacks are expected to be
combined with attacks against our ships and territory by
enemy destroyers. In addition, transport vessels could
be deployed to enable massive enemy ground forces to
invade our territory. Our defense operations protecting
the waters surrounding Japan are composed of measures
at sea, measures in waters around our coasts, measures
in major straits and aerial defense above waters around
Japan. We will protect the waters around our country
by combining these multiple operations, blocking the
invasion of our enemies and attacking and depleting
their combat capabilities.

Accordingly, the construction of new FFM with

**21 The act of systematically monitoring a specific area with the purpose of gathering information and intelligence to prevent a surprise attack by an opposing force.ii**


-----

Formulated based on the Basic Space Act, the Basic

Plan on Space Policy is the most fundamental plan for
space development and utilization in Japan and aims
to strengthen the comprehensive infrastructure that
supports Japan’s space activities.

The Space Security Initiative states that the goal of

space security is for Japan, together with its allies, likeminded countries and others, to maintain the stable use of
and free access to outer space, while promoting national
peace and prosperity and the safety and security of its
people through outer space. It also states that, based on
the needs of the MOD/SDF, government research and
development will be actively linked to the fundamental
strengthening of defense capabilities by using

government research and also developing advanced
technologies conducted by government agencies for
defense purposes as well.

Subsequently, in October of the same year, based

on the Space Security Initiative and others, a publicprivate council on strengthening the stability of the space
system was established to first accurately identify and
analyze the situation, then respond appropriately through
public-private cooperation in the event of an unforeseen
space-related incident. Additionally, in March 2024,
issues related to the maintenance and development of
the technological, industrial and human resource base
across the security and civilian sectors were examined
to identify technologies for which Japan should promote
development and then the Space Technology Strategy,
including a technology roadmap indicating a timeline to
develop such technologies, was formulated.

In addition, led by the Cabinet Office’s National

Space Policy Secretariat, which is in charge of planning,
formulating and coordinating policies for the utilization


of space development for the entire government, space
policy is being promoted based on Space Activities
Act,[23] Remote Sensing Data Act[24] and Space Resources
Act[25].

**2** **Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**


In the space domain, the MOD/SDF will further reinforce
Japan’s operational capabilities in the ground, maritime
and air domains by actively incorporating novel forms
of space utilization, including satellite constellations
and providing functions such as information gathering,
communications and positioning from space. At the same
time, to counter threats to the stable utilization of space,
surveillance capabilities from space will be developed
and a Space Domain Awareness (SDA)[26] system will
be established and the resiliency of Japan’s space assets
will be bolstered to allow missions to be continued in
response to various situations. In addition, the MOD/SDF
will further reinforce capabilities to disrupt opponents’
command and control, and telecommunication, etc.

Furthermore, the MOD/SDF will strengthen

cooperation and collaboration, including research and
development, with related organizations and private
businesses, including the Japan Aerospace Exploration
Agency (JAXA). They will also strengthen cooperation
in areas such as human resource development through
exchanges with our ally and like-minded countries such
as the United States.

communications requirements and to further strengthen
resiliency, the MOD is aiming for a system of three
X-band defense communications satellites by launching
Kirameki-3 in FY2024. The MOD will also procure
more receiver equipment and enhance broadband
ground station communications to expand equipment
and related ground facilities capable of communicating
with Kirameki.

Further, the MOD will develop and produce the next
generation defense communications satellite, which will
succeed the 1st and 2nd satellites and conduct technical
demonstrations regarding technologies and others with

**(1) Improvement of Capabilities by Leveraging**

**Space Domain Including Information-Gathering,**
**Communications and Positioning**

**A. Information Gathering**
With regard to information gathering, the MOD/SDF will
build a seamless information gathering system through
acquisition of multilayered satellite images, such as
by using Information Gathering Satellites (IGS),[27] and
civilian satellites such as small satellite constellations
that enable frequent imaging. In particular, from the
perspective of ensuring the effectiveness of Japan’s standoff defense capabilities, it is necessary to fundamentally
strengthen our information gathering capabilities. In
addition to strengthening cooperation with the United
States, Japan will build a satellite constellation to acquire
the capability to detect and track targets, which will be
supplemented by various initiatives, including the use of
civilian satellites.
**B. Communications**
Regarding communications, the MOD currently owns
and operates X-band defense communications satellites
called Kirameki-1 and Kirameki-2 to use them for
information and communications such as command
and control, which is extremely important for unit

Satellite System (QZSS)[28] of the Cabinet Office started
service in November 2018. With this in mind, the MOD/
SDF will secure redundancy[29] by using positioning
signals, including those of QZSS.
**D. Response to HGV Detection and Tracking, etc.**
Small satellite constellations are attracting attention
as a technological trend related to missile detection,
tracking functions and others. The MOD believes
that infrared observation from space using satellite
constellations may be effective as a means of early
detection and tracking of HGVs being developed and
deployed by various countries and will, while considering
the possibility of collaboration with the United States,
utilize the space demonstration platform planned for the
new H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV-X) to conduct space
demonstrations of infrared sensors and other equipment.

In addition, the MOD will promote research on future

sensors, such as high-sensitivity wideband infrared
detection elements.


**(2) Efforts to Ensure Stable Utilization of Space**
While utilization of satellites plays a vital role as the
basic infrastructure for security, some countries appear
to be developing anti-satellite weapons, including killer
satellites, anti-satellite missiles and jamming weapons
that interfere with electromagnetic waves.

In addition, the rapid increase in debris from anti
satellite destruction experiments and the emergence of
satellite constellations are causing orbital congestion.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the resiliency of
SDA and space utilization.

The MOD/SDF have been working to strengthen their

capabilities to secure superiority in space utilization. As
part of these efforts, they have been working to enhance
Space Situational Awareness[30] (SSA). Going forward,
the MOD/SDF will continue to strengthen SSA, which
enables learning the position, orbit and other information
of space objects, while also working to enhance SDA,
which enables grasping the operational status, aims and
capabilities of satellites.

In FY2023, the MOD/SDF began the production of

the SDA satellite (scheduled to be launched in FY2026).

In addition, various initiatives, including a study on

the further operation of more than one SDA satellite, will
be promoted. Moreover, the MOD/SDF will develop a
space operations command and control system, etc.

ordinary stationary satellites stay in circular orbit on the equator. Multiple satellites are usually launched since a single satellite cannot stay online for 24 hours by itself. Users are able to
receive signals from such satellites without being affected by obstacles, such as mountains and buildings, since the satellites pass nearly right above the users.

activities, and it also plays an important role in command and control
as well as intelligence in the defense field while there are growing
threats for stable space utilization, such as increasing space debris
and the existence of so-called “killer satellites.” Our mission is to
understand what is happening in space to cope with these threats.

“Space Domain Awareness” sounds like a grand image of

something seen in science fiction movies, but in reality, it involves
down-to-earth tasks, such as analyzing and evaluating orbital
information that is based on huge amounts of data, such as sensor
data. We also cooperate with JAXA, the space forces of the ally and
like-minded countries, and others to understand the vast domain of
space, and I feel that I am growing every day with new discoveries A work scene in the 1st Space Operations Squadron


to strengthen the operational infrastructure for space
operations.

With regard to the strengthening of resiliency of space

utilization, Japan will ensure resiliency against jamming
and other interference through the demonstration
of technology with enhanced resiliency for satellite
communications and will also ensure cybersecurity
for SSA systems, etc. towards future Japan-U.S. space
system cooperation. In addition, Japan will build
capabilities to disrupt C4I of opponents in coordination
with the electromagnetic domain.

**See** Fig. III-1-4-11 (Initiatives for Developing the Space Domain

Awareness (SDA) System)

**See**


**(3) Strengthening of Organizational Systems**
To strengthen the Space Domain Mission Units, in
FY2023, the 1st Space Operations Squadron (Fuchu)
and the 2nd Space Operations Squadron (Hofu Kita)
responsible for sustainment and maintenance of spacerelated equipment, etc. under the Space Operations
Group were newly organized. In FY2024, the system for
stable operation of equipment for SDA will continue to
be strengthened through expansion of personnel.

In addition, as securement of the stable utilization

of space becomes vital, the MOD/SDF will promote
the development of the SDA system to ensure space

capabilities through the establishment of new Space
Domain Mission Units under the command of a
general and other measures. For this, given the growing
importance of the space domain and the qualitative and
quantitative improvements that will be made to its space
operation capabilities, the ASDF shall be renamed the
Japan Air and Space Self-Defense Force in view of the
future positioning of space operations alongside air
operations as its core tasks.

To strengthen the organizational systems and

human resources base in the space field, Japan will
continue to strengthen cooperation, including human
resources development, through exchanges with related
organizations such as JAXA as well as our ally and likeminded countries such as the United States. Japan will
also work to secure human resources in the space domain,
including the establishment of a system to effectively
utilize knowledge of the space field accumulated among
relevant ministries and agencies.

**(4) Strengthening of Cooperation with Related**

**Organizations and Space-Related Industries**

With regard to outer space, it is of vital importance
for both the lives of Japanese citizens and defense to
ensure stable utilization of space for purposes such as
information gathering, communications and positioning.

collaboration, including research and development, with
related organizations including JAXA and the private
businesses with regard to outer space. In doing so, the
MOD/SDF will promote investment in technological
development in the private sector by further utilizing
civilian technology in the defense field and enhance
Japan’s overall capabilities in space.

In addition, in March 2023, with the start of the

operation of the SSA system, the MOD began providing
information on SSA, including orbit information on
space objects, to the private businesses and others that
operate satellites.

Furthermore, in October 2023, the ASDF opened the

Space Collaboration & Innovation Office in a private
shared office to actively exchanging opinions with private
space operators and for other purposes. The ASDF will
station several ASDF personnel in this office and reflect
knowledge gained in future equipment introduction and
from other activities.

Working at the Space Collaboration & Innovation Office (6 members of ASO on the right)


announcements were made by Canada, New Zealand,
Germany, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Korea,
Australia, France and others.

Furthermore, at a plenary session of the U.N. General

Assembly held in December of the same year, under the
leadership of the United States, 11 countries, including
Japan, made a joint proposal for not conducting the
“Direct-Ascent Anti-SATellite (DA-ASAT) missile
testing” resolution, which was adopted at the plenary
session of the UN General Assembly with the support of
155 countries.

At the same time, to avoid risks from misunderstanding

and miscalculation, it is necessary to communicate the
importance of strengthening communication among
relevant countries and of implementing Transparency
and Confidence Building Measures (TCBM) in outer
space.
**A. Cooperation with the United States**
From the perspective of further promoting cooperation
in the space domain between the defense authorities of
Japan and the United States, the two countries established
the Japan-U.S. Space Cooperation Working Group
(SCWG) at the Deputy Director General level in April
2015. The SCWG holds wide-ranging talks on space
cooperation, including collaboration on space policy
and strategy, cooperation between U.S. and Japanese
space operations forces including SDA informationsharing and education and discussions on LEO satellite
constellations. Meetings of the SCWG have been held
nine times through now, most recently in July 2023.

In addition, the Japanese and U.S. governments hold

the Japan-U.S. Comprehensive Space Dialogue (CSD)
and the Japanese and U.S. security authorities hold
the Japan-U.S. Space Security Dialogue (SSD). The
MOD participates in these meetings, in which there are
exchanges of information regarding the space policies
of both countries as well as discussions on future
cooperation.

With regard to recent high-level exchanges, in the

Japan-U.S. “2+2” meeting in January 2023, both sides
confirmed that they consider attacks to, from, or within
space present a clear challenge to the security of the
Alliance and that such attacks, in certain circumstances,
could lead to the invocation of Article V of the JapanU.S. Security Treaty. In addition, in September 2023,
General Saltzman, the Chief of Space Operations, United
States Space Force, paid a courtesy call on Defense

essential to strengthen cooperation with our ally, likeminded countries and others. Japan is also conducting
cooperation towards reducing space threats through
norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors in
space. In September 2022, Japan decided not to conduct
satellite destruction testing with destructive, directascent missiles, with the intention of actively promoting
discussions in the international arena towards the
formation of norms for responsible behaviors in outer
space. This decision was announced in response to an
announcement to the same effect by the United States

MOD/SDF will protect itself from all cyber threats
with its high level of cybersecurity capabilities and also
will use these capabilities to strengthen the national
cybersecurity as a whole.

To this end, the MOD/SDF will establish a posture

that can protect its command and control capabilities as
well as its high-priority equipment systems even under
cyber attacks[31] along with a posture for supporting cyber
defense for the defense industry by FY2027.

By approximately ten years from now, the MOD/SDF

will have established a posture to safeguard its command
and control capabilities, force projection capabilities
and operational bases to assure missions to be executed
even under cyber attacks and strengthened its posture for
supporting the cybersecurity of entities other than the
SDF.

**1** **The Whole-of-Government Initiatives**

Based on the National Security Strategy (NSS), the
government of Japan as a whole intends to improve
its response capabilities in the field of cybersecurity to
the same level or higher than those of major Western
countries, including the introduction of active cyber
defense in cases where there is a threat of a serious cyber
attack that does not necessarily lead to an armed attack
but raises security concerns.

In FY2024, among others, projects are being

planned focusing on policies to ensure cybersecurity
of information systems of government agencies, etc. In
addition, the National center of Incident readiness and
Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) is to be fundamentally
strengthened.

**See** Section 1-2-3 (Cybersecurity)

**See**


**2** **Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**

The cyber domain is not only core infrastructure in
the daily lives of the people of Japan, but also of vital
importance for carrying out cross-domain operations to
defend Japan.

In light of the severe situation in cyberspace in recent

years, the NSS calls for the introduction of active cyber
defense to prevent, as far as possible, a serious cyberattack
that does not necessarily lead to armed attacks but raises
security concerns and prevent the spread of damage if
such an attack has occurred.

The MOD/SDF will coordinate with whole-of
government initiatives in the field of cybersecurity,
including active cyber defense. In doing so, the MOD/
SDF will achieve a high level of cybersecurity by
shifting to a posture where persistent risk management

**B. Utilization of Private-sector Human Resources**
The MOD/SDF recruits those with cybersecurity
expertise and experience as uniformed SDF personnel
and technical defense officials, and also promotes
personnel exchanges between the public and private
sectors.

In addition, since July 2021, the MOD/SDF has been

hiring personnel with advanced knowledge and skills
as well as abundant experience and achievements in
the cyber domain as “Chief Cybersecurity Advisor.” In
addition, the MOD/SDF is also working on a publicprivate personnel exchange system to employ people
with practical experience in the private sector, as well
as utilizing external personnel through service contracts
and other means. Since 2021, the Ministry of Defense
Cyber Contest has been held with the aim of uncovering
talented individuals with cybersecurity expertise.

Additionally, since 2022, the MOD/SDF has been

hiring the candidates for SDF reserve personnel equipped
with cybersecurity skills.

**(2) Security Enhancement**
**A. Introduction of Latest Architecture**
As threats in the cyber domain are becoming more
advanced and sophisticated every day, Japan has shifted
its approach to information system security measures
from temporary “risk elimination” to continuous
“risk management,” and has implemented from
FY2023 the Risk Management Framework (RMF),
which continuously analyzes and evaluates risks and
implements necessary security measures even after the
start of the information system operation.

Additionally, the MOD/SDF will transition from

the traditional idea that perimeter security is sufficient
to maintain the organization’s network safety and will
promote the introduction of the new security functions
based on the “Zero Trust” concept. These will improve
the cybersecurity level of the MOD/SDF and establish
a posture that can promptly detect and respond to any
intrusion into the organization’s network.
**B Security Measures including Equipment and Facility**

**Infrastructure**

To appropriately respond to the latest cyber attack threats,
which are becoming more advanced and sophisticated
every day, it is necessary to strengthen the posture for
protection of information systems. To this end, the MOD/
SDF will develop a cloud system that integrates and
standardizes MOD/SDF systems, implement centralized
cybersecurity measures, strengthen the protective

posture of equipment systems and facility infrastructure
systems and enhance the threat hunting function that
continuously hunts for and detects potential internal
threats based on the assumption that threats have already
penetrated inside the network.
**C Strengthening Defense Industry Cybersecurity**
In March 2022, the MOD/SDF developed the Standards
on Cybersecurity Measures for Defense Industry, the
new information security standards that include the same
level of control measures as NIST SP800-171[33] of U.S.
standards. In response to this, defense-related companies
have been upgrading their information systems since
April 2023.

of knowledge of private sectors, are necessary. In this
context, the MOD/SDF has developed cyber workfore
by continuously and by stages assigned to cyber-related
positions and providing them with both in-house and
external education to acquire and maintain advanced
knowledge and skills.

As general cyber education course for all SDF

services to learn general and advanced knowledge of
cybersecurity has started since FY2019 at then GSDF
Signal School. It is also dispatching personnel to College
of Information and Cyberspace International Fellows at
the National Defense University of the United States and
the U.S. Army’s Coalition Cyber Operations Planner
and establishing a specialized course in system and
cyber engineering at the GSDF High Technical School.
Moreover, in March 2024, the GSDF Signal School was
reorganized into the GSDF System and Signal/Cyber
School and newly established the Cyber Education
Department, expanding the educational infrastructure
for training cyber personnel. In FY 2024, the National
Defense Academy also expanded its cyber literacy
education and reorganized its Department of Information
Engineering to the Department of Cyber and Information
Engineering.

Furthermore, since cybersecurity depends on the

literacy of personnel who use networks and systems, not
just specialized personnel with advanced knowledge, the
MOD/SDF is promoting literacy education for general
SDF personnel.

In terms of research, the MOD/SDF is strengthening

the research structure of the Cyber Security Division
newly established in the National Institute for Defense
Studies in FY2023 and Acquisition, Technology and
Logistics Agency Future Capabilities Development
Center is conducting research into cyber protection
technology for equipment systems to prevent the spread
of damage caused by cyber attacks and enable various
equipment systems to remain in operation in the event
of a cyber attack.

**(4) Cooperation with Private Companies and Other**

**Countries**

To respond to cyber attacks in a swift and appropriate
manner, it is necessary to keep abreast of the latest
information, including cyber-related risks, counter
measures and technological trends, through cooperation
with the private sector and strategic talks, joint training
and other opportunities with allies and other parties. For
thi th MOD/SDF ill ff ti l t


with private companies and foreign countries, including
the United States, which is Japan’s ally.
**a. Cooperation with Private Companies and Others**
In July 2013, the Cyber Defense Council (CDC)
was set up with its members consisting of around ten
companies in the defense industry with a high interest
in cybersecurity. With the MOD serving as the hub for
information sharing among companies in the defense
industry, information is aggregated and efforts are made
to grasp the overall picture of cyber attacks. In addition, a
joint training takes place annually, simulating a situation
where the MOD/SDF and defense industry are under
cyber attacks as part of efforts to improve both of their
cyber response capabilities.
**b. Cooperation with the United States**
To strengthen the foundation that supports effective
Japan-U.S. joint responses at all levels, Japan will
further strengthen information sharing at all levels and
fundamentally strengthen efforts related to information
security and cybersecurity to enable both Japan and the
United States to fully exercise their capabilities.

In October 2013, the Japanese and U.S. governments

set up the Cyber Defense Policy Working Group
(CDPWG) as a framework for policy consultations
between the defense authorities of the two countries. In
this framework, specialized and specific considerations
were conducted on a wide range of fields, such as the
promotion of policy consultations on cyber issues and
closer information sharing.

The Guidelines and the CDPWG Joint Statement

published in 2015 cited the prompt and appropriate
establishment of an information sharing structure and
the protection of the critical infrastructure upon which

as transportation of police officers and provision of
equipment to the police force will be carried out. If the
case cannot be dealt with by the general police force,
then public security operations by the SDF will be
implemented. Furthermore, if it has been confirmed that
an armed attack is being carried out against Japan, the
SDF will respond under a defense operation order.

In addition, in response to ballistic missile attacks,

Aegis ships will be deployed to protect the entire
territory of Japan and PAC-3s of the ASDF, which are
dispersed throughout the country to protect bases, will be
moved and deployed flexibly according to the situation.
Furthermore, Japan would respond to cruise missiles and
the like with various anti-aircraft missiles launched from
aircraft, naval vessels and ground-based assets.

**Special Operations Forces**

Typical forms of attacks by guerrillas or special forces
include the destruction of critical private infrastructure
and other facilities, attacks against people and
assassinations of dignitaries.

In dealing with attacks by guerrillas or special forces,

the MOD/SDF will respond with a particular emphasis
on the establishment of a relevant information gathering
posture, monitoring and surveillance to prevent invasions
in coastal areas, protection of key facilities and search and
destruction of invading guerrillas or special forces. Efforts
will be made for early detection of attacks and indications
through monitoring and surveillance and, as required,
the SDF units will be deployed to protect key facilities,
such as nuclear power plants and the necessary posture
for protection will be established at an early stage. Based
on this, in the event of an infiltration of our territory by

mass casualties and contamination of an extensive area
and the means for transporting such weapons, as well
as related equipment and materials, to terrorists and
countries under suspicion of proliferating such weapons.
The sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in March 1995
is one of the examples of an incident in which these
weapons were used.

In the event of the use of NBC weapons in Japan in

a way that corresponds to an armed attack, the SDF will
conduct defense operations to repel the armed attack and
rescue victims. Furthermore, in the event of the use of
NBC weapons in a way that does not correspond to an
armed attack but against which the general police alone
cannot maintain public security, the SDF will conduct
public security operations to suppress the armed group
and rescue victims in cooperation with related agencies.
Furthermore, when the incident does not fall under
the category of defense operations or public security
operations, the chemical and medical protection units of
the GSDF and other units will cooperate with relevant
organizations in information gathering concerning
the extent of the damage, decontamination activities,
transportation of the sick and injured and medical
activities through disaster relief and civil protection
dispatches.

The MOD/SDF possesses and maintains the GSDF

Central Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC)
Weapon Defense Unit and the Countermeasure Medical
Unit and is also increasing the number of chemical
and medical protection unit personnel, to improve the
capability for responding to NBC weapon attacks. Also,
the GSDF has designated initial response personnel
who remain ready to mobilize quickly in the event of
extraordinary disasters.

The MSDF and the ASDF have also acquired

protective equipment and materials to be used on vessels
and at bases.


While the police assume primary responsibility for
responding to illegal activities of armed agents, the SDF
will respond in accordance with situational developments.
If this happens, it is important for the SDF to cooperate
with the police force. Accordingly, with regard to public
security operations of the SDF, the Basic Agreement[38]
concerning cooperation procedures between the SDF
and the police, as well as local agreements between
GSDF divisions/brigades and prefectural police forces,
have been concluded.[39]

In addition, the GSDF has been conducting joint

field training exercises nationwide with the prefectural
police, in an effort to strengthen such collaboration by
conducting field exercises at the premises of nuclear
power plants throughout the country since 2012.

the perspective that development of evacuation facilities
equipped with the necessary functions to protect the
lives and health of citizens from armed attack situations
where ballistic missiles and the like are used is a measure
for preventing damage and leads to deterrence against
ballistic missile attacks and other attacks.

In March 2024, the government of Japan presented

the basic concept of initiatives to secure necessary
evacuation facilities, including the development of
“Specific Temporary Evacuation Facilities”[40] as solid
evacuation facilities that can be used for a certain period
of time in areas where evacuation would be difficult,
due to reasons such as severely restricted transportation
and no evacuation sites in the vicinity. The Government
also formulated the “Technical Guidelines for Specific
Temporary Evacuation Facilities” to specify the technical
specifications that should be provided and other matters.

**2** **Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**


of civil protection measures utilizing civilian vessels and
aircraft used by the SDF and various SDF transport assets.
The MOD/SDF will also promote various measures such
as strengthening SDF units that can also provide civil
protection and utilizing SDF reserve personnel.

**(2) Daily Collaboration with Local Governments**
The MOD/SDF has established departments responsible
for regular and close liaison and coordination with local
governments and other bodies in its main Headquarters
and Commands as well as in Provincial Cooperation
Offices, etc., and has stationed the Assistant Director for
Civil Protection (civilian official) at the GSDF divisions/
brigade headquarters since FY2023.

Civil protection councils are established in prefectural

and municipal governments for comprehensive

implementation of civil protection measures.

Representatives of each branch of the SDF and Regional
Defense Bureau have been appointed to the councils.

Moreover, local governments are recruiting retired

SDF officers to serve as crisis managers. For example,
they act as coordinators with the MOD/SDF, as well as
developing and implementing joint response plans and
exercises.


**(1) Enhancement of Posture for Civil Protection**
To counter invasions of Japan while protecting the
lives of Japanese citizens, it is imperative for national
government institutions, local governments, public
institutions and private businesses to cooperate and work
together in an integrated manner.

To implement swift evacuation of residents, including

those in the southwestern region, well in advance of an
armed attack, the Government will promptly formulate
plans for smooth evacuation, secure means of public and
private transportation, develop public infrastructure such
as airports and seaports and coordinate its use, secure
various types of evacuation facilities and coordinate with
international organizations. In addition, to enhance the
effectiveness of such efforts, the Government will conduct
and verify various types of training, including evacuation of
residents and then consider necessary measures, including
institutional aspects, while promoting cooperation among
the national government, local governments, designated
public institutions and others.

Moreover, in addition to participating in and

cooperating with these measures, the MOD/SDF will also
coordinate and cooperate in the planned implementation

With regard to Defense Attachés, in FY2023, the MOD,

in order to strengthen intelligence collection in Europe in
light of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, dispatched
one additional Defense Attaché to each country in
Romania, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine, as well as
newly dispatched one in Qatal. In FY2024, the MOD plans
to newly dispatch Defense Attaché to Cambodia, Estonia,
and Sri Lanka, as well as increase the number of Defense
Attachés in Vietnam.

directions including recruitment, education, training
and personnel allocation to strengthen comprehensive
intelligence collection and analysis capabilities.

Furthermore, the MOD/SDF will promote cooperation
and collaboration with relevant domestic organizations
related to intelligence and take necessary measures to
make more effective use of intelligence collected by IGS
in SDF operations.

**3** **DIH**


**(1) Mission of the DIH**
The DIH is the central intelligence agency of the
MOD and the largest intelligence agency of Japan. It
was established in 1997 to develop a framework for
sophisticated and comprehensive intelligence collection
and analysis in the increasingly complicated security
environment following the Cold War. The Headquarters
gathers SIGINT, IMINT, GEOINT, OSINT, etc. and
analyzes international and military situations and other
matters related to Japan’s swiftly changing security
environment.

In addition to intelligence collection and analysis, the

Headquarters is also considered in the National Defense
Strategy (NDS) to play a central role in responding to
Integrated Information Warfare for the defense of Japan
and is to fundamentally strengthen the capabilities
to collect, analyze and disseminate information on
international military situations and other issues.

**(2) Activities of the DIH**
The DIH is an organization consisting of the GSDF,
MSDF and ASDF personnel and administrative and
technical officials (specialized in language, technology,
administration or general office work). The SDF personnel
use the knowledge based on their experience in their own
unit, etc., whereas administrative/technical officials use
their expert knowledge in language, technology and other
fields, to work together for their mission.

Specifically, they conduct comprehensive analysis

on international situations that change day by day from
diverse perspectives, including military, political and
economic factors, based on information received from a
wide range of sources including SIGINT, IMINT, OSINT
(newspapers, internet, etc.) and opinion exchange with
relevant parties.

The DIH is also strengthening information gathering

and analyzing functions in new domains such as space,

b d th l t ti t F


As the character of warfare becomes more rapid and
complex moving forward, to win battles, Japan needs
to establish a system that enables real-time intelligence
sharing by making maximum use of various means,
including artificial intelligence (AI) and further
strengthening the capabilities such as intelligence
collection and analysis capabilities. Japan also needs
to continuously and accurately grasp the intentions and
capabilities of our surrounding countries and others
more than ever before.

Therefore, to effectively collect, organize, analyze,

share and preserve intelligence and to contribute to
policy decisions and force operations, Japan will
strengthen its capabilities by function for signals
intelligence (SIGINT), imagery intelligence (IMINT),
human intelligence (HUMINT) and OSINT, centered
on the Defense Intelligence Headquarters (DIH),
while fundamentally enhancing our integrated analysis
capabilities, including the use of geospatial intelligence
(GEOINT). To this end, the budget is to be acquired
for the maintenance of the intelligence systems of the
DIH as well as the Japan Ground, Maritime and Air
Self-Defense Forces (the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF); the
maintenance and improvement of various intelligence
collection assets and intelligence collection equipment
at each communication station and coastal surveillance
unit; and the collection and organization of various
intelligence materials, so that intelligence analysis and
other functions can be strengthened.

In order for the intelligence division to respond

appropriately to increasingly diversified intelligence
requirements, the MOD/SDF is promoting the securing
and training of highly capable personnel handling
intelligence collection and analysis. Moreover, the
MOD/SDF i t ki t d i i

example, it conducts the collection and analysis of
necessary information regarding trends in threats in
cyberspace through such means as collecting OSINT
and exchanging information with other countries. In
addition, the DIH increased the number of personnel
in FY2022 to strengthen its system for gathering and
analyzing information on the economic security of other
countries.

Results of the DIH’s intelligence service are provided

as analysis products to the Prime Minister, the Minister
of Defense, the National Security Secretariat established
within the Cabinet Secretariat, the Cabinet Intelligence
and Research Office, as well as GSDF, MSDF and
ASDF units in a timely and appropriate manner to
support policy decision and unit operation. The DIH also
actively exchanges information with relevant ministries
and agencies and foreign counterparts.

significant decrease in operational efficiency and others.
Accordingly, it was decided to improve the operation of
recurrence prevention measures while maintaining their
effectiveness from January 2024 onward. Specifically,
the following measures were implemented to improve
operations: (1) For officials engaged in related work such
as recruitment/support work and procurement who have
daily contact with former officials, only when a former
official made an unusual request were such requests
reported to the head of the respective organization, etc.;
and (2) As a general rule, the meetings and briefings
should be conducted by multiple officials, but in cases
where more than one official is not available, such as
when it interferes with operations, a single official may
conduct the meeting or briefing independently with the
prior approval of the senior official in charge of his or
her duties.

On June 2022, it was found that then commanding

officer of MSDF destroyer JS “Inazuma” designated his
crew newly assigned to the ship by personnel transfer
as an official handling specially designated secrets, even
though he/she had not undergone an security clearance
assessment for specially designated secrets, and that the
former commanding officer had such personnel handle
specially designated secret information at the Combat
Information Center (CIC) during the two-month mission
operation before the ship had an accident off Suo-oshima
in Yamaguchi Prefecture on January 2023, thereby
violating Act on the Protection of Specially Designated
Secrets, and others. In addition, on July 2023, it was
found that the commander of a unit under the command
of the GSDF Northern Army, when giving instructions
and communicating at a training exercise held at the
Kamifurano Training Area, divulged specially designated
secret information to 15 personnel of the unit who were
not in a position to know the specially designated secret
information, thereby violating the Act on the Protection
of Specified Secrets, and others.

The MOD/SDF took the occurrence of this incident

seriously, and on April 2024, announced the results of
the investigation and disciplinary action, and at the same
time issued an instruction from the MOD regarding the
prevention of recurrence, In addition, the Defense Vice
Minister has decided to intensively study more effective
measures to prevent recurrence of such incidents and to
further ensure information security.


The MOD/SDF has been working to ensure a system
necessary for information security in accordance with the
Act on the Protection of Specially Designated Secrets[1]
and other relevant laws and in cooperation with relevant
ministries, agencies and bureaus, to appropriately protect
various types of highly classified information.

However, it came to light that the Commander of

the MSDF Fleet Intelligence Command intentionally
disclosed without authorization specially designated
secrets and other information to his former superior,
who was not eligible to handle classified information,
in a situation briefing conducted in March 2020,
thereby violating the Act on the Protection of Specially
Designated Secrets and Article 59, Paragraph 1 (duty of
confidentiality) of the Self-Defense Forces Law.

In response to this, in March 2023, then Defense

Minister Hamada established measures to prevent
recurrence (Minister’s circular notice), including
guidelines for meeting and briefing former officials and
institutionalization of maintenance training for managers
and retired officials and made all officials thoroughly
aware of such measures.

Subsequently, taking the opportunity of about

six months having elapsed since implementing
recurrence-prevention measures, the effectiveness of
the measures was verified after October 2023 and it
emerged that some departments had experienced a

capabilities, including interceptor missiles for ballistic
missile defense (Standard Missile (SM)-3 Block IIA),
interceptor missiles with upgraded capabilities (Patriot
Advanced Capability (PAC)-3 MSE), Long-Range Shipto-Air Missiles (SM-6) and Upgraded Type 03 MediumRange Surface-to-Air Missiles (modified).

Specifically, ammunition development costs, which

were approximately 1 trillion yen in the previous

on the Ministry of Defense Disaster Prevention Plan in
order to take all possible measures for the initial response
by promptly transporting and deploying units as well as
to respond to large-scale earthquakes, which are under
consideration by the Central Disaster Management
Council.[2] With this, the MOD/SDF formulate various
contingency plans to respond to such earthquakes with the
aim of implementation of swift, systematic disaster relief.

Based on the damage assumptions for a megaquake in

the Japan Trench or the Chishima Trench as well as the

On January 1 2024, an earthquake with a maximum intensity of 7

(M7.6, depth of approximately 16 km) occurred with its epicenter in
the Noto region of Ishikawa Prefecture. The governors of Ishikawa
and Toyama prefectures issued a disaster relief request to the Japan
Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) the same day and January 4,
2024, respectively and it provided life-saving work, sanitation,
transportation, food, water, bathing, road clearing and other services.
In response, the Ministry of Defense (MOD)/Self-Defense Forces
(SDF) launched the aircraft immediately after the disaster to assess
the damages, and organized a joint task force under the command
of Commanding General of the Middle Army on the second day the
same month, which carried out various activities using up to around
14,000 personnel.

In this disaster relief operation, under circumstances where

it was difficult to access the disaster areas from land due to their
location at the tip of a peninsula where the road network had been
cut off, the MOD/SDF dealt with the situation by mobilizing its
integrated operational capabilities, including the intensive air
mobility operation of the GSDF, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense
Force (MSDF) and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF), as
well as the use of the SDF vessels as bases at sea.

In the operation in Ishikawa and Toyama prefectures (operations

activities immediately after the disaster, the task force transported
police, firefighters and DMAT personnel, etc. using the SDF aircraft,
vessels and other means; conducted road-clearing work to allow

conducts joint exercises on a regular basis. From August
to September 2022, the MOD/SDF conducted training
in Japan with related organizations for the transportation
of Japanese nationals and others overseas to practice the
entire process of the actions of units and coordination
with the related organizations, which improved integrated
operational capabilities and strengthened cooperation
with the related organizations. Furthermore, from
February to March 2024, the MOD/SDF took advantage
of the opportunity of the annual multilateral joint
exercise Cobra Gold in Thailand to rehearse on a series
of activities for rescue of Japanese nationals and others
overseas in cooperation with the relevant ministries
and agencies, the Embassy of Japan in Thailand and
other organizations. The exercises strengthened the
collaboration between the MOD/SDF and the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs.

The MOD/SDF has conducted the transportation of

Japanese nationals and others overseas in seven cases,
two of which were carried out in 2023.

The first case was the transportation of Japanese

nationals and others in the Republic of Sudan. In April
2023, considering the situations in the Republic of
Sudan and at the request of the Minister of Foreign
Affairs of Japan, the MOD/SDF dispatched two C-130
transport aircraft, two C-2 transport aircraft and one KC767 aerial refueling and transport aircraft to the Republic
of Djibouti. One C-2 transport aircraft transported 45
Japanese nationals and their families from Sudan to
Djibouti.

The second case was the transportation of Japanese

nationals and others in Israel. In October 2023,
considering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and at the
request of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan,
the MOD/SDF dispatched one KC-767 aerial refueling
and transport aircraft and two C-2 transport aircraft to
Jordan and other areas. One KC-767 aerial refueling
and transport aircraft transported 83 people[5] on October
21 and 46 people[6] on November 3 from Israel to Japan,
respectively.

The MOD/SDF has utilized the operation facility in the
Republic of Djibouti used by the SDF units operating
under the Counter-Piracy Measures Act[7], under
circumstances such as the transportation of Japanese
nationals and others in South Sudan in 2016 and the
dispatch of an investigation team to Ethiopia in response
to the worsening situation there in 2021.

In light of this experience as well, the National

Security Strategy (NSS) indicated a direction by
stating that “…while gaining understanding from the
Government of Djibouti, the SDF facility there, which
has been in operation for counter-piracy activities, will
be also utilized to protect Japanese nationals and others
overseas.” On December 22 2023, the Cabinet approved
the “Government Initiative to Ensure the Safety of
Japanese Nationals and Others Overseas in the Middle
East and Africa” in order for the government of Japan
to take all possible measures to rescue and transport
Japanese nationals and others overseas.

In response, a new mission establishing temporary

arrangements for the possible rescue and transportation
of Japanese nationals and others overseas was newly
assigned to counter-piracy units, such as the accumulation
and management of equipment, defense cooperation

should not be tolerated in any region, including the IndoPacific, and that the Alliance capabilities to deter and
respond need to be strengthened to that end.

The two sides also affirmed that they would work

closely together to realize the initiatives to strengthen
the deterrence and response capabilities of Japan-U.S.

in April of the same year, and that they would continue

particular, the two sides agreed to continue discussions
on upgrading their respective command and control
framework and other issues for the purpose of enhancing
interoperability between the U.S. force and the SDF, to

mutual understanding of tactics and communication, but
are also beneficial for improving tactical skills for each

vast experience in actual fighting, are invaluable and greatly
contribute to improving SDF capabilities.

**Section 5** **Efforts Concerning the Stationing of the USFJ**

Under the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, the presence a very important initiative for mitigation of the impact on
of the United States Forces of Japan (USFJ) functions as local communities, including those in Okinawa, and further

**(2) Satisfying Labor Requirements of the USFJ**

The SOFA stipulates that the manpower (labor)

required by the USFJ shall be satisfied with the assistance
of the Government of Japan.

As of the end of FY2023, there were 25,779 USFJ

local employees (hereinafter referred to as the “USFJ
employees”) at USFJ facilities and areas throughout
Japan, working as clerks at headquarters, engineers at
maintenance/supply facilities, members of security
guards and fire departments on base, and sales staff at
welfare/recreational facilities. They support the smooth
operations of the USFJ.

criteria used in evaluating contractor employee positions
for eligibility to receive designation as members of the
civilian component, and stipulates the procedures for
notification and review, etc., together with the exclusion
of ordinary residents from the civilian component.

**3** **USFJ-Related Costs**


USFJ-related costs include Host Nation Support, or
HNS (cost sharing for the stationing of USFJ),[6] costs
for implementing the stipulations of the Special Action
Committee on Okinawa (SACO) Final Report to mitigate
the impact on the people of Okinawa, as well as costs
for implementing measures that contribute to mitigating
the impact on the local communities associated with the
initiatives for the realignment of the U.S. Forces.

**4** **HNS (Cost Sharing for the Stationing of**

**USFJ)**


HNS (Cost Sharing for the Stationing of USFJ)
plays an important role to ensure the smooth and
effective implementation of the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements. Due to soaring prices and wages in Japan
since the mid-1970s, and changes in the international
economic situation, Japan began to bear labor costs such
as welfare costs for USFJ local employees in FY1978.
Then in FY1979, it started to bear costs for the Facilities
Improvement Program, or FIP.

In addition, as labor costs soared due to changes in

economic conditions surrounding both countries, there
arose a concern that the employment stability of the
employees would be undermined, and then the activities
of the USFJ could be affected. Therefore, in 1987, Japan
and the United States concluded an agreement that
sets forth special measures regarding Article 24 of the
SOFA (the Special Measures Agreement, or SMA)[7] as
exceptional, limited, and provisional measures relating
to the cost sharing principle of the SOFA.

Based on this SMA, Japan started to bear labor costs

of eight categories such as the adjustment allowance
(currently replaced by the regional allowance). As the
SMA was revised later on, the costs shared by Japan
have expanded to cover labor costs including base pay,
and utilities costs from FY1991, training relocation costs


**(3) Supplementary Agreement on Cooperation in the**

**Field of Environmental Stewardship**

In September 2015, the governments of Japan and the
United States signed the Supplementary Agreement on
the Environment, which came into force on the same day.
This supplementary agreement represents an international
commitment with legal binding force and sets forth
provisions concerning the issuance and maintenance
of the Japan Environmental Governing Standards
(JEGS) and the establishment and maintenance, etc., of
procedures for access to USFJ facilities and areas in the
event of actual occurrence of an accident (leakage) that
affects the environment and in the event of a field survey
(including cultural property survey) related to the return
of a facility or area.

**See** Part IV, Chapter 4, Section 2-2 (Initiatives Related to USFJ

Facilities/Areas)

**See**


**(4) Supplementary Agreement on Civilian Component**
In January 2017, the governments of Japan and the
United States signed the Supplementary Agreement on
Civilian Component, which came into force on the same
day. This Supplementary Agreement clarifies the scope
of the civilian component, which is addressed only by
a general provision in SOFA, in addition to developing

Based on the consensus that these costs will build the foundation to further strengthen the Japan-U.S. Alliance as a result of the negotiations over this SMA (Act on New Special Measures
for Article 24 of the SOFA), the Japanese side has decided to refer to this budget by a Japanese phrase that points to its goal of enhancing Alliance readiness and resiliency.

2 The SACO-related costs refer to the costs for implementing the contents of the SACO Final Report to reduce the impact on the people of Okinawa, while the
realignment-related costs refer to the costs relating to the measures that contribute to reducing the impact on local communities as a part of the realignment initiatives. On
the other hand, since HNS (Cost sharing for the stationing of USFJ) is Japan’s voluntary effort to bear some costs in light of the importance of ensuring the smooth and
effective implementation of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, its nature is different from the SACO-related costs and the realignment-related costs, and is categorized
separately.
3 The costs for the stationing of USFJ include the MOD-related budget, other ministry-related budgets (base subsidy, etc.: ¥40.6 billion, FY2023 budget) and the estimated
costs of government-owned land provided for use as USFJ facilities (¥164.4 billion, FY2023 estimate).

**2** **Progress of the Realignment of the USFJ**


**4** **Relocation and Return of MCAS Futenma**

Although over 25 years have passed since Japan and
the United States agreed on the total return of the site
of MCAS Futenma, it has not been achieved yet. The
Government of Japan believes that the return must not
be postponed any longer.

The fundamental idea shared by the Government of

Japan and the people of Okinawa is that it is imperative not
to allow MCAS Futenma to remain indefinitely at its current
location, which is in the vicinity of houses and schools, in
the center of Ginowan City, Okinawa Prefecture.

The Government of Japan’s view is that the current

plan to relocate MCAS Futenma to Henoko, Nago City
is the only solution to avoid continued use of the Air
Station. This has been confirmed by the Japanese and
U.S. governments on repeated occasions, including joint
statements at Japan-U.S. summit meetings and the “2+2”
Meetings.

In order to achieve the total return of MCAS Futenma

as early as possible, the Government of Japan will
continue to make all efforts while providing careful
explanations to local residents in Okinawa building upon
years of persistent dialogue.

The return of MCAS Futenma is expected to eliminate

danger in the area and to contribute to the further growth
of Okinawa, including Ginowan City, through the reuse
of the area (approximately 476 ha, a land area around
100 times larger than Tokyo Dome).


Various efforts have been made for the realignment of the
USFJ, including the relocation of carrier-based aircraft
from Naval Air Facility Atsugi (Kanagawa Prefecture)
to MCAS Iwakuni (Yamaguchi Prefecture), and the
relocation of KC-130 air refueling aircraft from MCAS
Futenma (Okinawa Prefecture) to MCAS Iwakuni, as
well as their rotational deployment to Kanoya Air Base
(Kagoshima Prefecture).

The MOD is continuing promotion of efforts to

improve the SDF facilities on Mageshima (Nishinoomote
City, Kagoshima prefecture) that will be used for fieldcarrier landing practice (FCLP), return of land south of
Kadena including MCAS Futenma, and relocation of
U.S. Marine Corps personnel stationed in Okinawa to
Guam.

**See** Fig. III-2-5-3 and 4 (Progress of the Realignment of Force

Structure of USFJ and the SDF Described in the United States
**See**

Japan Roadmap for Realignment Implementation (1) and (2))

**3** **Field-Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP)**


The May 2006 Roadmap prescribes that a bilateral
framework to conduct a study on a permanent FCLP
facility is to be established with the goal of selecting a
permanent site at the earliest possible date. The MOD
has acquired most of the land on Mageshima, and has
been explaining the facility development to the local
communities of Kagoshima Prefecture, Nishinoomote
City, Nakatane Town, and Minamitane Town.

The United States also welcomed the Government of

Japan’s decision to develop SDF facilities on Mageshima
in the “2+2” Meeting joint statement issued in January
2022.

In January 2023, the MOD released the environmental

impact assessment report prepared based on the view of
the Governor of Kagoshima Prefecture, who had taken
into account the opinions of the mayors of Nishinoomote
City, Nakatane Town and Minamitane Town, and others,
and started the construction work within Mageshima.

In March of the same year, construction work also

began on the maritime area around Mageshima, and
the development of facilities are steadily progressing in
close cooperation with local municipalities.

**Chapter**


**(1) Relocation of MCAS Futenma and Mitigation of the**

**Impact on Okinawa**

The relocation of MCAS Futenma holds more
significance than merely moving the facility from one
location to another. Rather, it involves reduction in the
base’s functions and area in Okinawa, and contributes
greatly to mitigating the impact on Okinawa.
**a. Distribution of Functions Offered by MCAS Futenma**
The relocation of MCAS Futenma involves the return of
the entire area by relocating three functions: (1) operation
of MV-22 (Osprey) and other aircraft, (2) operation of
air refueling aircraft, and (3) accepting transient aircraft
in contingencies. Of these three functions, (2) and (3)
involve relocation out of Okinawa Prefecture, while (1)
involves relocation to Camp Schwab.

The relocation of (2) operation of air refueling aircraft to

MCAS Iwakuni was completed in August 2014. With regard
to (3) accepting transient aircraft in contingencies, Japan

d th U it d St t d i O t b 2018 t d l

facilities that would be necessary for relocating the function
to Tsuiki Air Base (Fukuoka Prefecture) and Nyutabaru Air
Base (Miyazaki Prefecture). The construction work was
completed by March 2023 except for the runway extension
at Tsuiki Air Base. The MOD is moving forward with
procedures for reclamation of public waters and others
related to the runway extension work at Tsuiki Air Base.
**b. Reduction in Area**
The area required for the land reclamation to build the
FRF is approximately 152 ha, less than one-third of the
approximately 476 ha of MCAS Futenma, and the FRF
will be equipped with a significantly shorter runway at
1,200 m (1,800 m including the overruns) compared to
the current runway length of 2,740 m at MCAS Futenma.
**c. Reduction in Noise and Risks**
Two runways will be constructed in a V-shape, which
enables the flight path for takeoff and landing to be
located over the sea, in line with the requests of the
local community. In MCAS Futenma, flight paths used
daily for training and other purposes are located over
residential areas, whereas flight paths in the FRF will be
changed to over the sea, thereby reducing noise and risks.

For example, while more than 10,000 households are

located in areas requiring housing noise insulation near
MCAS Futenma, there will be zero households requiring
such insulation around the FRF.


**(2) Background Concerning the Futenma Replacement**

**Facility**

**a. Consideration of Relocation Site**
Considering the occurrence of the U.S. Forces helicopter
crash in Ginowan City in August 2004, bilateral
discussions on the realignment have been made towards
realizing the relocation and return of MCAS Futenma at
the earliest possible date in order to resolve the concern
of the residents living in the vicinity.

The “2+2” joint statement compiled in October 2005

calls for locating the FRF in an L-shaped configuration.
However, after that, based on consultations and agreement
with the local governments including Nago City, it was
decided to stipulate in the May 2006 Roadmap that
the FRF be located in a V-shaped configuration. With
regard to construction of this replacement facility, a
Memorandum of Basic Understanding was exchanged
between then Governor of Okinawa Inamine and then
Minister of State for Defense Nukaga in the same month.

After the change of government in September 2009,

the Exploratory Committee for Okinawa Base Issues was
established. After reviews conducted by the Committee,
at the “2+2” Meeting held in May 2010, the governments
of Japan and the United States confirmed the intention to
locate the FRF in the Camp Schwab Henokosaki area and
the adjacent waters. Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting

held in June 2011, it was decided that the runway would
take a V shape.

During the deliberation process which led to these

conclusions, first of all, it was determined that, from a
security perspective, the deterrence of the U.S. Forces,
including that of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in
Okinawa that is located in a crucial area for the security of
Japan, cannot be lessened while there remains instability
and uncertainty in the security environment in East Asia.

Furthermore, concern was expressed that the functions

of the U.S. Marine Corps, such as mobility and readiness,
would be weakened if the helicopter units stationed at
MCAS Futenma were to be detached from the other
Marines units stationed in Okinawa and moved abroad
or out of the prefecture. This is because the U.S. Marine
Corps conducts integrated operations of air, ground,
logistics support, and command elements.

Therefore, it was concluded that the FRF had to be

located within Okinawa Prefecture.
**b. Beginning of Landfill Work**
An environmental impact assessment was conducted for
approximately five years from 2007 for the FRF Project.
For this assessment, the MOD received 1,561 opinions
from the Governor of Okinawa, made all the required
revisions, and appropriately reflected them in the content
of the environmental impact assessment report.

The Director General of the Okinawa Defense Bureau

submitted the Landfill Permit Request on public waters to
Okinawa Prefecture in March 2013, and then Governor
of Okinawa Nakaima approved this in December 2013.

After the construction began, then Governor of

Okinawa Onaga revoked the landfill permit, which
led to litigation between the Government of Japan and
Okinawa Prefecture. However, landfill work began in the
waters of the Henoko side in December 2018. By the end
of September 2023, progress to reclaim the Henoko side
of the waters was at around 99.5%, leaving only areas
that cannot be reclaimed at this time, such as those that
need to be reclaimed in conjunction with the adjacent
unbuilt areas. At present, in the reclamation area on the
Henoko side, stockpiling landfill materials to be used for
reclamation on the Oura Bay side is underway. (As of
May, 2024)
**c. Consideration on Soil Improvement Work, Etc.**
Regarding the soil foundation of the landfill area, a
study was conducted on the stability of seawalls and


other structures in the waters of Oura wan area in light
of the results of a boring survey, etc. As a result, it was
confirmed that it is possible to implement the construction
of seawalls and landfill work while ensuring the required
stability through soil improvement work via prevailing
and adequately proven construction methods[8] used
for construction projects such as Tokyo International
Airport and Kansai International Airport. This was also
confirmed by the Technical Review Committee that has
been held since September 2019 consisting of experts
in the fields of geotechnical, structural, hydraulic, and
pavement engineering.

In addition, in December 2019, the Okinawa Defense

Bureau announced that, based on the results of studies
conducted to date, it would take nine years and three
months from commencement to completion of construction
according to the revised plan. Around 12 years would be
required to complete the admin procedures described
in the Okinawa Consolidation Plan, and the cost of the
Futenma Air Station Replacement Facility Construction
Project was estimated at about 930 billion yen.

Similarly, in terms of the environment, the

Environmental Monitoring Committee, comprising
experts in various fields related to the natural environment
and others, which was held from January to April 2020,
confirmed that the degree of impact on the environment
caused by the change in the plan would be the same or
less than that before the change.
**d. Landfill Permit Revision Request on Public Waters**
As explained above, hearing experts’ insights on the
environment and other aspects, after due consideration,
in April 2020, the Okinawa Defense Bureau submitted to
the Governor of Okinawa Prefecture the Landfill Permit
Revision Request given the additional implementation
of the soil improvement work, etc.

However, in November 2021, the Governor of

Okinawa Prefecture disapproved the Permit Revision
Request on the grounds that surveys of the soil foundation
and environmental protection measures at the planned
landfill area were inadequate. In response, in December
2021, the Director General of the Okinawa Defense
Bureau filed a request for review with the Minister of
Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism under the
Administrative Complaint Review Act. In April 2022,
the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and
Tourism determined revocation of the disapproval by

The standard methods are the sand compaction pile method, the sand drain method, and the paper drain method. Among examples of projects in which these methods were used is the


-----

the Governor of Okinawa, and also issued an instruction
for correction against Okinawa Prefecture based on the
Local Autonomy Act to approve the Permit Revision
Request.

In response to this determination and the directive

for correction, in August the same year, the governor
of Okinawa Prefecture filed lawsuits at the Fukuoka
High Court, Naha Branch to revoke the government’s
involvement. As for these lawsuits, in August 2023, the
Supreme Court decided against the Okinawa Governor’s
petition to accept the appeal regarding the determination,
and in September the same year, the Supreme Court issued
a judgment to dismiss the Okinawa Governor’s appeal
regarding the directive for correction, and accordingly the
judicial judgment that the Minister of Land, Infrastructure,
Transport and Tourism’s directive to approve the Permit
Revision Request was legitimate was finalized.

Based on this judgment, the same month, the Minister

of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism issued
a recommendation and instruction under the Local
Autonomy Act to the Governor of Okinawa Prefecture to
approve the Permit Revision Request, but the approval
remained pending.

Therefore, in October the same year, the Minister

of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism filed
a subrogation lawsuit at the Fukuoka High Court,
Naha Branch for substituted execution under the Local
Autonomy Law. Subsequently, in December the same
year, a judgment was made ordering the governor of
Okinawa Prefecture to approve the Landfill Permit
Revision Request by a deadline, but since no disposition
of approval had been made by that deadline, the Minister
of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism issued
approval under the law. The same month, the governor of
Okinawa Prefecture filed a petition for acceptance of an
appeal to the Supreme Court regarding this lawsuit, but,
in February 2024, the Supreme Court decided to reject
the petition, whereupon the judgment of the Fukuoka
High Court, Naha Branch ordering the governor of
Okinawa Prefecture to approve the Landfill Permit
Revision Request became final.

In addition, in September 2022, due to dissatisfaction

with the determination of the Minister of Land,
Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Okinawa

Prefecture filed a lawsuit with the Naha District Court
to revoke the determination based on the Administrative


Case Litigation Act. In November 2023, the Naha District
Court made a judgment to dismiss Okinawa Prefecture’s
lawsuit, but Okinawa Prefecture has appealed to the
Naha Branch of the Fukuoka High Court, and there is
one lawsuit is pending between the government of Japan
and Okinawa Prefecture regarding the Landfill Permit
Revision Request (as of May 2024).

and MCAS Futenma (image)); Reference 31 (Background of
the Futenma Replacement Facility); Reference 32 (Estimated
Timelines for the Return of Facilities and Areas South of
Kadena)

**(3) Construction Based on the Plan after Approval of**

**the Landfill Permit Revision Request**

**a. Status of Construction**
After receiving approval of Landfill Permit Revision
Request, the Okinawa Defense Bureau began

construction work based on the revised plan on January
10, 2024. Specifically, in the waters on the Oura Bay
side, the construction began to develop an offshore yard
that will serve as a temporary storage area for caissons
(box-shaped structures made of reinforced concrete, etc.)
to be used for future seawall construction. Additionally,
construction of the K-5, K-6, and K-7 seawalls began in
February, March, and April the same year, respectively.
**b. Environmental Protection Initiatives**
The environmental impact assessment report states that
because corals inhabiting the landfill area will be lost
due to the landfill work, corals will be transplanted to
the extent possible as a preservation measure. Some of
the targeted corals for preservation have already been
transplanted with the permission of the Governor of
Okinawa Prefecture, and other preservation measures
will also be taken for the remaining targeted corals in the
future. The FRF Project expand a scope for preservation
to be more careful in transplanting corals compared to
landfill work to construct the second runway at Naha
Airport.[9] Hermit crabs designated as a national natural
treasure, as well as shellfish and crustaceans listed as
endangered species, have also been appropriately moved
to a surrounding location suitable for habitat in time
for the construction. Furthermore, as part of measures
for habitats that will be lost due to the landfill work,
measures have been taken to transplant corals grown in
land-based facilities to the waters surrounding Oura Bay
and expand the growth area of seagrass beds.

These environmental preservation measures

Specifically, in relation to the construction of the second runway at Naha Airport, around 37,000 clusters of small corals were transplanted. If the same standard as the one applicable to

have been taken based on the guidance and advice
of the Environmental Monitoring Committee, and
the construction of the FRF is proceeding with due
consideration for environmental preservation.
**c. Consideration for Surrounding Residents**
The progress of the construction work is expected
to increase construction vehicle traffic in future.
Construction work will proceed while giving due
consideration to the impact on the natural and living
environment of the local communities of the noise and
traffic congestion that may be caused as the construction
work progresses.

Targeting the earliest possible total return of the MCAS

Futenma, the construction work will proceed steadily
in terms of relocation to Henoko, while continuing to
provide detailed explanations to local residents.

thereby enabling the return of significant land areas
south of Kadena Air Base.

Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting in April 2012, it

was decided to delink the progress on the relocation to the
FRF from both the relocation of the III MEF personnel
from Okinawa to Guam and the resulting land returns
south of Kadena. In addition, with regard to the land
to be returned, it was agreed to conduct consultations
focusing on three categories, namely (1) land eligible
for immediate return; (2) land eligible for return once
the relocation of functions is completed; and (3) land
eligible for return after the relocation abroad.

**(1) Consolidation Plan for Facilities and Areas in**

**Okinawa**

Since the change of administration at the end of 2012,
Japan and the United States have continued consultation
under the basic policy to dedicate all strength toward
mitigating the impact of the U.S. Forces on Okinawa
communities. Japan strongly requested an early return
of land areas south of Kadena, including Makiminato
Service Area (Camp Kinser) in Urasoe City of which
Okinawa has particularly made a strong request for
the return and coordinated with the United States. As

local community. This has resulted, for example, in the
opening of the entire stretch of Ginowan City road 11
in March 2021 on land along the east side of MCAS
Futenma, which has improved local traffic. Furthermore,
in May 2022, Prime Minister Kishida visited the Lower
Plaza Housing area of Camp Zukeran and announced
that Japan and the United States will agree to open the
area as a green space for public use ahead of its return
to Japan, and its public use began in March 2024 as the
“Lower Plaza Green Square”.

All-out initiatives are being continuously made by

the Government to steadily implement the return of land
areas south of Kadena Air Base under the Consolidation
Plan in a manner that visibly mitigates the impact on
Okinawa.

including the specific years of return.

The return of all land according to the plan will

enable the return of approximately 70% (approximately
1,048 ha, the equivalent of 220 Tokyo Domes) of six
USFJ facilities for exclusive use[10] located in densely
populated areas in the central and southern parts of the
main island of Okinawa. In the Consolidation Plan, it is
confirmed between Japan and the United States that this
plan will be implemented as soon as possible, and that
the Government will continue to make the utmost efforts
to return the land south of Kadena, at an early date.

Since the Roadmap was announced in May 2006, the
governments of Japan and the United States held a series
of consultations on the reduction of the U.S. Forces in
Okinawa.

**(1) Timing and Size of Relocation**
The 2006 Roadmap stated that approximately 8,000
personnel of the III MEF and their approximately 9,000
dependents would relocate from Okinawa to Guam by
2014, but the “2+2” Meeting in June 2011 and other
agreements set the timing of the relocation for the earliest
possible date after 2014.

Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting held in April 2012,

the governments of Japan and the United States decided
to delink both the relocation of III MEF personnel from
Okinawa to Guam and the resulting land return south of
Kadena from the progress on the FRF and to adjust the
composition of the units and the number of personnel to
be relocated to Guam.

As a result, the MAGTF is to be located in Japan,

Guam, and Hawaii, with approximately 9,000 personnel
relocated to locations outside of Japan. Meanwhile, the
end-state for the U.S. Marine Corps presence in Okinawa
is to be consistent with the level of approximately 10,000
personnel envisioned in the Roadmap.

March, 2020, the return of all areas that were designated
as land areas to be returned as soon as required procedures
are completed based on the Consolidation Plan (shown
in red in Fig. III-2-5-8) was realized. The use of returned
lands is being promoted incrementally. For example,
at the former site of the West Futenma Housing Area,
which was returned in March 2015, the formation of
Okinawa Health Medical Center requested by the local
community is being promoted.

In addition, returns have been realized ahead of

Accordingly, the “2+2” Meeting held in October

2013 agreed that, under the relocation plan described at
the 2012 “2+2” Meeting, the relocation of U.S. Marine
Corps units from Okinawa to Guam is to begin in the
first half of the 2020s. The plan is expected to facilitate
progress in implementing the Consolidation Plan for
Facilities and Areas in Okinawa of April 2013.

In addition, at the “2+2” Meeting in January 2023,

it was confirmed that the relocation from Okinawa to
Guam would begin in 2024 and others.


**(2) Costs of the Relocation**
Under the Roadmap, the two sides reached an
agreement that, of the estimated US$10.27 billion (in
U.S. fiscal year 2008 price) cost of the facilities and
infrastructure development costs, Japan would provide
US$6.09 billion, including US$2.8 billion in direct
cash contribution, while the United States would fund
the remaining US$4.18 billion. In February 2009, the
Japanese Government and the U.S. Government signed
“the Agreement Between the Government of Japan
and the Government of the United States of America
Concerning the Implementation of the Relocation of the


-----

III MEF Personnel and Their Dependents from Okinawa
to Guam” (the Guam International Agreement).[11] The
Agreement legally guarantees and ensures actions taken
by Japan and the United States for projects to which
Japan provides direct cash contributions.

As part of measures based on this Agreement,

the Government of Japan has been providing cash
contributions to the U.S. Government in relation to the
projects for which Japan has provided financial support
since FY2009.[12]

Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting held in April 2012,

the unit composition and the number of personnel to be
relocated to Guam were adjusted and it was agreed that
the preliminary cost estimate by the U.S. Government for
the relocation was US$8.6 billion (in U.S. FY2012 price).
With regard to Japan’s financial commitment, it was
reaffirmed that it was to be the direct cash contribution of
up to US$2.8 billion (in U.S. FY2008 price) as stipulated
in Article 1 of the Guam International Agreement. It was
also confirmed that Japan’s equity investment and loans
for family housing projects and infrastructure projects
would not be utilized.[13]

Moreover, it was stipulated that any funds that had

already been provided to the U.S. Government under
the Guam International Agreement would be counted
as part of the Japanese contribution. Furthermore, as a
new initiative, a portion of the direct cash contribution
of US$2.8 billion mentioned above would be used to
develop training areas in Guam and the Commonwealth
of the Northern Mariana Islands as shared-use facilities
by Japan and the United States. In addition, it was agreed
that the remaining costs and any additional costs would be
borne by the United States, and that the two governments
were to complete a bilateral cost breakdown.


At the 2+2 Meeting in October 2013, a Protocol

Amending the Guam International Agreement was also
signed to add the stipulations concerning the development
of training areas in Guam and the Commonwealth
of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the use of these
training areas by the SDF. The limit on Japanese cash
contributions remains unchanged at US$2.8 billion (in
U.S. FY2008 price).

**(3) Completion of Environmental Impact Assessment**

**Procedures**

As for the environmental impact assessment for Guam,
the required procedures were conducted to reflect the
revisions to the project made by the adjustments to the
plan for realignment, and the assessment was completed
in August 2015.

Furthermore, the Commonwealth of the Northern

Mariana Islands Joint Military Training Environmental
Impact Statement (CJMT-EIS), is now being

implemented.


**(4) Progress of the Guam Relocation Project**
While the environmental impact assessment for Guam
was being conducted, the Government of the United States
implemented infrastructure development projects at the
Andersen Air Force Base and the Apra area of the Naval
Base Guam as projects unaffected by the assessment. The
U.S. Government is currently implementing relocation
construction work in all project areas, following the
lifting of the freeze on the Guam relocation funds
pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act and
the completion of the environmental impact assessment
for Guam.

**7** **Other Realignment Initiatives**

**(1) Aviation Training Relocation (ATR)**
Based on the decision that U.S. aircraft from three
USFJ facilities and areas – Kadena, Misawa (Aomori
Prefecture) and MCAS Iwakuni – would participate
for the time being in bilateral training at SDF facilities,
the Aviation Training Relocation (ATR)[14] has been
underway since 2007. The MOD has been improving its
infrastructure, as required, for the training relocation.

The ATR contributes to enhancing interoperability


between the two countries, and also to relocating part
of air-to-ground training conducted by using Kadena Air
Base. Thus, this training relocation will help with noise
abatement around Kadena Air Base, thereby contributing
to the mitigation of the impact on Okinawa.

In addition to assisting the USFJ, the MOD/SDF is

making efforts to ensure the safety and security of the
local residents, such as the establishment of liaison
offices, facilitating communication with related

government agencies, and addressing needs of the


-----

local residents. These efforts have been contributing to
successful training relocation.

Overview of the Background to the Aviation
Fig. III-2-5-10
Training Relocation


**See** Fig. III-2-5-10 (Overview of the Background to the Aviation

Training Relocation)


The Government plans to continue decreasing MV

22’s amount of time deployed and training in Okinawa
by relocating the exercises to mainland Japan and Guam,
and will continue to promote initiatives that contribute
to further mitigating the impact on Okinawa.

Furthermore, with regard to the safety of MV-22s,

prior to the deployment of MV-22s to MCAS Futenma
in 2012, the Government established an analysis and
assessment team composed of aircraft pilots and experts
from inside and outside the Government and confirmed
the safety of MV-22 by conducting its own survey, etc.
In addition, when Japan made the decision to introduce
Ospreys in 2014, the Government reconfirmed their
safety by collecting and analyzing all kinds of technical
information, not only in the preparation phase, but also
after the decision of introduction was made.

Furthermore, since 2016, the Government has

dispatched GSDF Osprey personnel to the U.S. Marine
Corps’ training programs, in which they pilot and
maintain the aircraft. The Government has reaffirmed
that the Osprey is a reliable aircraft that allows for stable
maneuvering and maintenance.

Additionally, the CV-22s (Osprey) have the same

propulsion system as the MV-22 and both aircraft also
have the basic structure in common. Therefore, the
safety of both aircraft is at the same level.

In addition, after the crash of the CV-22 in November

2023, an unprecedented level of exchange took place
regarding technical information in the verification
process between Japan and the United States. The
Ministry of Defense (MOD) has come to the recognition
that the cause of the accident was a materiel failure of a
specific part in the components necessary for the aircraft
to perform its functions, and believes that various safety
measures corresponding to this cause can be taken to
prevent and address accidents caused by the same type
of failure. In this context, with regard to the said materiel
failure, the United States side has explained that there is
no need to change the design of the aircraft itself, nor is
there any problem with the safety of the aircraft itself,
and that there are no structural deficiencies that affect
flight safety.

The MOD has confirmed, at all levels in Japan and the

United States, that flight safety remains the top priority
for the resumption of operations, and that Japan and the
United States will continue to cooperate and take all
possible measures to ensure safety.


**See**


**(2) Training Relocation for MV-22 (Osprey) etc.**
The Government of Japan and the United States
Government decided in the “2+2” joint statement of
October 2013, to utilize the opportunities to participate
in various operations in mainland Japan and across
the region to reduce the amount of time that MV-22s
are deployed and used for the training in Okinawa, so
that training outside of Okinawa Prefecture, including
mainland Japan, can be increased while maintaining
the deterrence of the Alliance. Based on the above, both
governments have been moving forward with conducting
training of the MV-22 deployed at MCAS Futenma
outside of Okinawa Prefecture and so on.

In September 2016, it was agreed at the Joint

Committee to relocate the training activities of TiltRotor/Rotary Wing aircraft, such as AH-1, CH53,
and the MV-22 that are currently deployed at MCAS
Futenma, out of Okinawa Prefecture at Japan’s expense
in order to further promote training outside of Okinawa
and mitigate the impact of training activities there.

In FY2023, the MV-22 and other aircraft were

incorporated into Japan-U.S. bilateral training upon being
relocated to maneuver areas and other locations in Oita,
Kumamoto, Miyazaki and Kagoshima prefectures in
October 2023, and in Nagasaki, Kumamoto, and Kagoshima
prefectures from February to March 2024. From the date of
the agreement up to March 2024, a total of 20 exercises, in
addition to the ones mentioned above, have been conducted
in Guam as well as in Japan at the maneuver areas in
Hokkaido, Aomori, Iwate, Miyagi, Gunma, Kanagawa,

**2** **Stationing of the U.S. Forces in Okinawa**


Thus, the stationing of the U.S. Forces in Okinawa,

including the U.S. Marine Corps, which can deal
with a wide range of missions with high mobility and
readiness, along with the above-mentioned geographical
characteristics, further ensures the effectiveness of
the Japan-U.S. Alliance, strengthens deterrence, and
contributes greatly not only to the security of Japan but
also to the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.

On the other hand, Okinawa has many USFJ facilities

and areas such as air bases, maneuver areas, and
logistics facilities. As of January 1, 2024, approximately
70% of USFJ facilities and areas (for exclusive use)
are concentrated in Okinawa Prefecture, occupying
approximately 8% of the land area of the prefecture
and approximately 14% of the main island of Okinawa.
Therefore, it is necessary to make utmost efforts to
mitigate the impact on Okinawa, while also considering
the above-mentioned security standpoints.

**(1) Initiatives for Realignment, Consolidation, and**


In comparison to areas such as the U.S. mainland,
Hawaii, and Guam, Okinawa is located closer to
potential conflict areas that could affect Japan’s peace
and security, including the Korean Peninsula and the
Taiwan Strait, but at the same time has the advantage of
having a certain distance from these areas that would not
heighten military tension there unnecessarily. In addition,
Okinawa, comprising a large number of small islands,
is located roughly in the center of the Southwestern
Islands having a total length of some 1,200 km and close
to key sea lanes for Japan, which depends on marine
transportation for over 99% of its overall international
trade. Furthermore, its location is extremely important
from the perspective of security, as Okinawa serves as a
strategically important target for neighboring countries

-----

Government of Japan provided 83 facilities and areas
covering approximately 278 km[2] for exclusive use
as USFJ facilities and areas. On the other hand, USFJ
facilities and areas were strongly requested to be
realigned, consolidated and reduced, on the grounds that
their concentration in Okinawa seriously affect the lives
of the people in Okinawa.

Both countries have continued their initiatives to

realign, consolidate, and reduce USFJ facilities and
areas, centering on those subject to strong local requests,
and, in relation to the so-called 23 issues,[16] it was agreed
in 1990 that both sides would proceed with the required
coordination and procedures toward the return of land.
Moreover, it was agreed in 1995 that efforts would also
be made to resolve the so-called Three Okinawa Issues:
the return of Naha Port (Naha City), the return of Yomitan
Auxiliary Airfield, and the relocation of artillery live-fire
training over Highway 104.

Subsequently, in response to an unfortunate incident that

occurred in 1995, as well as the refusal of the then Governor of
Okinawa to sign land lease renewal documents under the Act
on Special Measures for USFJ Land Release, the Government
of Japan decided to devote even greater initiatives towards
realignment, consolidation, and reduction, believing that
the impact should be shared by the whole nation. In order
to hold consultations on issues related to USFJ facilities and
areas in Okinawa, the Government of Japan established the
Okinawa Action Council between the central government
and Okinawa Prefecture, as well as the SACO, and the socalled SACO Final Report was compiled in 1996.

procedures regarding the SOFA procedures, and also
refers to the related facilities and areas covered. The
land to be returned based on the implementation of
contents included in the SACO Final Report represents
approximately 21% (about 50 km[2]) of USFJ facilities
and areas in Okinawa at that time, exceeding the amount
of land returned during the period between the reversion
of Okinawa and the implementation of the SACO Final
Report, which is roughly 43 km[2].

**(3)** **Return of a Major Portion of the Northern Training Area**
The condition for returning the Northern Training Area
was to relocate seven helipads in the area to be returned to
the preexisting training area. However, the Government
of Japan reached an agreement with the U.S. side to
give considerations for the natural environment and to
relocate not all seven but the minimum number of six
helipads necessary, and proceeded with the construction
work. The relocation of the helipads completed in
December 2016, and the return of approximately 4,000
ha, a major portion of the Northern Training Area located
in the villages of Kunigami and Higashi, was achieved
based on the SACO Final Report.

The returned land accounts for approximately 20% of

USFJ facilities and areas (for exclusive use) in Okinawa.
The return is the largest one since the reversion of
Okinawa to the mainland, and had been an issue for 20
years since the SACO Final Report in 1996.

Based on the Act on Special Measures Concerning

Promotion of Effective and Appropriate Use of the
Lands in Okinawa Prefecture Previously Provided for
Use by the Stationed Forces, the MOD took measures
to remove obstacles (such as soil contamination survey,
etc.) so that the landowners, etc., could use returned
lands effectively and appropriately, and transferred the
land to the landowners in December 2017. In addition,
in July 2021, the northern part of the main island of
Okinawa, including the returned lands, was inscribed in
the World Natural Heritage Site as part of the AmamiOshima Island, Tokunoshima Island, Northern part of
Okinawa Island, and Iriomote Island.

**(1) Deployment of the U.S. Aircraft Carrier to**

**Commander Fleet Activities, Yokosuka**

The presence of the U.S. Pacific Fleet plays an important
role in ensuring maritime security in the Indo-Pacific
region as well as regional peace and stability. The U.S.
aircraft carrier provides the core capabilities of the Fleet.

The U.S. Navy affirms that it will continue to ensure

that all of its nuclear-powered vessels anchoring in
Japan’s ports, including the nuclear-powered aircraft
carrier[17] which is forward-deployed at Commander
Fleet Activities, Yokosuka (Yokosuka City, Kanagawa


**17 Nuclear-powered aircraft carriers do not need refueling and they are able to maintain high speeds necessary for the operations of aircraft, giving them excellent combat and operational**

Prefecture), adhere to the relevant safety policies. For
example, the nuclear reactors will normally be shut
down while the vessels are anchored, and repair of the
nuclear reactors and refueling will not be carried out in
Japan. The Government of Japan will also continue to
take all possible measures to ensure safety. The nuclearpowered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan departed
from Yokosuka in the spring of 2024, and is scheduled to
be replaced by the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS
George Washington later that year.

**(2) Realignment, etc. of USFJ Facilities and Areas**
With regard to the realignment of facilities and areas
of the USFJ in Kanagawa Prefecture, the release of
facilities and areas including Kamiseya Communication
Station and Fukaya Communication Site has already
been realized based on the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee
agreement of October 2004.

Meanwhile, more than 10 years have passed since the


initial agreement, and security environment surrounding
Japan is becoming increasingly severe. Therefore, there
have been changes in the U.S. Navy’s posture and
capabilities, as represented by the increased operations
of the U.S. vessels at Commander Fleet Activities,
Yokosuka. In light of such circumstances, the following
were agreed at the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee meeting
in November 2018: (1) development of facilities for
satisfying the U.S. Navy’s facility requirements; (2)
start of negotiations on joint use of Negishi Dependent
Housing Area to conduct site restoration works; and
(3) cancellation of the construction of family housing
units in the Yokohama portion of Ikego Housing Area
and Navy Annex. Subsequently, joint use of Negishi
Dependent Housing Area was agreed upon at the JapanU.S. Joint Committee meeting in November 2019.

MOD's Approach under the vision of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP)


**Background**

〇 In August 2016, then Prime Minister Abe unveiled the “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” concept in his keynote speech in the 6th Tokyo International Conference on
African Development (TICAD VI) held in Kenya.
〇 Japan’s fundamental aim is to foster regional stability and prosperity by improving connectivity between Asia and Africa through a free and open Indo-Pacific
region.

-  Prime Minister Kishida announced Japan’s new plan for a FOIP in his policy speech at the Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA) held in India in March 2023.

**Basic concepts of “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”**

〇 The Indo-Pacific region is the center of the world vitality and home to more than half the world population; realizing the stable and autonomous development in
this region is crucial for the stability and prosperity of the world.
〇 The goal of “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” Vision is to facilitate free and robust economic activity throughout the Indo-Pacific, and to realize the prosperity in the
entire region.

**New Pillars of Cooperation for FOIP**

(1) Principles for peace and rules for prosperity (2) Addressing challenges in an Indo-Pacific way
(3) Multilayered connectivity (4) Extending efforts for security and safe use of the “sea” to the “air”

**✓✓ Japan is pursuing the “Free and Open Indo Pacific (FOIP)” Vision through a coordinated whole-of-government approach.**


**Characteristics of the Indo-Pacific Region**

〇 The Indo-Pacific region is at the center of global economic dynamism and home to the largest share of the world’s population. Key sea lanes are located in the
Indo-Pacific area; as a result, regional stability is essential to Japan’s security and prosperity.
〇 Meanwhile, there are various challenges within the region, including rapid military modernization and intensified military activities.
〇 All countries in the region are taking measures to respond to these rapid changes in the environment.

**Aspects of MOD’s Approach**

〇 Securing the stable use of major sea lanes by defense cooperation and exchange activities
〇 Preventing contingencies through confidence-building and mutual understanding
〇 Contributing to peace and stability through active engagement in the region, in cooperation with partner countries

〇 The MOD/SDF is collaborating positively with Indo-Pacific countries such as the United States, Australia, India, Canada, New Zealand, and also countries in Europe
including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy, all of which share values inherent to the FOIP Vision and have ties to the region.


**✓ As “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” is an inclusive vision, Japan welcomes cooperation with all countries that share its values.**

Fig. III-3-1-1 Defense Cooperation and Exchanges


**Defense cooperation and exchanges**

“Defense cooperation and exchanges” refers to efforts to strengthen bilateral and multilateral defense relations by using various tools, which are significant initiatives
for securing the peace and stability of Japan and the international community.

**Purpose of defense cooperation and exchanges**

〇 To create a security environment desirable for Japan
〇 To deter threats from reaching Japan by making opponents realize that doing harm to Japan would be difficult and consequential
〇 To prevent contingencies through promoting confidence-building and mutual understanding

**Tools for defense cooperation and exchanges**

**Tool ① Cooperation and exchanges among people**
… On such occasions as “2+2” Meetings, defense ministerial meetings, chief of staff-level meetings or other high-level meetings, working-level consultations among defense
authorities, and multilateral international conferences, participants frankly exchange views on defense policies, regional affairs, defense cooperation and exchanges, etc., thereby
developing mutual understanding and confidence-building among them and further promoting defense cooperation and exchanges thereafter. Exchanges of students and interchange
in education and research aim to facilitate understanding of defense policies and statuses of military units of other countries and promote relations of trust through network building.

**Tool ② Cooperation and exchanges among assets**
… Through goodwill exercise, mutual visits of naval ships and aircraft (calling at ports and airports), exchange events among units, and other measures, mutual trust
with partner countries is developed and cooperative relationships are promoted. In joint training and exercises, the SDF will enhance the skills of each unit and strengthen
nation-to-nation defense relationships through by increasing collaborative capacity with foreign military assets.

**Tool ③ Capacity building**
… Capacity building aims to improve the capabilities of partner countries in a concrete and steady manner over a certain period of time, and help their military forces
play roles in contributing to international peace and regional stability. It is conducted through activities such as seminars and practical training in various fields, the provision
of technical guidance, opinion exchanges, and the observation of education and training programs, etc.

in January 2022, coming into force in August 2023).
In addition, based on the new Japan-Australia Joint
Declaration on Security Cooperation (JDSC)[1] signed in
October 2022, the National Defense Strategy of Japan
(NDS) states that the two countries will further deepen
their defense cooperation and build a closer relationship
second only to the Japan-U.S. defense cooperation.

Based on the new JDSC as well, the two countries

The United Kingdom, being a major power that has
influence not only in Europe but also in the rest of the
world, has historically maintained close relations with
Japan. On the security front, Japan shares the same
strategic interests as the United Kingdom, as both
countries are important allies of the United States. Given
this relationship, it is extremely important for Japan
to promote cooperation with the United Kingdom by
working together on global issues, such as international
peace cooperation activities, counterterrorism, counterpiracy operations and cybersecurity as well as by
exchanging information on regional affairs. Additionally,
in recent years, the United Kingdom has made important
contributions to ensuring a rule-based maritime order by
dispatching a Career Strike Group to the Indo-Pacific
region and permanently deploying two patrol vessels

**a. Significance of Defense Cooperation and Exchanges**

**with Djibouti**

Djibouti is an important country as it is the only country
where the SDF has an overseas facility that is used for
counter piracy. The facility has been used to transport
supplies to the unit dispatched to United Nations Mission
in the Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS) as well as
for trainings as part of Japan’s disaster response capacity
building for Djibouti.

Additionally, the SDF facility in Djibouti was used

as a standby location for transportation of Japanese
nationals and others in the Republic of Sudan in April
2023 and Israel in October 2023.

The National Security Strategy of Japan (NSS) and

other documents state that Japan will, while obtaining
the understanding of the government of Djibouti, utilize
this operation facility on a long-term and stable basis to
strengthen operational bases in African countries, etc.,
including the rescue and transportation of Japanese
nationals and others overseas. In December 2023, Japan
concluded an exchange of notes with the government
of the Republic of Djibouti enabling Notes between


the Government of Japan and the Government of the
Republic of Djibouti concerning the status of the SelfDefense Force of Japan in the Republic of Djibouti[16] to
apply mutatis mutandis to secure the status of the SDF
in Djibouti responsible to rescue and transport Japanese
nationals and others overseas as well as responsible for

numerous security concerns between Japan and China,
it was important to have candid discussions between the
defense authorities of the two countries and Minister of
National Defence Li expressed the same view.

Regarding the regional affairs, then Minister of

Defense Hamada reiterated serious concerns about the
situations in the East China Sea, including the Senkaku
Islands and the South China Sea and expressed grave
concerns about the continued joint military actions by
China and Russia in the vicinity of Japan. In addition,
Minister Hamada re-emphasized the importance of
peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.

Besides, regarding communication between the

defense authorities of Japan and China, the two ministers
reaffirmed that the Hotline between Japanese and
Chinese Defense Authorities, which began operating in
May 2023, would operate appropriately and reliably and
agreed to continue to promote dialogue and exchange
going forward.

In November 2023, Prime Minister Kishida held a

summit meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on
the occasion of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) summit meeting held in the United States. At the
meeting, the two leaders confirmed the comprehensive
promotion of a “mutually beneficial relationship based
on common strategic interests,” and Prime Minister
Kishida spoke about the importance of communication
in the security field, while welcoming the start of
operation of the Hotline between Japanese and Chinese
Defense Authorities under the “Maritime and Aerial
Communication Mechanism between the Japan-China
Defense Authorities”.

**(3) Initiatives of Each Service**
In July 2023, the Japan-China Field Officer Exchange
Program implemented by the Sasakawa Peace Foundation
resumed face-to-face exchanges for the first time in four
years after its discontinuance due to the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic and other factors. The SDF field
officer-level delegation to China visited a think tank

**(4)** **Maritime and Aerial Communication Mechanism**

**between the Defense Authorities of Japan and China**

Utilization of the Maritime and Aerial Communication
Mechanism began in June 2018. The “Maritime and
Aerial Communication Mechanism between the Defense
Authorities of Japan and China” has been developed
(1) to promote mutual understanding and confidence
between Japan and China and to enhance bilateral
defense cooperation and exchanges; (2) to avoid
unexpected collisions; and (3) to prevent unforeseen
circumstances in the sea and air from developing into
military clashes or political or diplomatic issues. The
mechanism’s main components include (1) annual and
expert meetings between the two countries’ defense
authorities; (2) a hotline between Japanese and Chinese
defense authorities; and (3) on scene communication
measures between vessels and aircraft of the SDF and

**15** **Russia**

Russia’s aggression against Ukraine that began in
February 2022 clearly undermines the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Ukraine, is a serious violation of
international law, including the Charter of the United
Nations which forbids the use of force and is an absolutely
unacceptable act. Such unilateral changes to the status
quo by force shake the foundations of the international
order and under this position, the Government of Japan
condemns Russia to the utmost degree.

The Government of Japan handles the relationship

with Russia appropriately while emphasizing the
solidarity of the G7 and taking the Ukrainian situation
into account. At the same time, it is also necessary to
maintain the minimum essential contacts with Russia,
as it is one of Japan’s neighbors, to avoid unforeseen
circumstances or unnecessary conflicts.

(2) JASMINE

In November 2023, at the 8th ASEAN-Japan Defence

Ministers’ Informal Meeting, Defense Minister Kihara
newly presented the “JASMINE” to advance JapanASEAN defense cooperation to a new level.

Taking the current security environment into account

and in line with the spirit of the “Vientiane Vision 2.0,”
JASMINE proposed specific defense cooperation that
Japan would like to pursue together with ASEAN to
realize the shared vision of the future for the Indo-Pacific
region[25] Its four pillars are: (1) Japan-ASEAN to carry
out efforts to create a security environment that does not
allow any unilateral attempts to change the status quo
by force or coercion, (2) to continue and expand the
Japan-ASEAN defense cooperation, (3) to pursue further
friendship and opportunities between Japan and ASEAN
defense officials and (4) to support defense cooperation
between ASEAN, Japan, and the Pacific Island countries.

The specific initiatives proposed and announced

include: the first seminar between Japan and ASEAN on
the rule of law and security in the space domain; further
support for confidence building and improvement of
situational awareness in both maritime and air domains;
seeking synergies between the Official Security
Assistance (OSA) and existing projects such as the
transfer of defense equipment and technology as well
as capacity building in both hardware and software;
cooperation between ASEAN, Japan and Pacific Island
countries through the Ship Rider Cooperation Program
and others, and the launch of a new Japan-ASEAN
Capacity Building programs on WPS.

**(2) Security Dialogues in the Pacific Islands Region**
**a. South Pacific Defence Ministers’ Meeting (SPDMM)**
SPDMM is an important framework for the security of
the Pacific Islands Region, where defense ministers from
seven countries, including three Pacific Island countries
(Tonga, Papua New Guinea and Fiji) that have their


own militaries and others gather, and Japan has been
attending this meeting as an observer since 2022.

The 8th meeting, held in December 2023 discussed

the impacts of strategic competition on the stability of the
South Pacific, as well as traditional and non-traditional
security challenges such as climate change, IUU fishing
and threats in cyberspace.
**B. Multilateral Security Dialogues Hosted by the MOD/**

**SDF, etc.**

**a. Japan Pacific Islands Defense Dialogue (JPIDD)**
Since 2021, the MOD has been hosting the JPIDD
and inviting both Pacific Island countries and regional
partner countries to further promote defense and
security cooperation and strengthen cooperation among
Japan, Pacific Island countries and partner countries in
addressing regional security challenges. Although the
first meeting in 2021 was held online due to the impacts
of the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2024, Defense
Minister Kihara held the second meeting in Tokyo, the
first face-to-face meeting.

**Chapter**


During the second meeting, the participants exchanged

wide-ranging views on common security issues and the
efforts of each country to address them and had a lively
discussion on future cooperation and partnership in the
Pacific Islands Region. During this meeting, Defense
Minister Kihara presented the “Cooperation Concept for
United Security Efforts in the Pacific Islands Region”
as a pointer for future cooperation in the region and the
participating countries expressed their welcome to this
concept.

**24 SDF personnel serve as instructors in capacity building for ASEAN countries’ cybersecurity personnel with the aim of enabling them to respond more appropriately to cyber incidents.**
**25 Japan and ASEAN have confirmed their “shared view to promote a rules-based Indo-Pacific region that is free and open.”**
**26 In addition to the Pacific Island countries with military forces, Australia, Chile, New Zealand and France are member countries, with Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom**

**b. Concept of Cooperation for Integrated Security**

**Initiatives in the Pacific Islands Region**

At the second JPIDD in March 2024, Defense Minister
Kihara presented the “5 Point Cooperation Concept,”
which combines three principles and two coordination
points that Japan values in further promoting cooperation
in the fields of defense and security in the Pacific Islands
Region.

The three principles are (1) Respecting Centrality,

Unity and Ownership of Pacific Island Countries, (2)
Strengthening Equal, Mutually Beneficial and Supportive
Relationships and (3) Supporting Collaboration among
the Pacific Island Countries, Japan and ASEAN. Two
coordination points are (1) Strengthening Coordination
between JPIDD and SPDMM and (2) Strengthening
Coordination between JPIDD and PALM. Based on this
concept, the MOD/ SDF will further promote defense
and security cooperation in the Pacific Islands Region.

**(3) Others**
**a. International** **Conferences** **Hosted** **by** **Private**

**Organizations and Others**

International conferences on security include not only
intergovernmental conferences but also meetings
organized by private organizations in which various
people, such as government officials, scholars and
journalists, participate to discuss medium- to long- term
security issues.

Major international conferences organized by private

bodies include the IISS Asia Security Summit (ShangriLa Dialogue)[27] and IISS Regional Security Summit
(Manama Dialogue)[28] organized by the International
Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) and the Munich
Security Conference,[29] one of the most prestigious
meetings on security in Europe and the United States.
By actively participating in these conferences, Japan’s
Defense Minister and MOD officials build trust and
share understanding with high-level officials of various
countries and send out positive messages through
meetings with defense ministers and representatives
from other countries and delivering speeches at plenary
sessions.

In June 2023, then Defense Minister Hamada attended


and gave a speech at the 20th Shangri La Dialogue. In
his speech, Minister Hamada first mentioned Russia’s
aggression against Ukraine and as the lessons from it,
underlined the importance of preventing confrontation
and the importance of a free and open international
order based on maritime law. He also insisted that the
international community should unite to deter unilateral
changes to the status quo or such attempts by force or
coercion.

After pointing out that in the Indo-Pacific region,

especially regarding the East China Sea and the South
China Sea, unilateral changes to the status quo or such
attempts by force or coercion have been made, then
Defense Minister Hamada explained that to prevent
confrontation and uphold the free and open international
order based on the rule of law, Japan has been promoting
various initiatives, such as fundamentally reinforcing
its defense capabilities based on the National Security
Strategy of Japan (NSS) and other measures and
strengthening cooperation with the ally and like-minded
countries.

Furthermore, he asserted that the enhancement of

regional deterrence by Japan as well as its ally and
like-minded countries would provide countries with a
position of strength that does not succumb to force and
would provide a solid footing for diplomatic efforts to
resolve differences in interests and opinions through
dialogue. It would also send out a message that Japan
would work with other countries to create an era toward a
world of “Cooperation and Harmony”, while continuing
to emphasize the opportunities for dialogue provided by
ASEAN-led multilayered cooperative frameworks that
exist in the region, such as the ASEAN-led East Asia
Summit, ARF and ADMM-Plus.

**(1) Pacific Partnership**
The Pacific Partnership (PP)[31] is an initiative in which
naval vessels, primarily those from the U.S. Navy,
visit countries in the Asia-Pacific region to provide
medical care, conduct facility repair activities and
engage in cultural exchange to strengthen cooperation
between countries participating in the initiative and
facilitate international peace cooperation activities
through cooperation with governments, military forces,
international organizations and non-governmental

organizations (NGOs) in those countries. In FY2023,
in Solomon Islands, Tonga, Papua New Guinea, Palau
and Fiji, the Initiative succeeded in strengthening ties
with participating countries through exchanges such as
mangrove planting, on-site inspection training, medical
support on a U.S. Navy hospital ship, etc. and musical
performances.

**(2) Multilateral Exercises**
The multilateral relationships have recently shifted from
the phase for building trust to the phase for developing
more concrete and practical cooperative relationships.
Various multilateral training and exercises have been
actively conducted as important initiatives to effectively
help this shift.

In particular, in the Indo-Pacific region, the MOD/

SDF has actively participated in multilateral training
and exercises in non-traditional security fields, such
as HA/DR and Non-combatant Evacuation Operations

to participate in such multilateral exercises so as not
only to the skill level of the SDF, but also to create a
cooperative platform with relevant countries. In light of
this perspective, the MOD/SDF intends to continue to
actively engage in such training.

In 2017, the MSDF began the Indo-Pacific

implementation of policies and measures with gender

Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Defense Matsumoto at the 3rd meeting of the HQ for WPS

Promotion in MOD

Promoting WPS will produce an environment where

diverse individuals, including women, can demonstrate
their abilities. Diversity is also important for improving
operational efficiency.

Accordingly, promoting WPS is essential for

reinforcing defense capabilities as it will lead to the
development of human resources and organizational
capacity building in the MOD.

Third, with regards to contributing to international

peace and stability, the New Plan for a “FOIP” announced
by Prime Minister Kishida in 2023 clearly states that
the principles for peace and rules for prosperity is the
backbone of FOIP, and therefore it prescribes response
from a perspective of WPS, in order to create an
international environment where the weak are not beaten
by force. WPS perspectives are essential to ensure
more effective implementation of the SDF’s overseas
activities, including PKO and international disaster relief
activities. As a responsible member of the international
community, the MOD will also promote WPS and
contribute to peace and stability, while cooperating with
defense authorities of other countries pursuing respect
for fundamental human rights and ensuring the rule of
law.


**(1) Rationales and Significance of Promoting WPS**
Promoting WPS contributes to the protection of life,
person, etc., of Japanese nationals and fundamental
reinforcement of defense capabilities as well as
international peace and stability. With this standpoint,
the MOD/SDF must promote WPS.

Specifically, first, with regards to the protection of life,

person, etc., of Japanese nationals, there are increased
opportunities in recent years to conduct operations,
such as the transportation of Japanese nationals and
others overseas, as well as tailored livelihood support
for affected population by disaster. In this context, the
MOD/SDF will directly protect the life, person, etc.,
of Japanese nationals by systematically responding to
situations by incorporating WPS perspectives, based on
the needs of women and girls who compose half of the
population and who are put in particularly vulnerable
situation in conflicts and such.

Second, regarding the fundamental reinforcement

of defense capabilities, the WPS Agenda includes the
promotion of the participation of women in decisionmaking processes. This includes in the field of security,
and is closely related to the measures that MOD has
been taking to promote the active engagement of female
personnel.

response. Meanwhile, there was an overall challenge of
failing to make each and every personnel fully aware of
WPS and appreciate the significance of reflecting gender
perspectives in policy planning and development.

Given this challenge, the HQ for WPS Promotion

in MOD was established in 2023, headed by the
Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Defense, to raise
awareness among all SDF personnel and strengthen
international cooperation efforts. In addition, Director for
International Cooperation on WPS was newly appointed.

The first meeting of the HQ for WPS Promotion in

MOD, headed by then Parliamentary Vice-Minister of
Defense Onoda, was held in August 2023. The second
meeting, headed by Parliamentary Vice-Minister of
Defense Matsumoto was conducted in January 2024. In
April 2024, the third meeting was convened, and based
on previous discussions at the HQ, the MOD adopted a
WPS Promotion Plan for the first time. The MOD WPS
Promotion Plan sets forth items to be implemented by
FY2028 for the MOD to promote WPS, and is based on
the National Action Plan for WPS.

It lists four specific initiatives: (1) change of mindset,

(2) structural development, (3) international cooperation
and (4) reflection of gender perspectives in SDF activities.
It also prescribes a follow-up system to evaluate the
implementation status of the initiatives by convening an
annual meeting of the HQ for WPS Promotion in MOD.

Based on the MOD WPS Promotion Plan, the MOD

will strongly promote WPS as a whole of Ministry effort,
and contribute to protecting Japanese nationals and
international peace and stability by conducting activities
incorporating gender perspectives.

**(3) Recent Major Initiatives and Activities on WPS**
From 2021 to 2024, Japan co-chaired the ASEAN
Defence Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM-Plus) Experts’
Working Group (EWG) on Peacekeeping Operations
(PKO) with Viet Nam and led on the promotion of WPS
initiatives. As the co-chair, Japan set the promotion
of WPS as one of the main objectives of the EWG
activities, and established a WPS platform.[35] Japan also
invited experts from the U.N. to participate, including in
four WPS seminars, to contribute to raising awareness
on WPS in each country. At the Competency Evaluation
Program for Prospective UN Peacekeepers (CEPPP)
flagship event held in Viet Nam in September 2023,

The MOD has carried out WPS-related activities both

domestically and internationally, and now that a WPS structure
has been established in the ministry, various activities can be
conducted even more efficiently and effectively.

We have received invitations and requests for WPS

collaborations from many countries and feel that there is a growing
attention to WPS in this issue in the international community.

WPS perspectives were also shared.

Since 2023, WPS elements have been newly

incorporated into the ongoing capacity building
programs for Indo-Pacific countries in the area of PKO
and HA/DR by delivering WPS Seminars and opinion
exchanges, to raise awareness among defense officials
in each country. At the 8th ASEAN-Japan Defence
Ministers’ Informal Meeting held in November 2023,
Defense Minister Kihara announced the launch of a new
Japan-ASEAN Capacity Building Program on WPS.

Additionally, the Director for International Cooperation

on WPS and uniformed SDF personnel are dispatched as
presenters to training and international conferences on
WPS hosted by other countries and international bodies
such as NATO to introduce MOD/SDF initiatives, and
gain insights from those countries that are promoting
WPS. The outcomes of these activities are referred in

natural disaster in the Indo-Pacific region, Japan has
conducted emergency humanitarian assistance activities
including the dispatch of the Japan Disaster Relief Team
(JDR). Disaster response by the SDF can be expected
both domestically and internationally.

The MOD/SDF, as a whole-of-ministry, will reflect


WPS perspectives in its disaster relief activities. This
will enable the MOD/SDF systematically respond to the
situations with understanding and consideration to the
needs of affected people, including women, in disaster

**(2) Activities by the SDF**
**a. Dispatch of the Deployment Surface Force for**

**Counter Piracy Enforcement (DSPE) and Other Units**

The MOD/SDF dispatches the DSPE, the Deployment
Air Force for Counter Piracy Enforcement (DAPE)
and the Deployment Support Group for Counter Piracy
Enforcement (DGPE) to carry out counter-piracy
operations.

The DSPE strives to ensure the safety of ships

navigating in the area by using destroyers (one destroyer
dispatched) in two different manners - direct escort of
private vessels across the Gulf of Aden and zone defense
in allocated areas in the Gulf of Aden. There are JCG
officers aboard the destroyer.[5]

The DAPE conducts counter-piracy activities using the

P-3C patrol aircraft (one aircraft dispatched). The DAPE
conducts warning and surveillance operations in the flight
zone that is determined in coordination with the CTF151 Headquarters and confirms any suspicious boats. At
the same time, the unit also provides information to the
Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) destroyers,
the naval vessels of other countries and civilian vessels,
responding by such means as confirming the safety of
the surrounding area immediately, if requested. The
information gathered by the MSDF P-3C is constantly
shared with other related organizations and contributes
significantly to deterring acts of piracy and disarming
vessels suspected as pirate ships.

To improve the operational efficiency and effectiveness

of the DAPE, the DGPE carries out activities such as
maintenance of the installation set up in the northwest
district of Djibouti International Airport.

Additionally, the Airlift Squadron and other units,

organized as needed, operate ASDF transport aircraft to
carry out air transport of materials required mainly by

the DAPE and the DGPE.

The NDS and other documents state that the SDF

operation facility in Djibouti, which is being operated
for counter-piracy operations, will be utilized for the
rescue and transportation of Japanese nationals and
others overseas, while obtaining the understanding of the
Djibouti government. In December 2023, the Cabinet of
Japan approved the “Government Initiative to Ensure
the Safety of Japanese Nationals and Others Overseas in
the Middle East and Africa.” and added a new mission
for counter-piracy unit to maintain a temporary posture
for the possible rescue and transportation of Japanese
nationals and others overseas, including accumulating
and managing equipment.

**See** Chapter 1, Section 7-2 (Rescue and Transport of Japanese

Nationals and Others Overseas)

countries engaged in counter-piracy operations and
enhance the effectiveness of the SDF’s counter-piracy
operations, the MOD has dispatched SDF personnel to

**(3)** **Tense Middle East Situation and the SDF’s Response**
Due to the clashes between Israeli and the Palestinian
militants, in October 2023, amid the tense situation in the
Middle East due to military clashes between Israel and
Hamas, the Houthi rebel group in Yemen, which stands
in solidarity with Palestine, has repeatedly attacked
civilian merchant ships and other vessels in the Red Sea
and Gulf of Aden, causing some civilian casualties. In
November of the same year, a ship operated by Nippon
Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha was seized.[6] In the same
month, at least one ballistic missile was launched toward


the CTF-151 and CMF headquarters since August 2014.
Of these, the SDF dispatched a CTF-151 commander for
the first time in 2015, followed by respective dispatches
in 2017, 2018 and 2020.
**c. Achievements**

As of March 31, 2024, the DSPE has escorted 4,076

vessels (including 121 vessels escorted based on orders
for maritime security operations). The DAPE is also
responsible for most of the countries’ warning and
surveillance activities in the Gulf of Aden. As of the same
date, it has flown 3,267 times, totaling approximately
23,360 flight hours and provided information 16,299
times to ships and other countries engaged in counterpiracy operations. In November 2023, upon receiving
information that the Liberian-flagged tanker “Central

The Liaison branch has been staffed with two staff

officers since April 2019, with staff who are working on
liaison and coordination with Egypt and Israel, as well
as preparing medium- and long-term operational policies
related to the same.

Since June 2023, two staff officers have been

dispatched to Force Engineering Office, Support branch
to work on planning and progress management related to
the renewal of various facilities at the MFO. Additionally,
one liaison staff member has been dispatched to Cairo to
liaise and coordinate with the relevant organizations in
order to help the officers dispatched to the MFO carry
out activities smoothly and effectively.

These activities demonstrate Japan’s more active

involvement in the peace and stability of the Middle
East. This is also expected to promote collaboration with
the U.S. and other countries dispatching officers, and to
provide opportunities for human resources development.

**2** **UNMISS**

**(1)** **Significance of the Dispatch of Personnel to UNMISS**
In July 2011 following South Sudan’s independence,
with the objective of consolidating peace and security
as well as helping South Sudan to establish necessary
conditions for the development, the UNMISS was
established. In response to requests from UN for
cooperation with UNMISS, particularly for dispatching
GSDF engineering units, Japan has dispatched units and
personnel including staff officers to the Headquarters
and SDF engineering units.

South Sudan shares borders with six countries and is

positioned in a highly important location, connecting the
African continent on all four points of the compass. The
peace and stability of South Sudan is essential not only
for the country itself; but also for the peace and stability
in its neighboring countries, which leads to those of the
whole Africa, as well as a crucial issue that should be
dealt with by the international community. Based on the
experiences gained through past PKO, the MOD/SDF
has contributed to the peace and stability of South Sudan
by providing personnel cooperation in infrastructure
development, which is highly expected by the UN.

UNMISS is the only UN PKO to which Japan

currently dispatches its personnel and the dispatch of
staff officers supports the progress of the peace process in
South Sudan together with the international community.
It is significant for Japan to continue dispatching its
staff officers from the perspectives of maintaining close
involvement in the UN, cooperation with neighboring
African countries, and securing opportunities for human
resource development.

activities; the intelligence staff officer collects and
compiles information on public safety conditions; the
engineering staff officer plans and proposes UNMISS

officer prepares flight plans for aircraft operated by
UNMISS.

Of the two additional uniformed GSDF personnel

dispatched in 2024, the DCOS (PET) operates and
supervises the personnel, evaluation and training
divisions at the UNMISS force headquarters, while
the PA provides support to the DCOS (PET) to ensure
smooth implementation of the duties.

Additionally, one liaison staff member has been

dispatched to the liaison office in the Embassy of Japan
in South Sudan to support the activities of Japanese staff
officers. This member liaises and coordinates with the
South Sudan Government and the International Peace
Cooperation Corps in South Sudan to ensure Japan’s
smooth and efficient cooperation with UNMISS.

In this way, Japan will continue to contribute to

UNMISS activities.

Considering that 30% or more of PKO personnel are

from Asia, Japan has been conducting the program in
Asia and the surrounding area since 2018. In June 2023,
24 GSDF personnel were dispatched to the Indonesia
Peace and Security Centre to contribute to the acquisition
of knowledge and skills necessary for infrastructure
development and building camps in PKO for the military
engineers of Indonesia and neighboring countries. From
the start of the program until March 2024, a total of 116
GSDF personnel were dispatched to provide a total of 5
training sessions for 95 personnel from 10 countries in
Asia and the surrounding regions.

Additionally, the UN decided to extend the scope of

support under the UNTPP to the field of sanitation and
established the UN Field Medical Assistant Course[3]
(UNFMAC), given that strengthening sanitation capacity
to ensure the safety of deployed personnel has become
an issue in UN peacekeeping operations. In July 2023,
the MOD/SDF dispatched one GSDF personnel as the
instructor to said course held at the UN Regional Service
Centre Entebbe in Uganda, providing education to 25
personnel dispatched.

Japan has so far earned unquestionable trust in the areas of
engineering and transport that are essential for promoting
smooth peacekeeping operations. To continue to support
the rapid deployment of peacekeeping missions and
implement high quality activities, Japan expressed its
active support at the PKO Summit in September 2014
and it was embodied by the UNTPP.

The UNTPP was founded using funds from Japan as a

project to support training for military engineers and the
procurement of heavy equipment by the UN DOS. From
the start of the program to March 2024, a total of 184
GSDF personnel have been dispatched to the African
region to provide 10 training sessions for a total of 312
members from 8 African countries.

project and since 2000, GSDF personnel with expertise
in chemicals and ammunitions have been dispatched to
conduct excavation and recovery projects on a total of 20
times (As of September, 2023).

In addition, MOD officials are dispatched to major

meetings such as the Wassenaar Arrangement, the
Australia Group (AG) and the Missile Technology
Control Regime (MTCR), which are international export
control regimes and have made proposals to contribute
to non-proliferation of key technologies from security
perspectives. Moreover, Japan has been cooperating to
enhance the effectiveness of regulations and decisions,
such as by dispatching SDF personnel to training
conducted by the Preparatory Commission for the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization
(CTBTO).

Japan has concluded various conventions on the

regulation of conventional weapons such as the
Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of
Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed
to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate
Effects (CCW), based on humanitarian perspectives
and security needs. In addition, Japan has signed the
Convention on Cluster Munitions (Oslo Convention),[2]


which was adopted outside the framework of the CCW.
With the entry of this Convention, the disposal of all
cluster munitions possessed by the SDF was completed
in February 2015.

In addition, the MOD/SDF dispatches its personnel

also to the Group of Governmental Experts meetings
related to Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems
(LAWS) and other events as necessary under the CCW
framework. Discussions related to Lethal Autonomous
Weapons Systems (LAWS) are under way from the
perspectives of their characteristics, human involvement,
international law and other matters. Japan is continuing
its active involvement in the discussions, while also
considering the standpoints of national security.

Additionally, international discussions about the

impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the military
domain have been intensifying in recent years, and
in February 2023, then Vice-Minister of Defense for
International Affairs Oka attended the “Responsible AI
in the Military Domain (REAIM)” Summit 2023 held in
the Netherlands.

Regarding the prohibition of anti-personnel mines,

Japan has actively cooperated in the initiatives of the
international community that focus on the prohibition
of anti-personnel mines by submitting annual reports
that include data on Japan’s exceptional stocks to the
Secretariat of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention
(Ottawa Treaty).[3]

Japan also submits an annual Confidence-Building

Measures report in relation to the Biological Weapons
Convention (BWC) and reported on the facilities of the
National Defense Medical College and the Acquisition,
Technology & Logistics Agency (ATLA) in that report.

In addition, the MOD/SDF provide an annual report

under the frameworks of the UN Register of Conventional
Arms, the UN Report on Military Expenditures and the
Arms Trade Treaty (ATT),[4] which aim to increase the
transparency of military preparedness and military
expenditure. The MOD/SDF also dispatch personnel
as needed to governmental expert meetings and other
meetings for reviewing and improving these systems.

**1** **Act on Enhancing Defense Production and Technology Bases and its Basic Policy**

Japan’s defense industry is responsible for each stage
of the life cycle of defense equipment (research,
development, production, sustainment and maintenance,
supply, decommissioning, etc.). In this context, defense
equipment and the defense industry are inseparable. The
Act on Enhancing Defense Production and Technology
Bases[3] was enacted in June 2023 and enforced in
October of the same year in order to take necessary
measures to maintain and enhance the ability of the
defense industry to produce advanced equipment and
ensure high operational rates. Under this Act, the
Minister of Defense is supposed to establish a basic
policy,[4] which was announced in October 2023. This Launching ceremony of the Mogami class destroyer JS “Yubetsu” (November 2023)
basic policy prescribes the matters necessary to ensure
adequate implementation of the measures stipulated in the perspectives of ensuring Japan’s independence in
the Act. Also, it indicates the new direction on how to the security environment, enhancing its deterrence,

principle that bases related to defense equipment, which
should not be dependent on other countries, should be
maintained and enhanced domestically. Therefore, it
is necessary to promote international joint research
and development in addition to active international
cooperation and licensed production, contributing to
incorporating the excellent technologies of various
countries into Japan’s defense equipment.

The transfer of defense equipment and technology is

a key policy instrument to ensure peace and stability,
especially in the Indo-Pacific region, to deter unilateral
changes to the status quo by force, create a desirable
security environment for Japan, and provide assistance
to countries that are subject to aggression in violation
of international law, use of force, or threat by force.
Accordingly, the government and private sector will
make joint efforts to promote the smooth transfer of
defense equipment and technology of high-security
significance and international joint development in
various fields.


disrupted due to the spread of COVID 19. Under these
circumstances, the need to maintain and reinforce bases
in Japan has become even greater from the perspective
of ensuring stable manufacturing of defense equipment
directly concerning the defense of Japan, as well as
securing technological superiority.

**(2) Approach to Procurement of Defense Equipment**
On the premise of acquiring defense equipment which
meets required performance for the defense of Japan, it
is necessary to decide how to acquire defense equipment
according to the necessity to ensure continuous
acquisition, sustainment and maintenance of the defense
equipment in terms of expenses, and from the viewpoints
of nurturing sectors in which Japan has a comparative
advantage and complementing sectors in which Japan is
falling behind or lacking, in addition to the growing need
to maintain and reinforce bases in Japan. Specifically,
when acquiring new defense equipment, domestically
produced equipment will be pursued, focusing on the
following areas:
(a) Defense equipment that can meet various conditions, such

as operational concepts, performance, acquisition cost, life
cycle cost, schedule, etc., with domestic technologies

(b) Defense equipment that is essential in maintaining war

sustainability in the event of a contingency as well as
in ensuring for the ability to improve operations and
maintenance in peacetime (e.g., ammunition and ships)

(c) Items that should not be dependent on foreign countries from

the perspective of confidentiality (e.g., communications,
cryptography)

(d) Defense equipment that is indispensable for realizing

operational concepts that consider Japan’s geographical
and policy peculiarities

(e) The latest technologies from foreign countries that are hard

to obtain

(f) Potential target of external threats through economic means


**(4) Ideal State of the Defense Industry**
It is of utmost importance that the defense industry
maintain the capacity to manufacture the necessary
defense equipment and support high operational rates.

In addition, to make the Japanese defense industry

internationally competitive like the defense industries
of foreign countries including European countries and
the U.S., it is important to review the industrial structure
and build a defense industry led by companies with a
high degree of defense demand dependence (the ratio of
defense-related sales).

**（5） Roles of the Government and Defense**

**Equipment Manufacturers in Ensuring Stable**
**Manufacturing of Defense Equipment**

While the government emphasizes creating an environment
in which the defense equipment manufacturers can work
on defense projects and determine to continue such
projects further, defense equipment manufacturers[5]
are expected to proactively act on the government’s
initiatives to maintain and enhance the bases, newly
recognizing that they are essential entities responsible
for national defense.

**(3) Approach to International Cooperation**
As countries these days compete fiercely in R&D in
the military field and make remarkable technological
progress, it is difficult for each country to maintain
necessary bases without cooperating with other countries.

**2 �Measures Based on the Act on Enhancing**

**Defense Production and Technology Bases**

**(1) Specific Initiatives (reinforcing supply chain**

**resilience, improving manufacturing process**
**efficiency, enhancing cybersecurity, supporting**
**business succession, etc.)**

Various risks are assumed to impede the stable
manufacturing of defense equipment, such as the risk of
difficulty in importing raw materials because of export
restrictions imposed by a foreign government, the risk
of delay in delivery or failure to meet the performance
requirements because of sluggish productivity and
technological standards caused by aging facilities that
have not been renewed, the risk of major concerns
for any parts infected with malware or spyware in
the manufacturing process, the risk of leakage of
information on performance due to cyber attacks, and
the risk of withdrawing from defense projects because
it has become challenging to continue the business.
The following specific initiatives need to be taken by
defense equipment manufacturers to respond to such
risks effectively and ensure the supply chain consisting
of prime contractors and suppliers functions more
effectively and efficiently, thereby contributing to stable
manufacturing of designated defense equipment.[6]

(a) Reinforcing supply chain resilience

-  Domestic production and stockpiling of raw

materials

-  Research and development of alternate materials

and products

(b) Improving manufacturing process efficiency

-  Introduce state-of-the-art equipment and

technologies

-  Automate inspection processes by introducing AI

(c) Enhancing cybersecurity

-  Enhance information systems

-  Employee training

(d) Support for business succession, etc.

-  Maintain manufacturing facilities

-  Employee training (acquisition of technology and

know-how), etc.

Following the Basic Policy, the Minister of Defense

shall approves plans for specific initiatives submitted by
defense equipment manufacturers. The MOD then enters
into a contract directly with the defense equipment


the contract’s provisions. In fiscal 2023, 36 projects
with a total value of approximately ¥9.9 billion were
approved.

**（2） Facilitation of Equipment Transfer and the Designated**

**Equipment Transfer Support Corporation**

When transferring defense equipment and technology,
the defense equipment manufacturer may be required
to make appropriate adjustments to specifications and
performance from the national security perspective.
In particular, it is necessary to appropriately address
concerns of losing Japan’s technological superiority
over other countries in the defense sector by securing
information on advanced technologies used in Japan’s
defense equipment.

The necessary grants are provided when the Minister

of Defense requires a defense equipment manufacturer
to adjust specifications and performance.

On February 16, 2024, the Minister of Defense

designated the Designated Equipment Transfer Support
Corporation to provide the necessary grants from the
fund and to ensure that equipment transfer conducted
by defense equipment manufacturers is carried out
smoothly and under appropriate management, in line
with the policy objectives of the MOD.

The MOD delivered 40 billion yen in FY2023 and

40 billion yen in FY2024 to the Designated Equipment
Transfer Support Corporation to establish the fund.

**(3) Protecting the Confidential of Defense Equipment**
In manufacturing defense equipment, the MOD provides
contractors with classified information on defense
equipment, such as advanced technologies, for steady
procurement of higher-quality defense equipment. On
the other hand, in recent years, the threats of leakage of
classified information in defense equipment including
cyber attacks and corporate acquisition by countries of
security concern, has become higher.

With this in mind, the classified information provided

by the government to contractors has been re-designated
as “Confidential of Defense Equipment,” explicitly
indicating to contractors and their employees that
handling such classified information requires strict
management. In addition, the same penalties currently


imposed on SDF personnel will be applied to persons
who intentionally leak these confidential, which will
prevent leakage more effectively.

In addition, with foreign governments and companies

interested in Japan’s defense industry and domestic
companies wishing to participate in the defense industry,
the Defense Industrial Security Manual, which lays out
the matters to be observed by companies having contracts

For effective measures based on the Act on Enhancing
Defense Production and Technology Bases, the defense
industry must be informed of these new systems and utilize
them. In particular, since the suppliers that constitute the
defense industry are located in every corner of Japan, the
MOD has been conducting “Kimishika-Oran seminars”
(briefing sessions held from place to place on measures
to help reinforce defense production bases) in various
parts of the country since December 2023.

The title “Kimishika-Oran” was created as a character

and a catchphrase to familiarize defense equipment
businesses with these measures. As of the end of March
2024, the seminars have been held in 11 locations across
Japan, with over 500 participants from approximately
390 companies. The MOD will continue its efforts to
promote and inform these measures for reinforcing the
defense production and technology bases.

industry and academia to build an ecosystem that will
allow us to continue to grow together, collaborating in a
sustainable, autonomous and comfortable manner while
creating synergies and ensuring technology preservation.

**(1) Create**
The MOD will take every possible measure to rapidly
strengthen our defense capability, including speeding up
the time required for R&D of functions and equipment.
The ministry will quickly implement the necessary
functions and equipment, demonstrate them in operational
fields, and reflect the results and feedback acquired in
further improvements. They will also provide functions
and equipment quickly and flexibly while actively
introducing R&D methods for early deployment. This
includes introducing new methods such as manufacturing
prototypes of an operational quality that troops can use,
trial fielding the prototypes, and demonstrating them
in the operational field as soon as possible, leading to
improved deterrence. Open innovation that actively
utilizes R&D resources and ideas outside the ministry
for solving any issues will be promoted.

The ministry’s policy, operational, and technical

divisions will work together to create the concept of
future warfare, the direction for future R&D, and the
acquisition of functions and equipment. In addition to
predicting technologies and warfare in the future, the
MOD will also engage experts from outside the ministry
with extensive knowledge of science and technology
in the civilian field to examine how technology can be
utilized against new threats.

Technical knowledge, human resources, facilities and

test equipment are the essential foundation of R&D. The
MOD will share its goals with ATLA’s research institutes
and test centers, which have the R&D infrastructure,
as well as with partners that have supported R&D
projects, to improve the predictability of industries and
implement projects in alignment with our direction for
reinforcing the defense technology base. Investments
for the continued maintenance and reinforcement of the
technology base essential to advancing R&D will be
made. The MOD will communicate and collaborate with
companies, including start-ups unfamiliar with defenserelated R&D, to establish a system that allows various
industries to participate in our projects. A technology


base that will enable defense related companies
to integrate the technologies of start-ups and other
companies into functions and equipment will be built.
The Innovative Science and Technology Initiative for
Security (ISTIS), which solicits and outsources goaloriented basic research with the expectation that it will
contribute to future R&D in the defense sector, focuses
on developing technologies in niche areas that find it
difficult to gain investments from the civilian sector
and on identifying and developing the basic research
that will expand the boundaries of the S&T field. This
program will continue to be utilized to create the new
technology base. To assign personnel who can fulfill
diverse roles to the appropriate positions flexibly and
quickly, new initiatives for human resource utilization
and promotion, such as further strengthening human
resource development and expanding the recruitment of
experienced personnel, will be actively pursued.

**(2) Nurture**
The MOD will not limit itself to past R&D experience
and will also explore technologies that should be
nurtured, actively taking brand-new approaches that
differ from conventional R&D methods. The ministry
will also encourage challenging research and create an
R&D system that can accept unpredictable technological
risks.

Given the MOD’s limited resources and the fact that

the ministry’s R&D investments are just a small part of
the S&T investments by the government of Japan, various
science and technology activities outside the ministry will
be actively utilized for defense purposes. To effectively
utilize the results of R&D with different objectives for
the defense sector, efforts will be made to concretely
communicate the needs of the ministry and the direction
of our efforts, create an environment that encourages
members of the S&T community to participate in MOD
projects, seek new partners, and build and expand
networks among researchers. An ecosystem that rewards
the efforts of industries and allows businesses to grow
naturally will also be developed. The MOD will create
new chemical reactions by fusing the defense sector
with the non-defense sector to nurture technological
solutions based on new ideas. Great efforts will be made
to maximize domestic and international STI capabilities

to nurture technologies.

The outcomes of the MOD’s R&D have also

contributed to raising Japan’s capabilities in STI.
Various R&D activities at the MOD will be promoted
to nurture Japan’s capabilities in STI, with an eye on
addressing global issues. Through ISTIS, the MOD will
expand the human resources that conduct goal-oriented
basic research, secure diverse researchers, pioneer new
research areas, and establish and strengthen human
connections in emerging research areas to expand STI
capabilities.

**(3) Understand**
The MOD will determine what it should do in the future
based on an accurate understanding of the current S&T
environment, such as the technological trends in the
private sector in Japan and overseas, the current status of
R&D in industries including startups in Japan, advanced
and innovative technologies held by research institutes
and academia, and the results of R&D projects.

As various science and technologies are beginning to

be used in the actual battlefield nowadays, the MOD will


accurately and quickly understand how S&T is being
used currently, how new technologies may be used in
future warfare, and how this will change the national
security environment and our nation’s defense, including
MOD and SDF activities. Appropriate measures will be
implemented for such S&T changes.

The MOD will actively communicate outside the

ministry about what it is doing regarding technology, its
purpose, and how its efforts affect the national security
environment and defense activities. Plans and future
R&D projects will be shared with outside the ministry
as far as possible to improve the predictability of
stakeholders.

Active utilization of advanced civilian technology is
essential for securing the lives and peaceful livelihood
of Japanese nationals into the future and also beneficial
for the development of Japan’s science, technology, and
innovation in non-defense areas as well, similar to how
investment in innovative science and technology by the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
of the United States facilitated advances in science and
technology as a whole, including civilian technology
such as the development of the Internet and GPS. From
this perspective, the MOD intends to promote relevant
measures.

Specifically, the MOD has implemented a competitive

research funding program called Innovative Science &
Technology Initiative for Security to publicly seek and
commission basic research in target areas, which is
expected to contribute to future research and development

also actively participates in the Council for Integrated
Innovation Strategy Promotion[4] established to promote
the strategy in order to further enhance collaboration
with relevant ministries and agencies, national research
and development agencies, industry, universities, and
other parties.

In addition, it is an effective initiative within the

Government to promote communications between the
relevant ministries and agencies that promote civilianbased initiatives, and the MOD. The NSS also states that
Japan will strengthen the cross-government framework
for utilizing funding and information related to research
and development, and it is important for the entire
Government to work together based on this strategy.

Specifically, the Government will intensively offer

strong support for cutting-edge technology with multiple
applications, such as AI and quantum technology, through
programs, such as the Key and Advanced Technology
R&D through Cross Community Collaboration Program
(K-Program). The research and development results
obtained will smoothly reinforce security-related areas.
Furthermore, a cross-governmental framework was
established to expedite the development of technologies
with the potential to contribute to strengthening
comprehensive defense architecture by matching the
research and development needs of the MOD with the
technology seeds possessed by the relevant ministries
and agencies.

development of equipment, the MOD launched its
“Efforts to Facilitate the Early Practical Use of GameChangers” starting in FY2022 as an initiative to
commission private companies to conduct research and
improve their advanced technologies to the point where
they can be used in the research and development of
equipment.

**See** Reference 64 (FY2023 Awarded Research Projects for the

in defense areas. From among research proposals widely
seeking from universities, research institutes, and startup
companies, a total of 165 research projects have been
awarded as of FY2023. This program will continue to
promote the discovery and development of innovative
and emergent technologies in FY2024 as well.

In the basic research areas, free thinking of researchers

leads to innovative and creative results. For this reason,
it is necessary to assign maximum value to freedom of
research when sponsoring research, so that, for example,
researchers will be able to publish all of their research
results to have a wide range of academic discussions.
Hence, in this program, the MOD will not intervene in
research, restrict contractors’ publication of research
results, or designate research results as confidential,
never providing any confidential data to researchers.
In actuality, some research results have already been
published through oral presentations, publications, etc.
Also, since cooperation with startup companies and
research institutes in Japan is essential for identifying and
developing cutting-edge civilian technologies, we will
encourage the broad participation of leading researchers,
including those from academia, while obtaining the
understanding and cooperation from the relevant parties.

Advanced Technology Bridging Research was

launched in FY2020 to expedite the identification and
development of promising, advanced technologies from
the results of basic research under the Innovative Science
& Technology Initiative for Security and other sources,
enhance their level of technological maturity, and apply
them to the research and development of equipment.
Advanced Technology Bridging Research will continue
to be conducted with a vastly expanded scope in FY2024
with the aim of helping to develop equipment that will
become game-changers in the future.

In addition, in order to accelerate the research and

transfer of defense equipment and technology through
collaboration with relevant ministries and agencies and
by joint public and private efforts.

This revision makes it possible to transfer defense

equipment in a broad array of fields and at the same time,
requires the more strict examination for the transfer. The
government will maintain its basic philosophy as a peaceloving nation that conforms to the Charter of the United
Nations and the course it has taken as a peace-loving
nation, and promote transfer of defense equipment and
technology strictly and carefully in the same manner.

A summary of the December 2023 revisions to the

Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment
and Technology and the Implementation Guidelines as
follows.

**(1) Three Principles on Transfer of Defense**

**Equipment and Technology**

The current three principles will be maintained, and
the significance of transfer of defense equipment
and technology and the recognition of the security
environment was added and updated in the preamble in
accordance with the National Security Strategy. It is also
stated that Implementation Guidelines will be amended
in a timely manner in response to changes in the security
environment and security needs.


The National Security Strategy states that the Three
Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and
Technology and the Implementation Guidelines will be
revised to promote smooth transfer of defense equipment
and technology of high security significance and
international joint development in a broad array of fields.

In doing so, the necessity, requirements, and

transparency of the related procedures for transfer
of defense equipment and technology will be under
adequate consideration, while maintaining the three
principles themselves.

Based on this, the ruling party’s WT was held 23

times after April 2023, discussed the revision of cases
where overseas transfers may be permitted, as well as
how to ensure appropriate management after the transfer,
including strict examination when determining whether a
transfer is allowed and prior consent for transfers to third
countries, while also taking into account of examples
from other countries.

In December 2023, the ruling party’s WT consolidated

the recommendations for the government. Based on the
recommendations, the government partially revised the
Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment
and Technology and the Implementation Guidelines
in the same month. This is the first revision since the
Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and
Technology was formulated in April 2014.

In addition, this revision of the Implementation

Guidelines made it possible to transfer defense equipment
and technology in a broad array of fields. The first project
after the revision is the transfer of patriot missiles, which
Japan is manufacturing under license, from Japan to the
U.S. After deliberation at the National Security Council,
it was confirmed that the project falls under the category
of a case that can be approved for overseas transfers.

The Ministry of Defense (MOD) intends to create

a desirable safety and security environment for Japan


**(2) International Joint Development and Production**
This revision makes it possible to transfer parts and
technology from Japan directly to countries other than its
international joint development and production partner
countries.

**(3) Transfer of Defense Equipment Related to**

**Licensed Products**

Defense equipment (including finished products) for
licensed products, including those not of U.S. origin, can
now be supplied to the license provider country. However,
when providing defense equipment that corresponds to
licensed products considered as weapons[3] under the SDF
Law to countries other than the license provider country,
it excludes the case of the provision to countries where
combat is currently deemed to be taking place as part of

This revision makes it possible to provide repairs and
other services to countries cooperating with Japan in
security area including the U.S.


**3 �Direct Transfer of GCAP Finished Products**

**to Third Countries**

In the proposal consolidated by the ruling party’s WT in
December 2023, it was considered that the direct transfer
from Japan to third countries other than the partner
countries pertaining international joint development and
production requires ongoing deliberations. Under these
circumstances, in particular the finished GCAP products,
to realize aircraft that has the capabilities required to
protect our country, it is considered necessary to hold
a mechanism that allows direct transfer from Japan to
third countries other than the partner countries. In this
context, the government has coordinated with the ruling
party and provided explanations to the Diet.

Based on this, in March 2024, the Cabinet decided that

the transfer of finished products regarding the GCAP
from Japan to third countries can be permitted.

In the future, when Japan transfers the finished GCAP

products directly to third countries, a Cabinet decision
will be made on each case, which is so-called a “double
Cabinet decision”.

Furthermore, the Implementation Guidelines were

partially revised to include “three restrictions”: (1) At
present, direct transfer from Japan to countries other
than partner countries is restricted to finished products
regarding GCAP; (2) transfers will be restricted to
countries that have concluded an international agreement
obligating the use of defense equipment transferred from
Japan in a manner consistent with the purposes and
principles of the Charter of the United Nations; and (3)
it excludes the case of the transfer to a country where
combat is currently deemed to be taking place as part of
an armed conflict.

These strict decision-making process shows clearly

that Japan will maintain its basic philosophy as a peaceloving nation that conforms to the Charter of the United
Nations.

The Ministry of Defense, in light of the current

revision, will firmly proceed with discussions with the
United Kingdom and Italy, to realize a fighter aircraft
suitable for Japan’s security environment to ensure the
peace and stability of our country in the future.


**(5) Transfer of Parts**
This revision makes it possible to transfer parts to
countries cooperating with Japan in security area, after
clarifying the definition of parts.[4]

**(6) So-called Five Categories (Rescue, Transport,**

**Warning, Surveillance and Minesweeping)**

It was clarified that products to be transferred can be
equipped with arms under the Self-Defense forces Law
necessary for the performance of their essential duties
or for self-protection such as machine guns mounted on
minesweeper and transport ships.


**(7) Assistance to the country that is subject to**

**aggression with equipment (excluding arms)**

This revision enables to transfer equipment and
technology that does not fall under the category of arms
under the Self-Defense Forces Law to a country that is
subject to aggression in violation of international law,
regardless of cooperation with Japan in security area.[5]

**(8) Strict Examination**
The perspective of strict examination was expanded in
light of the diversification of types of transfers, such as
transfers of arms under the Self-Defense Forces Law and
transfers from license provider country to a third country.


**Part**

**Ⅳ**

**Chapter**


**(9) Procedures for Deliberations**

Law and transfers of such arms to third parties are
basically deliberated and announced by the National
Security Council.[6]


Refers to items incorporated as part of a finished product. However, this excludes items that can function as equipment by themselves.

Before revision, it was stipulated as “The overseas transfer of defense equipment, which is part of the equipment transferred by the Minister of Defense according to the provisions of Article
116-3 of the Self-Defense Forces Law to Ukraine, which has been invaded in violation of international law.”

to launch joint projects quickly. In January 2024, this
Arrangement was applied for the first time, and the JapanAustralia Joint Research on Robotic and Autonomous
System for Undersea Warfare was launched.

At the meeting of the Australia-Japan Defense

Ministers held in October 2023, Japan Defense Minister
Kihara, together with Australian Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister of Defence Marles, welcomed the
announcement by the Australian Department of Defense
regarding the signing of a contract with Mitsubishi
Electric Australia for a joint development project using
laser technology. This project represents the first joint
development project between Japan and Australia. It
is also the first time that the technology of a Japanese
defense-related company has attracted the attention of
a foreign government, leading to the implementation of
international joint development in the defense field. This
is a new step for Japan, which has been promoting the
transfer of defense equipment through partnerships of
public and private sectors.

In November 2023, the Acquisition, Technology and

Logistics Agency exhibited a booth at the international
exhibition “INDO PACIFIC 2023” in Australia. Mr.
Wada, who was then serving as Senior Adviser to the
Minister of Defense, took part in the exhibition. The
public and private sectors collaborated to showcase
the appeal of Japan’s equipment and its advanced
technological capabilities.

**(2) India**
Japan considers defense equipment and technology
cooperation with India as an important field of cooperation


based on Special Strategic Global Partnership between
Japan and India. At the Japan-India summit meeting in
December 2015, both countries signed the Agreement
concerning the Transfer of Defence Equipment and
Technology,[13] which entered into force in March 2016.

To create a precedent of defense equipment and

technology cooperation including dual use technologies,
both countries have held the Joint Working Group on
Defence Equipment and Technology Cooperation seven
times so far. The Cooperative Research on the Visual
SLAM Based GNSS Augmentation Technology for UGV
(Unmanned Ground Vehicle)[14] /Robotics was launched by
Japan and India in July 2018, and completed successfully.

Progress has been made in discussions on defense

equipment and technology cooperation between the two
countries, including the second Japan-India Defence
Industry Forum, which was held in Bengaluru in
February 2019.

Japan and ASEAN member states have exchanged
views regarding defense equipment and technology
cooperation in non-traditional security sectors, such
as humanitarian assistance (HA), disaster relief (DR),
and maritime security, through the Japan-ASEAN
Defense Vice-Ministerial Meetings and other occasions.
Participating countries have expressed their expectation
for Japan’s cooperation in effectively dealing with these
issues. In the “Vientiane Vision” announced by Japan at
the ASEAN-Japan Defence Ministers’ Informal Meeting


held in November 2016, it was stated that Japan s
defense equipment and technology cooperation with
ASEAN countries would be promoted with a focus on
the following three points: (1) equipment and technology
transfer, (2) human resources development, and (3)
holding seminars on defense industries.

In terms of the specific initiatives implemented, Japan

and Indonesia held the second Japan-Indonesia “2+2” in
Tokyo in March 2021. The Agreement concerning the
Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology[22] was
signed by both countries and went into effect immediately.

With Singapore, at the Shangri-La meeting held

in Singapore in June 2023, the two countries signed
the Agreement concerning the Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology[23], which came to immediate
effect.

With Thailand, the two countries signed the Agreement

concerning the Transfer of Defense Equipment and
Technology, which went into effect during Prime
Minister Kishida’s visit to Thailand in May 2022.[24]

With the Philippines, after the Agreement concerning

the Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology
between Japan and the Philippines[25] went into effect in

2018, with pilot training support provided by the MSDF
and maintenance and repair assistance provided by a
Japanese company. In addition, parts and maintenance
equipment of utility helicopters (UH-1H) that became
unnecessary for the GSDF were also delivered to the
Philippine Air Force by
September 2019. These
two transfers are cases
of applying the provision
of the SDF Act that went
into effect in June 2017
that enables the MOD to

In August 2020, a contract was concluded between

Department of National Defense of the Republic of the
Philippines and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Inc.,
which would supply four air surveillance radar systems
for approximately US$100 million. This was the first
case of an overseas transfer of finished equipment since
the establishment of the Three Principles on Transfer
of Defense Equipment and Technology in 2014. The
first radar system was delivered to the Philippine Air
Force in October 2023 and the second radar system
was in March 2024. Acceptance, turnover and Blessing
ceremonies for the radar systems were held in December
2023 and Aril 2024 respectively, in the presence of the
Philippines Secretary of National Defense Teodoro. In
addition, ASDF and GSDF also provided education for
personnel of the Philippine Air Force along with this

**2** **Provision of Defense Equipment to**

**Developing Countries**


Surrounded by an increasingly severe security

environment, it has become even more important for
Japan that the nations which have a cooperative and
friendly relationship with Japan in terms of security and
defense have appropriate capabilities. It is also critical to
develop a foundation that will serve as the basis for the
international community to cooperate towards improving
the security environment.

Among these friendly nations, some have difficulties

in acquiring an adequate level of defense equipment on
their own because of the scale of their economy and fiscal
situation. Some of these states have been requesting to
use SDF equipment that is no longer in use.

Under these circumstances, to respond to the needs

of such friendly nations, the MOD established a special
provision under Article 9, paragraph (1) of the Public
Finance Act[30] in the SDF Law, which came into force
in June 2017. The provision enables the MOD to grant
or transfer SDF equipment that is no longer in use to the
governments of developing states at a lower price than
the current price.

Even in the case of granting or transferring equipment

at a lower price than the current price as per this provision,
whether or not to transfer such equipment, and to which
government such equipment is to be transferred, will be
determined case-by-case in light of the Three Principles
on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology and
other regulations. In addition, the Government of Japan
and partner countries must conclude an international
agreement to prevent extra-purpose use and transfer to
third-parties without the prior consent of Japan.

To strengthen the recruitment capabilities, the MOD/

SDF is promoting digitalization and online dissemination
of recruitment PR materials, dissemination of information
via SNS, and partial adoption of online recruitment
examinations for candidates for uniformed SDF personnel
and general candidates for enlistment (Upper).

In addition, the Provincial Cooperation Offices

based in 50 locations throughout Japan, have been
enhancing their recruitment system by increasing the
number of part-time staff in FY2023, recruiting and
employing uniformed SDF personnel, etc., attentively
and perseveringly with the cooperation of obtaining
local governments, schools, recruitment counselors, and
others. Moreover, local governments carry out some of
the administrative activities regarding the recruitment of
uniformed SDF personnel and candidates for uniformed
SDF personnel, including announcing the recruitment
period and promoting the SDF as a workplace, with
the MOD bearing the requisite cost. At the same time,
the MOD is strengthening collaboration with local
governments to ensure necessary cooperation, including
information provision on recruitment targets, which
is indispensable for smooth administrative activities
regarding recruitment.

enhance and improve the system, the eligible educational
institutions and academic fields have been expanded so
that qualified human resources can be secured at an early
stage based on the DBP.

Furthermore, in terms of utilizing human resources

from the private sector, efforts have been made to
strengthen mid-career recruitment, including recruiting
mid-career executives with national qualifications and
licenses for specialized skills and recruiting more former
uniformed SDF personnel who had retired mid-career.
In addition, a bill was submitted to the Diet in February
2024 and passed in May of the same year for the
introduction of a Fixed-Term Uniformed SDF personnel
System, under which highly skilled individuals from
outside the MOD/SDF with specialized knowledge and
skills in domains such as cyberspace will be hired as
uniformed SDF personnel for a term of up to five years.

Personnel management of uniformed SDF personnel

differs from that of general civilian government
employees[2] due to the need to maintain the SDF’s strength.
With consideration given to the knowledge, experience,
physical strength, and other factors necessary to perform
the duties of the respective ranks, the SDF has an “Early
Retirement System” where the majority of uniformed
personnel retire after their mid-50s and a “Fixed-Term
System” where one term lasts two or three years.


**(1) Uniformed SDF Personnel**
Based on a voluntary system that respects individuals’
free will, uniformed SDF personnel are recruited
under various categories. The upper age limit for the
recruitment of candidates for uniformed SDF personnel
and general candidates for enlistment (Upper) was raised
in 2018 from “under 27” to “under 33” in order to secure
diverse human resources from a broader range, including
people with work experience in private companies. Also,
the upper age limit for the recruitment of ASDF aviation
cadets has been raised from “under 21” to “under 24”

institutions and number of academic fields covered by loans have been expanded, and the name of the system has been changed since FY2024.

are making positive contributions in a broad range of
sectors, including manufacturing and service industries,
as well as finance, insurance, real estate, and construction
industries, in addition to the disaster prevention and crisis
management departments of local governments.

Specifically, as of the end of March 2024, a total of

665 retired SDF personnel work as crisis management
officers and others at the disaster prevention and crisis
management departments of local governments: 46
prefectural bureaus have 109 of them in total, and
476 municipal bureaus have 556 all over Japan. Since
strengthening cooperation between the MOD/SDF
and local governments will help to reinforce the crisis
management capabilities of local governments, efforts
are also being made to strengthen re-employment
support in this regard.

Furthermore, the MOD offers disaster prevention

and crisis management education for retiring uniformed
SDF personnel seek employment in the disaster
prevention and crisis management departments of local
governments. An individual who completes the course
is certified as a regional disaster prevention manager by
the Cabinet Office upon request. The requirement for
this certification is a rank of at least Ichii or a rank of
Nii (First Lieutenant (GSDF, ASDF)/Lieutenant Junior
Grade (MSDF)) with the effective work experience of an
Ichii (Captain (GSDF, ASDF)/Lieutenant (MSDF)). In
addition, exchange of opinions regarding re-employment
support for SDF personnel scheduled to retire with
the security industry, where many SDF personnel are
reemployed, will be continued, and in December 2023,


Personnel receiving skills training for re-employment

the All Japan Security Service Association and the
Ministry of Defense agreed to collaborate on initiatives
related to securing human resources in the security
industry and provide smooth reemployment support for
SDF personnel scheduled to retire.

Additionally, in order to increase the number of SDF

Reserve Personnel and SDF Ready Reserve Personnel,
in addition to maintaining and increasing the number of
uniformed SDF personnel under the fixed-term system,
it is decided that a scholarship would be provided
to support the education of individuals who enter a
university in Japan after completing their tenure as fixedterm uniformed SDF personnel and who are appointed
SDF Reserve Personnel while at university.

Meanwhile, with regard to the re-employment of

SDF personnel, the following three regulations, as are
the cases in other national government employees have
been put in place to ensure public trust regarding the
fairness of official duties: (1) regulation on requesting
re-employment of other personnel and retired personnel
and on requesting information; (2) regulation on seeking
employment opportunities at companies in which the
retired personnel had a stake whilst in office; and (3)
regulation on requests (lobbying) by re-employed
personnel.[7] Compliance with these regulations is
monitored by bodies comprised of academic experts with
no history of serving as SDF personnel. Any violation of
these regulations will be strictly dealt with through the
imposition of penalties.

Additionally, for the purpose of the appropriate

implementation of centralized management and

In order to maintain the strength of the SDF, many uniformed SDF personnel retire in their mid-50s (personnel serving under the

early retirement system) or in their 20s to mid-30s (uniformed SDF personnel serving under the fixed-term service system).

Since supporting re-employment is the responsibility of the Japanese Government (the MOD) as the employer, and is crucial both

for resolving any concerns that uniformed SDF personnel may have about their future as well as for securing qualified human
resources, the MOD conducts support measures such as occupational training useful for their re-employment.

with ten years ago (end of March 2014 when females
made up about 23.4% of the total civilian officials and
others), this is a rise of 4.2 percentage points, indicating
that the ratio of female civilian officials and others has
been on the rise in recent years.

With regard to recruitment, in line with the overall

government target, the MOD has set the goal of
ensuring that women account for over 35% of recruits
in and after FY2021. Regarding promotion targets to be
achieved by the end of FY2025 include increasing the
proportion of women of the unit chief level at the MOD
proper or its equivalent to 35%, division director at local
organizations/ division deputy director level at the MOD
proper or its equivalent to 10%, the division director
level at the MOD proper or its equivalent to 6%, and
designated official or equivalent to 5%.

**See** Fig. IV-2-3-1 (Women’s Participation at the MOD and Targets

and Current Values for the Action Plan); Fig. IV-2-3-2 (Changes
in Incumbent Female SDF Personnel); Fig. IV-2-3-3 (Major
Technological Cooperation with National Research and
Development Agencies, etc.)

**2** **Significance of Promoting Active**

**Engagement of Female SDF Personnel and**
**Personnel Management Policy**


The MOD/SDF has set numerical targets in the Action
Plan for the systematic expansion of the recruitment
and promotion of female personnel. In addition, based
on NSS, the MOD/SDF plans to develop an educational
infrastructure that supports women’s activities, and to
develop women’s quarters in military buildings and naval
vessels to increase the number of female SDF personnel.

**(1) Female SDF Personnel**
As of the end of March 2024, the number of female SDF
personnel is about 20,000 (about 9% of the total SDF
personnel). Compared with ten years ago (end of March
2014 when female SDF personnel made up about 5.6%
of the total SDF personnel), this is a rise of 3.3 percentage
points, indicating that the ratio of female SDF personnel
has been on the rise in recent years.

Regarding the recruitment of female SDF personnel,

the targets for the proportion of newly employed
female SDF personnel among total newly employed
SDF personnel in and after FY2021 and the proportion
of female SDF personnel among total SDF personnel
by FY2030 have increased to at least 17% and 12%,
respectively. In addition, the MOD/SDF is improving
education, living, and work environments for female
SDF personnel in line with the increasing number of
female SDF personnel recruited.

With regard to promotion, the MOD/SDF aims to

increase the proportion of women among SDF personnel
with a rank of field officer or higher to at least 5% by the
end of FY2025.


With SDF duties becoming increasingly diverse and
complex, SDF personnel are required more than ever to
have multifaceted capabilities, including higher levels
of knowledge, decision-making ability, and skills. In
addition, under a severe recruitment environment due to
the declining birth rate and continuing trend of higher
education, it is anticipated that the number of SDF
personnel with time and location restraints, including
those involved in childcare, nursing care, and other
responsibilities, will significantly increase.

In light of these changes, the SDF is required to evolve

from a conventional organization with an emphasis on
homogeneity among the members, into an organization
that is capable of incorporating diverse human resources
in a flexible manner.

At present, the largest human resource that the SDF has

not been able to fully utilize is women, who account for
half of the population targeted for recruitment. Promoting
the active engagement of female SDF personnel has
the following significance: (1) securing useful human
resources; (2) utilizing diverse perspectives; and (3)
reflecting values of the nation. For this reason, the
MOD/SDF has decided to open up a path for female

**Establishing Medical Bases**

The role of SDF hospitals is to admit and treat injured
SDF personnel and other persons transported from their
area of activity in various emergency situations. In
peacetime, these hospitals also provide medical care to
SDF personnel and their families, etc. These hospitals
also play the role of educational institutions that train
medical personnel to maintain and enhance their skills.

In response to the recommendations of this discussion

meeting in February 2024, the MOD/SDF is promoting
studies to establish a system for administering blood
transfusion during combat trauma care. Furthermore,
there are plans to provide equipment to stockpile blood
products in the FY 2024 budget.

**(3) Securing medical materials and equipment such**

Most deaths in war are due to exsanguination from bomb
wounds, gunshot wounds, and other similar causes.
To prevent such deaths, it is extremely important to
secure blood products for transfusion. For this reason,
to establish an operational posture for the MOD/SDF
to autonomously secure and stockpile blood products
based on NDS, in October 2023, under Parliamentary
Vice-Minister of Defense Matsumoto, the “Expert
Panel on Blood Transfusion during Combat Trauma
Care of the MOD/SDFs” was established with external
experts having specialized knowledge, and a total of five
discussion meetings have been held.

In response to the recommendations of this discussion

meeting in February 2024, the MOD/SDF is promoting
studies to establish a system for administering blood

operation system,[4] etc. After these measures, the patients
are safely and quickly sent back to the Self-Defense
Forces Hospitals for specialized treatment and complete
cure.

For improving the life-saving rate of our SDF

personnel, a medical support system and posture is being
established that allows for aid to be received within 10
minutes of injury, the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF have
been educating and training SDF personnel who are
licensed as Licensed Assistant Nurses and Emergency
Life-Saving Technician so that they are able to provide
life-saving procedures4 to SDF personnel who have been
injured in the course of executing their missions near the
scene of injury while promoting their designation and
deployment to units as frontline medics.

In addition, for the construction of a rapid and reliable

evacuation posture using all means of evacuation, the
SDF will enhance education and training tailored to the
characteristics of the units and equipment of the GSDF,
MSDF, and ASDF, which include medical care during
evacuation on board ships and aircraft while promoting
the development of training equipment for medical
transport by air and teaching materials for improving
first aid capability.

The SDF will also promote development and

integration of medical training infrastructure necessary
for combat injury education and common to all SDFs,
aiming to improve common knowledge and skills.

as well as promoting the necessary research in defense
medicine to advance the quality of the SDF’s medical
services in areas such as the treatment of trauma, burns,
and physical injuries, infectious disease control, and
mental health. In particular, research on artificial platelet
could be beneficial in treating combat injuries if it can be
successfully put to practical use.

In addition, in FY 2024, a “Center for Trauma, Burn

and Tactical Medicine” will be newly established at the
NDMC to train medical and nursing officers capable of
providing medical care for combat trauma care.

In addition, an operational posture will be established

to provide highly advanced medical care at the NDMC
Hospital to allow it to play the role of admitting severely
injured SDF personnel who cannot be treated at SDF
hospitals.

The MOD / SDF will drastically reform the operation

of the NDMC Hospital, which is a clinical site for
medical officers and others who provide treatment for
combat injuries.


As the only educational institution of the MOD/SDF
for the training of SDF personnel who are physicians
(medical officers), SDF personnel who are public health

**2** **Training of Each SDF Service**


A high-level of training by each SDF is a fundamental
prerequisite for being able to fully exert joint defense
capabilities. As such, each SDF continuously conducts
individual training for its troops and organizational
training for its units, forming the foundation of a strong
SDF.

**(1) GSDF**
The GSDF conducts field training exercises at the regional
army level to improve its response capabilities for
various contingencies and other situations. Furthermore,
GSDF units from across the country conduct Ground
Self-Defense Force exercises. They strive to improve
their operation execution capabilities and operational
effectiveness by demonstrating various unit actions
while contributing to enhancing deterrence and response
capabilities.

In addition, it conducts parachute drop training from

U.S. Air Force and other aircraft in Japan and overseas,
training for amphibious operations, and live-fire training
for Medium range SAM/SSM (Surface-to-Air Missile /
Surface-to-Ship Missile) units to enhance various tactical
skills necessary for joint cross-domain operations.

cooperation of the U.S. Navy in order to improve various
tactical capabilities. In addition, the MSDF conducts
MSDF exercises (field training exercises) in which units
all over Japan are mobilized, as part of efforts to enhance
readiness.

The “ANNUAL Exercise 2023,” conducted in November

2023, rehearsed commanders’ tactical decisions and unit
operational procedures, based on a series of hypothetical
situations ranging from the gray zone to an armed attack.
In this largest-ever exercise by the MSDF, in addition to
the U.S., Australian, and Canadian navies and air forces,
the Philippine Navy participated as an observer for the
first time. Various tactical training exercises, including
anti-submarine warfare and anti-surface warfare, were
conducted to improve the MSDF’s operation execution
capabilities and strengthen cooperation with the navies
of participating countries.

The MSDF has also strengthened cooperation with

the Japan Coast Guard, and in June 2023, conducted
field training exercise with the Japan Coast Guard for
the first time after the Minister of Defense established
the Control Procedures for the Japan Coast Guard. This
exercise was conducted under the assumption that the
Japan Coast Guard would be placed under the control
of the Minister of Defense in an armed attack situation
and would evacuate residents, provide information to
vessels, and perform evacuation support. Through the


exercise, the MSDF rehearsed and verified information
communication procedures with the Japan Coast
Guard. In addition, bilateral exercises with the Japan
Coast Guard were conducted to enhance joint response
capabilities, including training related to comprehensive
response and strengthening of cooperation, and training
to deal with suspicious vessels.

**See** Part III, Chapter 1, Section 3-1-3(2) (Reinforcing Coordination

with the Japan Coast Guard)

**(3) ASDF**
The ASDF focuses on enhancing the professional
expertise of its personnel in phases in order to fully
utilize equipment with cutting-edge technologies, such
as fighter aircraft, radars, surface-to-air guided missiles,
etc. It also conducts unit-specific training and training
on inter-unit coordination procedures involving units,
such as fighter units, air warning and control units,
and surface-to-air guided missile units, as well as
comprehensive training that includes air transport units
and air rescue units.

For example, the ASDF conducts the field training

exercise Air Defense Command Comprehensive Training,
in which all relevant units in Japan are mobilized, as well
as PAC-3 maneuver and deployment training, overseas

**Section 2** **Establishing the Respective Training Environments and Safety Management**

**1** **Training Environment**

Given the increasingly severe security situation
surrounding Japan, it is important to work to establish
units and other organizations and enhance the quality
of the training so that the SDF can exert its capabilities
to the fullest. Because of this, SDF training has been
planned and conducted under conditions that are as close
as possible to actual combat situations, yet it is necessary
to further enhance the training environment in order to
maintain and enhance the readiness of the SDF. It is
against this background that the MOD/SDF is promoting
initiatives to enhance the training infrastructure in Japan
and abroad to conduct efficient and effective training and
exercises. Rising Thunder, a maximum range firing exercise utilizing the extensive U.S. firing training

Furthermore, in light of the collision between a Japan

Airlines aircraft and a Japan Coast Guard aircraft at
Tokyo International Airport in January 2024, MOD/
SDF is advancing necessary measures to prevent similar
accidents by working closely with the Ministry of Land,
Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT).

In April 2024, during a nighttime anti-submarine

warfare training exercise, two MSDF SH-60K patrol
helicopters crashed in the ocean east of Torishima Island
in the Izu Islands. A search is underway for the crew on
board and the aircraft, and an investigation is underway
into the cause of the accident.

In addition, in June 2023, an incident occurred at the

Hino Basic Shooting Range (Gifu Prefecture), during a
live-fire training for new personnel, in which one SDF
cadet fired at three members, resulting in two members
being killed in the line of duty. This incident should
never occur in any organization handling weapons,


and the MOD/SDF will continue to make every effort
to prevent recurrence and thoroughly implement safety
management, which includes training the personnel and
reviewing the firing procedures.

In this way, any accident and incidents that may cause

injury to Japanese nationals, damage their property,
or lead to the loss of life of SDF personnel, must be
prevented at all costs. After thoroughly investigating
the causes of these accidents and incidents, the MOD/
SDF will ensure that each and every member of SDF
personnel is reminded of the latest safety management
guidelines. At the same time, the MOD/SDF as a whole
will make every effort to ensure safety in the operation of
vessels, aircraft, vehicles, etc., through conducting safety
education for SDF personnel and the steady maintenance
of equipment, etc., so as to ensure that public confidence
is not undermined.

The Base Subsidy was established in view of the fact

that the facilities used by the U.S. Forces and the SDF
such as airports have a significant impact on the finances
of municipalities. The subsidy generally takes the form
of a substitute for fixed property tax and is granted to
municipalities where these facilities are located.

where USFJ properties are located in view of the fact
that such properties are exempt from fixed property tax,

life of residents in local municipalities affected by the
realignment and stimulate local industries. These grants
are provided in accordance with the progress of the
realignment after the Minister of Defense has designated
the specified defense facilities and neighboring
municipalities affected by the realignment.

As of April 2024, 11 municipalities affected by seven

defense facilities are eligible to receive the Realignment
Grants. In order to promote the realignment, additional
measures are taken with budgetary provision.

**See** Reference 75 (Outline of Measures to Promote Harmony

Amid the increasingly severe security environment
surrounding Japan, maintaining the presence of the
USFJ and its readiness is vitally important for ensuring
the security of Japan. For stable stationing of the USFJ, it
is essential to obtain the understanding and cooperation
of local governments and residents in the vicinity of
defense facilities. Various efforts will continue to be
undertaken tirelessly in this regard.

**(1) Coordination with Local Governments, etc., for**

**2** **Procuring Renewable Energy Electricity**


**3 �Balancing Renewable Energy Electricity and**

**Security**


The introduction of renewable sources of energy,

including wind power, is being promoted in response to
the issue of climate change, and wind power generation
facilities are expected to increase moving forward.
Depending on the location and specifications of these
wind power generation facilities, they may potentially
impact the activities of the SDF and U.S. Forces in
Japan, for example, by interfering with the operations
of the warning and control radars making it difficult to
detect aircraft and missiles, etc. Because of this potential
impact, the MOD/SDF coordinates with project operators
and other related parties meticulously from the early
stages of project planning. Additionally, in line with
the National Defense Strategy,[2] the Bill for Adjustment
between Defense and Wind Power[3] was submitted to
the regular session of the Diet in 2024 as a legislative
measure to institutionalize current efforts, with the act
passed and enacted in May 2024.

**4** **Response to PFOS[4]**


As the largest consumer of electricity among government
institutions, the MOD/SDF, which has approximately
250,000 SDF personnel and operates facilities and
various equipment all around Japan, has actively
promoted the procurement of electricity generated by
renewable energy sources (hereinafter “renewable energy
electricity”) for the MOD/SDF facilities since FY2020
in order to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions and other goals.

In FY2024, the MOD held 968 contracts related to

the procurement of electricity for its facilities, etc.,
nationwide, of which 213 facilities, etc., procured
renewable energy electricity. Furthermore, 157 facilities,
etc., procured 100% of their electricity from renewable
energy sources. The amount of renewable energy
electricity procured in FY2024 is expected to be around
560 million kWh (annual electricity consumption of
more than 130,000 general households). This means
that approximately 43% of all electricity expected to
be used by the MOD/SDF in FY2024 (approximately
1310 million kWh) will be procured in the form of
renewable energy electricity. Although the amount
of renewable energy electricity procured in FY2024
increased significantly from the previous fiscal year, as
a member of the Government, the MOD will continue to
make efforts to increase the ratio of renewable energy
electricity.


The MOD has formulated the Action Plan for PFOS
