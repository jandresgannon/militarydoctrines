6. The following fundamental concepts are employed in the Military Doctrine:

```

-----

```
a) the military security of the Russian Federation (hereinafter military
security) - a state of protection of the vitally important interests of the
individual, society, and the state against external and internal military
threats associated with the utilization or threat of military force that is
characterized by the absence of a military threat or by the ability to
counter such a threat;
b) military danger - a state of interstate or intrastate relations
characterized by an aggregation of factors capable in certain conditions of
leading to the emergence of a military threat;
c) military threat - a state of interstate or intrastate relations
characterized by the real possibility of the outbreak of a military conflict
between opposing sides and by a high degree of readiness on the part of a
given state (group of states) or separatist (terrorist) organizations to
utilize military force (armed violence);

II. THE MILITARY DANGERS AND MILITARY THREATS TO THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION
7. World development at the present stage is characterized by a weakening of
ideological confrontation, a lowering of the level of economic, political,
and military influence of certain states (groups of states) and alliances and
an increase in the influence of other states with ambitions for all-embracing
domination, multipolarity, and the globalization of diverse processes.
Many regional conflicts remain unresolved. There is a continuing tendency
towards a strong-arm resolution of these conflicts, including in regions
bordering on the Russian Federation. The existing international security
architecture (system), including its international-legal mechanisms, does not
ensure equal security for all states.
That said, despite the decline in the likelihood of a large-scale war
involving the use of conventional means of attack and nuclear weapons being
unleashed against the Russian Federation, in a number of areas military
dangers to the Russian Federation are intensifying.
8. The main external military dangers are:
a) the desire to endow the force potential of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) with global functions carried out in violation of the
norms of international law and to move the military infrastructure of NATO
member countries closer to the borders of the Russian Federation, including
by expanding the bloc;
b) the attempts to destabilize the situation in individual states and regions
and to undermine strategic stability;
c) the deployment (buildup) of troop contingents of foreign states (groups of
states) on the territories of states contiguous with the Russian Federation
and its allies and also in adjacent waters;

```

-----

```
d) the creation and deployment of strategic missile defence systems
undermining global stability and violating the established correlation of
forces in the nuclear-missile sphere, and also the militarization of outer
space and the deployment of strategic nonnuclear precision weapon systems;
e) territorial claims against the Russian Federation and its allies and
interference in their internal affairs;
f) the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, missiles, and missile
technologies, and the increase in the number of states possessing nuclear
weapons;
g) the violation of international accords by individual states, and also
noncompliance with previously concluded international treaties in the field
of arms limitation and reduction;
h) the use of military force on the territories of states contiguous with the
Russian Federation in violation of the UN Charter and other norms of
international law;
i) the presence (emergence) of seats of armed conflict and the escalation of
such conflicts on the territories of states contiguous with the Russian
Federation and its allies;
j) the spread of international terrorism;
k) the emergence of seats of interethnic (interfaith) tension, the activity
of international armed radical groupings in areas adjacent to the state
border of the Russian Federation and the borders of its allies, the presence
of territorial contradictions and the growth of separatism and violent
(religious) extremism in individual parts of the world.
9. The main internal military dangers are:
a) attempts to change the constitutional structure of the Russian Federation
by force;
b) the undermining of the sovereignty and violation of the unity and
territorial integrity of the Russian Federation;
c) the disruption of the functioning of organs of state power, important
state and military facilities, and the informational infrastructure of the
Russian Federation.
10. The main military threats are:
a) a drastc deterioration in the military-political situation (interstate
relations) and the creation of the conditions for the utilization of military
force;

```

-----

```
b) the impeding of the operation of systems of state and military command and
control of the Russian Federation, the disruption of the functioning of its
strategic nuclear forces, missile early warning systems, systems for
monitoring outer space, nuclear munitions storage facilities, nuclear energy
facilities, atomic and chemical industry facilities, and other potentially
dangerous facilities;
c) the creation and training of illegal armed formations and their activity
on the territory of the Russian Federation or on the territories of its
allies;
d) a show of military force with provocative objectives in the course of
exercises on the territories of states contiguous with the Russian Federation
or its allies;
e) a stepping up of the activity of the Armed Forces of individual states
(groups of states) involving partial or complete mobilization and the
transitioning of these states' organs of state and military command and
control to wartime operating conditions.
11. Military conflicts are characterized by their objectives and by the ways
and means of achieving these objectives, the scale and timing of military
actions, the forms and methods of struggle, and the weaponry and military
equipment utilized.
12. Characteristic features of contemporary military conflicts are:
a) the integrated utilization of military force and forces and resources of a
nonmilitary character;
b) the massive utilization of weapons and military equipment systems based on
new physical principles that are comparable to nuclear weapons in terms of
effectiveness;
c) the broadening of the scale of the utilization of troops (forces) and
resources operating in airspace and outer space;
d) the intensification of the role of information warfare;
e) the reduction of the time parameters for preparing to conduct military
operations;
f) an increase in the promptness of command and control as a result of
transitioning from a strict vertical system of command and control to a
global networked automated command and control system for troops (forces) and
weaponry;
g) the creation on the warring sides' territories of a permanent zone of
military operations.

```

-----

```
13. Features of modern military conflicts are:
a) the unpredictability of their emergence;
b) the presence of a broad range of military-political, economic, strategic,
and other objectives;
c) the growth of the role of modern highly effective weapons systems, and
also the rearrangement of the role of various spheres of armed struggle;
d) the prior implementation of measures of information warfare in order to
achieve political objectives without the utilization of military force and,
subsequently, in the interest of shaping a favourable response from the world
community to the utilization of military force.
14. Military conflicts will be distinguished by speed, selectivity, and a
high level of target destruction, rapidity in manoeuvring troops (forces) and
firepower, and the utilization of various mobile groupings of troops
(forces). Possession of the strategic initiative, the preservation of
sustainable state and military command and control, and the securing of
supremacy on land, at sea, and in the air and outer space will become
decisive factors in achieving objectives.
15. Military actions will be typified by the increasing significance of
precision, electromagnetic, laser, and infrasound weaponry, computercontrolled systems, drones and autonomous maritime craft, and guided
robotized models of arms and military equipment.
16. Nuclear weapons will remain an important factor for preventing the
outbreak of nuclear military conflicts and military conflicts involving the
use of conventional means of attack (a large-scale war or regional war).
In the event of the outbreak of a military conflict involving the utilization
of conventional means of attack (a large-scale war or regional war) and
imperiling the very existence of the state, the possession of nuclear weapons
may lead to such a military conflict developing into a nuclear military
conflict.

Russia is willing to discuss its new military doctrine with NATO - official

```

```
Text of report by corporate-owned Russian news agency Interfax
Moscow, 9 February: Russia is ready to give the necessary clarifications in
the Russia-NATO Council about its new military doctrine, Andrey Nesterenko,
the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, has said.
Earlier NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen spoke critically of
Russia's new military doctrine that has been approved by President Dmitriy
Medvedev.
"Apparently, the NATO secretary-general has had little time to study the
essence of the provisions of the new military doctrine of our country. The
Russian side has consistently shown transparency in discussing strategic
doctrinal documents in the Russia-NATO Council," Nesterenko said. 
"We are ready to continue this dialogue, to give the necessary clarifications
in the Russia-NATO Council about our new military doctrine," he said.
He said that this issue was discussed during the bilateral meeting between
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Rasmussen on 6 February. The
minister drew the attention of the secretary-general of the alliance to the
wording of Russia's military doctrine which says that the security risks are
caused not by NATO itself but by the "desire to give the military potential
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization global functions carried out in
violation of the standards of international law, to move the military
infrastructure of NATO member states to Russia's borders including by
expanding the bloc".
The doctrine also speaks about the risks due to "developing and deploying
strategic missile defence systems which undermine global stability and
violate the present balance of forces in the nuclear missile sphere, and also
the militarization of outer space, the deployment of strategic non-nuclear
systems of high precision weapons".
The doctrine also clearly states that one of the main objectives of the
Russian Federation in containing and preventing military conflicts is the
development of relations with the European Union and NATO, Nesterenko noted.

national interests of the Russian Federation and the interests of its allies.
5. The provisions of the Military Doctrine are specified in the Russian
Federation President's Messages to the Russian Federation Federal Assembly
and can be adjusted within the framework of strategic planning in the
military sphere (military planning).
Implementation of the Military Doctrine is achieved through the
centralization of state control in the military sphere and is effected in
accordance with federal legislation and statutory legal acts of the Russian
Federation president, the Russian Federation Government, and federal organs
of executive power.
6. The following fundamental concepts are employed in the Military Doctrine:
a) the military security of the Russian Federation (hereinafter military
security) - a state of protection of the vitally important interests of the
individual, society, and the state against external and internal military
threats associated with the utilization or threat of military force that is
characterized by the absence of a military threat or by the ability to
counter such a threat;
b) military danger - a state of interstate or intrastate relations
characterized by an aggregation of factors capable in certain conditions of
leading to the emergence of a military threat;
c) military threat - a state of interstate or intrastate relations
characterized by the real possibility of the outbreak of a military conflict

community states in which the sides would be pursuing radical military
```

-----

```
political objectives. A large-scale war may result from the escalation of an

II. THE MILITARY DANGERS AND MILITARY THREATS TO THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION
7. World development at the present stage is characterized by a weakening of
ideological confrontation, a lowering of the level of economic, political,
and military influence of certain states (groups of states) and alliances and
an increase in the influence of other states with ambitions for all-embracing
domination, multipolarity, and the globalization of diverse processes.
Many regional conflicts remain unresolved. There is a continuing tendency
towards a strong-arm resolution of these conflicts, including in regions
bordering on the Russian Federation. The existing international security
architecture (system), including its international-legal mechanisms, does not
ensure equal security for all states.
That said, despite the decline in the likelihood of a large-scale war
involving the use of conventional means of attack and nuclear weapons being
unleashed against the Russian Federation, in a number of areas military
dangers to the Russian Federation are intensifying.
8. The main external military dangers are:
a) the desire to endow the force potential of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) with global functions carried out in violation of the
norms of international law and to move the military infrastructure of NATO
member countries closer to the borders of the Russian Federation, including
by expanding the bloc;
b) the attempts to destabilize the situation in individual states and regions
and to undermine strategic stability;

```

-----

```
c) the deployment (buildup) of troop contingents of foreign states (groups of
states) on the territories of states contiguous with the Russian Federation
and its allies and also in adjacent waters;
d) the creation and deployment of strategic missile defence systems
undermining global stability and violating the established correlation of
forces in the nuclear-missile sphere, and also the militarization of outer
space and the deployment of strategic nonnuclear precision weapon systems;
e) territorial claims against the Russian Federation and its allies and
interference in their internal affairs;
f) the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, missiles, and missile
technologies, and the increase in the number of states possessing nuclear
weapons;
g) the violation of international accords by individual states, and also
noncompliance with previously concluded international treaties in the field
of arms limitation and reduction;
h) the use of military force on the territories of states contiguous with the
Russian Federation in violation of the UN Charter and other norms of
international law;
i) the presence (emergence) of seats of armed conflict and the escalation of
such conflicts on the territories of states contiguous with the Russian
Federation and its allies;
j) the spread of international terrorism;
k) the emergence of seats of interethnic (interfaith) tension, the activity
of international armed radical groupings in areas adjacent to the state
border of the Russian Federation and the borders of its allies, the presence
of territorial contradictions and the growth of separatism and violent
(religious) extremism in individual parts of the world.
9. The main internal military dangers are:
a) attempts to change the constitutional structure of the Russian Federation
by force;
b) the undermining of the sovereignty and violation of the unity and
territorial integrity of the Russian Federation;
c) the disruption of the functioning of organs of state power, important
state and military facilities, and the informational infrastructure of the
Russian Federation.
10. The main military threats are:
a) a drastic deterioration in the military-political situation (interstate
relations) and the creation of the conditions for the utilization of military
force;
b) the impeding of the operation of systems of state and military command and
control of the Russian Federation, the disruption of the functioning of its
strategic nuclear forces, missile early warning systems, systems for

```

-----

```
monitoring outer space, nuclear munitions storage facilities, nuclear energy
facilities, atomic and chemical industry facilities, and other potentially
dangerous facilities;
c) the creation and training of illegal armed formations and their activity
on the territory of the Russian Federation or on the territories of its
allies;
d) a show of military force with provocative objectives in the course of
exercises on the territories of states contiguous with the Russian Federation
or its allies;
e) a stepping up of the activity of the Armed Forces of individual states
(groups of states) involving partial or complete mobilization and the
transitioning of these states' organs of state and military command and
control to wartime operating conditions.
11. Military conflicts are characterized by their objectives and by the ways
and means of achieving these objectives, the scale and timing of military
actions, the forms and methods of struggle, and the weaponry and military
equipment utilized.
12. Characteristic features of contemporary military conflicts are:
a) the integrated utilization of military force and forces and resources of a
nonmilitary character;
b) the massive utilization of weapons and military equipment systems based on
new physical principles that are comparable to nuclear weapons in terms of
effectiveness;
c) the broadening of the scale of the utilization of troops (forces) and
resources operating in airspace and outer space;
d) the intensification of the role of information warfare;
e) the reduction of the time parameters for preparing to conduct military
operations;
f) an increase in the promptness of command and control as a result of
transitioning from a strict vertical system of command and control to a
global networked automated command and control system for troops (forces) and
weaponry;
g) the creation on the warring sides' territories of a permanent zone of
military operations.
13. Features of modern military conflicts are:
a) the unpredictability of their emergence;
b) the presence of a broad range of military-political, economic, strategic,
and other objectives;
c) the growth of the role of modern highly effective weapons systems, and
also the rearrangement of the role of various spheres of armed struggle;

```

-----

```
d) the prior implementation of measures of information warfare in order to
achieve political objectives without the utilization of military force and,
subsequently, in the interest of shaping a favourable response from the world
community to the utilization of military force.
14. Military conflicts will be distinguished by speed, selectivity, and a
high level of target destruction, rapidity in manoeuvring troops (forces) and
firepower, and the utilization of various mobile groupings of troops
(forces). Possession of the strategic initiative, the preservation of
sustainable state and military command and control, and the securing of
supremacy on land, at sea, and in the air and outer space will become
decisive factors in achieving objectives.
15. Military actions will be typified by the increasing significance of
precision, electromagnetic, laser, and infrasound weaponry, computercontrolled systems, drones and autonomous maritime craft, and guided
robotized models of arms and military equipment.
16. Nuclear weapons will remain an important factor for preventing the
outbreak of nuclear military conflicts and military conflicts involving the
use of conventional means of attack (a large-scale war or regional war).
In the event of the outbreak of a military conflict involving the utilization
of conventional means of attack (a large-scale war or regional war) and
imperiling the very existence of the state, the possession of nuclear weapons
may lead to such a military conflict developing into a nuclear military
conflict.
III. THE MILITARY POLICY OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION
