**STRATEGIC DEFENCE AND SECURITY REVIEW: FIRST ANNUAL REPORT**

In October 2010, the Government published a new National Security Strategy (NSS)

and the first ever Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR), collectively

developed by the National Security Council (NSC). No UK government had

previously carried out a coordinated review of all its security and defence

capabilities. The NSC had to take account of the overriding need to reduce the

deficit and redress the absence of any up-to-date strategy within the MOD, due to

the lack of a Defence Review for twelve years. It made hard choices about which

capabilities to protect, which to enhance and which to cut back. It focused on what

mattered for the future.

The NSS set out four top-tier national security risks: terrorism, cyber threats,

international military crises and national disasters such as floods - giving a clear

focus to the Government's national security effort. The SDSR set out how the

Government intended to address these major risks, and what key decisions the

Government had made about equipping the UK Armed Forces, police and

intelligence agencies properly to tackle current and future threats. At the heart of the

NSS and SDSR was an integrated approach to national security, combining defence,

development, diplomatic, intelligence and other capabilities. Implementation of both

the Strategy and the Review has been driven collectively from the centre by the

NSC.

Since October 2010, significant progress has been made in delivering SDSR

commitments. But the Arab Spring, the death of Usama bin Laden and the natural

disasters in Japan, as well as an increasingly challenging global economic outlook,

demonstrate how rapidly and dramatically international contexts can change. The

robust nature of the SDSR and the NSS has vindicated the NSC decision to maintain

an adaptable defence and security posture to provide long term flexibility in our

approach to national security.

The Government's work on national security is overseen by the NSC chaired by the

Prime Minister. It meets weekly, bringing together key Ministers and military and

intelligence chiefs to consider a broad range of domestic and international security

1


-----

issues. It is supported by the National Security Adviser and the National Security

Secretariat in the Cabinet Office.

The Government is held accountable by Parliamentary Select Committees including

the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy, to whom the Minister for

Government Policy recently provided evidence on the NSS and the SDSR, and the

House of Commons Defence Committee, who recently reported for the second lime

on the SDSR. In addition, this document fulfils the commitment to provide an annual

public report on implementation of the SDSR.

The SDSR comprised over 200 individual commitments across the national security

agenda. There has been good progress against the majority of these undertakings,

including delivery in many of the highest priority areas: publishing a revised counter-

terrorism strategy, publishing a Building Stability Overseas Strategy, launching a

major new National Cyber Security Programme and significant work to bring the

defence budget back into balance as part of a comprehensive programme of

defence transformation. This report sets out progress over the last 12 months

against SDSR commitments in each area.

**Defence**

The Armed Forces can rightly be proud of their outstanding contribution to

operations in Afghanistan and Libya. In Afghanistan, UK forces have been engaged

in intensive counter-insurgency operations in Helmand Province, and in training the

Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) - who have already taken responsibility for

security in a first two tranches of districts. In Libya, UK Armed Forces responded fast

and flexibly to the requirement to make a major contribution to NATO air operations

and to the maritime tasks. The Libya campaign confirmed the validity of the

adaptable posture set out in the SDSR.

This Government inherited a challenging financial position and an over-committed

Defence budget. The SDSR recognised the need to restore affordability to the

defence spending plans. Over the last twelve months, the MOD has taken tough but

necessary action on equipment and personnel costs to bring the defence programme

broadly back into balance. The UK retains the fourth largest military budget in the

2


-----

world and will meet NATO's target of spending 2% of Gross Domestic Product on

defence over the Spending Review period. To ensure that future aspirations are

matched by resources, in July the Government announced that the MOD can plan on

the defence equipment and e_quipment support budget increasing by 1 % a year in

real terms between 2015 and 2020. This decision puts plans for Future Force 2020

onto a stronger footing and makes several significant programmes possible,

including spending on the Joint Strike Fighter, procurement of the Rivet Joint

intelligence and surveillance aircraft and the development of the Global Combat

Ship.

In the **maritime environment** the SDSR announced the decision to decommission

HMS Ark Royal immediately, reduce by four the number of frigates, place at

extended readiness either HMS Ocean or HMS Illustrious and decommission a Bay-

class amphibious support ship. The Royal Navy has implemented these changes in

full. It has taken out of service HMS Ark Royal, four Type 22 frigates and RFA Largs

Bay, which has been purchased by the Royal Australian Navy. HMS Illustrious will

be decommissioned in 2014. Progress towards building Future Force 2020

capabilities has included the launch of the second Astute class submarine, HMS

Ambush, and the start of construction of the fifth submarine, HMS Anson. The third

new and highly capable Type 45 destroyer, HMS Diamond, entered service and

assembly of the new Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers has progressed well.

The Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System has been selected as the preferred

means of launching aircraft from the operational carrier and detailed assessments

continue.

In the **land environment** the SDSR announced that the Government would be

rationalising headquarters, converting one operational divisional headquarters to a

force preparation role and removing one deployable brigade. The Army also

undertook to reduce holdings of Challenger 2 tanks by around 40%, to reduce AS90

vehicles by around 35% and to rationalise wider equipment holdings. The Army is

on track to meet commitments to reduce equipment holdings, has announced the

disbandment of 19 Light Brigade, has started rationalising elements of its non-

deployable headquarters and regional divisional and brigade structures have been

3


-----

reduced. Progress towards building Future Force 2020 capabilities includes a

planned increase in defence funding between 2015 and 2020, meaning about £1

billion will be spent on 14 new Chinook Helicopters and £1 billion on refurbishment of

the Army's fleet of Warrior vehicles.

In the **air environment** the SDSR announced that we would be reducing Tornado

numbers, removing Harrier from service in 2011, and reducing Joint Strike Fighter

numbers but buying the more capable Carrier Variant and installing a catapult on the

new aircraft carrier. The SDSR also announced that the RAF would not bring

Nimrod MRA4 into service, would focus the VC-10 on air-to-air refuelling, and would

withdraw from service the TriStar from 2013, the C-130J Hercules by 2022 and

Sentinel once it is no longer required in Afghanistan. The Royal Air Force withdrew

the Harrier from service in December 2010. Tornado drawdown remains on track.

Progress towards building Future Force 2020 capabilities includes Typhoon force

growth and delivery of the RAF's largest ever aircraft, the Voyager Future Strategic

(transport) and Tanker Aircraft (FSTA), which has started UK trials and will go into

service in the new year as a replacement for Tri Star and the VC-10. A400M

production remains on track - the first aircraft is expected to be delivered in late 2014

as a replacement for the C-130 Hercules.

The SDSR made clear that while effective military hardware is essential, it is our

**people that give our Armed Forces their edge and deliver the capabilities this**

country needs. The SDSR committed to rebuilding and formalising an Armed Forces

Covenant and in May the Government announced a new version of the Armed

Forces Covenant. This was enshrined in law by the Armed Forces Act 2011,

including the requirement for an annual report on the Covenant to Parliament. Key

proposals from Dr Andrew Murrison's report, 'Fighting Fit: a Mental Health Plan for

Service Personnel and Veterans,' are also being implemented - 30 additional mental

health nurses have been commissioned and a 24-hour mental health support line

has been launched. The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme was revised,

incorporating all of Lord Boyce's recommended changes, and sustainable and fair

changes have been made to allowances.

-----

The SDSR took tough but vital decisions and there were few harder than staff

reductions, particularly for those who had provided many years of distinguished

service. However, to realise the long-term vision for defence the SDSR announced

reductions of around 17,000 service personnel and 25,000 civil servants by 2015.

The three Services have announced redundancy programmes and a first tranche of

MOD civil servants have accepted voluntary early release. MOD's civilian workforce

has already fallen by almost 10% compared to the SDSR baseline and it is on track

to meet the SDSR commitment of a total fall of around 32,000 by the year 2020.

The SDSR committed to a six-month study of the role and structure of reserve

**forces.** In July, the Future Reserves 2020 study recommended around £1.5 billion

of investment in the reserve forces of all three Services over the next ten years to

progressively adjust the Regular/Reserve balance. This will be implemented while

maintaining the land forces capability set out in the SDSR so that by 2020 we

envisage a total trained Army of around 112,000, broadly in the ratio 70:30 Regular

to Reserve.

The SDSR announced the intention to bring back half of the UK military personnel

from Germany by 2015 and the rest by 2020, and to deliver £350 million per year

from estate rationalisation, while reflecting reductions in RAF equipment based

around the UK. In July, the Defence **Basing** Review made clear how these

strategic, long term changes would affect the military footprint, providing long term

stability for the Armed Forces and better value for money for the taxpayer. RAF

Marham will remain as a base for Tornado GR4 aircraft while RAF Leuchars will

become an Army base. The Typhoon force will grow at RAF Lossiemouth, while

Kinloss will become home to Army units. Work in the coming year will develop the

detailed plans required to implement these changes.

Lord Levene has completed his review of MOD's structure and corporate culture to

identify the changes needed to deliver the Future Force 2020. His recommendations

have been agreed and are being implemented in full, including plans to create a new

Joint Forces Command. To ensure that the equipment and support programme

remains affordable, the Defence Secretary is chairing meetings of the new Major

Projects Review Board. Lord Currie has reviewed defence single source contracts

5


-----

and made wide-ranging reform proposals that are now the subject of public

consultation. Work continues to review and renegotiate up to 500 contracts with a

total value of £8 billion. The Green Paper on Equipment, Support and Technology for

UK Defence and Security was published last year and the White Paper will be

published shortly.

On the **Deterrent,** implementation of the SDSR decision to reduce the number of

nuclear warheads on each Vanguard Class submarines has started, with the first

submarine carrying a maximum of 40 nuclear warheads instead of 48. Separately

the implementation of SDSR decisions regarding the overall nuclear weapon

stockpile and number of operational missiles on each submarine is on track. In May

this year, formal approval was granted to begin the assessment phase for the

programme to replace the Vanguard-class submarines. In addition, to assist the

Liberal Democrats make the case for alternatives to the Trident system, the

Government initiated a study into the costs, feasibility and credibility of alternative

nuclear deterrent systems and postures.

**Wider Security**

The NSS and SDSR prioritised tackling the international **Terrorism** threat, which

was SEVERE for much of the year but reduced to SUBSTANTIAL in July. The

leadership of Al Qa'ida (AQ) is weaker than at any time since 9/11. The deaths of

Usama Bin Laden and Anwar Al Awlaki have contributed significantly to this. AQ has

played no significant role in recent political change in North Africa and the Middle

East. Nonetheless, other terrorists groups, including AQ affiliates in Yemen and

Somalia, have emerged as a substantial threat in their own right.

The SDSR committed to continuing to support the devolved institutions of Northern

Ireland to tackle the threat from terrorism. The threat from Northern Ireland related

terrorism to Great Britain remains SUBSTANTIAL (SEVERE in Northern Ireland).

The Government has developed a new strategic approach in support of the Police

Service of Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Executive, allocating an

additional £200 million over the next four years to countering this threat.

-----

The SDSR committed to review the most sensitive and controversial counter-

terrorism and security powers, to revise the UK counter-terrorism strategy

(CONTEST) and to reform the counter-radicalisation workstream of CONTEST

_(Prevent)._ The Government published a more focused Prevent Strategy in June and

a revised CONTEST in July. The new version of CONTEST has been broadened to

cover all forms of terrorism but focused on the greatest risks. Following a review of

the most controversial counter-terrorism and security powers, in January the

Government announced that Control Orders would be replaced by less intrusive and

more targeted Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIMs), changes

to stop and search powers and a reduction in the maximum period suspects can be

held without charge for terrorism offences from 28 to 14 days. The TPIM Bill and the

Protection of Freedoms Bill are currently before Parliament.

The SDSR committed to enhancing the response of police armed response units to a

terrorist firearms attack in the UK and supporting their work with specialist military

units. Significant improvements have been made to the police and military response

to a Mumbai-style attack.

The SDSR committed to delivering a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic

Games next year. In December 201 O the Home Office announced that the

Government expects to deliver the core of the Government safety and security

programme for about £475m, the majority of which will pay for the policing operation.

More broadly, the SDSR commitment to maintain core counter-terrorism policing

capabilities while introducing efficiency savings has been honoured.

The SDSR has helped ensure that development is at the heart of an integrated

approach across Government. Both tackling the root causes of instability and

helping to resolve conflicts overseas are key national security tasks. The

Government is on track to meet its commitment to direct 30% of Official

Development Assistance (ODA) toward conflict-affected and fragile states by

2014/15. This investment will help reduce poverty and focus work in some of the

poorest countries in the world but will also contribute to the UK's own national

security.

7


-----

The SDSR also committed to a new cross-Whitehall strategy to address instability

and conflict overseas and to a larger Conflict Pool fund for conflict prevention. In

April, the Government announced an increase in the Conflict Pool's programme

resources from £229 million this financial year to £256 million in financial year 2011-

12, and increases annually thereafter to £309 million in FY 2014-15. In July, the

Government published the Building Stability Overseas Strategy, a key principle of

which was to tackle threats at source - focusing on those fragile and conflict-

affected countries where the risks are high, the UK's interests are most at stake and

where the UK can have an impact. As a result, Government departments are now

working with NGOs and international partners to establish an improved Early

Warning System to enable early action to help prevent and respond to conflict. The

Government has also committed to a new annual £20 million Early Action Facility to

speed up support for emerging crises and to help build strong, legitimate and robust

societies in fragile countries.

This year, the UK also deployed its first ever Stabilisation Response Team to Libya

to help build a shared international understanding of the country's interim

stabilisation needs, bringing together military and civilian expertise. Early planning by

the UK-led International Stabilisation Response Team fed into a National Transitional

Council stabilisation plan, and supported the United Nations' engagement.

The SDSR announced £650 million of new investment to tackle the rapidly evolving

threats to Cyber Security. In April, the Government launched a transformative

National Cyber Security Programme, backed by this new investment. November's

London Conference on Cyberspace demonstrated the UK's continued lead on

international cyber thinking and helped build alliances with like-minded nations,

shaping an open, vibrant and safe cyberspace. The Conference was attended by

more than 700 participants from over 60 countries, and was debated in social media

around the world including in China, Pakistan, India and the Middle East. The UK

signed a trilateral Cyber Defence Memorandum of Understanding with Australia and

the US in June.

The SDSR committed to a new National Cyber Crime Strategy and a new Cyber

Security Strategy. To meet this requirement, on 25 November the UK Cyber

8


-----

Security Strategy set out the UK's approach to securing opportunities for UK growth,

tackling cyber crime, bolstering the UK's critical infrastructure protecting national

interests in cyberspace and improving national cyber security skills and capabilities.

The MOD, Home Office law enforcement community and BIS are recruiting new

cyber specialists to manage the implementation of the new strategy under

strengthened Cabinet Office leadership by the Office of Cyber Security and

Information Assurance. In parallel to this work, Government and the private sector

are developing joint plans for improving the UK's ability to protect itself against cyber

security threats, including those that threaten the most critical national infrastructure.

The Government is working with the private sector on plans for pilot cyber

accreditation products and services.

SDSR re-focused **Civil Emergencies** planning towards better preparing for the

highest priority risks - unconventional terrorism, wide area flooding and pandemic

influenza. In March, Exercise Watermark tested Government and public

preparedness for flooding. In the new year, the Government will formally respond to

the Environment Agency's report on lessons from the exercise. The Government

published a new UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy in November,

aimed at informing local organisations and emergency planners.

The SDSR committed to strengthened Crisis Management in the Cabinet Office.

The Government has upgraded the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms (COBR), reduced

infrastructure vulnerabilities to natural hazards and provided advice to small and

medium size enterprises on business continuity and resilience. As part of the

broader Big Society agenda, the Government launched in March the Community

Resilience Programme to help communities build resilience to civil emergencies

through self-help schemes at local level. The National Resilience Capability

Programme has developed capabilities to respond to a wide range of emergencies,

such as flooding and severe winter weather.

The SDSR recognised diverse risks to the UK's Energy Security, including political

instability in key energy producing countries. Before the Arab Spring, Libya provided

7% of UK oil imports and met 2% of global oil demand. The loss of Libyan

production and concern over instability in the region contributed to significant global

9


-----

price volatility. To prevent market shortage, the UK supported the International

Energy Agency's release of oil stocks before increased production from countries

such as Saudi Arabia helped stabilise supply and price.

In October, the Chief Nuclear Inspector's report into the Fukushima accident

concluded that UK nuclear facilities have no fundamental safety weaknesses. The

UK remains committed to safe civil nuclear power. A shift by some countries away

from nuclear power to fossil fuels after damage to the Fukushima nuclear plant has

added to existing pressure on gas prices from growing global demand.

The SDSR committed to improving the domestic energy market and agreeing a new

International Energy Forum (IEF) Charter. In July, the Government launched

Planning Our Electric Future: a White Paper for secure, affordable, and low-carbon

electricity. The paper outlined the strategy for a cleaner, more diverse and more

sustainable electricity mix and plans to legislate for a capacity mechanism that

matches electricity supply to demand. The UK was also one of 86 signatories to the

new IEF Charter and continues to support the European Commission's work on an

energy road map to 2050.

On Organised Crime, the SDSR committed to establishing a powerful new National

Crime Agency (NGA), to publishing a new Organised Crime Strategy and to revising

the UK Threat Assessment. In June, the Home Office published the National Crime

Agency (NGA) plan, setting out the vision for a new agency at the centre of

Government's efforts on organised crime that connects local policing and

neighbourhood action to national agencies and action overseas. Keith Bristow has

now started his new role as the first head of the NGA, responsible for setting up and

then leading the new agency. In July, the Government published the Organised

Crime Strategy, which will transform the UK's collective response to organised crime

through a more forward-looking threat assessment and a clearer approach to

working with overseas partners. The revised Organised Crime UK Threat

Assessment gives the most comprehensive picture of the threat ever and will guide

the response of law enforcement partners. The last year has also been the most

successful ever for asset recovery, with a record £161 million net receipts recovered

10


-----

from criminals, a rise of 5% from the year before. The Government has deprived

criminals of more than £1 billion in assets.

The SDSR commitments on Border Security included technological enhancements,

EU action on passenger records, the establishment of a National Maritime

Information Centre, a stronger focus on aviation security and a new Border Policing

Command. The Government has responded to threats to aviation by introducing new

scanning technology and procedures to stop terrorists from boarding an aircraft

bound for or leaving the UK. The UK played a leading role in the EU adoption of a

risk-based inbound cargo security regime and in May the UK opted in to the EU's

draft Passenger Name Record directive based on a strong UK negotiating position

on data capture for intra-EU flights. In April the Government completed the transfer

of the existing e-Borders services to alternative providers and subsequently

contracted to increase the capability and scope of e-Borders (a system which

electronically collects and checks passenger details in advance of travel} to cover all

modes of transport. The new National Maritime Information Centre became

operational in April and has already provided valuable information on maritime

threats in support of the Libya campaign. Implementation of the NCA's new Border

Policing Command remains on track.

The SDSR recognised the risk of hostile states or groups outside of UK borders

obtaining the capability to attack UK interests, including with CBRN weapons. It

committed to better central coordination on Counter Proliferation and Arms

**Control through a new Cabinet Office-chaired committee, a new common fund,**

international diplomacy and capacity building efforts, negotiations on a new Arms

Trade Treaty and a new technical assessment capability. The new committee has

been established and is overseeing work to produce the UK's first National Counter-

Proliferation Strategy. The committee also oversees a new Critical Capabilities Pool,

which is ensuring that UK retains the skills and abilities needed to tackle proliferation

risks.

Since April, the cross-Government Virtual Hub for Counter Proliferation (CP)

Technical Assessment has joined up the expertise from a number of departments

and agencies through more collaborative working (without increasing administrative

11


-----

overheads). The Virtual Hub has established a more coordinated, programmatic •

approach to CP assessment under the guidance of the newly-formed Counter

Proliferation Committee of officials, to focus on the highest priority proliferation risks.

Internationally, the UK played a crucial role in renewing UN Security Council

Resolution (SCR) 1540, which will continue to ban terrorists from acquiring nuclear

materials and expertise for years to come. In March, the UK agreed to contribute

£4m to the IAEA Nuclear Security Fund, becoming the second biggest contributor to

the fund responsible for securing nuclear and radiological material throughout the

world. The UK will continue to take a leading role in international control regimes and

at the UN, tackling serious proliferation challenges such as Iran and North Korea,

who continue to defy international law and further develop their illegal nuclear

programmes.

In July, the FCO announced the conclusions of its Export Control Review, which

concluded that there was no evidence of any misuse of controlled military goods

exported from the UK. But it also concluded that there are measures we can take to

strengthen the controls, which will be taken forward in the coming year. We have

played a major role in gathering international support for an Arms Trade Treaty,

including at the UN.

**Alliances and Partnerships**

The SDSR committed to reinforcing the alliance with the **US, the UK's pre-eminent**

security and defence relationship. The British diplomatic network in the US remains

strong and close military cooperation, as was demonstrated in Libya, remains critical

to the success of ongoing operations, including in Afghanistan. Intelligence sharing,

counter-terrorism cooperation and collaborative work on cyber operations has

developed throughout the year. In the longer term, the UK and US Joint Strategy

Board announced during President Obama's visit in May will take a joint approach to

long-term planning between the two nations.

The SDSR committed to intensifying the defence and security relationship with

France. The November 201 O UK-France Summit saw the signing of two ground-

breaking and wide-ranging defence and security cooperation treaties. Close UK-


-----

French cooperation over Libya demonstrated the ability of the two nations' armed

forces to work together, maximising capabilities in a complex, multinational setting.

The UK and France have also conducted two major exercises and have agreed a

five-year exercise plan to develop the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force

capability. Advances in equipment cooperation include the establishment of a joint

project office on Unmanned Air Systems.

As well as announcing the intention to strengthen relationships with our established

closest allies, in September the FCO announced a Network Shift towards an

expanded overseas network and deeper diplomatic relationships with Emerging

Powers. This involves extending the UK's diplomatic presence in China and India,

with additional reinforcements in Brazil, Thailand, South Korea, North Korea,

Mongolia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Angola, Botswana, Chile, Argentina, Colombia,

Panama, Peru, Pakistan, Vietnam, the Philippines and Taiwan. It also involves

opening new Embassies in South Sudan and Kyrgyzstan, reopening Embassies in

Cote d'Ivoire, El Salvador and Madagascar and, in due course, opening a new

Embassy in Somalia. The programme is funded by savings from European posts

and by reducing the footprint in Iraq and Afghanistan over time. Ministers have also

increased visits to key countries, including 80 visits to the Gulf in the last year, and

formalised new arrangements, such as the UK-Turkey Strategic Partnership signed

in Ankara by the two Prime Ministers in July 2010.

The UK's key role as a permanent member of the **UN Security Council was**

emphasised by events in Libya and the leading role in gaining widespread support

for UN SCR 1970 and UN SCR 1973 to protect the Libyan people. The UK also

promoted the role of the UN Secretary General's Special Representative for Libya

and the Special Envoy for post conflict planning in providing a quick and integrated

response. Other UNSCRs on North Korea, Cote d'Ivoire, Sudan/South Sudan and

Somalia demonstrated the role the UN continues to play in addressing threats to

international peace and security.

**NATO's role in enforcing UN resolutions through the No Fly Zone in Libya**

demonstrated the ability of the two organisations to work together towards

international crises, within a wider coalition of willing participants. The UK was a

13


-----

driving force in maintaining political will to sustain the NATO operation and will

continue to invest in the reform of the NATO Command Structure and strongly

support the Secretary General's efforts to improve NATO efficiency and

effectiveness.

The UK continues to work closely with **EU partners to ensure that, alongside NATO,**

Europe promotes shared security and prosperity interests. The UK has led the

debate on tougher action on piracy while maintaining an activated national

headquarters (HQ) at Northwood commanding EU Operation ATALANTA, the EU

mission to counter piracy off the coast of Somalia. The UK continues to press for

stronger action in the Balkans and Afghanistan, while supporting greater EU

capability development and better EU-NATO relations.

The SDSR committed to producing **integrated strategies** for the countries and

regions of greatest significance or risk. For priority countries and regions, the NSC

has approved these government-wide strategies for systematically pursuing wider

national objectives. These strategies are regularly reviewed to respond to ongoing

developments and track progress towards objectives and drive individual country

plans, which have been developed for each country where there is UK

representation.

The SDSR committed to promoting the UK's economic interests through

commercial diplomacy. In May, the FCO published the Charter for Business, which

set out how the diplomatic network will support the UK's economic interests

overseas and help deliver growth. Successes include opening markets in India

worth £500 million, defending a UK company in Korea from a multi-million pound tax

claim, and assisting a UK company in Qatar to secure business worth £2 billion.

Commercial diplomacy efforts include support for British defence exports, including

the highly capable Eurofighter Typhoon, which has made the final stages of several

major export competitions and is now in service with six nations. The UK has

continued to champion multilateral trade liberalisation, encourage World Trade

Organisation accessions and promote bilateral EU Free Trade Agreements (FTAs),

such as the Korean FTA that came into force in July and is expected to net the UK

£150 million per year.

14


-----

The SDSR committed to focusing the UK's overall **defence engagement,** the use of

defence capabilities to increase the UK's influence and understanding across the

world. In May the Foreign and Defence Secretaries announced a new defence

engagement strategy to be published before the end of 2011, to ensure that UK

maximises influence through use of defence assets and activities to support wider

national goals of protecting our security, enhancing our prosperity and protecting UK

citizens.

The SDSR committed to establishing a National Space Security Policy. To fulfil this,

a Space Security team has been formed in the Cabinet Office and is working to

publish a National Space Security Policy in 2012.

The SDSR committed to a system of lead Ministers, accountable to the NSC,

responsible for overseeing the co-ordination of SDSR implementation. Over the last

year, progress has been monitored by a cross-Government Implementation Board of

senior officials, based in Cabinet Office and reporting to NSC. This underscores the

joint, whole-of-Government approach that the NSC continues to take on issues of

national security.

The acid test of any defence and security strategy is its ability to deal with a crisis.

The UK's prompt and flexible military, diplomatic and stabilisation activity in Libya

confirmed the validity of many of the key conclusions of the SDSR. The outstanding

performance of the Armed Forces and civilians demonstrated the UK's continued

ability to project power flexibly and to take a leading role in shaping international

. events. The UN, EU and NATO again demonstrated their centrality. The excellent

political and military cooperation with France, other NATO and European partners

and Gulf States demonstrated the vital importance of strengthening defence ties with

existing allies and new partners in tackling defence and security.

The Government remains determined to update the NSC biannually on SDSR

progress and will continue to provide public annual reports. In 2012, there will be a

further update to Parliament and, in line with the commitment in the National Security

Strategy, a review of the National Security Risk Assessment.
