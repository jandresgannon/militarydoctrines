**Preface**

The Republic of Korea leads the world in information and communications technology (ICT) and

related infrastructure, and the development of a diverse and convenient cyberspace has allowed

people to broaden their horizons. Additionally, cyberspace is now the foundation for providing the

government's administrative services as well as operating the nation's critical facilities.

However, the recent rise in cybercrime and terrorism threatens the lives of ordinary people and

business activities of companies. Systematic and sophisticated cyber attacks present a grave

challenge to national security.

To address these growing threats, the Korean government has drawn up this National

Cybersecurity Strategy. We will safeguard the people's safety, rights and interests against

cybercrime. We will swiftly detect and block cyber threats to guarantee that key operations

of the government continue. We will foster cybersecurity talent and continue to support the

development of the cybser security industry.

At the heart of cybersecurity lies the people, and the government has devised three fundamental

cybersecurity principles to protect the people. We will guarantee the public’s basic rights and carry

out security activities rooted in the rule of law. We will realize clear and transparent cybersecurity

by ensuring citizen participation.

With the cooperation of the government, companies and citizens alike, we can secure our

cyberspace. The government will spare no effort in creating an open and safe online environment.

I call on my fellow Koreans to join in these endeavors to make Korea a leading cybersecurity

nation.

**Moon Jae-in**
President

National Cybersecurity Strategy

Increased vulnerability in cyberspace

The Republic of Korea has built one of the most convenient and
prosperous cyberspace environments, drawing upon our worldclass information and communications technology(ICT) and related
infrastructure.

Today cyberspace is crucial to the daily lives of people, as well as


#### 01
**Changing**
**Environment**
**and New**
**Challenges**



to the economic activities of businesses and the operations of the
government, including the provision of basic services.

However, interconnection across various information and
communications devices is sharply increasing the complexity of
cyberspace, making it harder to manage in a safe manner.

The borderless nature of cyberspace enables vulnerabilities of certain
ICT devices to threaten cyberspace as a whole.

Furthermore, cyberspace threats are starting to affect our physical
environment with the increasing use of convergent technologies,
enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT) for home appliances, medical
devices, smart factories and critical infrastructure.

The severity of cyber threats

In the past, malicious cyber activities were carried out mainly by
individuals or hacker groups. With the growing involvement of criminal
and terrorist groups, supported by state actors, cyber attacks are
becoming more organized and executed on a larger scale.

The methods of cyber attacks are diversifying as well, from theft of
confidential information and money, to causing social unrest for
political purposes, and even cyber terrorism to disrupt or destroy
infrastructure.

There is also an increasing likelihood of a cyber war, where cyber
attacks may incur damage equal to that caused by traditional armed
attacks.

BACKGROUND VISIONS AND GOALS STRATEGIC TASKS PLANS FOR IMPLEMENTATION

Intensified cybersecurity competition among states

Political, economic, and military disputes among states are escalating
to conflicts in cyberspace. In some cases, cyber attacks are conducted
prior to or after physical attacks.

Recognizing cyber capabilities as asymmetric powers with potential
to significantly impact national security, states have long fostered
cybersecurity experts and expanded cybersecurity organizations.

In addition, governments have invested substantial budget in
developing state-of-the-art cyber technologies based on artificial
intelligence (AI) and big data analytics, as well as strengthening
capabilities to collect cyber intelligence, disturb Internet networks, and
disrupt major facilities.

Increased harm to the public due to cybercrime

Cybercrime damage to businesses and people continues to grow with
the increasing use of advanced technology and sophistication of cyber
attacks, such as stealing and encrypting personal information.

The involvement of state actors and terrorist groups is also creating
greater and more serious cybercrime damage, increasing the number
of incidents that threaten national security.


-----

National Cybersecurity Strategy

The Republic of Korea has achieved remarkable success in becoming
an IT powerhouse, but the nation's cyberspace has been vulnerable to a
range of threats.

The government has continuously enhanced the national cybersecurity
system by establishing and implementing comprehensive measures
in concert with relevant ministries and agencies whenever a massive
incident occurred.


#### 02

**Review and**
**Evaluation**



Despite these efforts, the rapid development of cyberspace and
increased threats to cybersecurity demand more proactive attention
and action.

Response Capabilities

The government has continued to bolster its cyber defense
capabilities by building a system to detect and respond to cyber
attacks in real time, as well as separating internal government
networks from the public Internet.

However, it is time to further enhance the resilience of national core
services and implement active response measures to evolving cyber
attacks.

Human resources and budget

The Korean government has continuously increased the cybersecurity
budget and invested in fostering more cybersecurity personnel, while
companies have also expanded resources dedicated to cybersecurity.

Yet, the ratio of the government's cybersecurity budget in proportion
to the national budget still falls short that of developed countries, and
there remains a shortage of talented cybersecurity experts, while there
is the increasing demand for security skills and experience.


-----

Ⅰ Ⅱ Ⅲ Ⅳ
BACKGROUND VISIONS AND GOALS STRATEGIC TASKS PLANS FOR IMPLEMENTATION

Industry and technology

The government has enacted relevant laws and regulations to

enhance the competitiveness of the security industry and create

more jobs, and has created and implemented R&D plans for

related technologies.

However, there is still a perception of security as cost, and the lack

of sufficient investment and research in basic and next-generation

security technologies limits our ability to narrow the technological

gap with other leading countries.

Security Awareness

The government’s efforts to raise awareness, coupled with

increased damage caused by malicious cyber attacks, has

improved both individuals' and companies’ awareness of the

importance of cybersecurity.

Still, many people do not practice basic security rules, while many

companies do not take the action needed to protect information

and security, creating a gap between awareness and practice.

International cooperation

In order to respond to transnational cyber threats, the

government is striving to build a cooperative mechanism with

allies and international organizations, such as the UN and ITU.

At the same time, we need to pursue systematic and practical

international cooperative activities, such as joining international

conventions, sharing information and technology, and drawing up

international rules on cybersecurity.


-----

National Cybersecurity Strategy

Changes and challenges in cyberspace, combined with the realities
facing our nation, demand a more strategic and systematic approach
towards national cybersecurity.

In order to respond to threats and achieve national prosperity, we must
strengthen cyber capabilities and promote cooperation across sectors
under a consistent strategy.

Recognizing the cyber threat to national security, the government has

The achievements, response systems, institutions, and capabilities
of previous policies were extensively evaluated in the process of
establishing this Strategy.

This
vision and goals of the Republic of Korea and outlines strategic tasks for
individuals, companies, and the government.

The Strategy further elaborates on the roles and responsibilities of all
members of society to create a national culture of security practice,
ultimately enhancing the nation's cyber defense capacities.

Furthermore, the Strategy aims to protect our cyberspace from threats
to allow all people to safely enjoy cyberspace.
