**Slovak Foreign Policy Report 2010**

The year 2010 was a challenging but also groundbreaking year for Slovakia, taking
into consideration changes within its foreign policy priorities. Qualitative change brought
about by the new government was particularly noticable in the promotion of realistic
attittudes towards the European Union and the single European currency, the change in
atmosphere in bilateral relations with Hungary, and in the pursuit of value-based foreign
policy. Slovakia confirmed its commitment to the European and Euro-Atlantic values and
principles through its balanced and transparent policy in an ever-changing global context.
From the perspective of global developments within the international community,
2010 was a complicated year in which the decline of the global economy continued and the
problems brought about by the global financial and economic crisis were not overcome. In a
majority of advanced countries, the crisis translated into a debt crisis, the most serious crisis
which the common European currency has had to face so far. In the context of the global
economy, large countries with fast-growing economies (such as China, India and Brazil),
including those countries that use economy and trade as a foreign policy instrument, are
increasingly reinforcing their positions. Europe has continued with the search for its identity
through internal reforms, including the establishment of the European External Action
Service.

**Regional cooperation and neighbourly relations**
**Regional cooperation and the development of good neighbourly relations were the**
priorities of Slovak foreign policy. In pursuing these priorities, the Slovak Republic is
building on the assumption that the countries of the Visegrad Four (V4) group have sufficient
capacity to further develop multilateral cooperation and influence European policies. During
the preparations for its twelve month Presidency of the V4, handed over from Hungary on 1
July 2010, the Slovak Republic had resolved to intensify regional cooperation and bring
forward topics and issues that would strengthen both the EU and NATO, while also benefiting
our interests. Priority issues include sectoral cooperation concerning the new financial
perspective of the EU, regional and cohesion policies, energy industry, transport infrastructure
and the environment. In the second half of 2010, a mechanism of regular meetings of V4
prime ministers that are held prior to European Council meetings was successfully introduced
(the September 2010 meeting was attended by President of the European Council Herman
Van Rompuy; the December meeting was attended by President of the European Commission
José Manuel Barroso). Another successful event was an informal meeting of the V4 foreign
affairs ministers and representatives of the Western Balkan region, together with
representatives of Belgium’s EU Presidency and the European Commission, held in
Bratislava in October 2010. The ministers expressed their support of the policy of EU
enlargement to the Western Balkan countries and agreed on closer coordination of joint
actions to be taken by the V4 countries to support European and Euro-Atlantic integration
processes. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic began implementing a
specific bilateral assistance programme for the countries of the Western Balkans and the
Eastern Partnership - Centre for Transfer of Integration and Reform Experience.
Slovakia actively joined in consultations with the European Commission and countries
of the region which should become part of the European Danube Region Strategy. Slovakia’s
priorities include development of transport infrastructure, energy industries and the
environment, along with social and economic development, including enhancement of
competitiveness.
As far as bilateral **neighbourly relations are concerned, those with the** **Czech**
**Republic have preserved their above-standard quality, as proved by bilateral visits of Prime**


-----

Ministers and Foreign Affairs Ministers of the two countries following their appointment after
respective general elections. The proximity of programmes and ideas of the new coalition
governments in the two countries also provided room for close cooperation within such
platforms as the EU, NATO, OSCE and the UN. Slovakia and the Czech Republic continued
their joint operations in international crisis management missions (Kosovo, Afghanistan), and
their armed forces agreed to carry on joint purchases of military equipment. Energy security
was also among the priority issues on the agenda of bilateral cooperation. Close cooperation
and the ability to effectively provide mutual aid could also be seen during emergency
situations caused by floods (May and August 2010). The two countries consulted the extent of
damage and the submission of an application to the EU Solidarity Fund.
Cooperation with the **Republic of Poland** was of a similarly dynamic nature, as
proved by a December 2010 visit by the Slovak Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikuláš Dzurinda
to Warsaw. Both countries tested their operational links and responsively assisted each other
during the floods on the Slovak-Polish border. Energy security was the top issue discussed at
the July meeting of the Slovak and Polish Prime Ministers, which translated into a declaration
expressing their interest in building a gas network interconnection between the two countries.
Unresolved bilateral issues include the completion of cross-border road transport
infrastructure along the expressway section between Prešov and Rzeszów and modernisation
of railway infrastructure.
After a fruitless period of confrontation, 2010 witnessed a change in the approach to
bilateral relations with the Republic of Hungary. The adoption by Hungary of an amendment
to the Citizenship Act and the Act on National Solidarity (so-called Act on Trianon) just on
the eve of Slovakia’s general election had increased tensions in bilateral relations and resulted
in a temporary suspension of dialogue between the two countries. It was not before the July
2010 meeting of the Prime Ministers of the Slovak Republic and the Republic of Hungary that
an agreement to resolve problematic issues was achieved and bilateral dialogue resumed,
along with the functioning of joint committees established in order to implement the Treaty
on Good Neighbourliness and Friendly Cooperation between Slovakia and Hungary. In the
course of September and October, the committees launched their activities aimed at
development of multifaceted cooperation. The atmosphere in bilateral relations improved and
new possibilities opened up for more effective communication between the top state officials,
as proved by the visit of the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to Slovakia in December
2010 and the visit of the Slovak Minister of Foreign Affairs to Hungary in September of that
year. The Foreign Affairs Ministers agreed on cooperation in the area of infrastructure
development, energy, consular cooperation and joint action in the region (V4), the EU and
NATO. New transport infrastructure projects between the two countries were discussed (the
north-south gas network interconnection Veľký Krtíš–Vecsés, completion of the KošiceMiskolc expressway, construction of bridges over the Ipeľ River), as well as projects in the
area of culture and science.
Intensive bilateral discussions with Austria were held during the September visit by
the Slovak Prime Minister to this neighbouring country, as well as during the visits by the
Slovak Minister of Foreign Affairs to Austria in August and October. Nuclear energy was a
closely watched issue in bilateral relations; in May 2010, Slovakia managed to close, without
any principal objections raised by Austria, an environmental impact assessment procedure
concerning the construction of blocks 3 and 4 of the Mochovce nuclear power plant. Another
positive achievement in the area of energy security was the launching of the gas network
interconnection in Baumgarten (Austria) enabling reverse gas flow from Austria to Slovakia.
Austria has thus become the second country, after the Czech Republic, which can supply
Slovakia with natural gas in case of an emergency. A strategic dimension of this arrangement
is that it will enable connection to the planned Nabucco gas pipeline, which should end right


-----

at the Baumgarten terminal. Once the Nabucco project is launched, Slovakia will have both
the transport route and sources of its gas supplies diversified. A solution to connect oil
transport systems of the two countries is also being sought.
As for relations with **Ukraine,** Slovak diplomacy focused on good neighbourly
relations, economic cooperation, energy security, minority and expatriate issues, and crossborder cooperation. The delivery of energy supplies to Slovakia through Ukrainian territory
was reliable and uninterrupted in 2010. Bilateral dialogue also intensified. The Slovak
Minister of Foreign Affairs visited Ukraine in April and August. The most prominent events
in bilateral contacts last year included a visit by the President of the Slovak Republic to
Ukraine in October and a Slovak-Ukrainian business forum. During the visit, an agreement on
cancellation of consular fees for national visas was signed. Slovak activities contributed to a
broader engagement of the Ukrainian academic community and civil society in shaping the
country’s European attittudes. Funds from the Slovak development assistance programme
were used to finance the launch of the National Convention project (in cooperation with the
Slovak Foreign Policy Association) in December 2010.
For the fourth year in a row, the Slovak Embassy in Kiev served as a NATO Contact
Point Embassy in Ukraine. Despite Ukraine’s changed policy towards NATO, the Embassy
will continue providing information to the Ukrainian public on NATO-related issues and
participate in the implementation of Ukraine’s reform plans in the area of defence.

**European Union**
The main topic on the **European agenda** in 2010 was the **financial crisis and the**
acknowledgement of the very deep mutual economic and financial interdependence among
EU Member States. This led to the commencement of a process of reinforcing economic
cooperation among EU countries. Slovakia actively pursued its opinions on the continuation
of the EU enlargement process, overcoming the consequences of the global economic crisis
and consolidation of the Eurozone. It primarily focused on those areas and policies where it
can provide higher added value and tangible results to partners (such as fiscal policy,
structural reforms, the Western Balkans, the Eastern Partnership, etc.). With the aim of
improving the effective functioning of European institutions, Slovakia was actively engaged
in the implementation process of the Treaty of Lisbon, while also paying appropriate attention
to the building of the European External Action Service.
With respect to measures aimed at stabilising and consolidating public finances of the
Eurozone countries, Slovakia actively promoted the strengthening of the Stability and Growth
Pact and responsible economic governance, including through more stringent fiscal discipline,
extending economic oversight and, above all, application of a permanent crisis mechanism.
Slovakia’s position in the discussion on a loan to Greece and the establishment of the
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) was driven by its efforts to promote measures
that provide a more permanent solution to the problem. One such measure involved debt
restructuring with a managed default as an option. We consider it important that views on
resolving debt problems of Eurozone countries have changed and partners have realised that a
loan will not help if the essence of the problem remains unresolved. Slovakia contributed to
this change in attitude by taking a position which had first been subject to criticism but turned
out later as well-founded, value-consistent and prospective. As regards the preparation of the
new Strategy for Growth and Employment - Europe 2020, it is one of Slovakia’s
achievements that the cohesion policy is considered among the most important instruments
for its implementation. In 2010, Slovakia managed to speed up the drawing of cohesion policy
funds for the 2007-2013 period, which allowed to close operational programmes of the 20042006 programming period. Slovakia actively participated in the drafting of a future cohesion


-----

policy beyond 2013. A strong cohesion policy for all EU regions with focus on the most
underdeveloped regions remains among Slovakia’s top priorities.
Slovakia was actively engaged in negotiations on the 2011 EU budget, pursuing
balanced approach and taking into account not only the need for budgetary stringency, but
also availability of sufficient resources to finance EU policies. Within the debate on the EU
budget review, Slovakia opened up the issue of updating national positions on the budget
review in October 2010. Concerning the intensification of EU Member States’ cooperation
under the common agricultural policy (CAP), agricultural ministers of Slovakia, Hungary,
Poland, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania signed a joint declaration at their meeting
in Bratislava in November 2010, in which they agreed that real CAP reform was necessary. It
should primarily be aimed at preserving a two-pillar policy model and extending the
application of the Single Area Payment Scheme.
With respect to further **EU enlargement, Slovakia was primarily engaged in**
supporting **European prospects of the Western Balkans. Visits by the Slovak Minister of**
Foreign Affairs to Serbia (October) and Montenegro (November) emphasised Slovakia’s
commitment to assist the two countries in their EU integration efforts and capacity building to
meet these objectives. Slovakia expressed its political support to accession talks between
Croatia and the EU. In particular, it shared with Croatia its experience from the accession
process and harmonisation of national legislation with EU law. Slovakia observes with regret
that it was impossible to begin actual accession talks with Macedonia last year. Slovakia
acknowledged the positive _avis_ of the European Commission on the EU membership
application submitted by Montenegro and, together with partners, succeeded in pushing
through a European Council decision of December 2010 to grant Montenegro the status of a
candidate country. Slovakia also contributed to the progress in Serbia’s EU integration
process. In February, the interim trade agreement between the EU and Serbia was unblocked;
in June, the Council of the EU decided to proceed with the ratification process of the
Stabilisation and Association Agreement. The President of the Slovak Republic ratified the
Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and Their
Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Serbia, of the other part, in October 2010.
It was also due to the activities of Slovak diplomacy that a joint EU-Serbia resolution was
adopted at the UN General Assembly in September 2010 concerning the request for an
advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on the legitimacy of the unilateral
declaration of independence by Kosovo and its compliance with international law. With an
active endorsement by Slovakia, the Council of the EU requested the European Commission
in October 2010 to provide an opinion on Serbia’s application for EU membership. Slovakia
was supportive of EU integration of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina and approved the
decision of the Council of the EU to liberalise visa regimes for the citizens of the two
countries. A joint statement was adopted at the ministerial meeting of the V4 countries with
the Western Balkan countries that was held in Bratislava in October, outlining the steps to be
taken during the upcoming period.
Slovakia appreciated the commencement of accession talks with Iceland and
supported the continuation of EU accession negotiations with Turkey.

Under the overall revision and improvements in the implementation of the European
Neighbourhood Policy, the Slovakia sought to enhance the effective functioning of the
**Eastern Partnership** project. Strengthening political dialogue with Eastern Partnership
countries was the main objective pursued by MFA top officials during meetings in Ukraine
(August) and Moldova (November). Slovakia paid special attention to negotiations on
association agreements with partner countries, implementation of a visa-free regime, and
increasing the effective utilisation of EU financial instruments available to partners. Both


-----

countries were offered bilateral action plans which focused on sharing Slovakia’s experience
from transformation, approximation of EU law, administrative capacity building and anticorruption activities. A particular accent was put on cooperation with civil society; National
Conventions were also opened during the visits. Their purpose is to facilitate communication
between the government, the non-governmental sector, academia and the business community
and raise public awareness about the European Union.
The year 2010 was characterised by the **implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon,**
and yielded the first experience with a reformed EU institutional framework. Slovakia
pursued its positions, including, for example, a balanced involvement of the rotating
presidency in the preparation and organisation of respective meetings of the Council of the
EU and the European Council. Slovakia endorsed the introduction of a European Citizens’
Initiative mechanism, which enables one million EU citizens to call directly on the European
Commission to prepare a legal act in any area falling within the framework of its powers.
An important aspect in the practical implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon was the

establishment of the **European External Action Service** (EEAS), designed to improve
coordination of the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy. Slovakia successfully
established itself in a group to promote and coordinate positions on the building of the EEAS.
The fundamental principles of the joint position included a shared ownership of the EEAS (by
Member States and EU institutions), application of the geographical balance principle, and
meaningful participation of all EU Member States. Slovakia sees added value in its possibility
to effectively contribute to the scope of the EEAS, namely in Slovakia’s priority areas which
include the Western Balkans and the Eastern Partnership. In this respect, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic appreciated the appointment of the former Slovak
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miroslav Lajčák, as a Managing Director for Russia, the Eastern
Neighbourhood and the Western Balkans.

**Security policy and new challenges**
The **security policy** in 2010 was affected by complicated developments in
Afghanistan operations, an unpredictable policy pursued by Iran, the signing of a nuclear
disarmament treaty between the US and Russia, and escalating tensions on the Korean
Peninsula. NATO November summit in Lisbon adopted its new Strategic Concept,
preparation of which historically for the first time also involved Slovakia. The document is in
line with the positions Slovakia presented during the preparation process and reflects
Slovakia’s requirement that the tasks and goals of the Alliance be realistic, feasible and open
for cooperation with partners. It is also closely linked with the need to cope with the pressure
for more effective spending of financial resources. The summit confirmed that the Alliance
was resolved to address security risks even outside NATO territory and cooperate with
partners that share similar values in a global context. An important issue on the summit
agenda was the decision on the building of a NATO missile defence system. The Lisbon
summit also announced the beginning of the transition of responsibilities to the Afghan
administration (the so-called transition process) to be carried out in the 2011-2014 period.
The GLOBSEC 2010 international conference organised by the Slovak Atlantic
Commission in September, the Slovak Security Forum conference organised by the EuroAtlantic Centre and the NATO Depository Library in October, along with other similar expert
events, contributed to a full-scale debate on the new NATO Strategic Concept and security
policy.
The priority was the ISAF operation in Afghanistan. The number of Slovak troops
deployed under ISAF increased to 314 in 2010, with the prospect of a further increase by 30


-----

troops in the course of 2011. The character of Slovak armed forces activities in Afghanistan
began to be better aligned with the requirement to strengthen NATO training capacities to
support the transition of responsibilities for the country’s security, scheduled to start in 2011.
Slovak development assistance in Afghanistan was also adjusted to match this objective.
Slovakia is interested in having adequate participation in UN peacekeeping missions.
Slovak troops continued their tasks under the UNFICYP mission in Cyprus and UNTSO in
the Middle East. Activities of the Slovak contingent in Cyprus were supportive of Slovak
diplomacy in its role as mediator, thus contributing to the excellent performance by the
Slovak Republic of complex and (including by the UN) widely appreciated tasks of a provider
of good services within bicommunal dialogue. Slovak troops continued their presence within
the ALTHEA mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, at NATO Headquarters in Sarajevo, the
EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia, the EULEX mission in Kosovo, and the EUBAM mission
on the Moldova-Ukraine borders. Two police experts participated in the EUPOL operation in
Afghanistan.
Slovakia systematically advocated close institutional cooperation between NATO and
the EU, and cooperation of NATO with the UN, the OSCE and the African Union. In
addition, Slovakia actively joined the OSCE discussion on the future of European security
within the Corfu Process and pushed through a proposal in the area of energy security.
Together with its partners and allies, Slovakia actively sought answers within
international organisations to such **global challenges** as counter-terrorism, climate change,
cyber defence, terrorism, global economic crisis, disarmament, illegal migration, food and
energy security, education, science, and the search for optimal ways towards advanced
technologies.
Within the **UN, the Slovak Republic participated in the building of a system of**
international relations based on the principle of effective multilateralism. Under the Common
Foreign and Security Policy, Slovakia was supportive of EU priorities in the UN and engaged
in resolving the issue of pursuing uniform voting of EU Member States at the global level
within activities of the UN General Assembly and Security Council in line with the changes
brought forth by the Treaty of Lisbon. Slovakia endorsed a UN reform process with the aim
of increasing coordination and mutual cooperation among the General Assembly, the Security
Council and the Economic and Social Council in particular. The Slovak Republic supported
the unification of UN structures in the area of gender equality and the empowerment of
women into a single entity entitled UN Women. It presented its positions on the UN Security
Council reform based on increasing its effectiveness and responsibility, including through
increased representation of the Eastern European Regional Group.
As a chair of the UN Group of Friends of **Security Sector Reform** (SSR) in New
York, the Slovak Republic carried on with the activities it had launched as a non-permanent
UN Security Council member in the 2004-2007 period. The Security Sector Reform was one
of the key issues on the agenda of the Slovak chairmanship that received a broad positive
response in the UN. In cooperation with Indonesia, Slovakia organised a workshop on
multidimensional UN peacekeeping operations and post-conflict peace building for ASEAN
countries, held in Jakarta in March 2010. It supported a workshop organised by Nigeria and
the Republic of South Africa in New York on African prospects in the SSR area, focusing on
cooperation between the UN and the African Union.

**Bilateral relations**
The economic crisis, new global challenges, international co-responsibility and a
positive experience of solidarity have strengthened relations between Slovakia and other EU
and NATO countries.


-----

The Slovak Government has confirmed its interest in continuing and further
intensification of bilateral cooperation with the US. It has emphasised its strong interest in a
substantive dialogue, seeking answers to foreign policy and security challenges. It was
important to take advantage of the positive momentum, complete a number of major bilateral
cooperation projects, and bring the bilateral strategic dialogue to a higher political level.
Successful projects for the transfer of persons detained at the US Guantanamo Bay Detention
Facility to Slovakia, reinforcing the number of Slovak troops deployed under the ISAF
operation and, last but not least, the completion of several years of efforts to establish a
Congressional Caucus on Slovakia in the US Congress moved to the forefront. The top events
in the bilateral dialogue included the visit by the Slovak Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikuláš
Dzurinda to the US in October 2010, followed by the visit by the Slovak Prime Minister Iveta
Radičová in November of that year. At a meeting with Minister Dzurinda, US Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton praised Slovakia for being a pillar of regional stability and cooperation.
Attention also concentrated on enhancing bilateral economic cooperation, as proved
by an address delivered by the Minister of Foreign Affairs at a global investment symposium
at the Harvard Club in New York, and the agenda of his official visit to the US that focused
on economic and scientific cooperation. Preparation of “Road Show” events continued, so as
to encourage technology transfers between the US and Slovakia.
Enhancing cooperation with **Germany was also among Slovak foreign policy**
priorities, where Slovakia managed to retain the intensity and high quality of mutual dialogue.
A number of important bilateral activities took place, primarily focused on the deepening of
economic cooperation. Discussions between the Slovak Prime Minister Iveta Radičová and
the German Minister of Foreign Affairs contributed to the intensification of economic
cooperation with an emphasis on utilisation of Germany’s capacities as one of the world’s
leaders in innovation, new advanced technologies and renewable energy. An important
moment was the search for common positions on the EU agenda, especially in the context of
crisis measures adopted within the Eurozone.
Bilateral dialogue between the Slovak Republic and the **United Kingdom of Great**
**Britain and Northern Ireland** concentrated on seeking responses to EU policy challenges
(building and staffing the European External Action Service, preparation of the EU budget
review) and global political developments. Slovakia was interested in balancing bilateral
dialogue through reciprocal visits of UK officials to the Slovak Republic.

The underlying element in bilateral relations with **France** in 2010 was the

strengthening of mutual dialogue at all levels, with the focus on identifying concrete
programmes and projects for bilateral cooperation. Attention primarily concentrated on the
economy, nuclear energy, investments and industry, as also proved by the September visit by
the Minister Mikuláš Dzurinda to Paris. Regional cooperation between Slovak and French
regions and municipalities continued to develop.

EU-related issues prevailed in bilateral relations with **Spain,** which held the EU

Presidency in the first half of 2010.

Bilateral relations with Italy concentrated on events designed to improve investment

opportunities in Slovakia, such as cooperation between ENEL and the Slovenské elektrárne
company. Relations with **Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg, Greece, Sweden, Cyprus,**
**Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands** focused on searching for new opportunities to
enhance economic and cultural cooperation.

In 2010, Slovakia continued strengthening its bilateral cooperation with the Western
**Balkan countries, and remained engaged in seeking solutions to the problematic issues of this**
region. Intensive cooperation with Croatia continued both in the context of the final stage of
its accession negotiations with the EU and the expansion of bilateral economic cooperation.


-----

During the official visit by the Slovak Minister of Foreign Affairs to Serbia in October 2010,
the quality of bilateral relations and Slovakia’s contribution to Serbian democratisation
processes were acknowledged; the Minister also delivered a speech at a ceremony
commemorating the 10th anniversary of the overthrow of Milosevic’s regime in Serbia.
Bilateral cooperation and European integration were discussed during the visit by the Slovak
Minister of Foreign Affairs to Montenegro in November 2010. Slovak troops completed their
mission within the KFOR operation in line with the long-term operation planning; Slovakia
remains present in Kosovo (EULEX mission) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (EU/ALTHEA
and EUPM operations).
While retaining its unvarying position on the unilateral declaration of independence by
Kosovo, Slovakia continued in 2010 to advocate a search for a long-term and sustainable
solution to the Kosovo issue and dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina. Slovakia remained
engaged in KFOR operations to the extent that its mandate would be in compliance with the
UN Security Council Resolution 1244(1999). Slovakia made sure that the KFOR troops
fulfilled their tasks according to their mandate even during the period of their gradual scaledown and transition of the operation to a deterrent presence level. Slovak troops concluded
their involvement in the KFOR operation on 30 September 2010 upon a decision by the
National Council of the Slovak Republic.
Slovakia was also actively involved in the formulation of a NATO policy on the
Western Balkans. It promoted the “open door policy” and, at a meeting of NATO Foreign
Ministers held in Tallinn in April 2010, endorsed the decision to invite **Bosnia and**
**Herzegovina** to join the Membership Action Plan and supported intensification of
cooperation between NATO and Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.
Slovakia’s relation with Eastern European countries developed in compliance with a
strategic policy line of the EU. **Moldova** was the priority country of the Slovak official
development assistance. Since 1 November 2010, following the signing of an agreement
between the Slovak and Hungarian Foreign Affairs Ministries on mutual representation in
visa procedures, Moldovan citizens are allowed toapply for Slovak visas at the Hungarian
Embassy in Chisinau.
As regards **Belarus,** Slovak actively participated in the EU debate on shaping of its
policy towards Belarus. Slovakia promoted a critical and open dialogue with Belarus leaders,
continuous communication with the opposition and support to civil society institutions in the
country, the use of official development assistance resources and a micro-grant scheme.
Slovak diplomacy condemned the December presidential election and accompanying
violence, and expressed support to the development of cooperation between the EU and
Belarus under the indispensable condition of respect for democracy, human rights and the rule
of law.
In relations to the Russian Federation, Slovakia advocated development of pragmatic
and mutually rewarding contacts focused on trade and strengthening the economic dimension
of diplomacy. Cooperation in the energy industry is considered strategic. During a visit by the
Russian President Dmitri Medvedev to Slovakia in April 2010, emphasis was put on
economic cooperation and a search for new strategies and innovative procedures. The visit
was subject to criticism by the general public on account that it failed to address unresolved
historic issues which the Slovak Republic considers important. The talks indicated that
cooperation was necessary on international policy issues in order to address common
challenges in the area of security, stability and development, modernisation, economic crisis
and climate change. The signing of an implementing protocol between the Slovak and
Russian government to the Agreement between the European Community and the Russian
Federation on readmission represented a significant milestone towards a visa-free regime
between the Russian Federation and the EU.


-----

Slovakia encouraged a more effective functioning of the NATO-Russia Council and
the preparation of a joint document to assess security threats of the 21[st] century. The strategic
dialogue between Russia and the US has remained an important factor in international
relationsalso with China playing an increasingly more important role.
In relation to **Georgia, Slovakia pursued a policy of supporting Georgia’s territorial**
integrity within its internationally recognised borders. Relations with **Armenia** and
**Azerbaijan** were based on the long-term interest in developing stable, pragmatic and
mutually rewarding contacts with the countries of the South Caucasus, with an accent on
economic cooperation and in compliance with the EU’s Eastern Partnership programme.
These aspects were also reflected in talks held by the Slovak Minister of Foreign Affairs with
partners in Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Standard cooperation continued with countries of **Central Asia,** corresponding with
the possibilities and interests of both parties. Further development of trade and economic
cooperation and the building of bilateral treaty base remained a priority, as discussed during
the visits by the Slovak President Ivan Gašparovič to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in April
2010.

**Economic policy abroad**
A large share of activities carried out as part of Slovakia’s economic policy abroad
last year focused on overcoming the consequences of the global financial crisis. Through its
active participation in the activities of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), Slovakia could draw on well-tried policies and best practices for
sustainable economic growth. Last year, an overall economic assessment, environmental
performance assessment, in-depth energy audit, plus a number of other significant activities,
were also carried out as part of the Slovakia-OECD cooperation. The foreign service sought
out possibilities for broader involvement of Slovak business entities in public tenders for the
delivery of goods and services to international organisations. The MFA organised a workshop
for Slovak business entities, attended by representatives of procurement departments of
international organisations of the UN System, the EU and NATO, to inform them about the
conditions for participation in international tenders.
In cooperation with the Ministry of Economy of the Slovak Republic, the competences
of the Ministry of Economy in the area of foreign trade concerning the management and
administration of Slovak commercial and economic sections abroad were transferred to the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, effective 1 January 2011, in compliance with the Government
Manifesto and an amendment to Act No. 575/2001 Coll. on the organisation of the
Government activities and on the organisation of central state administration as amended by
Act No. 403/2010 Coll. The aforementioned legislative measure laid down an institutional
framework for building of an integrated foreign service and an optimum model of economic
diplomacy emphasising Slovakia’s economic interests abroad. In cooperation with the
Economy Ministry, the SARIO agency and the Slovak Chamber of Industry and Commerce,
the MFA focused oninvestment capital from Asia, the Gulf countries, Latin America and
Africa, in addition to traditional European partners. Two important business conferences were
held in Bratislava in this respect: Prospects of Doing Business in Africa and Prospects of
Doing Business in China. In cooperation with SARIO, the MFA also organised business
missions for Slovak entrepreneurs to South Caucasian countries and Moldova. In April 2010,
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs organised an international conference on innovative policy
and technology transfers, in cooperation with the American Chamber of Commerce in the
Slovak Republic and the Office of the Government, which represented a tangible contribution
by the MFA to Slovakia’s international economic policy.


-----

**Development assistance**
In 2010, the Slovak Republic renewed its commitment to the Millennium
Development Goals, including through a declaration at the UN Summit held in New York in
September 2010. Slovakia confirmed it would endeavour to gradually increase the volume of
its development assistance. However, it will primarily concentrate on the quality,
effectiveness and tangible impacts on a given country and take into account the needs of
partner countries.
In cooperation with several other ministries, the MFA took several particular measures
in 2010 in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of bilateral development
assistance provided by the Slovak Republic. The Slovak Government approved a new method
of budgeting bilateral development assistance. New statute of the Slovak Official
Development Assistance Project Committee were adopted to ensure an independent and
transparent project selection procedure. Through November and December 2010, the OECD’s
Development Assistance Committee carried out a so-called Special Peer Review to evaluate
Slovak development assistance activities; relevant DAC recommendations will be
incorporated in order to further improve the effective functioning of the existing development
assistance system.
A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the MFA and the NonGovernmental Development Organisations Platform in May 2010. The objective of the
Memorandum is to intensify cooperation and improve the effective provision of development
assistance. A Communication Strategy on Slovak official development assistance, approved
in March 2010, is designed to raise general public awareness of official assistance, both at
home and abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will gradually extend the existing treaty base with
Slovak ODA priority countries. An agreement between the Slovak and Moldovan government
on development assistance came into force in September 2010.

Slovak ODA also served as an instrument to support reform and integration processes
in Western Balkan and Eastern Partnership countries. In order to ensure a coordinated
approach, the MFA prepared an institutional platform - Centre for the Transfer of Integration
and Reform Experience. The main objective for Slovak diplomacy was to insert the idea of
application of transitional experience into key EU documents on development cooperation.
Slovakia was among the countries which promptly responded to humanitarian
situations in Haiti, Ukraine, Pakistan, Moldova, Montenegro and Chile. The MFA provided
financial support to rescue teams which voluntarily participated in removing the waste of an
industrial accident near Ajka, Hungary. The readiness to help considerably enhanced mutual
relations and cooperation between the two countries. The Ministry also offered humanitarian
aid to fire-stricken Russia in the form of health recovery stays for children from socially
disadvantaged families. In line with its foreign policy priorities, the Ministry participated in
providing in-kind humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and the Palestinian Administration.
Limited transportation capacities have remained a lingering problem as far as the delivery of
Slovak humanitarian aid to remote territories is concerned. Nevertheless, Slovakia cooperated
effectively with NATO and France in this respect. Slovakia supports concrete steps to be
taken by the EU in order to encourage solidarity among its Member States.

**Value-based policy**
The new Slovak Government undertook in its Manifesto to curtail its contacts with
countries that violate human rights. This decision created conditions for the strengthening of
Slovakia’s position as a respected and recognised partner. One of the first steps indicating this
qualitative change was the Government’s position concerning the award of the Nobel Peace
Prize to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo and an appeal addressed by the Slovak parliamentary

Committee on Human Rights and National Minorities to the Chinese government, requesting
that he be released from prison. Slovakia also became more involved in addressing the issue
of human rights in Cuba. The Ladies in White movement was granted the Ján Langoš Award
in Havana in December 2010. A prominent Cuban dissident José Luis García Paneque was
received at the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss concrete measures that might be
taken in order to help Cuban citizens persecuted by the Communist regime. Slovak Prime
Minister Iveta Radičová reminded that the Slovak Republic was proud to support defenders of
human rights and freedoms in repressive regimes such as Cuba, thereby following its own
tradition of civil resistance against totalitarian regimes of the 20th century. The Slovak
Republic also applauded the release of Burmese dissident Aung San Suu Kyi from house
arrest and called on Burmese authorities to release all political prisoners. The presidential
election in Belarus and following development was a topic of special concern at the end of
2010. One of the first tangible results brought by the shift towards value-based diplomacy was
the acknowledgment of Slovakia’s activities by the US-based Celebrate Freedom Foundation,
including its decision to grant Slovakia an Ally of Freedom Award for 2011. The award is
granted for significant contributions to the protection and promotion of freedom and
democracy in the world, fulfilment of the vision of a free and united Europe, and engagement
in joint military missions, including the ISAF operation in Afghanistan.

**Effective foreign service**
The Slovak consular service contributed to the delivery of a strategic foreign policy
objective - **assisting and serving Slovak citizens abroad. Special emphasis was placed on**
responsibility and high quality in aiding Slovak citizens in emergency situations abroad, as
well as on the provision of consular assistance in dealing with the common consular agenda.
The MFA’s intention to improve the protection of Slovak citizens abroad and to ensure a
more operative contact with them led to the establishment of a system for registration of
citizens who travel abroad by means of the MFA website.
Activities of the MFA Citizen Assistance and Service Centre were an important
component of the Ministry’s consular service as it provided information, via phone, to nearly
8,000 citizens.
In 2010, agreements were signed with Hungary and Slovenia on mutual representation
in visa application procedures. The agreement with Hungary is already in force; Hungary
represents Slovakia in Moldova, Albania and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The agreement
signed with Slovenia will come into force following the approval of an implementing
protocol. Slovenia will represent Slovakia in Montenegro, while Slovakia will represent
Slovenia in Romania, Cyprus and Ukraine (Consul General in Uzhgorod)
The building of a consular network in Asia, including the Asian part of the Russian
Federation and former Soviet republics, in Central and Latin America and Sub-Saharan
African regions, has remained among the priorities of the consular service. It also involved
the development of a network of honorary consulates and their engagement in economic
activities.
In 2010, the MFA further improved the effectiveness of the performance of the
**Slovak foreign policy. Despite financial constraints, the existing network of Slovak**
diplomatic missions abroad can be considered effective and capable of pursuing Slovakia’s
foreign policy interests in a professional manner. Last year, a branch office of the Slovak
Embassy in Bonn was closed and a new Embassy in Podgorica opened.
The MFA signed two memoranda of cooperation with partner institutions of the
diplomatic academy (Serbia and Croatia) in 2010. Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Macedonia,
Mexico and Romania have also expressed interest in cooperating in the area of education.
