the ROC Armed Forces are committed to disaster prevention and preparations against threat of complex disasters, and have made use of various field exercises to enhance competences and professional skills in disaster relief.

13 The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has employed 

![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)

all functional media and hosted dynamic, diverse, and educational events to inspire patriotism amongst fellow citizens, so as to strengthen the unity between the military and the people, and realize the concepts of care, support, and participation of all citizens.

Veterans of the War of Resistance against Japan, surviving dependents of the martyrs, foreign friends who kindly assisted us during the War, and descendants of anti-Japanese resistance martyrs of Taiwan origin were invited to attend various commemorative events. President Ma Ying-jeou also personally presented these veterans with the commemorative medals for War of Resistance to honor their sacrifice in the War.

17 Article 138 of the *Constitution of the Republic of* China states: "The land, sea and air forces of the whole country shall be above personal, regional, or party affiliations, shall be loyal to the state, and shall protect the people."
18 PS 1 1 - 1 - 1 Minister's Foreword 19 The security of a nation cannot merely guaranteed by establishing a military force, but most importantly, by the consolidated support and commitment from the people. In order to improve the transparency of national defense affairs, the MND has published the *National Defense Report* on a regular basis to elaborate its national defense concepts and policy implementation performance. It is hoped that through the Report, the people may fully comprehend current national defense policies, step forward to participate in the buildup of our national defense, and thus forge a common consensus for all-out defense. In the past 2 years, the People's Republic of China (PRC) has been continuously increasing its military strength and attempting to break through the current US-led Asia Pacific security framework by efforts such as establishing the East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) and expanding island reclamation in the South China Sea. Additionally, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been pursuing unabated preparations against Taiwan despite easing tensions across the Taiwan Strait, and continuing to carry out targeted exercises while deploying over a thousand short- and medium-range ballistic missiles along the coastal areas facing the Taiwan Strait. Hence, the PRC remains the greatest threat to our national security, tilts regional military balance, and poses a grave challenge to the regional stability. Under the Hard ROC national security guidance of President Ma, the MND has pooled defense resources in building armed force capabilities that aiming at interdicting enemies as they are crossing the Taiwan Strait and preventing them from disembarking. Accordingly, the MND has acquired the AH-64E helicopters. The newly procured UH-60M helicopters, P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missile systems have been arriving on schedule. Furthermore, the ROC Air Force has been upgrading F-16 and IDF fighters, while the Tuo Chiang class corvette and Panshi Fast Combat Support Ship have been successfully delivered to the ROC Navy following the policy of constructing naval vessels indigenously. These efforts of national defense policy implementation have improved the developing progress of our defense industries and further upgrade the domestic industrial capabilities to the next level. In transition to a Volunteer Military System, the MND, in accordance with the *Act of Military Service System,* has been conscripting young adults born before 1993 to safeguard homeland and ensure national security. I am grateful for the cooperation and support shown by these conscripts and their families. 

Realistically speaking, no policy can be successfully implemented overnight. 

The Volunteer Military System, particularly, is critical to our national security, and has a tremendous scope of impact which can only be diminished by the collaboration of all parties involved. It was indeed not easy for our Armed Forces to achieve quite a recruitment result in just a few years. Currently, legislative procedures have been completed for the *Provisional Act for the* Implementation of the Volunteer Military System that is critical to volunteer force recruitment efforts. We believe that with improved emphasis on the pay, dignity, and future career prospects for service members, the Volunteer Military System will be more thorough and complete, and the transition will be more smooth and successful. The ROC Armed Forces have also reaped substantive results in combat readiness exercises, disaster prevention and relief, and professional education and training. In particular, at the scene of every major disaster, such as the recent Typhoon Soudelor, TransAsia Airways Flight 222 crash at Penghu Islands, TransAsia Airways Flight 235 crash at Keelung River, and the Kaohsiung gas explosions, units of the ROC Armed Forces could always be spotted committing fully to disaster relief operations. In the future, the ROC Armed Forces shall continue to improve their overall disaster prevention and relief capabilities and become powerful and elite forces excelled at disaster relief in peacetime and combat operations in wartime, so as to shoulder the greatest responsibility of safeguarding the people's lives and property.

This year marks the 70th Anniversary of Victory in the War of Resistance against Japan. The MND has hosted a series of commemorative events to pay tribute to the brave martyrs who gave their lives to the country, and illustrate the historical significance of the victory. These commemorative events demonstrated the historical fact that the Nationalist Government of the ROC led its military and the people in achieving victory after the 8-year long War of Resistance. In addition, the MND has also held the defense capabilities demonstration, an international seminar, an exhibition detailing the truth of the War, and a musical to help fellow citizens understand the value of peace, and recognize that peace is backed up by credible strength, so as to consolidate our resolves to pursue all-out defense, and ensure the sustainable development of our country. Finally, I gratefully acknowledge the active participation of the Report's advisory committee members as well as our editorial colleagues. I would also like to express my appreciation for the hard work and contributions of all men and women serving in the ROC Armed Forces whose steadfast dedication to force buildup and combat readiness allowed us to enrich the contents of this Report. I also hope that men and women of the ROC will like to share their ideas with us, continue to care and support for national defense and security affairs, and help the ROC Armed Forces to innovate and progress to become highly trained elite forces with powerful warfighting capabilities that lives up to the expectations of our country and our people.

## Introduction 23

Pursuant to Article 30 of the National Defense Act: "The Ministry of National Defense (MND) shall periodically submit the *National Defense Report* in accordance with national goals, general international situations, militar y situations, defense policy, force buildup, combat readiness preparations, utilization of defense resources and implementation of all-out defense." The MND shall compile a *National Defense Report* every 2 years in order to describe changes to the current strategic situations and status of implementation of national defense policies.

The 2015 *National Defense Report* of the MND is the 13th edition of the said report. The contents have been reviewed and compiled in accordance with current domestic and international situations, current challenges to security, and various policy implementation efforts and results. In the past 2 years, security policies of various Asia Pacific countries have experienced noticeable changes, which have affected the development of regional situations. The ROC Armed Forces have also achieved significant progress in acquisition of new equipment and key defense transformations such as establishing the Volunteer Military System and force restructuring. The MND is therefore obliged to share these achievements with the people. In addition to the introduction, this Report is divided into 4 Parts: Strategic Environment, National Defense Policy, National Defense Capabilities, and Allout Defense. The information in this report was collected from January 2014 to August 2015.

## Part 1. Strategic Environment

Traditional military security issues remain the major cause of conflicts among countries. Non-traditional security issues, such as those related to energy, food, and climate change, are also getting attentions in the global community. In the Asia-Pacific Region, rapid military expansion of the PRC has triggered a series of changes in the surrounding areas. The PRC remains the major security threat to our country as it has yet to renounce the use of force against Taiwan and can employ more diverse and flexible array of military means against the island. 

## Part 2. National Defense Policy

The ROC national defense policy, defense strategic objectives, concept of military strategy, and directions of force buildup and development are elaborated here based upon the directives of the *2013 Quadrennial Defense* Review. Detailed narratives of the current defense policy implementation, such as the Volunteer Military System, force restructuring, and transformation in our military judicial system, are also included, so as to allowing the people to grasp the ongoing status of major policies.

## Part 3. National Defense Capabilities

The ROC Armed Forces have been constantly improving their national defense organization, joint operations effectiveness, operational and training readiness, information and electronic warfare (EW) capabilities, logistics support, reserve mobilization, and intangible combat capabilities. The ROC Armed Forces are also maximizing the effectiveness of human, financial and material defense resources to support the completion of its tasks and missions. 

## Part 4. All-Out Defense

Part 4 describes the establishment, management, and results of the Allout Defense Mobilization System as well as efforts in the last 2 years by the ROC Armed Forces in disaster prevention and relief, joint fishery protection, military civil affairs, reconstruction of military dependents' housing, and medical care. Additional information has been provided to give accounts of recent developments and results in all-out defense education programs, including commemoration events for the 70th Anniversary of the Victory in the War of Resistance against Japan and the Retrocession of Taiwan held in 2015, in order to build a nationwide consensus for all-out defense and acquire citizen support for national defense efforts.

## Part 1. Strategic Environment 27

I
n the past 2 years, the global security environment remains in the form of "one hyperpower and many superpowers." The US-led global security efforts are facing new challenges in the form of growing violent and extremist terrorist organizations, increasing instability in Eastern Europe, and reversion of USRussia relations. Major security challenges in the AsiaPacific Region include territorial water and island disputes in the East China Sea and South China Sea, and North Korea's development of nuclear weapons. PRC's continuing military modernization, its One Belt, One Road diplomatic and economic strategy, and increasing presence in the East China Sea and South China Sea remain major factors influencing regional security and stability and threatening the survival and development of the ROC.

## Chapter 1. Security Situation 28

Conventional political and military threats to the current state of global security include conflicts arising from sovereignty and territorial disputes over waters and land, religious conflicts, and racial issues. Non-traditional security threats have also become challenges across countries, including the spread of terrorism, impacts on economic security, increased difficulties in the containment and prevention of infectious diseases, global climate change, shortage of food and water resources, and cyber-attacks. Even though the United States (US) is still the leading actor in defining security environment in the Asia-Pacific Region, the PRC, with its rapid-growing national strength, has attempted to change the status quo in order to acquire greater influence.

# Section 1. Global Security Environment

Global security is still being influenced by diplomatic and military strategies and policies of the US. However, major countries and regional organizations such as the PRC, EU, Russia, India, and Japan have also been expanding their influence in both global and regional affairs. US influence, in particular, is facing increasing challenges from the PRC. The overall state of global security is currently under the major influence of regional developments directed by major powers. Medium to small countries will employ geopolitical conditions, resource advantages, as well as economic and commercial interaction to expand their own influence to ensure both the survival and growth of their countries.

## I. Asia ( I ) The People'S Republic Of China

For the past 2 years, domestic policies of the PRC are still focused upon the leading directives of maintaining economic growth, internal stability, fighting corruption, enhancing governmental ethics, and strengthening the political leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The PRC also recently established the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms and the Central National Security Commission, both chaired by Xi Jinping with Li Keqiang serving as the deputy. This move has been enacted to bolster the Xi-Li Administration, unify executive powers, and grant the PRC leadership with the ability to respond quickly against domestic and global security threats. The PRC is also adopting the military strategic guideline of active defense that emphasizes those core interests of safeguarding national sovereignty, national security, territorial integrity, and national unity. In managing sovereignty disputes in the East China Sea and South China Sea, the PRC claims to adopt soft measures such as strengthening of communication, cooperation, and

mutual interests, however, it also emphasizes its stance of no preemption but with assured counterattack to express its determination in the defense of territories and sovereignty. For diplomatic policies, Xi affirmed the country's neighborhood diplomacy directives at the Peripheral Diplomacy Work Conference and the Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs in October 2013 and November 2014, respectively, insisting upon a policy that fosters an amicable, secure, and prosperous neighborhood environment. The PRC has also undertaken active participation in regional economic cooperation, such as moves to accelerate infrastructure and facility interconnectivity and integration as well as the

2015
One Belt, One Road strategy aiming at creating a tight-knit mutual interest network with neighboring countries that spread westwards into the Atlantic and southwards to the Indian Ocean, securing PRC's leading role upon the global stage. In its engagement with the US, the PRC has repeatedly emphasized its willingness to build a New Model of Major Power Relations with the US. However, disagreements between both sides still persist regarding issues of freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, compliance with international laws, cyber and information security, human rights, and other issues (such as issues related to Ukraine and North Korea). Strategic coopetition relations between the US and the PRC are expected to impact the strategic development direction of major countries around the world.

## ( Ii ) Northeast Asia 1. Korean Peninsula

Since Kim Jong-un assumed party, political, and military leadership in North Korea in April 2012, he has continued the Songun (military first) policy and carried out ballistic missile tests in 2014 and 2015, once again raising the tensions between North Korea and other countries such as Japan, South Korea, and the US. In order to response to North Korean provocations, South Korea has maintained its defense policy of deepening alliance and enhancing military cooperation with the US. Since 2011, South Korea has established regular Defense Strategic Dialogue with the PRC, enhanced multilateral cooperation through military training and senior level exchanges, and at the same time urged North Korea to return to the Six- Party Talks in order to reduce the possibility of military provocations by North Korea.

## 2. Japan

The Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe retook the reins of his country's politics in December 2012 and ushered in a series of political and economic initiatives such as *Abenomics* and *Active Pacifism*. 

The Cabinet of Japan passed three new documents governing Japan's diplomacy and security policies, namely the National Defense Program Guidelines, *Medium Term Defense Program (FY2014 - FY2018)*, and National Security Strategy in December 2013. The Cabinet further abolished the *Three Principles on Arms Exports* and replaced it with the *Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology* in April 2014. In July of the same year, Abe lifted restrictions on the right of collective self-defense by proposing the government's view on Article 9 of the *Constitution of Japan*, replacing the Three Conditions for Exercising the Right of Self-Defense with Three Conditions for the "Use of Force". Such measures have dissolved the restrictions that only permitted the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) to conduct individual self-defense since its establishment in 1954.

![34_image_1.png](34_image_1.png) improving the relations in both countries. The picture shows PAC JF-17 Thunder jointly developed by the PRC and Pakistan. (Source: Zhuhai Airshow)
Abe's Cabinet implemented measures to revise the Law Concerning Measures to Ensure Peace and Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan by abandoning the definition for *surrounding* that have been in use for many years. It was replaced with the concept of important influential situations in order to rename the above-mentioned law to the Law Concerning Measures to Ensure Peace and Security of Japan in Situations that will Have an Important Influence on Japan's Peace and Security, so as to lift the restrictions upon JSDF geographical range of operations and allow the JSDF to accompany the US armed forces in joint operations around the world. Abe's Cabinet is also aimed to establish the *International Peace Support Law,* so that JSDF forces dispatched to support global counter-terrorism operations are governed by common law instead of the *Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law*. This measure is expected to solidify US-Japan alliance, sending farreaching impacts to the balance of power in the Asia Pacific region and even the Taiwan Strait.

Relations between the PRC and Japan plummeted to a new low after Japan issued a unilateral declaration on the nationalization of the Diaoyutai Islands in 2012. Leaders of both countries have reached a four-point consensus on the handling of the Diaoyutai Islands dispute at the 2014 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which potentially suggests a gradual ease of tension between the two countries. However, both the PRC and Japan have continued to increase their military forces and intensity of maritime patrols. Future aircraft and vessels standoffs between the two countries in the East China Sea as well as confrontations arising from the defense of territorial waters are still likely to occur.

## ( Iii ) Southeast Asia

Recently, Southeast Asian countries have been pursuing ASEAN Integration with the objective of completing economic, social, cultural, and security integration by December 2015. This will create one of the largest emerging markets in the world with vast labor and mineral resources as well as market potential. The Strait of Malacca and South China Sea also serve as critical navigational routes between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, thus making the region highly contested by the world's superpowers. In addition to territorial disputes, other sources of confrontation such as historical issues, religious discrimination, and demands for ethnic autonomy are still rife in this region, and would be another source of regional instability. Southeast Asian countries are increasingly focused upon safeguarding their maritime rights and interests. Many countries have increased national defense budgets to drive military modernization and strengthen their naval and air force capabilities. The ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting (ADMM) has also been established as a platform for building regional multilateral cooperation frameworks. Southeast Asian countries also continue to participate in joint operational exercises led by the US in order to promote joint defense capabilities.

## ( Iv ) South Asia

India is located in the hub of South Asia and has significant regional strategic advantages. India's economic growth in recent years has allowed it to expand its national defense budget. The country is thus procuring armaments from the US, Russia, and France. This is especially true after Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of India in 2014. Modi emphasized the need to improve the self-sufficiency of national defense potential, upgrade armaments to improve overall military capabilities, and shape India into a major political, economic, and military power in South Asia. The PRC's One Belt, One Road strategy has made plans to extend the Qinghai-Tibet Railway to Nepal while strengthening political and military ties with Pakistan and Afghanistan to intervene in South Asian affairs. Such moves have reduced India's leadership and freedom to engage in regional affairs. Continuing border conflicts between Pakistan and India in recent years have led to stagnant relations between the two countries. The PRC, however, is engaged in the establishment of the Pakistan-China Economic Corridor, and have made plans to establish Gwadar Port in Pakistan as its key strategic base in the String of Pearls Strategy. There are concerns that this move may disrupt the strategic balance in South Asia and the Indian Ocean.

## ( V ) Middle East

As a result of the withdrawal of US and NATO forces, emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) extremist organization, ethnic disputes, Syrian Civil War, and conflicts between Israel and Hamas, the Middle East has remained a key focus of global security concerns. Nevertheless, A preliminary framework agreement has been reached regarding Iran's nuclear issue, helping to promote regional stability. With military support from the US and its allies, Iraq has gradually suppressed internal rebel forces. However, the country must still deal with conflicts arising from its religious sects and ethnicities. Recently, the joint military force created by the Arab League has carried out combined attacks against the Yemeni rebels, hoping to achieve greater military gains.

## Ii. Europe ( I ) European Union (Eu)

EU is facing multiple challenges in the form of politics, economics, diplomacy, and security issues highlighted by worsening EU-Russia relations as a result of the Ukrainian Crisis, attacks against France launched by Islamic State extremist terrorist organization, the Greek government debt crisis and antiausterity policies, Britain's intention to leave the EU by referendum, as well as impacts on EU immigration policies and Mediterranean coastal defense as it faces refugees fleeing North Africa and Syria. Despite these challenges, EU member states are still working together, initiating security, military, and economic partnerships to ensure regional peace and stability.

## ( Ii ) Russia

By carrying out military intervention of Ukrainian domestic politics, Russia is now under economic sanctions imposed by various European countries and the US, a move that is further compounded by falling gas prices, which have led to the collapse of the Russian Ruble and the country's economy. Faced with such challenges, Russia's strategic and collaborative partnership with the PRC has grown closer. Russia is also expanding economic and trade relationships with other countries in order to alleviate the financial crisis brought about by the Western sanctions.

## Iii. The Americas ( I ) The United States Of America

The "*National Security Strategy 2015*" of the Obama Administration responds to the current state of global affairs by emphasizing the need to sustain economic growth, combat terrorism, and maintain international order. It also

2015
points out the needs to address arresting global climate changes, fighting pandemics and security issues in the cyberspace, airspace, and maritime, and aspires to maintain the global leadership of the US. 

In 1 July 2015, the US Department of Defense released the National Military Strategy of the United States of America, which points to the serious security concerns posed by the PRC, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Nevertheless, the US has continued to invest in a substantial military-to-military relationship with the PRC and remained ready to engage Russia in areas of common interest, in an attempt to encourage military transparency of the two countries and reduce the potential for miscalculation. As part of the Asia-Pacific Rebalance strategy, the US has continued to employ political and economic cooperation and regular multinational military exercises, such as Cobra Gold, CARAT, and RIMPAC and station its forces in Singapore, the Philippines, and Australia to strengthen its ties with its Asia Pacific allies, improve its relations with other countries, such as India, Vietnam, Malaysia, and maintain its leadership role for Asia Pacific stability and development.

## ( Ii ) Central And South America

Illegal multinational economic activities, organized crime, and smuggling of narcotics have remained the leading issues affecting security in this region. However, the PRC has drastically increased its investments in South American countries in recent years due to the region's wealth of energy and food resources. South American countries are also pursuing socialist reformation and policies, and they are therefore dependent on the PRC for material and economic support, highlighting the increased standing and importance of the PRC in the region. As the PRC has begun to exert its influence in the backyard of the US, the US have thus recently reestablished formal relations with Cuba while improving its ties with other countries, such as Guatemala and Venezuela to strengthen its influences in Central and South America.

## Iv. Oceania

Despite being an ally of the US and playing a crucial role in the Asia- Pacific Rebalance strategy, Australia is compelled economically to expand its Mainland Chinese market. Hence, while Australia has agreed to allow US military garrisons and its participation in military cooperation, it has also maintained close economic and trade cooperation with the PRC, striking a balanced relationship with both the US and the PRC. Security environments in the South Pacific are relatively stable. Various countries in the region are employing international collaboration opportunities to support resource development and maintain economic growth. However, rising sea levels caused by global warming is also influencing the survival and development of these countries.

## V. Africa

Overall regional security issues in Africa in the last 2 years include political unrest, ethnic warfare, religious conf licts, border disputes, piracy, and terrorist attacks. As the continent has plenty of natural resources, countries and organizations, such as the US, Russia, the PRC, Japan, and the EU, are involved in the affairs of African countries to ensure the proper protection of their strategic resources. The PRC has taken particular focus upon its strategic deployment in Africa, investing in the region and providing economic support. The US has also recently increased its aid to African countries, signing a Cooperation Agreement with countries of the East African Community. Strategic competition between the US and the PRC in Africa is likely to intensify in the future.

# Section 2. Asia-Pacific Security Situation

The Asia Pacific countries, including the PRC, India, and ASEAN members, have been undergoing transformations in recent years thanks to recent economic growth. These countries enjoy advantages in the scale of labor forces, resources, and markets, which have made the region a focus for global economics and geopolitics. In this backdrop of rapid economic development, the Asia Pacific is also facing various conventional and unconventional threats that include growing military power of the PRC, territorial water and island disputes in the East China Sea and South China Sea, strategic competition between major powers, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and spread of terrorism. Asia Pacific countries have thus increased arms procurement, further fueling the elements of regional instability.

## I. Traditional Security Situation ( I ) Expansion Of The Military Power Of The Prc

The PRC has, in recent years, experienced rapid growths in its economy and increases to its comprehensive national power, allowing it to initiate large-scale military modernization efforts. The PRC is also actively pursuing amicable diplomacy with its neighbors, and is an active participant of international humanitarian assistance missions in the hopes of alleviating fears and concerns about its growing national power and military strength. However, the PRC has maintained massive increases in its defense budget for many years, undertaking rapid modernization and development of its military structure. This has led to an increasing imbalance of cross-Strait military power as well as growing doubts and wariness amongst neighboring countries.

In 2015, the PLA has issued the *Directive on Military Training* as part of continuing enhancement of basic military training across services. By integrating training with field exercises, the PLA has gradually reformed its training programs and created innovative strategies for enhancing the PLA's coercion and war-fighting capabilities under informatized conditions. The PRC's 2015 white paper "PRC Military Strategy" described improving transtheater mobility for its army, combat readiness patrols and blue seas training for its navy, and long-range operations and maritime flight training for its air force. The PLA is also taking advantage of its exercise and training activities to expand its operational depth and demonstrate to the world that its operational capabilities has reached the first island chain and is expanding towards the Indian Ocean and the second island chain. Additionally, the PLA is also developing anti-access / area denial (A2/AD) capabilities, tactics, techniques, and procedures in order to coerce foreign military forces from intervening in Taiwan Strait or Asia Pacific affairs, in order to ensure its core national interests and secure the areas crucially related to PRC's overseas interests.

## ( Ii ) East China Sea, South China Sea, And Island Disputes

Current land and maritime disputes in northeast Asia include sovereignty issues and boundaries of exclusive economic zones (EEZ) for Diaoyutai Islands, gas fields in the East China Sea, the Kuril Islands, and Dokdo/Takeshima Island. Of which, the ROC's disputes with Japan include the sovereignty of the Diaoyutai Islands as well as rights to fishing and maritime resources resulting from overlapping EEZs. The government of the ROC complies with the President's directives for the East China Sea Peace Initiative, and proposes to resolve the disputes peacefully based on the conventions of the United Nations and relevant provisions in international law. This proposal has been positively received by public opinions around the world.

2015
In the South China Sea, land reclamation has been carried out by the PRC, Vietnam, the Philippines, and other claimants in the region. In order to strengthen its sovereignty and claims (by international law) over the South China Sea, the PRC has employed various state-owned vessels in exercising its sovereignty and legal rights while constructing and expanding infrastructure of the Xisha (Paracel Islands) and Nansha (Spratly Islands) to establish a permanent and combat ready military presence in the region, leading to protests from the Philippines and Vietnam as well as concerned observations from the US and Japan. As a claimant to the South China Sea, the ROC has recently proposed the South China Sea Peace Initiative, which calls upon all countries to shelve disputes and promote joint development, a proposal that has gained global praise. However, before territorial, maritime and sovereignty disputes can be resolved properly, reactions from neighboring countries will continue to induce and affect the security environment of the Asia Pacific region.

## ( Iii ) Strategic Coopetition Between Major Powers

Strategic coopetition between the US, the PRC, and Russia are becoming increasingly complex. Although the US and the PRC have collaborated on issues regarding global climate change, suppression of terrorism, and development of new energy resources, the two countries remain contentious in other issues, such as the East China Sea and South China Sea sovereignty disputes, regional economic and trade integration, network security, and human rights. Economic sanctions imposed upon Russia by the US, Japan, and the EU also incited the comprehensive strategic partnership between the PRC and Russia, increasing the uncertainty of the Asia Pacific environment. In addition, to break through the stranglehold imposed by the US-led international order, the PRC and Russia have expanded the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in order to develop a new multilateral global order while strengthening PRC and Russia's influence in global affairs.

## ( Iv ) Proliferation Of Weapons Of Mass Destruction

As nuclear energy, nuclear technology, as well as applied biology and chemistry technologies become widely employed throughout the world, the potential risk of proliferation of raw materials used to generate nuclear energy or produce biological or chemical weapons has grown as well. Iran's nuclear weapons program is showing signs of positive development. However, North Korea has not given up on nuclear weapons testing. Chemical weapons were also employed during the Syrian Civil War. The chances of terrorist acquiring these weapons have greatly increased as well. Potential weapons proliferation may also result if improper supervision is provided for the weapons of mass destruction.

## Ii. Non-Traditional Security Situation ( I ) Relative Fragility Of Various National Economies

Global economies and markets are increasingly interconnected. Ups and downs of a single country's economy will influence regional or even global economic development. For example, the Greek government-debt crisis has affected Eurozone economy. Stock market fluctuations in the PRC also substantially affected various countries in the Asia Pacific. Strategic competition between the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) offered by the US, Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) offered by ASEAN, and the One Belt, One Road program offered by the PRC is likely to direct additional global investments into Asia Pacific markets while intensifying market competition. Regional economic security issues are likely to increase accordingly as a result.

## ( Ii ) Spread Of Global Terrorism

Global terrorism has employed the speed and convenience offered by global information networks to spread extremism, religious fanaticism, and sectarian 

NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC

![44_image_0.png](44_image_0.png)

2015
terrorism throughout the world. Terrorist targets are no longer limited to the US. Countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Indonesia, and the Philippines, have all been subject to attacks by different terrorist groups. These incidents demonstrate that no single country is capable of fighting against terrorism alone as well as the necessity of having global counter-terrorism efforts. In the last 2 years, extremist organizations, such as the Islamic State, made use of the Internet to broadcast hostage execution videos. The East Turkestan Islamic Movement also carried out terrorist attacks in the cities of Kunming (Yunnan Province) and Urumqi (Xinjiang Province). Both groups have thus been strongly condemned by the international community. Insurgencies in Southeast Asia include the autonomy movement of the Kachin Independence Organization in northern Burma, independence movement of the Sulu Army in the Malaysian state of Sabah, separatist movements in southern Thailand (involving three provinces), and Muslim Separatist Movement in the Philippines. All these insurgencies have been a main cause of frequent terrorist attacks in their respective regions, and have affected regional security and economic development.

## ( Iii ) Increasing Difficulty In Preventing Communicable Diseases

As a result of climate changes, globalization, and convenience of international travel, the emergence of new communicable diseases, such as avian flu, novel inf luenza, superbug (NDM-1), Ebola, and norovirus, have been reported. Outbreaks, such as the 2014 Ebola outbreak which wreaked havoc throughout West Africa with a range of spread that went beyond initial forecasts as well as the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus in the Middle East and South Korea, also pose challenges to current health and disease prevention systems while threatening global economic activities.

## ( Iv ) Accelerated Climate Change

Global warming has led to increases in sea levels, encroaching tides along coastal regions, and floods in urban areas that threaten various infrastructures. Increasingly hot summers have also led to deaths and disease. Droughts have already begun to reduce food production. If these issues are not handled accordingly, the entire world will have to handle the resulting consequences. Currently, international conventions such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol serve to regulate carbon emissions for countries around the world. However, conflicting

will flood coastal cities and threaten to damage relevant infrastructure. Increasingly hot summers have led to death and disease, while droughts have led to gradual decreases in food production. The picture shows the disastrous effects of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. (Source: US navy)
opinions have begun to emerge between developed and developing countries while results of carbon reduction efforts have failed to reach expectations. Global warming is still worsening, severely affecting ecologies and economic development in various countries around the world.

## ( V ) Increasing Risks For Energy Security

Crude oil and gas are strategic sources of fuel and raw materials for modern industries. However, most petroleum producing countries in the world happen to be located in the Middle East, a region rife with armed conflicts. Thus, various countries around the world have become concerned with issues of safe energy resource delivery and price stability. To oppose the economic sanctions imposed upon it by the EU, Russia has stopped supplying Europe with natural gas as a form of retaliation. Failure to resolve this issue effectively is likely to impact European economic development.

## ( Vi ) Increasing Competitions For Food And Water Resources

Global population is expected to reach 9 billion people by 2050, with water consumption increasing by 55% as a result. Forecasts have shown that by 2030, global water supplies may only be sufficient in satisfying 60% of the requirements, leading to insufficient global water and food resources. This issue is compounded with climatic anomalies as well as increasing demands in emerging countries. Food exports have reduced significantly, leading to increasing food prices as well as widening rich-poor divide. Less developed regions and countries will be worst hit, leading to popular uprisings, public unrest, disrupt social and political balance, and affect regional stability.

## ( Vii ) Increase Of Network And Data Security Attacks

The 2015 National Security Strategy released by the US pointed out that cybersecurity remains one of the most daunting challenges faced by national, public, and economic security efforts. For national security, cyberspace attacks can be employed as a formidable military weapon. Enemies can use the Internet to paralyze key infrastructure such as communications, transport, and traffic systems to affect military capabilities. They may also sabotage financial and trade networks, water supply, power systems, and air navigation control systems to disrupt social order. Such attacks therefore pose serious threats to the survival and development of any country.

Targets of international terrorism are no longer restricted to the US, showing that counter-terrorism work must be jointly carried out by the international community. (Source:

## Chapter 2. Security Challenges

The defense budget of the PRC has been growing every year to accelerate the modernization of its defenses and armed forces. The PRC is also strengthening its area denial capabilities, leading to increased concerns from the surrounding countries. The PRC has remained the leading threat to the ROC as it has yet to abandon military solutions against Taiwan and is still conducting targeted military exercises for such ends. Over a thousand short- and medium-range ballistic missiles as well as cruise missiles have also been deployed by the PRC along the Taiwan Strait. Other challenges to the ROC's defense and security include strategic competitions between the PRC and the US, intensifying island and maritime disputes in the East China Sea and South China Sea, as well as unconventional security threats posed by cyberspace and information security issues.

# Section 1. Current Status And Developments Of The Prc

The 2015 *PRC Military Strategy* expressed: They will further broaden strategic vision, update strategic thinking, and make strategic guidance more forwardlooking. A holistic approach will be taken to balance war preparation and war prevention, rights protection and stability maintenance, coercion and war-fighting, and operations in wartime and employment of military forces in peacetime. They will lay stress on farsighted planning and management to create a favorable posture, comprehensively manage crisis, and resolutely deter and win wars. The PRC has clearly followed Xi Jinping's directives in deploying conflict staging points, accelerating South China Sea island reclamation, and carrying out determined military measures in the protection of its sovereignty. Such measures reveal the PRC's ambitions in becoming a leader directing regional affairs. For its main joint operational programs, the PRC is learning from armed forces building and development experiences of other advanced nations such as Europe and the US to modernize and transform its defense forces by restructuring its military organization, generating new training guidelines, deploying new weapons, and training new military professionals.

## I. Strategies Against Taiwan Adopted By The Prc

Cross-Strait relations have eased as a result of increasing economic, cultural, and educational exchange. However, the PRC is still preparing various strategic moves against Taiwan. These strategic moves are also growing increasingly diverse in order to facilitate development of cross-Strait relations that are beneficial to the interests of the PRC and generate advantageous environments for future military invasions.

## ( I ) Carrot And Stick Unification Strategies

In addition to emphasizing the common and unchangeable political foundations of Taiwan and China, strategies adopted by the PRC against Taiwan also include drawing a bottom line for developing cross-Strait relationship. Xi Jinping's vision where both sides of the Strait are of the same family and finding the ability to work together and achieve the Chinese Dream are also being followed to broaden and deepen cross-Strait economic and trade cooperation as well as promote youth and ethnic minority cultural exchange programs. These measures are aimed at reducing the gulf between the PRC and Taiwanese citizens and alleviation of mutual hostility.

## ( Ii ) Denying External Intervention In The Taiwan Issue

National defense white paper reports generated by the PRC in recent years have pointed out that the current cross-Strait problem is a result of historical issues. The 2015 national defense white paper re-emphasized that "reunification is an inevitable trend in the course of national rejuvenation". The PRC aims to categorize Taiwan's sovereignty question as a domestic issue in order to construct the basis needed for legally carrying out military operations against Taiwan in the future. The *National Security Law of the People's Republic of* China as well as *Anti-Secession Law* has both placed Taiwan within the PRC's national security legal framework, highlighting that unification remains its ultimate objective in the Taiwan issue. The laws also provide a legal basis for pursuing non-peaceful measures against Taiwan, classifying it as a domestic issue in order to prevent external intervention of its military measures against Taiwan.

## ( Iii ) Three Wars For Weakening Public Awareness On The Necessity For National Defense

Since 2003, the PRC has conducted wars on the three fronts of media, psychology, and law. These three wars have been integrated within the *PLA* 

NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC

![52_image_0.png](52_image_0.png)

![52_image_1.png](52_image_1.png)

2015
Political Work Regulation as well as key education and training subjects for its military academies and troops. Recently, the PLA has been committed to establishing a Psychological Warfare Experimental Unit as well as a specialized training and research institution for the training of specialized psychological warfare officers. Military spokespersons have also been provided for the MND of the PRC as well as various armed services in order to maximize the country's capacities in swaying public opinions. The PRC has also mobilized local governments in carrying out dedicated measures against Taiwan, using overtures for peace to dissolve internal unity within the ROC as well as employing military force for intimidation and forceful persuasion with the hopes of achieving major victories in minor battles or victory without a fight.

## ( Iv ) Comprehensive Preparations For Military Actions Against Taiwan

In addition to creating an informatized armed forces to win battles in the digital age, the PRC is also carrying out comprehensive and thorough reforms of its national defense and military. By referring to the annual Outline of Military Training and Evaluation, the PRC is training its troops to improve their abilities to carry out trans-theater reinforcement, military operations against Taiwan, retaliate against foreign military intervention, and respond to regional conflicts. Despite making repeated pleas for resolving the Taiwan Strait dispute in a peaceful manner, the PRC's ambition to take over the ROC has remain unabated despite improvements of cross-Strait relations as observed from the PLA's utilization of the period of strategic opportunities for its development and its continued strengthening of military preparations against Taiwan.

## Ii. Current Status Of The Military Preparedness Of The Prc

Under the strategic directives of winning a campaign in remote area quickly and winning the first campaign decisively, the PRC is researching and procuring various weapon platforms and precision weapons, improving surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, enhancing Second Artillery Force strike and coercion, advancing aerial assault capacities, and expanding maritime attack prowess. The aim is to achieve comprehensive, long-range, multi-dimensional, rapid and decisive, and multi-faceted operational objectives. The PRC is also strengthening its readiness in conducting military operations in response to incidents in Taiwan, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea. In the event that crisis or contingencies occur in the Taiwan Strait or surrounding regions in the Asia Pacific, the PRC will be capable of deterring the forces of other countries from intervening in the said regions.

## ( I ) Defense Budget Of The Prc

With the exception of 2010, the PRC's defense budget has retained double-digit growth from 2006 to 2015 (a period of 10 years). The total defense budget of the PRC is now the second highest in the world (after the US) and the highest in Asia. Despite emphasizing the defensive nature of its defense policy, the PRC has recently made substantial investments for external procurement of weapons and technologies while conducting weapons research and development (R&D). National defense development of the PRC has thus gradually grown beyond its defensive requirements, classifying the PRC as a potential threat that has led to an armament race in the Asia Pacific region and affecting regional peace and stability.

## 1. Budget Overview

The PRC allocated a defense budget of RMB 911.4 billion in 2015, which was a 10% increase from 2014. The PRC declared that the increased budget is mainly used to modernize its military equipment, improve the work environment and salary of entry-level personnel, and drive the restructuring of military systems and organizations (PRC defense budgets from 2006 to 2015 are listed in *Table 2-1*).

## 2. Hidden Budget

The PRC has repeatedly emphasized that its entire defense budget has 

NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC

![54_image_0.png](54_image_0.png)

2015
been included in the central budget to be reviewed by the National People's Congress before implementation. Hence, issues of hidden expenses would not exist. However, defense R&D projects, arms sales income (the PRC is a major exporter of arms), weapons procurement expenses, external income of national defense industries, and expenses of the People's Armed Police Force (PAPF) have not been included in the defense budget. Investigations indicate that these incomes and expenses may be hidden within non-military budgets. Estimates made by the ROC show that actual defense budget of the PRC may be 2 to 3 times higher than the published figure. Inferential estimates made using the PRC's historical budgets and budget utilization show that the actual budget may be up to 4% of the country's GDP, far-exceeding the 2% of GDP provided in most western countries, making the PRC's defense budget proportions on par with those of the US and Russia.

## ( Ii ) New Equipment Deployment Overview

The PRC has expressed that its military preparations must be based upon winning informatized local wars, with particular focus on the development of its navy (PLAN), air force (PLAAF), and Second Artillery Force. The PLAN has deployed long-range anti-ship missiles and new missile boats in the Fujian and Guangdong regions. The PLAAF has been outfitted with longrange missiles and new generation fighters which have been rotated to the coastal areas of the Taiwan Strait to participate in defense operations. The Second Artillery Force has researched, developed, and manufactured a series of new missiles to help the PRC command superiority in the maritime zone and airspace within the first island chain in order to achieve the strategic objectives of "open seas protection".

## ( Iii ) Active Developments In East China Sea And South China Sea

Although the Taiwan Strait has remained a key center of gravity for strategic development of the PRC, the country also significantly increased strategic focus upon the East China Sea and South China Sea as well. The PRC is now reclaiming land around islands it occupies in the South China Sea and expanded Diaoyutai Island maritime patrols using public vessels to declare and demonstrate its sovereignty over the islands.

## 1. Increased Patrols In Waters Around Diaoyutai Islands

Multiple confrontations between the PRC and Japanese maritime vessel have occurred in recent years. The PLA has thus dispatched various aircraft and vessels to intensify patrols in the peripheral maritime areas of the Diaoyutai Islands. PLA naval patrol schedules and routes through the Gonggu Shuidao (Miyako Strait) and Hengyan Shuidao have gradually become a routine as well.

## 2. Strengthening Sovereignty And Construction Works Of South China Sea Islands And Atolls

In the past 2 years, the PRC has gradually increased its commitment to military exercises and maritime sovereignty defenses in the South China Sea, and has continued to reclaim land on occupied islands. The PRC also deployed naval forces to forcefully evict Filipino and Vietnamese vessels from the area to demonstrate the PRC's effective ownership and management of the South China Sea. To respond to increasing tensions in the South China Sea, Vietnam has acquired new and advanced weapon equipment, while the Philippines also acquired transport vessels, helicopters, and transport aircraft. Military preparations implemented by the aforementioned claimants represent potential challenges and variables to the PRC's control and management of the South China Sea and the sovereignty of its islands in the region.

## ( Iv ) Strengthening Area Denial Capabilities

The PRC regards foreign intervention as the greatest potential threat if it undertakes military actions against Taiwan. In order to effectively deny foreign military intervention, the PRC has carried out red vs. blue simulation models for its PLAN, PLAAF, and Second Artillery Force exercises in recent years to verify and validate relevant tactics, techniques, and procedures. Regional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) systems have been developed in tandem with novel weapon systems equipped by the Second Artillery Force, PLAN, and PLAAF in order to increase its A2/AD capabilities in the western Pacific. PLAN vessels and PLAAF aircraft have broken through the first island chain on many occasions, and its long-range strategic bombers have been equipped with YJ100 cruise missiles, giving it a striking range covering Guam. The PRC hopes that it will be capable of establishing itself as the dominant military force within the first island chain and be capable of deterring foreign military from intervening in Taiwan Strait issues.

## ( V ) Handling Various Security Threats

The PLA, PAPF, militia, reserve forces are referring to the National Defense Mobilization System and *Prescribed General Response Plans for Military* Disposition of Contingencies to conduct various military and non-military operations such as joint law enforcement, mobilization command and control, air defense in urban areas, disaster relief, counter-terrorism and stabilization, and joint search and rescue. To respond to various kinds of security threats and to conduct various types of military operations, the PRC is also involved in global peacekeeping missions, military exchange, and multi-national joint counter-terrorism exercises in order to acquire experiences of various countries in handling conventional and unconventional security threats.

## ( Vi ) Participation In Multi-National Military Exercises

The PLA has conducted a number of joint operational exercises such as Joint Navy Exercise, Shaheen, and Khaan Quest with more than 40 countries (organizations) in recent years, including Russia, India, ASEAN member states and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). The PLA was also invited, for the first time, to attend the US-led RIMPAC multinational joint naval exercise in 2014. The PRC hopes that participation in these military exchanges and direction of joint exercises with regional organizations will help to improve its joint operations capabilities and expand its regional influence.

## Section 2. Military Capabilities And Threats Of The Prc

For years, military preparations and planning of the PLA have always been based upon Contingency Military Operations against Taiwan. Military exercises have been conducted against combat tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by the ROC Armed Forces. These exercises are part of the continuous preparations for large-scale military operations against Taiwan, and are implemented to improve precision strikes of the PLA ground artillery forces, strengthen long range target guidance and strike capabilities of naval and air forces, and enhance surface blockade (control) of neighboring shores and islands. Hence, there is still a risk that military confrontation between the PRC and Taiwan may erupt.

## I. Military Capabilities Directed Against Taiwan By The Prc

With support granted by its immense defense budget, the PLA has greatly accelerated its modernization of national defense and armed forces, and is preparing for emergency military operations against Taiwan as well as improving its overall joint operational capabilities.

## ( I ) Intelligence, Surveillance, And Reconnaissance Capabilities

The PRC is employing various satellites, early warning aircraft, and unmanned surveillance drones as well as building digital data link networks and has greatly enhanced its early warning, command and control, battlefield reconnaissance, aircraft and vessel navigation, communication encryption, and precision weapon strike capabilities. Currently, the PRC has acquired all-time surveillance capabilities in areas to the west of the first island chain.

## ( Ii ) Capabilities Of The Pla Army

Under the directives of all-terrain mobility and three-dimensional attack and defense, the PLA Army (PLAA) is accelerating its mechanization processes, making organizational adjustments at the brigade level, implementing informationized transformation, and conducting exercises and training in realistic conditions. Air transport and deployment, equipping of pontoon bridges, and tactical developments have been enhanced and tested in joint amphibious landing exercises to familiarize relevant units in the tactics, techniques, and procedures of landing operations. Currently, the PLAA is already equipped with triphibious landing and warfare capacities to seize offshore islands of the ROC.

## ( Iii ) Capabilities Of The Pla Navy

The PLAN complies with the strategic requirements of offshore defense and "open seas protection". Measures carried out include expanding the depth of offshore defense strategy, improving amphibious transport capacities, and active enhancement to joint surface operations and nuclear counterattack capabilities. Current priorities include continued construction of aircraft carriers, nuclear (and conventionally) powered submarines as well as research and production of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) as well as long-range submarine-launched anti-ship missiles. Naval aviation units are also outfitted with JH-7 and Su-30 aircraft, with further developments underway for J-15 carrier-based aircraft. All these developments demonstrate the PLAN's growing abilities to initiate nuclear counterattack, deny foreign military access, and blockade and control of the Taiwan Strait.

## ( Iv ) Capabilities Of The Pla Air Force

Under the strategic requirements of integrating air and outer space capabilities as well as conducting both offensive and defensive operations, the PLAAF 
has accelerated R&D as well as outfitting of its next-generation combat and supporting aircraft such as the J-20 fighters, H-6K bombers, KJ-200 and KJ- 2000 early air warning aircraft, and Y-20 strategic airlifter. The indigenous Hong Qi (red flag) series as well as Russia-made S-300 series air defense missiles have also been deployed along the Taiwan Strait. The PLAAF is also making plans to acquire the newest S-400 series air defense missiles from Russia in order to complete its missile defense system. To build an air force capable of seizing air superiority in the airspace to the west of the first island chain, joint exercises for different units have also been strengthened to accelerate digitization of command and control systems and enhance overall air and missile defense capacities as well as abilities to conduct air strike, strategic projection, and strategic coercion.

## ( V ) Capabilities Of The Pla Second Artillery Force

The PLA Second Artillery Force operates under the directives of being lean and effective and possessing both nuclear and conventional missiles, employing universal warhead designs to strike at a diversity of targets to strengthen its capabilities of strategic nuclear coercion, nuclear counterattack and conventional precision strikes. Estimates on missile quantity, precision, and destructive effects equipped by the Second Artillery Force indicate that the unit is capable of launching large-scale joint firepower strikes and deter external military from intervening in any Taiwan Strait disputes.

## (Vi) Information And Electronic Warfare Capabilities

EW units at various levels of the PLA have recently employed simulated electronic environments of the Taiwan Strait during their training exercises in order to develop various EW tactics, techniques, and procedures. To secure EW dominance throughout the entire course of the battle, exercises of various PLA service branches were also carried out to identify weaknesses in EW tactics and to formulate countermeasures accordingly. Current EW software and hardware

3. Developments in the PLAN are heading towards "open seas protection" capabilities. The PLAN has continued to construct nuclear (and conventionally) powered submarines and developing SLBMs and long-range submarine-launched anti-ship missiles, demonstrating growing capabilities of the PLAN in carrying out nuclear counterattack, deny foreign forces access, achieving maritime dominance, and enforcing blockades in the Taiwan Strait. (Source: US navy)
attack equipment is also undergoing performance evaluations to monitor and collect electromagnetic parameters as well as to achieve capabilities of disrupting and interfering with ROC Armed Forces surveillance and command 2 Part 1 Strategic Environment Chapter 2 Security Challenges

## ( Vii ) Cyberwarfare Capabilities

The PLA has established basic offensive and defensive cyberwarfare capabilities at various military departments that include its military commands, 7 military regions, defense research agencies, defense mobilization information systems, and militia forces. In addition to using hackers to plant backdoors for stealing and transferring data, the PLA is also capable of using programs to acquire control privileges over the target server. PLA cyberwarfare units have also managed to infiltrate a target and remain undetected for 1,700 days. These cyberwarfare units are large and highly specialized organizations capable of dealing with information defense technologies employed around the world.

## ( Viii ) Military Aerospace Capabilities

The PLA has recently launched various military satellites into space. These satellites allow 24/7 military command, control, and intelligence transfer capabilities and are capable of supporting long-range precision strike missions carried out by the PLA in areas to the west of the first island chain. The BeiDou Navigation Satellite System provides coverage over the west Pacific to the Indian Ocean, offering effective improvements to real time targeted surveillance as well as the accuracy of long-range precision strikes.

## Ii. Military Threats Posed By The Prc Against Taiwan

Although evaluations conducted by the PRC revealed gradual improvements of cross-Strait relations, the PRC is still emphasizing that separatist forces are posing a threat to its territorial sovereignty and security. In recent years, the PLA has been continuously equipping its forces with major defense equipment such as amphibious assault vehicles, long-range multiple rocket launchers, surface combatants, long-range anti-ship missiles, third generation fighters, air defense missiles, and other major defense equipment, while the Second Artillery Force have continued to deploy missiles against Taiwan with particular focus on improvements to long-range projection capabilities. The PLA plans to complete the establishment of a formidable military arsenal for conducting military operations against Taiwan before 2020. Observations of recent PLA military training and exercises showed that the PLA has yet to reduce targeted military exercises against Taiwan. The PLA has been emulating western nations in adopting actual-size replicas of critical political and economic targets of Taiwan when carrying out its military deployment exercises, demonstrating that the PLA has regarded military confrontation over Taiwan as a regular part of its combat preparations. Overall military power of the PLA is now capable of conducting joint military coercion, joint blockades, and joint strike operations. Furthermore, increases in the quality and quantity of PLA military strength allows it to pursue intensified military operations against Taiwan while providing it with additional mobility in deploying troops across the Taiwan Strait.

# Section 3. Security Challenges Of The Roc

Growing uncertainty of global security situations means that Asia Pacific countries as well as the ROC will have to face more complex and severe security environments, with the leading challenge being military threats posed by the PRC. The PRC has yet to abandon military options against the ROC. Its increasing defense budget and rapid improvements to weapon and equipment R&D capabilities have fueled rapid growths in its military strength. Other grave security challenges and situations faced by the ROC include intensifying sovereignty disputes of island and territorial waters in the Asia Pacific region, growing concerns of unconventional security threats, changing demographic structure, attacks by network hackers, and weakening of national defense awareness amongst the country's citizens.

## I. Rapid Expansion Of The Military Strength Of The Prc

Combined national strength of the PRC has grown tremendously in recent years, while its defense budget has achieved 2-digit growths for 5 consecutive years. Large, non-transparent defense investments made by the PRC allowed massive expansion of its armaments, leading to growing imbalance of military power between the PRC and the ROC. The PRC has also developed long-range precision weapon systems in order to extend the range of its force projection and strategic attacks, improve its integrated joint operational capacities, and reduce the willingness of other countries from intervening in the regional confrontation. This has posed a serious threat to national security of the ROC. Given that the PRC has not abandoned its threats to initiate operations against Taiwan, the major challenge faced by the ROC is to hasten the transformation of its armed forces and improve joint operational performance to develop a small but superb, strong, and smart defense force formidable enough for defending national sovereignty and interests.

## Ii. Sovereignty Claims Over Disputed Islands And Maritime Rights And Interests

Complex regional confrontations due to island sovereignty and maritime rights disputes mainly involve the Diaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea and islands in the South China Sea. Such disputes have led to standoffs or even direct confrontation between government vessels dispatched from various countries. The PRC has unilaterally established an air defense identification zone in East China Sea and carried out land reclamation as well as construction of naval and air force facilities in the South China Sea, introducing new uncertainties to regional peace and stability. The ROC Armed Forces shall comply with ROC's overall diplomatic policy and continue to expand practical relationships with friendly states, promote regional security dialogues and exchanges, and refer to the government's principles of safeguarding sovereignty, shelving disputes, pursuing peace and reciprocity, and promoting joint development to participate in multi-national security issues. The ROC Armed Forces shall continue to strengthen defensive operations of its Dongsha Islands (Pratas Islands) and Taiping Island as well as maritime defensive patrols. Military force serves as the support for defending the country's sovereignty over the islands, its maritime rights, and protect navigational freedom through international waters.

## Iii. Defense Resource Constraints

Despite having slowly recovered from the global financial crisis, the global economy is currently hampered by the European debt crisis and the stagnating global economy. These events have also led to sluggish growth of the ROC's overall economy. Additional challenges include decreasing work force and limited increases in government tax income, making it difficult to secure further increases to the defense budget. The ROC Armed Forces shall allocate and employ defense resources in a more optimal fashion in order to maximize its benefits. To achieve the mutually beneficial goals of self-reliant defense and encouraging the development of national economy, the ROC Armed Forces have been promoting the development of dual-use technologies and allow tried and tested defense technologies to drive improvements of private enterprises and industries accordingly.

## Iv. Decreasing Proportions Of Able-Bodied Individuals

Although national birth rates of the ROC have somewhat recuperated in the last 2 years, the size of the young and able-bodied population is still quite low. The number of individuals available for conscription as well as national defense personnel will be less than ideal as a result. In order to maintain its military power, the ROC Armed Forces are reforming its conscription systems to establish a Volunteer Military System and recruit volunteers with higher quality and who are willing to commit to longer terms of service. Continuous adjustments have been made to the national defense organization, military structure, and size of the armed forces. Force streamlining as well as extensive mobilization and combat readiness systems have been implemented to achieve the concept of having a small standing army with the potential of drawing upon vast reserves during wartime and building an elite national defense force.

## V. Humanitarian Assistance And Disaster Relief

Unconventional security threats, such as sudden natural disasters and complex disasters caused, have continued to increase. The severity of the threats posed by these disasters to national security is on par with that of war. The ROC Armed Forces, tasked with defending national security and protecting public welfare, have listed disaster prevention and relief as one of its core missions. The Armed Forces shall continue to establish units capable 

NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC

![68_image_0.png](68_image_0.png)

2015
of disaster relief during peacetime and combat operations during wartime with quick response, disaster prevention, and contingency control capabilities. Systematic approaches as well as government-organized disaster prevention exercises, force streamlining, material mobilization, resource integration, and disaster hazard control systems have been carried out in order to support rapid deployment of local government in relevant relief operations and reduce national security threats posed by various disasters.

## Vi. Diverse And Frequent Network Attacks

As information technology (IT) continues to evolve, network vulnerabilities and threats have begun to invade and threaten countries with well-developed network connectivity. Recently, PRC cyber forces have used a variety of measures such as social network engineering, remote infiltration, virus (and malware) infections, theft, and surveillance to conduct a series of cyber invasions of government agency and private enterprise websites with grave consequences. The aim of such attacks is to disrupt the ROC Armed Forces command and control information system operations and delay its ability to respond in a timely manner to various incidents. The PLA may launch attacks against specified targets in the ROC through the Internet in the future with the aim of crippling national infrastructure system operations. Such attacks will pose severe threats to ROC military operational capabilities and national security. The ROC Armed Forces are working with government networks, integrated information security and protection, and joint response to conduct routine security protection and monitoring of crucial IT systems. During wartime, the armed forces shall employ active network defenses against the enemy in order to continue enhancing information and network protection potential, train network protection professionals, and enhance overall information security robustness and capacities.

## Vii. Challenges To Threat Awareness

Although cross-Strait political relations seem calm, the PRC has yet to abandon preparations for military operations against Taiwan. The PRC is also conducting a unification war against Taiwan on the three fronts of psychology, public opinion, and law, and is creating an image of peace in order to alleviate hostility amongst the ROC citizens and dissolve national unity. The MND has also been referring to the *All-out Defense Education Act* in order to conduct all-out defense education in 4 major categories of school education, on-the-job education for government agencies (institutions), social education, and national defense artifacts protection, awareness, and education. International situations, defense policy, all-out defense, defense mobilization, and defense technologies are established as the core educational subjects. Training courses have been arranged for various organizations such as relevant departments, different levels of governments, all-out defense mobilization systems, schools, and social groups, and course contents have integrated printed materials and a diverse selection of supporting activities in order to enhance training results and improve the sense of urgency and awareness for potential dangers amongst the general public. Various broadcasting channels are employed to integrate all-out defense concepts and knowledge into the lives of fellow citizens in order to achieve the educational goals of complete proliferation and extensiveness. It is hoped that such measures will improve all-out defense consciousness and ensure lasting peace and sustainable development of the country.

## Part 2. National Defense Policy 71

Article 137 of the *Constitution of the Republic of China* stipulates that the objective of the national defense of the ROC is to safeguard national security and maintain world peace. Facing the rapid evolution and spread of military technologies and information networking, as well as the challenges to national defense arising from an increasingly volatile and complex security environment, the MND, upholding the President's concept of the three legs of national security, proposes defense policy to lay out the objectives of national defense strategy and the concept of military strategy. Accordingly, the MND continues to carve out paths for the transformation of defense and future development of its operational capabilities so as to construct a Hard ROC defense force, and ensure national security.

## Chapter 3. National Defense Policy Plans

I
n order to safeguard national interests, and achieve the objective of deterring aggression and preventing war, the MND, following the government's policy, has taken comprehensive considerations of changes in domestic and international security environment, formulates the main themes of national defense policy, the objectives of national defense strategy, and the concepts of military strategy in order to ensure sustainable development of the country as well as peace and stability in the region.

The MND is guided by the principle that disaster relief is akin to fighting a battle and the directives of *forward deployment, early stationing, and instant* reaction to strengthen ROC Armed Forces' preparations for disaster prevention and relief operations so as to provide adequate assistance in these operations as requested by law.

## Vi. Promote The Volunteer Military System

To reap more positive results for recruiting and retaining enlisted members, the MND, joining hands with the government, has been considering the aspects of pay, dignity, and career opportunities after military service for them, and conducting multiple measures, such as refining internal management, improving service environment, and permitting advanced education during off hours, etc., to encourage young people to serve and then stay in the military. Consequently, the MND may attain the goal of a sustainable volunteer military system for stable recruitment and retention.

## Vii. Improve Care For Service Members

The MND has been incessantly providing care measures for service members. 

Aside from proposing the *Statute of Welfare for Military Service Members* to establish a legal basis for service members and their families' entitlement to their benefits and wellbeing, the MND has been renovating their living quarters, strengthening protection for their rights and interests, enhancing services for military families, and assisting in career planning so as to consolidate their support, and maintain a safe and sound atmosphere in their families.

## Section 2. Objectives Of National Defense Strategy

In response to security challenges, the MND has stipulated the defense strategy, which forms the foundation to direct the formulation and execution of the military strategy. Objectives of our national defense strategy are as follows: prevention of war, homeland defense, contingency response, avoidance of conflicts, and maintenance of regional stability.

## I. Prevention Of War ( I ) Strengthen Defensive Operational Preparedness

The MND has been continuing the national defense transformation and developing indigenous defense technologies, and creating innovative / asymmetric capabilities, so as to make the best of its compact but powerful punch to outfight a behemoth opponent. In order to improve joint operational capabilities, the MND is focusing on establishing capabilities for force preservation and infrastructure protection, training for regular forces, and implementation of the concept of all-out defense so as to effectively safeguard our homeland.

## ( Ii ) Promote Regional Military & Security Exchanges And Cooperation

The MND, following the President's instruction to integrate national defense with diplomacy, has been driving military exchanges, and expanding strategic dialogues and substantive security cooperation with friendly countries, based on the principles of fairness, reciprocity, and practicality. Furthermore, we have been striving to attend combined military exercises with them, and working together on issues concerning humanitarian assistance, maritime search and rescue, counter-terrorism and counter-piracy, etc., so as to jointly establish a security cooperation mechanism and maintain peace and stability in the region.

## ( Iii ) Nurture National Defense Strength

Aside from promoting the policy of merging national defense with public welfare, the MND has been improving its defense technology and weaponry R&D, making efforts on revolution in military affairs, fulfilling the goal of civilian control of the military, deepening the concept of all-out defense for all the people. As a result, we may fully demonstrate the glorious traditions and martial valor of the ROC Armed Forces, and raise their professionalism and sense of honor so as to nurture our overall national defense strength.

## ( Iv ) Contemplate Pending Issues With Cross-Strait Confidence Building

The government policy on cross-Strait relations is constructed on the basis of being required by the nation, being supported by public opinion, and being supervised by legislature. Based on the principle of first the urgent, then the gradual; first the easy, then the difficult; first the economic, then the politics, the government will institutionalize cross-Strait negotiations stepwise so as to build up mutual trust between two sides. Currently, conditions for establishing confidence building measures (CBM) have yet to mature. The MND will follow the government's policies in the future to review pending issues in a cautious manner.

## Ii. Homeland Defense ( I ) Build Elite Armed Forces

In tandem with the promotion of the Volunteer Military System, the MND has been restructuring its organization, and going through various associated measures, such as completing revisions for relevant laws and regulations, perfecting alignment of organization, manning and equipping, and force scale, etc., so as to refine its military structure to form elite armed forces.

5 4 3 proves impossible. Priorities have been given to crucial technologies that developed locally, so as to help accumulate indigenous defense R&D capacities and build a modernized military force to our defense needs.

## ( Iv ) Strengthen Force Preservation

Facing possible minimum-warning and extremely powerful strikes from the enemy, the ROC Armed Forces have been bolstering their force preservation efforts, and striving to maintain redundancy for operational functions of all the systems in order to prevent paralysis caused by initial combat loss while preserving military strength for subsequent stages. In addition, the ROC Armed Forces will assist in keeping critical infrastructure, such as telecommunications, transportation, energy, reservoir, and power grid in working order, so as to ensure our sustainability in operations.

## ( V ) Accumulate All-Out Defense Potential

The MND has been extending all-out defense education to build public awareness for all-out defense, and improve public faith in the ROC Armed Forces. In addition, we have been pooling all the personnel, material, and financial resources together to materialize preparations for defense mobilization, and establish a well-rounded all-out defense system. Through educational recall training for reservists, we may thus maintain the combat capabilities of reserve forces to ensure rapid mobilization capacities both in peacetime and wartime.

## Iii. Contingency Response ( I ) Refine Surveillance, Reconnaissance, And Early Warning Capabilities

In response to multitude of security threats, the MND has been integrating intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities of all subordinate units to enhance its intelligence gathering and early warning abilities. Intelligence exchanges are also carried out frequently with friendly countries to achieve effective prevention from, response to, and elimination of risks before they take place.

## ( Ii ) Perfect Contingency Response Capabilities

When the country comes under terrorist threats or sudden strikes from lurking enemy cells, the ROC Armed Forces joint operational command mechanism shall be activated to direct specialized quick response forces (QRF). To achieve the goals of preventing domestic contingencies and external assaults, the QRF shall follow the principles of stabilizing the situations, controlling the crisis, and unifying contingency responses to support establishments in charge and local governments to rapidly eliminate the threats.

## ( Iii ) Enhance Contingency Operational Capabilities

We have been strengthening the authenticity of simulation drills for our forces to be quick responsive to contingencies, and for commanding officers to be proficient in the procedures for handling various contingencies, so as to provide just and proper responses to crisis once it occurs. 

## ( Iv ) Improve Disaster Prevention And Relief Capabilities

We have chosen specific units from existing military organizations to form forces with immediate response, disaster prevention, and containment capabilities. As part of the preparations, the MND has been absorbing experiences from foreign countries and integrating them with governmentorganized disaster prevention drills. In addition, the MND has been procuring equipment that can be employed both in combat and disaster relief operations, and making the best of reservist mobilization capacities so as to improve disaster prevention abilities of the ROC Armed Forces.

## ( V ) Reinforce Information Security

At the moment, the first priority of information security of the ROC Armed Forces is to constantly improve upon existing systems by introducing various international standardization concepts. Thus, we may blend the characteristics and missions of our forces with experiences from advanced countries, so as to reach a benchmark of information security and protection for reliable management. Furthermore, we have been combining network security drills with annual wargaming activities and exercises to validate our level of protection for crucial information infrastructure. Drill results will be adopted as references for future preparations of information security so as to enhance our competencies to protect our information systems.

## Iv. Avoidance Of Conflicts ( I ) Implement Military Conflict Avoidance Measures

The MND has been implementing information transparency measures, such as regular announcements of military exercises, releasing of the *National Defense* Report, and hosting open house events, etc., to allow neighboring countries to understand the purpose of our defense policy, resources utilization, budget planning, weapon development statuses, and military activities. It is hoped that through increased mutual understanding we may reduce the possibilities of regional military conflicts.

## ( Ii ) Abide By Conflict Avoidance Regulations

All units in the ROC Armed Forces are required to comply with principles and readiness rules of crisis prevention, situational awareness, emergency response, rapid management, and escalation avoidance as well as not provoking incidents, not escalating conflicts, and reducing hostilities in order to avoid frictions arising from misjudgments or accidents that may lead to unnecessary conflicts.

## V. Maintenance Of Regional Stability ( I ) Promote An Asia-Pacific Common Security Picture

The MND has been participating in regional affairs, and complying with the sequence of establishing relations, strengthening ties, reaching consensus, forging a friendly atmosphere, and establishing substantive partnership to promote security dialogues and exchanges with various countries in the Asia Pacific region, and maximize the strategic defensive functions of the ROC in the first island chain in the West Pacific. The ROC also plays a crucial role in both conventional and unconventional security issues in this region and is an active contributor to regional peace and stability.

## ( Ii ) Jointly Safeguard Regional Maritime And Air Security

The MND is building collaborative channels for institutionalized strategic dialogues, working with countries in the Asia Pacific region to jointly ensure air / sea lines of communication in the East China Sea, South China Sea, and areas around Taiwan, thereby safeguarding regional peace and stability.

## ( Iii **) Participate In International Counter-Terrorism And** Humanitarian Assistance Activities

The MND upholds the principles of safeguarding peace, and dedicates itself to suppressing terrorist activities. Therefore, the MND has been making personnel and intelligence exchanges with neighboring countries, and seeking opportunities for joining multilateral exercises. The MND has also been working with overall diplomatic policies of the country to provide humanitarian assistance as part of our obligations to the global community.

## ( Iv ) Comply With The Non-Proliferation Treaty

In compliance with international norms, the MND does not produce, develop, acquire, store, or use nuclear weapons, and instead only develops defensive weapon systems. The MND has also been exercising control over the export of articles related to sensitive technologies and missile systems in order to demonstrate the country's non-proliferation efforts.

## Section 3. Concept Of Military Strategy

After considering the security environments in the surrounding areas as well as strategic developments of both this country and potential adversaries, the ROC Armed Forces are adopting resolute defense and credible deterrence as the concepts of military strategy, and shall employ a defensive posture and avoid provocation accordingly. However, where the enemy is determined to initiate military invasions and where war can no longer be avoided, the ROC Armed Forces shall integrate joint operational capabilities of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to defend national territories, safeguard national sovereignty, and ensure national security.

## I. Military Strategic Missions

To accomplish the concepts of military strategy of resolute defense and credible deterrence, the ROC Armed Forces must implement the following missions in an effective manner:

## ( I ) Resolute Defense: Ensure National Security

In homeland defense operations, the ROC Armed Forces must survive the first strike, avert enemy's decapitation attacks, maneuver forces to counter strikes, and sustain all ongoing operations. In wartime, they will lead the joint operational force of all service branches to conduct fortified defensive, mutual support, and recapture operations to counter hostile air and maritime blockade, secure air routes and sea lines of communication, and maintain connection with the outside world, so as to sustain military might. Furthermore, guided by the principle of strategical sustainment and tactical rapidness and decisiveness, the ROC Armed Forces, strategically, will adopt a defensive posture to gain a temporal and spatial leeway to generate advantageous situations. Tactically, we shall utilize favorable conditions in force, space, and time to effectively counter enemy strikes, and maximize the potential of all-out defense so as to resist enemy invasions and ensure homeland security.

## ( Ii ) Credible Deterrence: Continue To Enhance Credible Capabilities

The MND has been maintaining a balanced level of training and combat preparation for its forces, and integrating operational capabilities of subordinate services' weapon systems, so as to improve joint operational performance and enhance overall military power. In addition, the MND has been developing coastal mobile long-range precision firepower, air defense, suppressive weapon systems, IO/ EW jamming, positioning, direction finding, and countermeasure systems. These systems shall be applied in tandem with innovative / asymmetric tactics and techniques to focus attacks upon critical enemy weaknesses, and maximize our weapon effectiveness, so as to deter the enemy from undertaking any military actions after considering costs and risks incurred.

## Ii. Future Requirements For Defensive Operations

To accomplish the missions originated from the military strategy as mentioned above, we have comprehensively contemplated all factors, such as operational scenarios in the Taiwan Strait, characteristics of modern warfare, developments of military technologies and weapon systems, etc., to devise the principles of the future preparations for defensive operations of the ROC Armed Forces as follows:

## ( I ) Rapid Mobility

Force allocation, buildup, and deployment shall be implemented in a way to prevent enemy blockades, possible surprise attacks, decapitation strikes, and any other asymmetric techniques. Key focus is laid on the strengthening quick response and mutual support capabilities of each service's fire power, so as to establish stepwise a modernized defense force to the needs of our defensive operations.

## ( Ii ) Force Integration

Capabilities, force structure, command mechanisms, doctrines and manuals, tactics and techniques, as well as education and training of all services shall be planned and integrated according to a joint operational concept so as to multiply the total strength, and attain local battlefield superiority. 

## ( Iii ) Agile Command And Control

Various weapon systems and platforms shall be more proficiently linked to shorten the decision making cycle of detection, processing, decision-making, and action, so as to allow the overall military force to have efficient and agile command and control, unobstructed real-time communications, as well as highly effective precision firepower.

## ( Iv ) Infrastructure Protection

Facing the threat of possible high intensity sudden strikes from the enemy, the ROC Armed Forces shall do their utmost to backup and sustain the operational functions of all systems on the part of defense, and continue to bolster their critical infrastructure protection (CIP) measures in order to prevent paralysis caused by initial combat loss that may lead to inability to sustain military operations.

## ( V ) Innovative / Asymmetric Warfare

Given the widening gap between the military capabilities on either side of the Taiwan Strait, the ROC Armed Forces shall develop innovative / asymmetric warfare concepts to flexibly apply conventional and unconventional tactics and techniques to attack enemy weaknesses and critical nodes in order to change the outcome of the battle to our favor.

## Section 2. Devise Well-Planned Transformation Of Military Service

The adoption of the Volunteer Military System represents a key reform to our military service, and it will determine the successful transformation of ROC national defense. The Volunteer Military System is expected to be beneficial for improving ROC Armed Forces operational capacity, allowing rational personnel deployment, and reducing social costs. To effectively improve ROC Armed Forces operational capacities, we have been recruiting and cultivating highly motivated and experienced candidates to join long-term volunteer service so as to reduce training costs, make the best of their expertise, and resolve inherent weaknesses of the conscription system such as high turnover and difficulties in accumulating military competences.

## I. Dedicate To The Volunteer Military System

In order to carry out the policy of the Volunteer Military System, the MND is focusing on implementation of transitional conscription mechanism, recruitment for volunteer service members, and improvement on professional training. Under the leadership of Executive Yuan's Volunteer Military Program Task Force, the MND has been coordinating other governmental agencies to carefully implement the policy stepwise, so as to ensure the successful transition of the current military service.

## ( I ) Transition Conscription Mechanism For Successful Transformation Of Military Service

In accordance with the *Act of Military Service System,* the Executive Yuan has prescribed that from 1 January 2013, male adults born after 1 January 1994 shall undergo 4 months of regular military service training. For male adults born on 31 December 1993 or earlier without prior records of conscription, they shall serve in substitute service for 1 year. However, in light of current threats, increased tensions in the region, commissioning of highly capable new equipment, and the need to ensure national security, we are conscripting male adults born in 1993 or before and revising the verification schedule for the volunteer military system, so as to ensure a smooth and successful transformation of military service.

## ( Ii ) Continue Recruiting For Securing Manpower Sources

Recruitment target for 2014 was to recruit 16,069 individuals to attend all opening classes, and the result was 19,355 individuals recruited for an achievement rate of 120.5%. Among those recruited, there were 15,024 individuals for volunteer enlistee vacancies with an achievement rate of 142.3%. In comparison with 11,069 individuals recruited in 2012 and 10,942 in 2013, our recruitment is growing steadily. Following the recruitment success 

![93_image_0.png](93_image_0.png) volunteer service with long service terms, the ROC Armed Forces may thus have an edge to exert their potential of professionalism to effectively enhance our force performance.

1.2. To acquire stable recruitment resources and retain needed personnel, the MND has been taking steps to construct incentives, host events to elaborate policy, strengthen recruitment advertisements, make reasonable wage increases, renovate living quarters, encourage advanced education during off-hours, and improve systems for veteran affairs.

in 2014, we have set the recruitment target for 2015 at 14,000 individuals, and have recruited 11,901 individuals by the end of August. The ROC Armed Forces shall continue to provide thoughtful incentives to achieve the recruitment targets for 2015 and 2016.

## ( Iii ) Strengthen Professional Training And Enhance Force Performance

To achieve the advantage of quality over quantity, we have to recruit individuals to join the volunteer service with long service terms, and train them with extensive professional skill sets because they are the key to improve our force performance through the Volunteer Military System. Volunteer enlistees shall undergo improved professional military education in basic training and military occupational specialty (MOS) training to enhance their operational competences. It is hoped that they can assume duty positions in their designated units after graduation. When they join the active force, they shall receive advanced combat and composite training to further transform them into versatile combatants so as to help improve overall force performance.

## Ii. Provide Comprehensive Incentives For Recruiting

To acquire stable recruitment sources and retain needed personnel, the MND, guided by the Executive Yuan and assisted by other governmental agencies, has been taking steps to construct complete legal basis for recruiting incentives, host events to elaborate policies, strengthen recruitment advertisements, make reasonable wage increases, renovate living quarters, encourage advanced education during off-hours, and improve systems for veteran affairs.

## ( I ) Construct Complete Legal Basis For Incentives And Improve Care For Service Members

To construct complete legal basis for increasing wage, improving dignity, and exploring career opportunities after separation from the military for personnel recruited from the Volunteer Military System, the MND, working with the Ministry of the Interior and the Republic of China Veterans Affairs Council (VAC), has been proposing for the stipulation of the *Provisional Act for the* Implementation of the Volunteer Military System and amendments to the Statute of Welfare for Service members and Dependents and the ROC Veterans Assistance Act, so as to finish all legal processes, and establish a systemic guarantee for the protection of welfare for both active and retired personnel to whom we shall provide multi-faceted care.

## ( Ii ) Host Events To Elaborate Policies And Acquire Public Recognition

To earn public recognition to the benefits of the Volunteer Military System policy, the MND has been making full use of the timings of major annual exercises and training sessions, all-out defense education activities, open house events, Midshipman Cruise Training, and local reservist sports events, to host recruiting events in local communities. By hosting these events, we may invite local people, students, and reservist counseling organizations to participate, and elaborate our recruiting policy to them in order to encourage young adults to pursue a military career.

## ( Iii ) Strengthen Recruitment Advertisements And Promote Military Service

To encourage perspective young adults to sign up, the MND has designed and issued brochures and video promotion through multiple channels to disseminate recruitment information. Moreover, we have constructed an interactive guided-tour section titled *Starting a Military Career* on the official website of the Recruitment Center of the ROC Armed Forces, using online real-time interaction to keep young adults informed, and help them to choose a military career track that meets their expertise and ideals. In addition, we have adopted diverse recruitment means, including producing realistic promotional films, such as homeland guardians, *elite armed forces*, and *uniform of glory*, to help young adults and the public to gain a better understanding on the real life and training in the ROC Armed Forces so as to encourage them willingly join the service.

## ( Iv ) Make Reasonable Wage Increases And Raise Allowances

As of 1 January 2014, the Executive Yuan has raised volunteer service allowance and class 1 and class 2 offshore island allowances, which are indeed beneficial to our recruitment and retention. To speed up volunteer replacements for operational forces and other strenuous units, the Executive Yuan on 1 April 2015 has approved 2 extra allowances: operational forces service allowance and retention bonus, in order to maintain a stable recruitment and retention, and provide more incentives for young talents to serve than those offered by the private sector.

To promote the Volunteer Military System, the VAC has also proposed revisions to the *ROC* Veterans Assistance Act, which is now under review by the Legislative Yuan to provide counseling services to veterans who have served between 4 and 10 years. The revision also focuses on providing counseling services categorized by different MOSs and ranks, with attention paid to school admissions and job employment, so as to ensure that volunteer service members after discharge are able to receive necessary counseling for future employment.

## Section 3. Reform To National Defense Legal System

The MND upholds major goals of the national defense policy and the policy guideline of thorough legalization of national defense to formulate an annual revision plan for national defense laws and regulations. The MND shall follow the plan to stipulate (promulgate) and revise relevant laws and regulations according to planned schedule so as to create a democratic, legalized, modern, and professional national defense system.

## I. Reform To The Military Punishment System

The MND proposed an amendment to the Act of Punishment of the Armed Forces to address public concerns on human rights issues in the military, maintain absolute military discipline, and ensure that human rights and interests of service members are well tended. The amendment added some additional kinds of penalty, altered confinement penalty to forcible repentance and deleted reforming training as a form of punishment. In addition, the effects of certain punishments and remedy channels are also improved in the amendment, so as to reach a balance between force management and protecting the human rights of service members.

## Ii. Joint Operations Command Mechanism

( I ) The ROC Armed Forces have responded to changes of the enemy and trends in defense technology developments and integrated them within military restructuring programs. For the purpose of improving the joint operations command system performance and safeguarding national security, the ROC Armed Forces are actively pursuing the strength needed to acquire electromagnetic dominance and expanding EW capabilities. Through the integration of data links, the Armed Forces are also expanding command and control systems as well as surveillance capabilities. A Common Operational Picture (COP) has thereby been established to improve battlefield transparency. Synchronized awareness over battlefield dynamics has been established within the units of various levels, so as to strengthen their battlefield monitoring capabilities and their abilities for effective battlefield management, ensure the integrity and comprehensiveness of joint operations command and control functions, and meet the needs to conduct defensive warfare.

( II ) Additionally, in order to strengthen the countermeasures and defensive capabilities of command, control, communication, computer, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, and improve our flexibility of troop deployment during defensive operations, in recent years, the ROC Armed Forces have acquired long range surveillance radar, P-3C anti-submarine aircraft, mine sweepers, fuel and ammunition replenishment vessels, Swift Sea corvettes, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), Cloud Leopard Infantry Fighting Vehicle, LT-2000 MLRS, AH- 64E helicopters, UH-60M helicopters and many other modern military hardware. The Armed Forces have also completed upgrade programs for F-16A/B, IDF fighters, E-2K airborne early warning aircraft, and PAC-3 missile systems. According to the directives for defensive operations of Taiwan and Penghu islands, in the future, we will seize the opportunities of various joint operational exercises and training to verify the operations of our command mechanism, adequacy of our innovative / asymmetric capabilities and defensive operational plans, with focuses on organizational adjustments of the Jingtsui Program and deployment of new capabilities, so as to ensure that the ROC Armed Forces are able to exert the full potential of our joint operations capabilities.

## Iii. Joint Operations Capability Buildup

The ROC Armed Forces have considered changes in regional security, technological advancement, operational requirements and all-out defense policies to push forward an all-out defense posture, and strengthen joint operations performance. Furthermore, we have adopted a set of buildup guidelines of lead-in by technology, information and electronics superiority, joint interdiction, and homeland defense to vigorously establish a credible deterrence. Relevant buildup of capabilities includes joint C4ISR, joint information and electronic warfare, joint counter-air, joint sea control, joint ground defense, reserve mobilization, joint logistics and intangible combat capabilities.

## Iv. Improving Joint Operations Training Performance

Based on the principles of increasing intensity of joint operational training, integrating similar exercises, and improving training assessment standards, the ROC Armed Forces have planned major annual exercises, such as Han Kuang (HK) and Lien series to integrate and assess training performances of the participating units in order to combine training, exercise, and operational readiness together, so as to achieve the objectives of training for war and integrating training with operations.

## ( I ) Han Kuang Exercise

To enhance the ROC Armed Forces joint operational command systems as well as strengthen force buildup and combat preparations, the annual Han Kuang Exercise is divided into a command post exercise and a field training exercise in a fashion of joint operations with an aim at undergoing computersimulated wargaming first and field training later. The focuses of the exercise include: protecting cyberspace, improving early warning, enhancing command and control, protecting critical information facilities, countering unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and guided weapon attacks, verifying the abilities of the deployment of new capabilities, coordination of interagency efforts, and integration of joint firepower.

## ( Ii ) Lien Yung Exercise

Abiding by the *Joint Operations Training Principles*, the attack brigades of the ROC ground forces shall station at the Joint Operations Training Base Command every 18 months. The brigades will be incorporated in the Joint Operations Training System combined with all forces and firepower of the ROC Armed Forces as well as their information and electronic warfare assets, and will be evaluated via a live-fire exercise. By so doing, the participating cadre member of the ROC Armed Forces shall gain a full understanding of the attributes, capabilities and limitations of each service, enhance collaboration during joint operations, and strengthen the participating units' sense of joint operations in order to maximize our efforts of the joint operations.

## ( Iii ) Lien Hsing Exercise

The Joint Amphibious Task Force is composed of Marine brigades as well as naval and air force units. During the exercise, the task force shall act as the opposing and invading force and incorporate the scenarios of the field training phase of the Han Kuang Exercise to conduct joint amphibious landing and anti-landing exercises with forces in the theater to improve naval amphibious The purpose of the annual Han Kuang Exercise is to take the form of joint operations of the Army, Navy and 

![125_image_0.png](125_image_0.png)

![125_image_1.png](125_image_1.png) Air Force to improve our early warning capabilities, command and control performance, and verify our new capabilities.

disembarking operational capabilities as well as homeland defense capabilities in the theater.

## ( Iv ) Lien Yun Exercise

The Joint Operations Airborne Task Force commanded by the Air Force Headquarters is composed of aerial transport assets and Army airborne forces. During the exercise, the task force shall incorporate the scenarios of the field training phase of the Han Kuang Exercise to carry out joint airborne and antiairborne exercises with forces in the theater to verify its training performance as well as joint homeland defense capabilities.

![127_image_1.png](127_image_1.png)

been included in 2015 in order to strengthen combat physical fitness of our volunteer service members.

2.To strengthen long distance and precision strike capabilities of our missile forces, a combined firing training of the Armed Forces have been employed in an unexpected fashion to validate the effectiveness of firing preparation and responsive capabilities of the participating forces.

## Section 3. Maintaining Continuous Operational And Training Readiness

To build a Hard ROC defense force, the ROC Armed Forces have followed the guidelines of training for war and integrating operations with training to maintain intensive training and exercises for all members. In order to improve basic combat capabilities of our personnel, we have focused upon their physical fitness, combined (and joint) training, camp (base) training, and precision missile firing training.

## I. Enhancing Physical Fitness

ROC Armed Forces directives treat physical fitness as national strength and believes that enhanced fitness strengthens the entire nation. After assessing and performing quantifiable analysis of various fitness tests, we revised the standards for 3 physical tests and their alternative tests in 2008. In 2010, a total of 8 ROC Armed Forces Physical Fitness Assessment Centers were established in order to provide a systematic, scientific, and rational physical training regime so as to effectively improve basic combat capabilities of all service members. In addition, following the government's plan of "Let's swim," and ensuring that every service member has basic swimming skills adequate for self-rescue, we have also employed conducive training models that greatly increased the prevalence of swimming training and the number of personnel with qualified swimming skills. Additionally, in sync with the promotion of volunteer force, we have added combat physical fitness and mixed-martial art training in 2015 to enhance the basic physical fitness of our volunteer service members.

## Ii. Realizing A Well-Rounded Base Training

In the volunteer force, the term of enlisted personnel is extended to 4 years. The original concept of single Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) with single capability of the enlisted personnel is no longer satisfying the cost requirements of long service term and increased professionalism. Therefore, to increase the flexibility of assigning operational personnel and reservist management, a training program of single MOS with multiple capabilities must be implemented accordingly to ensure all service members proficient with all weapons and all military skills at the company (and below) level. Base training shall also incorporate intensified training at night, live firing, combat readiness training, routine combat training, and training of urban warfare skills and tactics. Professional training for cadre members and self-training of general MOS are intensified and the concept of management-training integration is realized so as to fully improve the overall effectiveness of base training.

## Iii. Strengthening Base-Level Assessment

Base training represents the core of field training, using actual battle conditions as training scenarios to strengthen live firing and force-on-force exercises to 

NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC

![128_image_0.png](128_image_0.png)

2015
hone the tactics, combat techniques and skills, and improve combined-arms performance at brigade and battalion levels. In order to further enhance base training and achieve training objectives, the ROC Armed Forces are planning to acquire composite targets, multi-functional training fields, and laser engagement systems to create a force-on-force platform capable of judgment on the scene for participating forces so as to achieve training goals.

## Iv. Improving Accuracy Of Missile Strike

In order to strengthen long-range precision strike capabilities of our missile units, we have adopted a model to combined missile firing training of the Armed Forces since 2014. Random selection of units for assessment has been employed since 2015 in order to validate missile firing preparation and responsive capabilities of various units. In 2014 and 2015, the ROC Armed Forces have fired a total of 809 missiles of 32 models of 9 different categories. Not only the training objectives are effectively achieved, but the expiring missiles and munitions are also adequately consumed to reduce subsequent disposal costs.

## V. Enhancing The Performance Of Simulation Training

The ROC Armed Forces have integrated technological training programs. In addition to the application of various current simulation training systems (769 systems of 86 categories) for tactics, combat techniques and skills to supplement field training, we are also focusing on acquiring training and simulation system for new capabilities and army close combat simulation system, and improving our theater joint operational wargaming system and simulation systems of all service branches. Plans have also been made to create a synthetic battlefield to achieve the objectives of reducing training costs, minimizing training risks, ensuring equipment availability, and enhancing training benefits.

# Section 4. Consolidating Information And Electronic Warfare Capabilities

Our communication, information and electronic warfare preparedness has taken the enemy threats, our operational concepts and actual joint operations requirements into consideration. In accordance with our Ten-Year Force Buildup Concept and Five-year Force Buildup Plan, we are consolidating our command and control systems, communication and information platforms, network and EW capacities in an increasingly complex electromagnetic environment. The goal is to establish a highly robust network centric joint operations command and control system with multiple back-up measures to support the operations of our Armed Forces.

## I. Improving Communication And Information Infrastructure

The communications and information system of the ROC Armed Forces integrates both government and privately operated communication and information resources, and employs universal information and communication technology standards and specifications with synchronous fiber-optic networks and communications and information systems serving as the main trunk lines. Cable and wireless networks, satellites and multi-routers, redundant backup, as well as secure and anti-interference high speed broadband transmission platforms have been established to offer voice communications, data, video and information services at the Joint Operations Command Center, posts at strategic level and various bases (and positions).

## Ii. Strengthening The Command And Control Capabilities Of Joint Operations

To effectively maximize the potential of digital command and control capabilities, we have continued to expand the fleet of our main aerial (and naval) data link platforms. Major sensors and various strategic command posts of the Army, Navy and Air Force have been integrated to enhance joint operations command and control performance. We are also actively participating in international organizations and meetings to acquire foreign operational capabilities of data link as well as the latest technological information. We have integrated our industrial cooperation (offset) plan with domestic industries so as to strengthen our self-reliant operational and maintenance capabilities and enhance operational effectiveness of the data link of the ROC Armed Forces.

## Iii. Integrating Electronic Warfare Capabilities

To improve the flexibility of battlefield EW command and control, the ROC Armed Forces joint EW operations has integrated electromagnetic (EM) spectrum management with decision-making support platforms. We have continued developing and acquiring various EW support, protective and countermeasure systems, and established various information and electronic defense standard operating procedures to ensure the integrity of our information and electronic resources, the usability of our command and control systems, as well as our freedom of actions. We have been also developing key EW technologies to establish EM superiority in the Taiwan Strait to provide effective support for our joint operations.

## Iv. Enhancing Information Security And Protection Capabilities

We have continued to enhance the performance of our Information Security and Protection Management Center while implementing exclusive network usage measures. Information security courses are constantly provided to various training and educational classes in order to enhance the awareness of information security amongst service members. The ROC Armed Forces are guided by the National Security Bureau as well as the National Information & Communication Security Taskforce (NICST) to establish a joint operations data security and protection mechanism. We shall take the opportunities of various exercises and training to put the concept of Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) into practice so as to strengthen our overall national information security protection capabilities.

## Section 5. Refining Logistics Support

In order to achieve the goals of precise logistics management and rapid logistics support, the ROC Armed Forces have been actively integrating the logistic capabilities of the Army, Navy and Air Force while enhancing existing IT systems in recent years. We have been promoting outsourcing our logistics and refining the contract management mechanism in order to preserve our logistic potential. In addition, we are vigorously considering to phase out obsolete equipment, fine tune integrated logistic support (ILS) planning for new equipment, and improve the quality of living quarters of service members so as to improve overall support and service performance.

## I. Exerting The Full Potential Of Logistics

To reap the combined effectiveness of professional division of labor and integration of one's profession and abilities, we have extensively reviewed the current status of our logistic operations, and revised those no longer applicable to date to simplify the logistic process involved. By so doing, we have stipulated the *Logistics Policy Guidelines of the ROC Armed Forces* of 29 articles in 13 categories issued to the entire Armed Forces. Furthermore, we have also enhanced and integrated functions of our information system to exert the full potential of logistics.

## Ii. Effectively Maintaining Equipment Readiness

In light of various new weapon systems entering our order of battle in recent years, we have adopted the ILS information system to refine full life cycle management mechanism for them in order to maintain stringent control of readiness of all weapon systems. In addition, we have consolidated maintenance and supply resources, and through prepositioning, forward acquiring and status prediction of them we may allot them in a timely and flexible fashion to ensure that our equipment are fully prepared.

NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC

![134_image_0.png](134_image_0.png)

2015

## Iii. Improving Effectiveness Of Maintaining Materiel

We have been checking the stockpile in the inventory to critically review new requirements, pushing forward integration of maintenance capabilities of all service branches, and enhancing the efforts of integrated logistics management teams, so as to better monitor fluctuation of maintenance costs and establish a comprehensive suite of core maintenance capabilities. In 2014, a total of 36,000 obsolete items in 1,200 categories, including major defense equipment, supporting equipment, communications, and wheeled vehicles, were phased out, saving the maintenance costs of NT$ 730 million, effectively reducing our financial burdens while improving the effectiveness of our equipment maintenance efforts.

## Iv. Implementing Energy Saving Policies

On the condition of not disrupting military exercises and training missions, we have been providing assistance to local governments by carrying out cloud seeding as well as water supply and delivery operations. We have also adopted the principle of use resources only where it counts, don't hoard resources where it matters and employ resource saving measures, to regularly review overall savings, compile a data of fuel, water and electricity consumed, and compare chronicled information to verify that we have achieved energy saving objectives stipulated by the Executive Yuan.

## V. Promoting Sequential Outsourcing Of Logistics

To drive the Jingtsui Program for force restructuring and to build a volunteer force, we have focused our scarce defense resources upon our major operational forces, and retained core logistic capabilities after reviewing all our logistic activities. In accordance with Article 22 of the *National Defense Act* regarding outsourcing to the private sector, items such as meals preparation, supplies, transport, and facilities maintenance have been outsourced to civilian entities in order to reduce personnel requirements of general service of the ROC Armed Forces. To improve personnel training and ensure that experiences are handed down effectively, we have established a contract management training capacity in 2014. Thereafter, in addition to supporting Armed Forces organization restructuring as well as streamlining, we have been reviewing the organization of our logistic units, our domestic market environment and earmarked budgets to carry on with sequential outsourcing accordingly to attain the goals of national defense working in tandem with public livelihood.

![135_image_0.png](135_image_0.png)

Meals preparation, supplies, transport and facilities maintenance and the like have been outsourced to civilian entities according to the Article 22 of the National Defense Act in order to reduce personnel requirements of general service of the ROC Armed Forces. The picture depicts a civil contractor doing equipment transport.

## Vi. Integrating Logistic Data Management

To enhance logistic data management performance, big data analytics are employed to merge and adjust 8 information systems that include our aircraft management system. We have been adopting a storage barcode system to improve the performance of our supply and maintenance operations. Chronicled results of exercise validation are used as a reference for reviewing and improving logistic systems for the purpose of force application, and we may thus have a timely and precise picture of the logistic status and requirements of the current force, so as to effectively improve our decision-making and reduce manual workload.

## Section 6. Consolidating Reserve Force

In its own right, the MND is in charge of military mobilization. We have therefore adopted the principle of building a streamlined standing army and consolidating reserve force. In peacetime, the MND is doing adequate preparation for mobilization, and in wartime it shall be able to quickly assemble a reserve force to support the defensive operations.

## I. Preparing The Mobilization Plans

To successfully achieve the defensive operations of Taiwan and Penghu islands, our military mobilization is directed by the guideline of planned mobilization as the core supplemented by contingent mobilization. Meanwhile, we have completed various mobilization plans for peacetime. In wartime, when mobilization is activated, the ROC Armed Forces shall quickly assemble reservists to form a highly capable reserve force. Regarding our mobilization planning, we have devised 7 sub-plans and 52 executive plans. Each of these plans has been meticulously designed according to operational requirements, reviewed and approved through necessary hierarchy, and incorporated in training and exercises for the purpose of validation. Furthermore, in order to allow mobilization staff at all levels to have more professional knowledge of the mobilization policy, we have held local workshops for them by providing courses centered on scenarios, special situations, and case studies, helping them to have an in-depth understanding of current mobilization policies, operational procedures and guidelines.

## Ii. Preparing Manpower Mobilization

When service members (including enlistees of short-term military training) are discharged, they are treated as reservists and have to attend recall training to retain their combat potential. In wartime, they shall be quickly mobilized to 1 2 1.Military mobilization is conducted mainly through planned mobilization and supplemented 

![138_image_0.png](138_image_0.png)

![138_image_1.png](138_image_1.png)

by contingent mobilization. Mobilization plans shall be created in peacetime in order to ensure that reservists can be quickly assembled into a highly competent reserve force if mobilized.

2.Tongxin Exercise and Ziqiang Exercise are also implemented during the live firing phase of the Han Kuang Exercise in order to validate the potency of force formation, pre-battle training, and homeland defense, etc.

form a reserve force in order to defend our national territories. We currently have 2.5 million reservists. Reservists within 8 years after discharge shall be mobilized first in order to ensure that our reserve force is able and competent. Additionally, according to the *Reservist Selection and Training Regulations* and the concept of *organizing before training and 2-year reservist replacement*, reservists shall attend two recall training sessions of 5 to 7 days within every 8 years, and some professional training courses shall be added if necessary.

## Iii. Preparing Materiel Mobilization

In order to utilize all material resources effectively to support our military efforts, we have been doing preparation of material mobilization from July to September annually, and it is divided into two phases: operational requirement review and supply and demand verification. We have followed the procedures of inspecting organization of assets, operational requirement review, supply and demand verification, inter-theater support, devising plans and validation through exercises, to invite relevant governmental agencies, local governments and supervisory organs to jointly establish a platform to pool all resources so as to improve operational precision. Currently, we have accumulated 335 items at our material control from 66 types in 10 categories.

## Iv. Validating Mobilization Through Exercises

To validate the effectiveness of *Combined Military Power Coordination Report* at various levels in pooling civilian and material resources within the region to support our military operations, we have been holding Tongxin Exercise and Ziqiang Exercise in concert with live-firing phase of the annual Han Kuang exercise. During the exercises, reservists (about 10,000 personnel) are recalled to validate the potency of force formation, pre-battle training and homeland defense capabilities. We have been using print and broadcast media as well as operational command systems to disseminate requisition orders, commandeering orders, alternate production orders simultaneously, and supervising participating forces to do training practices, such as purchasing and commandeering civil resources, mobilizing civil transports for military use, integrating public and private medical resources with military medical system, and mobilizing military supply industries to expand our maintenance and repair potential.

# Section 7. Forging Intangible Combat Capabilities

Mentality of perseverance can be epitomized by the country's soft power and smart power. The MND has employed the Chu-Kuang (Glorious) Garden TV program, a newspaper and three journals published by the Youth Daily News, Voice of Han Broadcasting Network and Internet publishing channels to create, broadcast and publish educational topics, monographs and news reports to help forge such a mentality. We have been hosting various art and cultural promotion events to push Armed Forces works against corruption and improve the sense of internal security. It is hoped that these measures can help strengthen the will of the service members, enhance their sense of moral value, and perfect their physical combat skills. The final goal is to forge a mentality of perseverance far exceeding that of the enemy and maximize the potential of this intangible capability.

## I. Promoting Sense Of Unity

On the occasions of the *90th Anniversary of Whampoa Military Academy* in 2014 and *the 70th Anniversary of Victory in the War of Resistance against* Japan and the Retrocession of Taiwan in 2015, the MND especially hosted a series of events, such as a musical called *Country and Home*, an exhibition titled *From Here to Eternity* (detailing the truth of the War of Resistance against Japan), memorial concerts, a seminar of the *70th Anniversary of* Victory in the War of Resistance against Japan as well as a workshop to discuss cultivating moral value and character for service members. Attendees, such as military representatives, veterans, service members, dependents, and civilians, were all impressed and deeply felt the invaluable consciousness of the cruelty of war and pricelessness of peace. To faithfully exhibit a piece of glorious history of the ROC Armed Forces, we have assigned personnel to bring home the remains of brave soldiers of the Chinese Expeditionary Force in Burma during the War, and issued a commemorative calendar titled An Honor and Heritage to help our fellow citizens appreciate the spirit of sacrifice and contribution of the ROC Armed Forces and inspire service members to follow their heritage of loyalty and valor in defending our nation so as to strengthen our mentality of perseverance. Additionally, we held a NICE PLAY - Saluting our Heroes event for exemplified service members and their families on the eve of the Armed Forces Day and All-Out Defense Education Day commendation event, and offered them foreign travel opportunities to broaden their horizons and strengthened their sense of pride and honor so as to create a positive image of the Armed Forces and help nurture a sense of unity.

![141_image_0.png](141_image_0.png)

In order to commemorate the 70th Anniversary for the Victory in the War of Resistance against Japan and the Retrocession of Taiwan, the MND especially hosted a musical called Loyalty unto Death - Striving for an Everlasting Peace.

## Ii. Psychological Warfare

To strengthen the psychological toughness of service members and recognize the importance of force buildup and operational preparedness, political warfare (PW) supervisors and officers in charge of PW at brigade (group) level or above are gathered annually to observe a demonstration of the Four Essentials of the Battlefield and Psychological Warfare (PSYWAR) Training. Moreover, prior to live-firing phase of the Han Kuang Exercise, a PSYWAR Week training program is also carried out to impart to service members a solid understanding of why we fight and who we fight for.

## Iii. Enhancing Counter-Espionage Operations

Even though the status quo of the Taiwan Strait is relatively stable, the lurking threats to our security are increasingly intimidating. In recent years, communist espionage cases have been unearthed one after another, and these cases have demonstrated that the PRC has yet to reduce its infiltration and espionage activities despite the fact that cross-Strait exchanges are increasing. In order to strengthen loyalty and patriotism amongst service members, we have generalized the recruitment and infiltration methods of the PRC, and incorporated them in our counter-espionage training as study focuses. Moreover, we have been adopting a diversified pedagogy to establish security awareness amongst service members and their families so as to strengthen the service members and civilians' consensus of the importance of counterespionage and security. Most communist espionage cases uncovered in recent years were mostly whistle-blown by service members. Subsequent case analyses revealed that the PRC has been vigorously tempting our discharged and retired personnel to contact active members and their families in order to acquire classified information. To achieve effective prevention and elimination of risk factors, and maintain purity in our military community, we have been providing courses to

service members and their families to improve their awareness in this regard. We have also stipulated a suite of *Practical Measures for Counter-Intelligence* Training for Retired ( Discharged) Personnel of the ROC Armed Forces. Moreover, we have been working together with private media companies to produce TV series of counter-espionage to establish a deep-rooted awareness of it in the general public so as to prevent the Armed Forces from the infiltration, espionage and sabotage activities of the enemy.

## Iv. Expanding News Broadcast

Civilian supervision of the armed forces is considered standard practice in democratic nations. By taking into account of this global trend, upholding the principle of promoting transparency for national defense policy implementation,

and respecting people's right to know, the MND has been publicly stating, communicating, and elaborating its policy implementation to the people via broadcast means on condition of without infringement of confidentiality to obtain their support for the Armed Forces. To help the people better understand our Armed Forces' dedication to training and to improve the exposure of our forces in the global stage, we worked with the National Geographic Channel, History Channel and Al Jazeera English in 2014 to produce special programs, such as *Taiwan's Elite Warriors: Thunder* Tigers, *Marine Corps Amphibious Reconnaissance and Patrol Unit*, and Impacts to the Taiwan Strait after the ROC Armed Forces Becomes a Volunteer Force. It is hoped that through project planning concept together with flexible, diversified and active marketing strategies, we may effectively build a positive image of the Armed Forces.

## V. Building Up A Clean Military

To realize the clean governance policy, the MND has established an Ethics Office and an Inspector General's Office which are dedicated to the elimination of corruption and graft within our ranks. In 2014, the performance of anticorruption activities taken by the ROC Armed Forces were ranked 3rd place among 11 governmental agencies in the same grouping for ethical evaluation reviewed by the Agency Against Corruption (AAC) of the Ministry of Justice. We were also subject to the 2014 Anti-Corruption Public Survey organized by Transparency International Chinese Taipei (TICT), which evaluated public servants of 26 specialties. The survey results revealed that our service members were ranked 5th place by the general public in terms of anti-corruption ratings. In May 2015, the Chairperson of Transparency International personally witnessed the signing of Partnership Agreement for Anti-Corruption Education of the ROC Armed Forces by the National Defense University and TICT to help blend international academic principles and theories of ethics into our military educational system.

## Section 1. Nurturing Quality Personnel

In order to enhance core competences of Officers and NCOs, aside from providing basic, advanced and specialized courses, we have been selecting qualified cadre to study overseas and do research in foreign think tanks. Service members are encouraged to study in domestic graduate schools to pursue Master's and PhD's degrees and in occupational training institutions for skill certificates in order to satisfy various requirements of their MOS.

## I. Streamlining Recruitment And Examination Affairs

( I ) Merging examinations: Entrance examinations for our 2-year Non-
Commissioned Officer (NCO) College Program were originally implemented separately by the Army Academy, the Naval Academy and the Air Force Institute of Technology. Such examinations have been merged into one. The entrance exams for Standing Flight Officer Class, Reserve Officer Cadets in universities, 2-Year Officer College, and equivalent classes are also held in the same timeframe so as to reduce the number of examination personnel.

( II ) Validating alternative physical tests: Since 2015, the results of physical fitness tests held by the Ministry of Education (MOE) have been validated as acceptable alternative tests to the on-site physical fitness tests (unencumbered running) for the aforementioned examinations. In addition, local test posts have been offering online intelligence assessment tests to replace paper ones for the purpose of examinees' convenience.

Education, coupled with the basic physical requirements of our service members, we have added physical fitness tests to the cadet admission requirements. By so doing, only the individuals with qualified physical fitness and academic level can be admitted into our military academies.

## Ii. Results Of Cultivating Competent Personnel ( I ) Basic Education

1.In concert with diversified admission and physical fitness policies of the MOE, coupled with the basic physical requirements of our service members, we have added physical fitness tests to the cadet admission requirements. By so doing, only the individuals with qualified conditions of physique and fitness can be admitted into our military educational institutions.

2.With farsighted military requirements in mind, we have reviewed and refined current educational programs and course curriculums, and have been incorporated into educational assessment mechanism of the MOE. Therefore, our cadets have been gathering sufficient academic competencies and necessary professional military skills as junior cadre members.

3.Our 2-Year NCO College Program focuses on imparting occupational skills and acquiring certificates. It is hoped that all graduating NCO cadets can be awarded with an occupational certificate and a degree diploma before commissioned so as to improve their technical competencies.

## (Ii) Further Education

1.Further education for officers is divided into 2 levels: command and staff level; strategic level. Regarding future curriculums, we are planning to adopt credit systems and acquire approval to award official Master's degrees to trainees graduating from the National Defense University Master's Program. By so doing, they will not only acquire the skills of pondering strategies, tactical planning and project management, but also establish a sound theoretical foundation for international affairs and global strategy so as to fulfill the goal to improve core competences of our high ranking personnel.

2.Further education for NCOs is structured by theoretical curriculums of NCO advanced courses with emphasis on advanced leadership and management, allowing senior NCOs to be able to effectively assist commanding officers to lead and manage subordinates. In addition, we have been reviewing the possibility to add NCO advanced research courses for sergeant majors at brigade-level and above, and they may receive further relevant training to acquire competencies as those of senior staff officers.

## ( Iii ) Full-Time Advanced Studies

We have been sponsoring qualified service members to attend full-time Master's and PhD programs provided mainly by military educational institutions and supplemented by domestic and overseas universities. The aim 

NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC

2015
is to develop their specialized theoretical foundations, cultivate them to become instructors in the field of R&D, and nurture them to be senior staff officers and NCOs.

## (Iv) Off-Duty Advanced Studies 1.Degree Programs

(1)We have been earmarking budget for sponsoring qualified service members on the premise of not affecting their operational duties to apply for degree programs to study during off-duty hours in domestic universities and colleges so as to improve their competences.

(2)To help wishful service members unable to study in universities and colleges to do so during off-duty hours, together with the promotion of the volunteer force, we have allowed operational forces, after reviewing their requirements, to set up Educational Points in the form of classrooms at their locations. Supervised by service headquarters, they may sign strategic alliance agreements with willing universities and colleges in their vicinity to provide educational resources. From 2014 to August 2015, there are 1,627 service members completed their studies through this channel, which can be deemed as one of diversified educational channels in military facilities for volunteer members(as shown in *Appendix 6-1*).

## 2.Training For Certificates

(1)To improve the occupational competencies of our technical personnel, and follow the policy of building the volunteer force, we have been increasing the number of occupational training courses for certificates, and considering opening new courses every year so as to allow service members to acquire national certificates and increase their opportunities of continued employment in other sectors or establishing their own trade when they separate from the service.

NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC

![152_image_0.png](152_image_0.png)

2015
(2)On the Personnel Management webpage of the MND, we have designed a special section for Occupational Training and Employment Services to reveal the regulation of attending occupational training before separation, annual employment service programs, programs for improving employment and starting new businesses offered by governmental agencies, physical addresses (or emails) and contact information of public employment service centers (or stations) as well as annual vocational training schedules in public vocational training centers. All service members before separation can freely choose the courses according to their interests in order to acquire vocational skills.

(3)We have signed strategic alliance agreements with some universities and colleges for our occupational training courses for certificates, and the courses are being held at the above-mentioned Educational Points and training locations provided by universities and colleges. From 2014 to August 2015, there are 932 service members completed their courses (per Appendix 6-2).

## ( V ) Military Education Exchange Programs

1.We have been selecting distinguished cadets and trainees to attend basic educational classes and military exchange courses in friendly nations in order to broaden their international perspective and to pragmatically build up our military exchange relations at every rank.

2.Regarding FMS Training, qualified officers are assigned to attend training courses relevant to force buildup, or courses at operational, tactical, and strategic levels. Qualified NCOs or enlisted personnel are assigned to attend courses relevant to maintenance and repair skills or hands-on operations. By so doing, we may improve officers' competencies in planning and command, and NCOs' and enlisted personnel's skills in technical maintenance.

3.For further military education, we are committed to securing training slots in this category in friendly nations for our mid-level cadre members to learn in unique and specialized fields of those nations and to enhance their joint operational staff competencies.

4.We have been offering slots for foreign cadets and trainees of friendly nations to study in our basic and further educational courses. It is hoped that through military educational exchanges we may strengthen military relations and friendship among us.

## (Vi) Think-Tank Studies

In accordance with our national policies and comprehensive planning for international relations, we have combined our channels of national defense think tanks, strategic forums and participation in overseas think tank studies so as to maintain exchanges and collaborations with renowned international think tanks. It is hoped that through participation, interaction and brainstorming in the studies of these institutions we may increase the potential of our think tanks while developing closer ties with scholars in the academic circle.

## Iii. Assigning And Operations Of Civilian Officers

Ever since the two Defense Acts that define our national defense organization characterized as professional division of functions, civilian control of the military and convergence of military command and administration systems came into force in 2002, the MND has been recruiting competent candidates to join in the national defense community as civilian officers through civil service examinations and open selection processes so as to instill new mindsets and concepts to us. By means of collective training and mutual coordination among military and civilian personnel, we have settled differences in their mindsets and ways of approaching one another, so as to realize the policy of civilian control of the military.

## ( I ) Composition Of Civilian Officers In The Mnd

The Executive Yuan authorized a roster of 203 civilian officer positions for the MND in 2015. There are 2 appointed (by the President), 67 senior, 119 assistant, and 15 junior civilian officers in the roster. The MND headquarters contains of 4 departments and 7 offices, and among them, the Department of Strategic Planning, the Department of Resources Planning, the Defense Procurement Office and the National Defense Mobilization Office are led by civilian officers. Furthermore, the Personnel Office, Comptroller Office and Ethics Office are composed of civilian officers as well.

## (Ii) Education And Training For Civilian Officers

We have recommended and arranged qualified civilian officers to attend relevant training programs hosted by the Directorate-General of Personnel Administration of the Executive Yuan, Civil Service Development Institute and National Academy of Civil Service (NACS) according to their core competencies. From 2014 to August 2015, there are 661 civilian officers attending 461 courses, and mid- and high-ranking civilian officers (including those assigned for overseas training) are accounted for over 53.3 percent among them. Additionally, the MND has also included civilian officers in various specialized military training in order to improve their military knowledge and enhance their interactions with service members. Moreover, to improve highranking civilian officers' competencies in handling national defense affairs, we have stipulated the *Guidelines for Training, Study, and Lifelong Learning* for Civilian Officers in the Ministry of National Defense, using on-the-job training programs and job rotations to provide them with comprehensive and professional defense knowledge.

## Section 2. Planning The National Defense Financial Resources

In order to achieve the objectives of our national defense policy implementation, earmark rational and adequate budgets, and ensure adequate resource allocation, we are planning to blend means of cost-effective assessment of national defense policy implementation and the resources management strategy with our budgeting procedures, such as financial forecasts, visional financial guidance, and budgetary distribution and implementation so as to maximize the effectiveness of the financial resources. 

## I. Financial Allocation Principles

To respond to hostile threats we are facing and current requirements for implementing our national defense policy, we have been reviewing the integrated mid-term budget estimates approved by the Executive Yuan to plan a well-rounded financial resources allocation by contemplating our mid- and long-term requirements, so as to adequately support our operational readiness. We are abiding by the principle of cost savings in designated fiscal years to keep a lean budget allocation so as to maximize the potency of our limited resources.

## Ii. Financial Trends And Analysis ( I ) The Proportion Of Central Government Budget Allocated For Defense Purposes

After reviewing the country's overall economic situation and future development, the Executive Yuan would then decide an adequate proportion in the central government budget for defense purposes by taking account of requirements of policy implementation and keeping a healthy financial status for the country. The Executive Yuan has pledged that once military hardware

![156_image_1.png](156_image_1.png)

2015
deemed necessary becomes available for procurement, it may take necessary steps to draw on special reserves, retroactive budget increase and special budgets to acquire the necessary funds for us in order to demonstrate the government's will of policy implementation for strengthening our national defense and determination to defend our country. In the past 10 years (2006 to 2015), the allocated defense budget ranged from NT$ 252.5 billion to NT$ 334.0 billion, equivalent to 16.07% to 19.51% of the total budget of the central government (per *Figure 6-1*).

## (Ii) Demarcation Of Open And Confidential Budgets

In conformity with the government's information transparency policy, we have clearly defined the demarcation principle for open and confidential budgets. Preparation of Confidential budgets shall be reviewed at their lowest confidential level based on the *Classified National Security Information* Protection Act and the *Government Information Transparency Law*, provided they do not affect overall national interests as well as national security. Statistics in last 10 years revealed that our confidential budgets have been kept within 6% of the overall national defense budget since 2012 (per *Figure 6-2*), demonstrating the results of improved transparency of our defense budgets.

## ( Iii ) Structural Analysis Of The National Defense Budget

The national defense budget can be divided structurally into personnel, operation and maintenance, military investments, and miscellaneous categories. Budget for personnel is mainly earmarked for personnel expenditures. Budget for operation and maintenance is mainly earmarked for keeping readiness of weapons, equipment and operations of every unit. Budget for Military investments is earmarked for research, development and acquisition of weapons and equipment. Budget for miscellaneous items is mainly earmarked for the National Security Bureau. Structural fluctuation to our budgets in last 10 years is shown in *Figure 6-3*.

Another NT$ 23.4 billion is earmarked for 45 new projects and programs, such as Acquisition of Additional Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV-7) and Portable Unmanned Aerial System Program.

4.Miscellaneous: NT$ 4.9 billion. Mainly earmarked for Compensation for Accidental Civilian Casualties by Operations of the ROC Armed Forces and the National Security Bureau budget.

## Iii. Financial Management Strategies

Due to our limited funding from the government financial resources, the success of our force buildup depends heavily on the optimum control management of comprehensive national defense resources. We have been employing a highly professional and effective management mechanism to adopt concepts of performance-based management functions, financial resource integration and cloud-based comptroller data to provide dedicated support for force buildup, and achieve the desired objectives of policy implementation.

## ( I ) Accomplishing Budget Implementation And Justifiably Managing Budget Resources

Given the difficulty in securing national defense budget, the budgetary requirements of the subsequent year are subject to a preliminary node control mechanism and the like to ensure proper planning of monthly budget allocations. We have been doing regular and irregular supervision activities to identify gaps between the pre-defined nodes and their actual progresses so as to make timely reviews and responses. Simultaneously, we may adopt a budget resource management mechanism to minimize ineffective budgets and maximize the combined benefits of all the budget resources.

## (Ii) Restructuring Accounting System And Improving Utilization Performance

In conformity with the *Accounting System of Ordinary Government Activities* of the Central Government, *Gazettes of Governmental Accounting Standards* and Doctrine, as well as relevant regulations and operational schedules of the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) of the Executive Yuan, the MND has been restructuring the ROC Armed Forces accounting system by integrating its hierarchies with its budgeting structures. By so doing, we may fully use national defense financial information so as to improve financial utilization performance of the government.

## ( Iii ) Developing Digital Platforms And Integrating Cloud Data

The MND has been integrating the ROC Armed Forces budgeting, general accounting and final accounting information systems to continue developing the ROC Armed Forces comptroller information and cloud services. We have been introducing digital certifications and signatures, time stamps and quick response two-dimensional barcodes (QR codes) to the ROC Armed Forces. Moreover, we have issued ROC Armed Forces smart cards with digital stamps to strengthen verification of identities in our financial operations (per *Figure* 6-4). Following main strategic objective of expanding service contents as the pillar and establishing national defense strategic analysis requirements as the beam, together with pragmatic measures for improving efficiency, saving energy, and reducing carbon emission, we have accelerated the pace of our operational digitalization and use of electronic documents in order to reduce both manual workload and redundant resource consumption. Our efforts have been recognized by receiving the prestigious Honorable Award for Operational Innovation, Revolution and Improvement from the DGBAS of the Executive Yuan in 2014.

## ( Iv ) Establishing Cost Systems And Achieving Management Functions

Following the essence of the *ROC Armed Forces Military Strategic Plan*, the ROC Armed Forces Planned Budget System, and our *5-year Policy Plan*, we have been pushing forward a cost-effectiveness system for national defense. By means of on-site consultations and verifications as well as our information systems, we have been analyzing data from different angles, such as personnel resources, maintenance capabilities, cost control, and resources integration, so as to provide reference for decision-making and reviewing necessary costs in various stages in our projects and programs.

![161_image_0.png](161_image_0.png)

Figure 6-4. Network Diagram of the ROC Armed Forces Comptroller Information and Cloud Services

## ( V ) Integrating Of National Defense Resources And Reforming Fund Management

The MND is in charge of 3 specialized funds, namely the ROC Armed Forces Camp and Facility Rebuilding Fund, the ROC Armed Forces Fund for the Rebuilding of Old Military Dependents' Village, and the ROC Armed Forces Production and Service Operations Fund. For the purposes of not adding to government's financial burdens and driving our 2 goals of exploring channels of revenue and expanding our scope of care, we have been continuing the National Defense Resources Integration Project to introduce corporate management practices for managing these specialized funds. By doing this reform, we have established their close reciprocal connection with the national defense budget so as to create a parallel and complementary financial operations model between them in order to satisfy our force buildup requirements. To explore channels of revenue, because the MND has been trying to get additional revenues to renovate our aging camps and living quarters in conformity with the government's policy of revitalizing land use, we have been planning to establish strategic alliances with financial institutions for the purposes of encouraging mutual investment initiatives and expanding the scope of our investments, so as to create new channels of revenue and improve our overall financial performance. To expand scope of care, we have been planning to improve the service capacities of our specialized funds in order to provide more practical care to service members and their families.

## Section 3. Keeping A Solid Armament Readiness

By referring to security threats, our military strategic concepts, future joint operational requirements, and arms development trends in advanced countries, we have been reviewing our technological levels and financial capacities to draw up 3 armament strategies of acquisition, technology, and logistics to lead our efforts in keeping a solid armament readiness. In addition to acquiring suitable arms and improving our self-reliant defense capabilities, we have been fine-tuning our full life cycle armament management mechanism in order to ensure proper support for our military operations.

## I. Weapons Acquisition Results ( I ) Military Investment Projects

The MND has made plans to established its short-, mid-, and long-term joint operational capabilities. By following acquisition procedures, we have been trying to invest limited national defense resources in establishing the most formidable combat capabilities. A total of 53 military investment projects for FY 2016 have been planned. We have reviewed upcoming available financial resources and our operational requirement priorities, and planned to proceed with those projects in FY 2016.

## ( Ii ) International Exchange In The Field Of Armament

In order to achieve our goal of establishing self-reliant defense and consecutively build our weapons research and development capabilities, we have arranged armament exchange platforms with advanced nations by adopting equitable, mutually beneficial and resource sharing principles to expand our armament exchange circles, create collaborative R&D opportunities and improve our acquisition project management. For instance, the US- Taiwan Defense Industry Conference was held in Williamsburg, Virginia 

NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, ROC

![164_image_0.png](164_image_0.png)

2015
in September 2014. The US participants recognized our determination to strengthen cooperation with US defense industries and to establish self-defense capabilities, and expressed their support willingly. Such support has greatly strengthened our mutual relations and trust.

## ( Iii ) Production And Manufacturing

Complying with the Article 22 of the *National Defense Act* and the guidelines of identifying core technologies, integrating all capabilities, forming strategic alliances and adopting work specialization, to combine the core technologies of our production factories with the vast capabilities in the industrial sector, we have employed means of co-production, technology transfers through offset and outsourcing production to expand opportunities for companies in private sector to join in the pool in manufacturing military items, and establish critical manufacturing capabilities for national defense so as to facilitate our acquisition and follow-on maintenance or our military hardware. From January 2014 to August 2015, through these means we have completed over 1,000 production projects, including Cloud Leopard 8-wheeled armored vehicles, and various weapon systems, equipment, guns, cannons and munitions for a total value exceeding NT$ 10.0 billion.

## ( Iv ) Acquisition Of Weapon Systems And Equipment

1.According to the principles of prioritizing indigenous production before foreign acquisitions, we have been applying advanced management techniques and well-rounded acquisition management systems to establish a comprehensive management system for every level. Furthermore, our acquisition processes have been subject to internal project supervision and management activities in order to effectively achieve their desired objectives. It is hoped that through expending the most adequate costs with lowest risks and shortest schedules, we may reap the maximum benefits possible.

2.We have been actively promoting indigenous weapons and equipment manufacturing and R&D capabilities. In 2014, the MND assisted the Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (CSIST) in establishing the Panlong Project and another 5 R&D projects. Completion of these projects will improve our defense technology R&D capabilities and help achieve our goals of self-reliant defense capabilities.

3.For the defensive weapons and equipment that cannot be manufactured indigenously, we shall consider foreign acquisition. US FMS programs to us reached US$ 18.3 billion since President Ma took office 7 years ago, with acquisition programs, such as F-16 A/B retrofit, AH-64E attack helicopter, UH-60M utility helicopter, P-3C fixed-wing anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft and PAC-3 missile systems. These acquisitions have effectively improved joint operational capabilities of the ROC Armed Forces.

## Ii. Results Of Technological Development

Following innovative / asymmetric concepts and force buildup guidelines of being led by technology, achieving information and electronic superiorities, conducting joint interdictions against enemy, and exerting homeland defense, the MND has envisioned short-, mid- and long-term national defense technology development trends that satisfy joint operational requirements to carve out its motivations to acquire key technologies which are under international export restrictions for the time being in order to fulfill its mission of self-reliant defense and ultimately to support our force buildup objectives. In order to make proper use of our national defense technology developments, we are planning to release mature and quality national defense technologies to industries to improve our industrial base and promote economic development of our country.

According to the principles of prioritizing indigenous production before foreign acquisitions, we have been effectively achieving our project objectives to exercise full control of weapon system acquisition schedules to satisfy our operational requirements. The picture shows newly commissioned utility helicopter.

## ( I ) National Defense Technology Developments

1.The top priority of defense technology development is to integrate 3 phases: identifying joint operational requirements, conducting national defense technology research, and pursuing weapon systems development. Abiding by stringent technology foresight procedures, we have been formulating short-, mid- and long-term defense technology development plans to ensure that our defense technology developments are insightful, integrated and continued in terms of policy implementation, and all the requirements, technology research, and weapon systems development are consistent and coherent.

2.For basic and applied technology studies, we have been requesting public and private universities to carry out relevant programs so as to encourage academic and research bodies to contribute to defense technology development. From 2014 to 2015, there are 182 research programs underway, such as low-noise highly efficient rotor blades for submersibles and UAV.

3.Concerning key technologies that are difficult to acquire, we have been establishing specific programs through defense technology research studies. There are 72 key technology R&D programs underway across 7 categories, including stealth and nano-technologies, helping to lay a sound foundation for key national defense technologies.

## ( Ii ) Developing Dual-Use Technologies

We have been releasing profitable non-sensitive national defense technologies to the industrial sector. From 2014 to August 2015, we have completed 234 investment projects for dual-use technology transfer, generating revenues of about NT$ 14.6 billion.

## Iii. Results Of Integrated Logistics

Our integrated logistics support is focused on 3 aspects: full life-cycle system management, supply chain management, and industrial strategic alliance. In addition, we have been giving integrated logistics education and training to relevant staff in charge for them to recognize that when requirement emerges is the time to kick off integrated logistics support. Therefore, they will be aware that we have to make the best of limited national defense resources so as to improve overall effectiveness of military investments.

## ( I ) Full Life-Cycle System Management

Currently, by adopting the weapons acquisition and integrated logistics support system to improve the readiness rates of our military hardware, we have been keeping a full life-cycle management, starting from planning, R&D, production, fielding, maintenance, to phasing out, for our 39 major military investment programs, including the Xunchi Program (8-wheeled armored vehicles program).

## ( Ii ) Supply Chain Management

In order to consolidate national defense technology R&D, production and maintenance capabilities, establish outsourcing partners, shorten materiel acquisition schedules, and reduce the impact caused by diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS), we have been vigorously promoting cooperation with academic and industrial circles in our supply chain so as to enhance research and production capabilities of the partners involved, shorten R&D and production cycle, and improve product quality. In the past 2 years, the MND has outsourced 579 cases to partners. For FY 2015, the total value of the outsourced cases is beyond NT$ 10.1 billion.

## ( Iii ) Strategic Alliance With Industries

By establishing a strategic commercial maintenance model for our military hardware, we have devised a government owned / contractor operated (GOCO) means for our units to build up strategic alliances with industries for the purpose of outsourcing. Involved contractors are thus encouraged to commit long-term investments and provide stable and reliable support. By so doing, in compliance with contractual requirements and our performance indicators, we have generated budget savings of up to NT$ 2.6 billion.

## Iv. Procurement Management Performance

ROC Armed Forces procurement is one of the key means employed for supporting force buildup and is an integral part of the national defense policy implementation. All procurements must comply with the regulations stipulated in the *Government Procurement Act* and make overall considerations to the quality, time and costs before proceeding with the relevant processes. Auditing, supervision and professional training have been employed to enhance procurement quality, efficiency and professional competencies of our personnel.

## ( I ) Current Status Of Military Procurements

From 2014 to August 2015, the ROC Armed Forces concluded 10,088 procurement cases at a value of NT$ 189,233.17million. Among them, 9,970 (or 98.83%) cases were made from domestic procurements at a value of NT$ 161,278.45 million, and only 118 (or 1.17%) cases were made from overseas procurements at a value of NT$ 27,954.71 million. These numbers have shown a gradual maturation of domestic manufacturers supported by the ROC Armed Forces.

## ( Ii ) Implementation Of Procurement Audits

From 2014 to 2015, 373 procurement cases at a value of NT$ 24.9 billion were designated for auditing by the Public Construction Commission of the Executive Yuan. By August 2015, 380 cases were submitted for auditing at a value of over NT$ 15.8 billion, and no major violations have been found.

## ( Iii ) Training Status Of Procurement Personnel

From 2014 to August 2015, we have held 28 courses (sessions) for government procurement personnel, including basic and advanced qualification training courses, actual procurement case study seminars, seminar on procurement supervision for high ranking personnel and specialized training courses for FMS and overseas procurements. A total of 1,839 individuals underwent these training courses.

## V. Construction And Asset Management Performance

In response to the Volunteer Military policy, governments' major policies, and planned national land usage allocation, the MND has established a stringent and comprehensive construction and camp asset management system to optimize key measures for the volunteer force, such as troop care and living quality improvement while implementing asset management to enhance performance of our policy implementation.

## ( I ) Renovating Aging Camps And Living Quarters To Improve Quality Of Living

1.Renovating aging camps: The Executive Yuan has provided an additional budget of NT$ 2.2 billion in 2015 in order to rebuild and renovate aging camps and purchase necessary furnishings to ensure the serviceability of camp amenities. In addition, renovated camps are designed with the concept of keeping adequate levels of independence and privacy in order to achieve overall improvements to personnel living environments.

2.Construction of new living quarters: 400 units of living quarters have been constructed in Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung so that service members will be able to take care of their families living nearby. For existing living quarters, we have been doing renovations on the principles of focused repair, overhaul, and lifespan extension to gradually restore aging accommodations to improve the living environment of military families.

## ( Ii ) Continuing Release Of Military Properties And Vitalizing National Land Utilization

1.In response to our force restructuring, the MND has been upholding the principles of merging smaller camps with larger ones, joint basing of the Army, Navy and Air Force, and relocating camps to suburban areas to continue its releasing of military properties without affecting our defense security and combat readiness.

# Section 1. Enhancing Disaster Prevention And Relief Efforts

In order to defend our country and fellow citizens, the ROC Armed Forces have been vigorously making preparations for disaster prevention and relief operations against the threat of complex disasters. Following the guidelines that disaster relief is akin to fighting a battle and that avoidance is better than prevention, and prevention is better than rescue, we have been adopting active measures, such as *forward deployment, early stationing, and instant* reaction for disaster relief efforts, so as to strengthen the ROC Armed Forces' performance in disaster relief and assistance provided to the overall disaster prevention and relief efforts in compliance with the law.

## I. Implementation Status ( I ) Aspect Of Disaster Prevention:

1.Raising disaster prevention awareness: For the past 2 years, the ROC 
Armed Forces have been providing extensive assistance to local governments in disaster evacuation efforts as well as promoting the guideline that avoidance is better than prevention, and prevention is better than rescue. By so doing, we have been successively rectifying the people's awareness of disaster prevention from betting on chances to active avoidance.

2.Establishing disaster prevention guidelines: The ROC Armed Forces have been adhering to the guidelines of forward deployment, early stationing, and instant reaction for disaster relief efforts. Lessons learned in recent years demonstrated that by following the guidelines, we can successfully complete the disaster relief operations and reduce the losses of lives and properties of our fellow citizens.

3.Strengthening communication and coordination: The ROC Armed Forces shall assign liaison officers to local governments 36 hours before a typhoon lands in order to establish communication channels between military commanders at all levels and heads of local governments. Our disaster prevention efforts have been well-received by the heads of local governments as well.

4.Stocking rescue supplies: We have kept a stockpile of equipment and items for 7 battalions to conduct disaster relief efforts in northern, central, southern, and eastern areas of Taiwan. A protocol of preparation of disaster relief supplies has been signed with the Red Cross Society of the ROC to jointly stock disaster relief supplies.

## ( Ii ) Aspect Of Implementation Approach:

1.Procuring disaster relief equipment: We have been picking out items from our operational inventory that may have a dual use in disaster relief, and acquiring 13 operational items of dual use in supporting our disaster relief missions, such as UH-60M utility helicopters, AAV-7 amphibious assault vehicles, and biological agent detection vehicles, etc. 

2.Nurturing disaster relief instructors: We have arranged disaster prevention and relief courses in the curriculums of operational training and academic education. For the purpose of nurturing instructors, selected service members from the Marine Corps, Special Forces, and engineering units were assigned to participate in relevant disaster relief courses provided by the Fire Department, the Red Cross Society, and the other aquatic search and rescue teams in order to further develop their disaster relief skills and professional competences. To date, 1,240 individuals have undergone those courses.

## Iv. Medical And Health Care ( I ) Improving Medical Logistics Operations And Facilitating Combat Training And Disaster Relief Preparations

Currently, the medical logistics and support system of the ROC Armed Forces is based on a 2-stage, 3-level system (per *Appendix 8-5*). Following the principle of applying medical treatment in proximity and direct evacuation to rear areas, the MND is dedicated to strengthening emergency rescue capacity of medical logistics units, and improving the quality of medical evacuation and transfer. Furthermore, in order to deepen the sense of accountability for its regional medical installations, the ROC Armed Forces have asked military hospitals and medical logistic units in the same theater of operations to be fully connected, with special attention to Mass Casualty Contingent Responses, Utilizing Civilian Medical Resources and Establishing Mobilization Capacities, Strengthening Medical Logistic Units' Cross-Theater Support Capabilities, Improving Hygiene (Medical)Material Supply and Shipping Grid, and Practical Management and Storage of Operational Hygiene (Medical) Material. With these emphases in mind, our medical logistics and support system can thus satisfy actual requirements of defensive operations and ensure successful completion of medical logistics support missions in joint operations. In addition, the ROC Armed Forces are able to use extensive experiences gained from years of participation in disaster prevention and relief to integrate our medical logistics operations with local medical operations, and improve interactions between governmental agencies and public and private hospitals. Following the principles of Standardization of Medical Rescue Teams and Mobilization of Rescue Equipment and Modules, we have established routine medical support capabilities for disaster relief operations so as to ensure success in emergency medical missions. In mishaps of the TransAsia Airways Flight 222 crash at Magong on 23 July 2014, Kaohsiung Gas Explosion on 31 July 2014, and the TransAsia Airways Flight 235 crash at Taipei City on 4 February 2015, and Formosa Fun Coast dust explosion at New Taipei City on 27 June 2015, the medical logistics and healthcare systems of the ROC Armed Forces were activated at a short notice to arrive on-site to demonstrate their complete emergent medical care capabilities. 

## ( Ii ) Strengthening Armed Forces Hospital Capacities And Improving Quality For Military-Civilian Medical Care

participating in disaster relief operations, and offering medical support against epidemics. The hospitals are also responsible for implementing physical examinations for enlisted personnel and personnel of special duties, aviation physical training, and military medical R&D for aviation and diving medicine. In wartime, the hospitals shall play a role in mobilization preparation missions, such as commandeering (or procuring) medical facilities and supplies, and dispatching beds. Furthermore, the hospitals shall follow the government's diplomatic policies to offer humanitarian support and medical services for friendly nations. Hence, ROC Armed Forces medical resources must be used and managed in a more efficient manner to satisfy the medical service requirements of the service members as well as the general public, and accomplish various military medical missions both in peacetime and wartime. The Armed Forces Hospitals are also constantly expanding the Armed Forces Medical Data Net and integrating decision-making support systems in response to government policies for enhancing patient safety, integrating exchanges of electronic medical histories, improving medical care quality, and meeting the requirements of hospital accreditation programs and operational management decisions. The aim of these measures is to ensure that Armed Forces Hospitals are capable of achieving the goals of medical-related job automation, information system management and corporate-based management. The Armed Forces Hospitals uphold the principle of public services and are committed to improving medical service quality. Since 2014, our Tri-service General Hospital has won the 6th Government Service Quality Award. Kaohsiung and Taichung Armed Forces General Hospitals also received the Symbol of National Quality for Transprofessional and Innovative Service Mechanism and patient-centered, comprehensive, and customizd services.

## ( Iii ) Integrating Military-Civilian Healthcare Systems

Through military and civilian medical cooperation, emergency operations center conferences, and monthly meetings for local specialized medical treatment, we may share professional and practical experiences gained from our research in military medicine and special medical cases handled by the Armed Forces Hospitals (such as sports medicine, heat injuries, rhabdomyolysis, heat strokes, and seasonal influenza) with neighboring civilian hospitals and medical institutions. The purpose of such measures is to satisfy medical treatment requirements of the service members and community residents. In order to make the best utilization of resources from both the armed forces and the veterans' medical systems, expand the service areas of both medical systems, and strengthen medical services to rank and file service members and veterans, we have established a complementary medical support mechanism between the armed forces and the veterans hospitals under the principles of resource sharing, fairness and mutual benefit, academic exchange, and disaster prevention support. Additionally, to improve the medical service accessibility for the service members in offshore islands or remote regions, the Armed Forces Hospitals regularly dispatches medical specialists to the Penghu Islands, Matsu, and Kinmen to provide the service members with healthcare services. The Armed Forces Hospitals are working with civilian medical institutions (such as hospitals of the Ministry of Health and Welfare and Lienchiang County Hospital) to provide outpatient and emergency medical services to local residents, so as to improve overall medical service quality in remote and offshore islands.

## V. Services For Reservists ( I ) Motivating Reservists And Building Up Mobilization Capabilities

It is hoped that with increased attention to relevant laws and regulations and communication of opinions we may improve the professionalism of our handlers and enhance the quality of their work.

## Vii. State Compensation

From 2014 to August 2015, the MND and service headquarters have accepted 147 state compensation cases, of which 14 cases have reached a final agreement or verdict while 111 cases have been closed. A total of 73 cases have been revoked after review or judged in favor of the defendant, thus achieving public savings of NT$ 1,066.45 million (per *Appendix 8-8*).

## Viii. Compensation For Casualties And Damages Caused By Military Activities

For the purpose of demonstrating the government's sincerity to make amends for civilian injuries, death or loss of property arising from military operations, and paying condolences to the dead and soothing the suffering of the injured and their families, the MND has stipulated *Regulations on Compensation for* Civilian Casualties or Damages Caused by Military Activities (hereinafter referred to as "*Compensation Regulations*"), which came into force on 1 December 1999, with an application period for 2 years. In order to protect the rights of those who didn't apply, the *Compensation Regulations* was revised in 2004 by extending application deadlines to 30 November 2007. As of August 2015, a total of 2,518 cases have been accepted, and 1,933 cases among them were closed with approved compensations of NT$ 1,536.3 million (per Appendix 8-9).

## Ix. Releasing Military'S Prohibited And Restricted Areas For Construction

To achieve the policy of attaching operational preparedness to the people's livelihood, the MND, on the conditions of not affecting national security and applicable laws, has been adjusting the scale of its military prohibited and restricted areas for construction in conjunction with transformation of national defense organization, upgrades of weapons and equipment, changes to its defensive operational models, and the exact defense and security requirements, so as to ensure both economic development and the rights and interests of the general public. Since 2014, we have released and scaled down 9 military prohibited and restricted areas with a total area of 4,512 hectares (per *Appendix* 8-10).

## X. Releasing Mnd Archives And Documents For Public Access ( I ) Availability Of Accessible Archives And Files

Abiding by the Government Information Publication Law, the Administrative Procedure Act, the *Classified National Security Information Protection Act*, and the *Archives Act*, etc., the MND has sorted out about 1.2 million documents in 38,536 collections of permanent storage for their historical or legal binding values. The MND has also been reexamining the confidentiality status for each classified document, and has completed digital cataloging, filing, and scanning processes for it at the same time. In order to reduce processing time, people may get access to the MND's website to apply for viewing the documents.

## ( Ii ) Digitalization Of Archives

Since 2014, the MND have been promoting online reviewing procedures for viewing archives applications. People may submit their online applications through the ROC Armed Forces historical and administrative archives and image access system, and after their applications are approved by the responsible office, they could view the requested archives online. By so doing, we may protect the integrity of the original copies. To protect personal information of the users, the MND has introduced the information security and personal information protection and management protocol for the ROC Armed Forces historical and administrative archives and image access system in 2014, and has acquired international certification of ISO 27001:2013 in October 2014 for data security in recognition of the full commitment of the MND in protecting personal information and its successful achievements.

## ( Iii ) Accessible Information And Archives Services

Since the ROC Armed Forces began to provide accessible information and archives services, the gesture has been well-received by the public. Aside from some files associated with national security, personal criminal activities, personnel and salary information, or data that otherwise infringes on public interest or the legal rights and interests of a third party and thus shall not be openly released or provided, the remaining information and archives can be accessible to the applicants.

| 9      | Brave Warriors,  Our National  Soul Memorial  Calendar                           | In order to help fellow citizens and the international community recognize the true  history of the War of Resistance against Japan, we have created a Memorial Calendar  commemorating the 70th Anniversary of Victory in the War of Resistance against Japan  and Taiwan Retrocession based on the theme of Brave Warriors, Our National Soul. The  Calendar was produced based upon the 4-point guidelines from President Ma Ying-jeou  to provide a series of photographs, pictures and texts of historical remains and sites where  important battles of the War of Resistance took place. To date, a total of 21,000 Chinese  language copies and 4,000 English copies have been printed and made available to the  public (including those in Mainland China). The Calendars are also well-received by  government departments such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Overseas Community  Affairs Council and Ministry of Education. |               |

Its main purpose  is to research and design means of establishing combat capacities  in order to support national strategies and achieve maximum  probability of success and beneficial results once military  objectives have been attained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 38     | Soft power                                    | Soft power is a theory proposed by Professor Joseph Samuel  Nye, Jr. of Harvard University and refers to a third power shown  by a country in addition to its economic and military power. Soft  power is mainly concerned with cultural aspects, political values,  policies, ideology, public opinions and other types of influences. (1) Innovative / Asymmetric Capability refers to establishing  an ability to unleash decisive strikes on hostile military  operational centers and key weaknesses. During the  establishing process, it is expected to work together with  existing and projected basic military power of the Army,  Navy, and Air Force, using innovative strategies and tactics  to strike at enemy weaknesses or suppress their strengths in  order to counter enemy incursions and effectively achieve the  missions set forth for defensive warfare. (2) Asymmetric capability of the ROC Armed Forces refers to  military capabilities other than those of the Army, Navy,  or Air Force. Such capabilities are employed in a flexible  fashion in order to maximize the country's relative advantages  to suppress enemy's operational capabilities or activities, thus  giving our forces more operational freedom and achieving  victory for our military operations. |
