**Abstract**
The Government Security and Defence Policy Report 2009 provides a comprehensive evaluation
of Finnish security and defence policy and lays down guidelines for the future extending into the
latter half of the 2010s.

The Report is based on the comprehensive concept of security. In an interdependent world many
security challenges and threats have far-reaching transnational impacts. Traditional security
policy instruments and military defence alone will not suffi ce to respond to them but fresh
approaches are also needed.

In the Report, an overview of the international situation is followed by an appraisal of how
its changes affect Finland. Based on this overview, the Report provides guidelines for security
and defence policy together with development needs and proposals for practical measures.
The Report lays a foundation for all reports, strategies and programmes that the Government
prepares on security and international relations.

### INTRODUCTION

The Government´s Security and Defence Policy Report 2009 is the latest in the
series of Government Reports issued on the subject. The Report provides a
comprehensive evaluation of Finnish security and defence policy and guidelines
for the future extending into the latter half of the 2010s.

The Report begins with an overview of the international situation, followed by
an appraisal of how its changes affect Finland. These are followed by guidelines
for security and defence policy. The fi nal chapter shows how these guidelines
will be implemented to improve Finland’s security.

Traditionally, security policy provides the means through which states respond to
military or political threats. Security generally refers to the general preconditions
for survival, whether it is a question of the sovereignty of the state and its
decision-making authority, the life of the individual or the cultural distinctness
of a population group. In addition to state-centred security inseparable from
sovereignty, security often refers to common or human security.

The comprehensive concept of security comprises security issues which, if
exacerbated, may turn into threats that can jeopardise or seriously harm
Finland, Finns or the functions vital to Finnish society. Wide-ranging threats
include premeditated action such as armed aggression, terrorism or network
interference. They can also occur spontaneously, such as widespread failures
of the electric grid or extreme forces of nature.

The threat scenarios for the functions vital to society have been devised with
the comprehensive concept of security in mind and provide the basis for our
emergency planning.

In an interdependent world many security challenges and threats have farreaching transnational impacts. Traditional security policy instruments and
military defence alone will not suffi ce; fresh approaches are also needed in
order to respond to them. Security threats are typically diffi cult to foresee
and provide little early warning. Therefore, in addition to preparedness and
response capabilities, attention must be paid to prevention and securitybuilding measures.

The Report also deals with global questions such as climate change, scarcity of
energy and water resources and population movements. By defi nition, these
do not constitute security threats per se to Finland but, if left unchecked, could

cause widespread destruction or destabilise societies and escalate into violent
confl icts, thereby adversely impacting security.

At the same time it is important to keep in mind that the use of military force
for the attainment of political goals is still a possibility. This too is refl ected in
the assessment of Finland’s security environment.

This Report lays a foundation for all reports, strategies and programmes
that the Government prepares on security and international relations. These
include, inter alia, the Strategy for Securing the Functions Vital to Society and
the Internal Security Programme, Government Report to Parliament on the
Human Rights Policy of Finland, EU-related reports, the Development Policy
Programme and the National Strategy for Civilian Crisis Management, the
Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Defence as well as the UN Strategy.

Finland’s most important foreign, security and defence policy goals are
safeguarding the country’s independence and territorial sovereignty,
guaranteeing the basic values, security and well-being of the population and
maintaining a functioning society.

Finland’s security is closely linked with international developments. Finland
shoulders its share of responsibility for fi nding solutions to global problems
and endeavours to improve the capability of the international community to
respond to threats.

Membership of the European Union is an integral element of Finland’s security
policy. It is in Finland’s interest to strengthen the EU’s international role and
the security of the Union. The European Security Strategy defi nes the Union’s
security policy challenges and objectives.

EU membership has opened up new opportunities for Finland to infl uence
the security environment in its immediate surroundings. On the other hand,
membership also obligates Finland to participate in the handling of questions
which, according to traditional security policy thinking, did not necessarily
belong to Finland’s priorities.

The European Union responds to security policy challenges comprehensively,
by using the instruments at its disposal as effectively as possible.

Related to this Report the Ministry for Foreign Affairs prepared a Report on
the Effects of Finland’s possible NATO membership (12/2007) as well as a
report on the mutual assistance obligation in the Treaty on European Union
(4/2008).

The Parliamentary Monitoring Group, appointed by the Prime Minister’s Offi ce,
made its Report (8/2008) available to the Government as this Report was
being fi nalised.

### 1 INTERNATIONAL SECURITY DEVELOPMENTS

#### The global economy

The global environment is characterised by deepening fi nancial integration
and rapid movement of capital. Rising living standards have often contributed
to political stability. The emerging economies of Asia are more explicitly than
before becoming the key engines of global economic growth.

Global economic growth has not only boosted economic activity, it has also
fostered interdependence. The economy is now more vulnerable to various
disturbances and fi nancial crises.

The impact of globalisation has been uneven and the gap between
industrial nations and developing countries remains signifi cant. Economic
underdevelopment increases the risk of political instability. Global phenomena
such as the worldwide fl uctuations in the price of food, cause the gravest
consequences to poor countries in which food crises bring about human
suffering and may also lead to instability and confl icts.

The turbulence which began in the US fi nancial markets in the summer of
2007 is a recent example of this. In the autumn of 2008 the turmoil grew,
triggering a global fi nancial crisis which has threatened to paralyse the normal
functioning of the international fi nancing system and is leading into the worst
fi nancial crisis since the Second World War.

The crisis is rapidly spreading to the real economy. In particular, the United
States and Europe are on the brink of a recession, the depth and length of
which is diffi cult to predict. Even the possibility of a deep depression cannot
be ruled out.

All of the security impacts of the crisis have not yet emerged. The crisis has
given rise to debate and, to some extent, even measures that point to the
strengthening of national interests and the compromising of arrangements
already agreed between states. Protectionist tones will probably gain
momentum. The crisis will also result in a major international redistribution of
wealth, causing serious problems for many countries.

This development will inevitably generate new international tension, weakening
the position of small states in relation to major powers. On the other hand,

12


-----

the international developments will generate the need to expand and reform
cooperation and the rules of international cooperation. Furthermore, there is
now widespread interest in reforming the very foundations of the international
monetary management system, the so-called Bretton Woods system. Some
countries seem to be again interested in the membership of the European
Union and the Economic and Monetary Union.

#### Technology and vital functions

Globally operating corporations and networks improve the security of society’s
information and communications systems, but at the same time also increase
interdependence. They facilitate alternative modes of operation and enable
fl exible solutions to various disturbances and crises. Moreover, decentralised
cross-border systems can act as backups for each other in certain conditions. This,
however, calls for far-reaching cooperation in multinational preparedness.

Technological development spawns new security solutions. Among other
things, technology enables the use of effi cient early-warning and information
exchange systems on a global scale. Nearly all vital functions and services of
society rely on technical systems, which in turn depend on the availability of
electricity and telecommunications.

As wireless data transfer in information and communications technology
systems becomes more common, accessibility improves. On the other hand,
this may degrade reliability. Most private and public services depend on fast
and reliable electronic systems.

Networking may also increase the risk of a domino effect: if one system
crashes it could impinge upon other technical systems. Such disturbances
can signifi cantly impact society’s functions. The outsourcing of maintenance
and service experts intensifi es the consequences of malfunctions. Moreover,
increased foreign ownership of businesses affects the way preparedness is
organised.

The rising cost of technology is particularly evident in the procurement of
defence materiel, with prices estimated at doubling every seven years.

Scientifi c and technological development also creates new security challenges,
especially those associated with possible abuses of technology, expertise
and skills in the manufacture of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear
weapons.

#### Crises and confl icts

Crises and armed confl icts after the turn of the century have for the most
part been contained within national boundaries. From time to time long-term
tensions between states have escalated into cross-border confl icts, mainly in
the Middle East and Africa.

Confl icts have become increasingly asymmetrical in nature, involving
progressively more non-state groupings. Violence and terror against the civilian
population is widely used as an instrument of war.

The majority of the security threats to Western nations originate in the region
spanning North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and Southeast Asia. The
situation in the Middle East remains volatile. Afghanistan and Iraq remain
the key challenges for the international community. As regards Afghanistan,
various actors, including the European Union and NATO, are trying to fi nd
better solutions for stabilising the nation. The possibility of a crisis involving
Iran or Pakistan is on the rise. Iran’s possible nuclear weapon ambitions are of
particular concern.

Personality cults, concentration of power in the centre and corruption continue
to characterise Central Asian states. The possibility of clan warfare, tribal and
local confl icts, religious extremism and organised crime as well as traffi cking
in humans, narcotics and arms all threaten the stability of the countries in the
region.

Armed confl icts between states are also possible in Europe. For example, in the
Balkans and the Caucasus political tensions, often involving ethnic minorities,
surfaced in the wake of the demise of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union,
respectively. In the Caucasus, disputes concerning the status of NagornoKarabakh, South Ossetia and Abkhazia have resulted in armed confl ict in recent
years. The most serious risk of escalation arose from the confl ict between
Georgia and Russia in August 2008.

In addition to political and economic grievances, historical reasons as well as
ethnic and religious tensions often lie behind confl icts. Confl icts are frequently
fanned by the illicit arms trade, easy access to weapons and disputes involving
control over natural resources. Time and again security challenges are linked
with a lack of development, manifested in poverty and inequality, as well as
other shortcomings in the respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of
law. Cross-border crime, such as the narcotics trade and human traffi cking, is
on the increase both regionally and globally.

Corruption, poor governance, discrimination and abuse of power destroy
people’s trust in the authorities. They are also often the root causes of increasing
lawlessness and the strengthening of extremism. Turmoil in society especially
exposes fragile states to politico-economic tensions which may result in acts
of violence.

Correspondingly, the infusion of religion into politics has often expanded the
divide between states and communities. There is a clear need to strengthen
the dialogue between religions and cultures.

Large numbers of unemployed young people and authoritarian political systems
have turned several developing countries into powder kegs. Fragile states are
either incapable or unwilling to carry out their fundamental tasks: ensuring
security, establishing and maintaining legitimate political institutions, furthering
economic development and providing basic services to their citizens. This may
destabilise a region and escalate into confl icts between states through, for
example, uncontrolled migratory fl ows and increased human displacement.

The most vulnerable groups bear the heaviest burden in confl icts. It is important
to acknowledge the status of women and guarantee their participation in
confl ict prevention and peacebuilding. Attacks on the civilian population,
including sexual and other forms of violence against women and children, are
increasingly becoming an element of terror campaigns against civilians and
warfare. Children are abducted and forcibly recruited to serve as combatants.
No-one has been able to stem the rising tide of child combatants.

**The confl ict in Gaza**

After the withdrawal of Israel from the Gaza Strip in 2005, and despite
short-lived ceasefi res, Hamas and other extremist organisations
continued to launch rockets into Israel.

Hamas won the Palestinian Legislative Council election in January
2006 and formed a government on its own. In the spring of 2007
Hamas and Fatah managed to form the Palestinian National Unity
Government. However, in June 2007 Hamas staged a violent takeover
of the Gaza Strip, resulting in a signifi cant increase of rocket strikes
against Israel. Israel closed all border crossing points to the Gaza
Strip, permitting only humanitarian aid as well as electricity, fuel
and water supplies to reach Gaza. The Rafah border crossing point
between the Gaza Strip and Egypt remained closed.

15


-----

When Hamas announced that they did not intend to renew the six
month ceasefi re signed with Israel in June 2008, the Israel-Hamas
confl ict in Gaza reached a fl ashpoint in December 2008. Following the
announcement, rocket fi re into Israel intensifi ed. The Israeli Air Force
began the strikes against Gaza on 27 December 2008. The Operation
Cast Lead became the largest military operation in the Gaza Strip
since the war of 1967. On Saturday, 2 December 2009, the operation
escalated into an invasion on the ground as well.

Israel stated that its objective was to strike the military infrastructure
of Hamas, the smuggling tunnels on the Gaza-Egypt border as well as
Hamas’ ministries. Israel held overwhelming military superiority over
Hamas and the other Palestinian extremist organisations. This was
also refl ected in the number of casualties. By the time ceasefi re was
declared on 18 January 2009, over one thousand Palestinians had lost
their lives and approximately 5,000 were injured. Thirteen Israelites
were killed and about 100 were injured.

Displacement of people and population movements are the most tangible
consequences of confl icts and crises. While they can be felt on the global
level, the heaviest burden falls on neighbouring countries and regions that
receive the so-called internally displaced persons. Refugees are rarely afforded
their basic rights, and it is a diffi cult challenge to return them to their homes.
Confl icts also precipitate the breakout and spread of infectious diseases and
epidemics.

Because of the new forms of armed crises and confl icts as well as new wideranging security challenges, high expectations are placed on the international
system and actors, such as the UN and other international organisations.

Intervening in armed confl icts and responding to new security threats require
new modes of operation and better cooperation. The UN relies on regional
organisations in its expanding peacekeeping activities. The European Union
and NATO are becoming more important in executing crisis management
operations, thus improving the crisis intervention capability of the international
community. African organisations, too, are developing their crisis management
capabilities. The African Union, right after the UN, is the second largest
implementer of military crisis management operations in Africa.

16

In addition to humanitarian aid and development assistance, both military
and civilian crisis management are required in confl icts such as Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Afghanistan, Kosovo and crisis areas in Africa. While military and
civilian crisis management employ different but complementary instruments,
they share the objective of creating a safe and functioning society. The focus
is on a comprehensive approach. One can also respond to changing needs by
improving the rapid reaction capability in crisis situations

**The crisis in Georgia**

During the summer of 2008 the frozen confl icts in South Ossetia
and Abkhazia reached a fl ashpoint. Both confl ict areas witnessed a
number of provocations resulting in localised fi ghting and deaths.

On 7 August 2008 Georgian troops launched large-scale military
action with the objective of restoring ‘constitutional order’ in the
region. Georgia used light infantry, special forces and artillery in its
campaign.

On 8 August 2008 Russian troops launched an attack which extended
deep into Georgia, beyond the crisis area proper. In addition to
the troops of the North Caucasus Military District, units from other
military districts were also concentrated in the area. Airborne troops
as well as motorised-infantry and naval infantry units were used in
the operation. In addition to these, special forces, strategic airlift and
Black Sea Fleet assets were in use.

The Russian land forces which were concentrated in the area pushed
through South-Ossetia and Abkhazia deeper into Georgia. The air
force and the naval air force bombed targets in Gori and Tbilisi,
among other places. The Russian navy prevented Georgia from using
its navy in the Black Sea. Georgia’s defences soon collapsed.

Russia carried out the invasion as an all services’ joint operation
in which the air force played a major role. The land forces in the
area rapidly occupied both South Ossetia and Abkhazia while the air
force provided support by engaging Georgia’s army as well as its key
defences. Russia’s navy blocked sea transports to Georgia from the
Black Sea and destroyed several Georgian navy vessels.

The confl ict entailed hostile rhetoric and propaganda from both sides.
Russia’s military action during the Georgian crisis demonstrated that
its army, navy and air force are operationally ready and capable
of rapidly launching a military operation. Russian troops were well
trained for local conditions; they had good situational awareness and
they were capable of information and network-centric warfare. The
events also revealed operational shortcomings, such as the ones in
Russia’s command and control system and the lacking night vision
capabilities of the army and the air force.

#### The use of military force

Military force is still used as an instrument in confl icts between states and in
internal crises. However, the aim of the use of force may well be, in addition to
the traditional objective of occupation of territory, the defence of the values of
the international community or even humanitarian purposes. When it comes to
the tasks and development of the armed forces of the West, especially those
of EU Member States, military crisis management and support of the civilian
authorities are highlighted in countering wide-ranging security threats.

The state between war and peace is increasingly nebulous. Characteristic of
the so-called grey zone is intimidation by threatening to use armed aggression
or applying the limited use of military force as a means of pressure. This phase
also includes political and economic pressure as well as various means of
information warfare and asymmetric warfare, such as cyber attacks, with the
intention of disturbing the normal functions of society. Technological advances
provide new instruments and means to asymmetric warfare, such as miniature
nuclear weapons.

New technologies and tactics are transforming warfare. Speed, tempo, mobility,
situational awareness, dimension of effects and the exploitation of space are
increasingly gaining importance. Information warfare and cooperation between
various actors increase. Network-centricity increases in step with the growing
volume of information and its relevance.

Accuracy and the rate of fi re are improving, which makes it easier to eliminate
heavy and slow-moving or fi xed formations than before.

#### Weapons of mass destruction and arms control

Multilateral arms control and disarmament efforts are challenging at present,
which refl ects the overall status of international relations. Tensions between
country groupings hamper progress with regard to multilateral arms control
questions. Arms control is increasingly linked with other confl ict prevention and
crisis management methods as well as development issues in a larger sense. In
addition to national security considerations, the signifi cance of human security
is emphasised.

In addition to new treaties and forms of collaboration, the effective
implementation of existing treaty regimes and other multilateral arrangements
is gaining importance. The United States and Russia are about to start
negotiations on the continuance of the START Treaty. There is a need to
compensate for the absence of formal verifi cation regimes by implementing
confi dence-building measures.

The threat of proliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD)
remains a key security problem at the global level. There are particular risks
associated with WMDs controlled by unstable regimes as well as WMDs and
related material ending up in the hands of non-state actors.

International export control cooperation is being intensifi ed. The European
Union is harmonising defence materiel export practices and instituting rules for
internal transfers of defence materiel. In addition to traditional export control,
the intensifying areas of international export cooperation include the control of
brokering activities as well as arms transport inspections.

The use of nuclear energy is on the increase. This highlights the role of the
International Atomic Energy Agency in monitoring nuclear safety and fi ssionable
material safeguards as well as in anti-proliferation efforts.

The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), long regarded
as the cornerstone of the international arms control regime, is being put to the
test. India, Pakistan and Israel still choose to remain outside the treaty and
North Korea’s and Iran’s violations of the treaty weaken the control regime.
Even though the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) is not expected to
enter into force in the foreseeable future, monitoring and information exchange
arrangements are already being implemented. Increasing terrorism-related
threats may bring forth new dynamism and political will to nuclear arms control
and disarmament.

19


-----

Rapid scientifi c and technological advances pose new challenges for the
prevention of proliferation of biological and chemical weapons. There is a growing
need to respond to the threats through national and international action. The
increasing biological threats are not only countered by traditional arms control
measures; they are also tackled by other means, such as those included in
the International Health Regulation of the World Health Organization and the
European Commission’s Green Paper on bio-preparedness. The destruction of
chemical weapon stockpiles, pursuant to the Chemical Weapons Convention,
is lagging behind the agreed schedule.

Progress has been made in arms control, especially, in questions related to
conventional weapons. Smuggling and the illicit small arms trade contribute
to the escalation of regional confl icts. The idea of an International Arms Trade
Treaty has been proposed to mitigate the destabilising effects of the legal arms
trade.

Cluster munitions remain in the spotlight of international attention. As a result
of the Oslo Convention, most Western nations will institute a ban on cluster
munitions. It is estimated that approximately ten per cent of the world’s cluster
munitions will be affected by the Convention. In order to protect civilians from
their harmful effects, special attention must be paid to such limitations which
the most important user states of cluster munitions are willing to accept.

The Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel mines has been widely
implemented. Mine clearance, humanitarian mine action, disposal of explosive
remnants of war as well as destruction of stockpiles, as laid down in the
Convention, remain topical challenges.

Russia has instituted a moratorium on the Treaty on Conventional Armed
Forces in Europe (CFE). This has diminished the predictability of military
activities. Efforts are also being made to use the confi dence and securitybuilding measures developed by the OSCE as models for outside of Europe.
The objective is to promote transparency of military activity and confi dence
between states.

It is indispensable for the future of multilateral treaty regimes that the Geneva
Conference on Disarmament restart negotiations after a hiatus of several
years. One possible theme could be a ban on the production of fi ssile material.
If the traditional UN-led negotiation system cannot meet its expectations, it
is possible that single-issue talks, such as the Ottawa and Oslo processes,
become more common.

20


-----

The European Union shall retain a strong role in the entire arms control sector.
The Union develops its active arms control efforts on the basis of the EU
Strategy against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and the
SALW Strategy (EU Strategy to combat illicit accumulation and traffi cking of
small arms and light weapons and their ammunition).

#### Terrorism

International terrorism is a long-term threat, the hub of which is extremist
terrorism. The Internet is also a tool for promoting radicalisation and terrorist
recruitment. Suicide terrorism is a commonplace modus operandi. Terrorist
organisations resort increasingly to fundraising methods typical of volume
crime.

Most terrorist attacks are still carried out by improvised explosive devices.
However, the use of chemical, biological, radiological or other hazardous
substances in terrorist attacks is a serious threat. In the security strategies of
the United States, Russia, the European Union and NATO, the combination of
terrorism and WMDs is considered to be the most serious security threat.

In addition to being a staging area of terrorism, Europe has also become a
target of terrorism. The most dangerous groups, individual cells and persons
in Europe are the ones that are ideologically associated with the Al Qaeda.
It is extremely diffi cult to anticipate their action. Reports of planned terrorist
attacks or those prevented in the nick of time have come, for example, from
the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark and Belgium.

International counter-terrorism cooperation is expanding and becoming
more versatile. The network of anti-terrorist treaties, sanctions regimes and
technical assistance programmes are being further developed. The increasingly
destructive nature of international terrorism underscores the vital importance
of preventive action. The United Nations General Assembly adopted a Global
Counter-Terrorism Strategy in the autumn of 2006. The key points of the strategy
include, among other things, respect for human rights and addressing the root
causes of terrorism. The root causes include, inter alia, prolonged unresolved
confl icts, violations of basic human rights, poverty and social exclusion.

The prevention of radicalisation and terrorism recruitment is a huge challenge.
In 2005 the European Union adopted the Strategy for Combating Radicalisation
and Recruitment to Terrorism and the accompanying Action Plan. As laid out in
the strategy, the Union aims to respond to terrorist networks and recruitment
and promote moderate views against the messages of extremist elements.

21


-----

The strategy’s core message is that security, justice, democracy and equal
opportunities must be guaranteed.

#### Human rights, democracy and the rule of law

Widespread violations of human rights, the absence of democracy and the rule
of law as well as social inequality increase instability and cause confl icts.

The changing nature of confl icts, internal confl icts and asymmetrical warfare
highlight the threats to the civilian population. It is vital to assist and defend
the rights of those in distress and vulnerable.

Moreover, internal large-scale atrocities against the civilian population are
seen as a threat to international peace and security. In 2005 the UN General
Assembly adopted the responsibility to protect (R2P) principle, under which
the international community should consider intervention if the national
authorities are incapable or unwilling to protect their populations, or if the
authorities themselves are the cause of the humanitarian disaster. Nevertheless,
international law does not recognise the legitimacy of humanitarian intervention
without a Security Council mandate.

In order to protect civilian populations and combat the most serious international
crimes, state actors must improve the monitoring of compliance with
international obligations. As far as individuals are concerned, mechanisms are
needed to ensure that personal criminal liability is enforced. The International
Criminal Court plays a central role in this.

#### Infectious diseases

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) the probability of an
infl uenza pandemic, such as the avian infl uenza, is now greater than ever
since 1969. While the WHO recommended that its Member States prepare for
a pandemic, it is impossible to anticipate when one might break out or how
severe its consequences might be. Thus far avian infl uenza has not been found
to be easily transmissible among humans.

The mobility of humans, animals and foodstuffs increases the risk of epidemics.
Climate change may spread diseases to areas in which they were hitherto
unknown. It can also be expected that new infectious diseases like SARS as
well as known mutating pathogens such as the infl uenza A virus may cause
rapidly spreading pandemics. These can jeopardise the vital functions of
society, causing signifi cant long-term damage to national economies.

22


-----

Intentionally spread and possibly genetically engineered pathogens may
constitute a more wide-ranging threat in the future.

#### Long-term global trends

 Climate change and the environment

The rate and intensity of climate change has proved diffi cult to forecast.
Whereas some changes are immediate, others occur in the medium or even
extremely long term. While the problem is global, its local effects vary a great
deal.

Without determined action global warming is inevitable. The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change has estimated that the climate should not warm more
than two degrees centigrade compared to the pre-industrial era levels so as
not to put the earth and mankind at risk. To prevent this from happening the
growth of global greenhouse gas emissions should be halted within the next
10–15 years and emissions cut by well over half by 2050.

The Bali climate conference in 2007 launched negotiations on a new international
agreement for the post-2012 period. All states participate in the talks. The aim
is to bring the negotiations to a conclusion at the 2009 climate conference in
Copenhagen.

The environmental effects of climate change are closely associated with
poverty and may seriously harm states that are already fragile. Climate change
may also signifi cantly compound the consequences of natural disasters and
confl icts as well as the global redistribution of resources. It also impacts food
production and access to freshwater resources.

Due to drought and desertifi cation, climate change may cause mass migrations
and extensive immigration in the long term. This would result in increased
instability in already volatile border regions and large changes in the ethnic
makeup, more unequal population distributions among states as well as
humanitarian crises. This could immediately impact Europe in the form of
increased migration fl ows from North Africa.

Environmental and natural resource issues may also spawn confl icts that could
contain military dimensions. If one nation were to contaminate the area of

23


-----

its neighbour, cross-border pollution could create tensions between states.
Water rights in border areas could also become a point of contention. Confl icts
damage the environment as well.

On the one hand, climate change improves access to oil and gas reserves as
the receding sea ice opens up transport corridors in Arctic regions. On the
other hand, it also increases the likelihood of disputes over rights to these
resources.

#### Energy and competition for natural resources

The growing need for energy and the impact of fl uctuating commodity
prices on the world economy are important factors that steer global politics.
Consumption is growing extremely rapidly in developing countries such as
China and India. International competition for energy is intensifying. Energy
issues are ever higher on the foreign and security policy agenda. Energy - its
availability, transit routes and reserves – is being used as an instrument of
political persuasion and pressure.

Oil, coal and natural gas will remain the most important sources of energy
in the coming decades. It takes years to bring new oil and gas fi elds online.
Moreover, investments in infrastructure and logistics are necessary in order to
bring these commodities onto the market. For example, the increasing demand
for oil by emerging economies, such as China and India, as well as its limited
availability may generate considerable economic and political repercussions.

Sixty per cent of the world’s known oil reserves are in the Persian Gulf region,
which increases the strategic importance of the area. Asian countries and,
especially, Japan are the most dependent on Persian Gulf oil.

The importance of energy resources in the Arctic is growing. It is estimated that
the Arctic regions contain 13% of previously untapped oil reserves and 30%
of undiscovered natural gas reserves. The race for the area’s energy resources
is only intensifying. There are also still many unresolved international law
questions which relate to the utilisation of natural resources in the sea bed.

In the long run the consumption and price of oil and natural gas will be
infl uenced by improving energy effi ciency, emission fees and alternatives to
fossil fuels.

The growing price and diminishing availability of oil have increased the
attractiveness of nuclear power and coal. Of the major players the United

24


-----

States, China, India and Russia are intensely stepping up their nuclear power
production. Nuclear power is emerging as a viable option for developing
countries.

The use of coal, which is harmful to both the climate and the environment, is
growing rapidly, particularly, in Asia. Coal reserves are abundant with no sign
of being depleted within the next hundred years. Carbon capture and storage
technologies are feverishly being developed to mitigate climate change.

For the time being, renewable energy sources play but a small role in global
energy policy, but already by the end of the next decade the situation might be
different. The EU has committed itself to increasing the share of renewables in
energy production. In some countries, biofuels have been competing with food
production and will continue to do so, in particular, until the so-called second
generation biofuels enter into production.

#### Democraphic trends

Whereas falling birth rates and demographic ageing are the key population
trends in developed countries, the rapid growth of population, urbanisation
and migratory fl ows are the trends in developing countries. The ageing of
the population may slow down economic growth in developed countries and
increase competition for skilled workers and expertise. The key challenge is
to succeed in the integration of labour migrants in order to prevent social
exclusion and its possible knock-on effects.

The mobility of people, both within the European Union and elsewhere, has
increased. The effects have been mostly positive. Employment and the prospect
of higher wages are often the driving forces behind immigration.

However, regional instability, widespread violations of human rights,
development problems, confl icts and environmental disasters set off real
population movements. The underlying causes often include human suffering,
inequality and gaps in living standards. Population movements may, in turn,
increase instability, fi nancial strain and the risk of epidemics.

It is more diffi cult to forecast migratory trends than natural population growth.
Migratory trends may also have stronger near term impact. Crises and instability
produce unregulated immigration of varying kind. Millions of illegal immigrants
reside in the European Union and its neighbouring countries. The facilitation
of illegal entry is lucrative business for international organised crime. The

25


-----

European Union harmonises measures related to immigration, asylum and
border surveillance.

Organised crime and the grey economy feed on increased freedom of travel.
The growth of human traffi cking is a serious human rights challenge. Poverty,
human rights violations, wars and confl icts are fundamental causes of human
traffi cking in many countries in which it is bred by the demand for cheap labour
and illicit economy associated with prostitution.

#### The European Union

European integration has brought stability and prosperity to the entire continent.
Responding to changing security challenges has been one of the drivers of
integration, and will continue to be one in the future as well. Engaging in The use of military force
extensive external action has made the European Union a more visible and
capable global actor. The Union promotes security and well-being throughout
the world.

Widening and deepening integration remain signifi cant agents of change
in European politics. The Union retains its role as a political and economic
community for its Member States and citizens.

Deeper integration, including the common foreign and security policy,
stabilisation and strengthening of the Euro area as well as the functioning of
the single market and Schengen cooperation, advance the common security
of Member States.

The fi nancial crisis and slower economic growth may negatively impact
solidarity among the Member States and emerge as heightened national
interests and increasing protectionism. On the other hand, the crisis has
already demonstrated that joint action brings the best results.

The Union responds to internal security challenges by promoting the area of
freedom, security and justice. In this area the Union’s priorities include the
consolidation of its citizens’ basic rights, counter-terrorism, issues related to
immigration, a more uniform external border management system, introduction
of new asylum procedures and a strategic approach to combating organised
crime.

Besides strengthening its international role and economic competitiveness, the
European Union sees combating climate change as a key policy objective. The

26


-----

goal is to achieve a new global climate treaty in 2009. The Union addresses
the security policy implications of climate change as part of its internal and
external action.

In order to advance its climate policy objectives the Union has created an
energy policy which among other things also aims to guarantee energy supplies
to its Member States and reduce dependency on imports.

The European Union champions human rights and democracy in its external
action. The Union’s human rights policy calls for, inter alia, the universal
abolition of the death penalty and torture and draws attention to the rights of
women, children and minorities.

The EU’s development policy is of central importance as regards global
development and stability. A wide range of instruments is available to the
Union with which it supports long-term development and reduction of poverty
as well as confl ict prevention and peacebuilding. Ninety per cent of the Union’s
external action funding qualifi es as offi cial development aid.

The diffi culty of reforming the European Union’s Treaties has impeded more
effi cient action. Ever since 2002 the Union has been in the process of reforming
its Treaties, with one of the objectives being increased effi ciency in external
capability and decision-making.

The Treaty of Lisbon was signed in December 2007. Ireland rejected the Treaty
in a referendum in June 2008 and, hence, the question of the Treaty’s entry
into force remains open.

The entry into force of the Treaty would strengthen the Union’s international
role. The EU would, among other things, become a juridical person. A High
Representative would be responsible for conducting the Union´s external
action with the assistance of a European External Action Service. The High
Representative and the External Action Service would foster continuity in the
conduct of the common foreign and security policy.

#### Enlargement and relations with neighbouring countries

The enlargement policy is a key security policy instrument of the European
Union. Previous enlargement rounds have strengthened stability and prosperity
in Europe. In the coming years the main focus of the enlargement policy will be
on the Western Balkans. Negotiations on Turkey’s accession to the European
Union have been ongoing since 2005.

27


-----

The European Union plays a key role in the stabilisation of the Western Balkans.
The essence of its actions is the stabilisation and association process, which
aims for full EU membership once the countries fulfi l the accession criteria.
Croatia is one of the Balkan nations with which the EU is presently conducting
accession talks. Moreover, Macedonia gained candidate country status in 2005.
The EU has also signed stabilisation and association agreements with Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Albania, Montenegro and Serbia. The most pressing challenges
include consolidating the status of Kosovo as well as developing relations with
Serbia on the basis of the stabilisation and association agreement.

Turkey’s EU-membership is believed to increase security and economic
growth in Europe. Turkey’s own ability to implement the reforms required by
membership is one of the challenges in the negotiations. The EU Member
States have reacted to the prospect of Turkey’s membership with varying
degrees of enthusiasm.

By means of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), created in 2004,
the European Union develops its relations with neighbouring countries for
which accession is not a prospect. The policy comprises altogether 15 states,
including Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova as well as the Mediterranean countries
that participate in the Barcelona process.

In the summer of 2008 an agreement was made to intensify cooperation with the
Barcelona process countries through the so-called Union for the Mediterranean.
Its purpose is to encourage all parties in cross-border cooperation projects in
areas such as transport, environmental policy or the economy.

Through the ENP policy the Union intensifi es its cooperation with its eastern
partners and, thus seeks to expand the area of peace and stability built on
common values. The eastern partner countries are Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus,
Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.

The relationship between the European Union and Russia signifi cantly impacts
security development in Europe. The Union has long pursued a new and
comprehensive EU-Russia agreement which strengthens the mutual partnership.
Negotiations on the agreement have started. Economic interdependence
between the parties is strong and contains a distinct energy policy dimension.

The Northern Dimension is common policy involving the European Union,
Russia, Norway and Iceland. It aims to promote economic well-being and
security in Northern Europe. Tangible examples of the Northern Dimension
include investments in an environmental partnership. Cooperation also exists

28


-----

in a social and health partnership as well as transport, logistics and cultural
partnerships.

#### Common Foreign and Security Policy

The range of instruments the European Union uses for external action has
grown and now encompasses political, humanitarian, development, trade
and economic measures as well as military and civilian crisis management.
Political dialogue, declarations, concerted action by the Member States,
common positions and in some cases even sanctions represent key means of
infl uence.

The European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) is an integral part of the
Common Foreign and Security policy (CFSP). Its key features are EU crisis
management operations, along with development of the required capabilities
for these, as well as mutual assistance with regard to terrorism and natural or
man-made disasters.

The European Security Strategy (2003) provides guidelines for the Union’s
security policy-related activities. The Strategy identifi es the following key
security challenges: terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
regional confl icts, state failure and organised crime. The Strategy was updated
in December 2008. The update highlighted a more coherent and consistent use
of the wide range of instruments available to the Union, strengthening of the
ESDP structures as well as the development of the European Neighbourhood
Policy and multilateral cooperation. Renewed interest is focused on cyber
security and energy security as well as climate-related issues.

The Lisbon Treaty would improve the Union’s capabilities in crisis management
and further amalgamate the concert of military and civilian crisis management.
The permanent structured cooperation mechanism is open to all Member States
and it opens up new possibilities to deepen military capabilities cooperation.

**The mutual assistance obligation aims to reinforce solidarity among**
Member States and bolster their commitment to the development of the
ESDP.

If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory,
the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid
and assistance by all the means in their power, in accordance with
Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. This shall not prejudice

29


-----

the specifi c character of the security and defence policy of certain
Member States.

Commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with
commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which,
for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of
their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.
(TEU Article 42(7))

The mutual assistance obligation in the Treaty of Lisbon was analysed in detail
in a report published by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on 10 April 2008.

**The solidarity clause states that the Union and its Member States shall act**
jointly in a spirit of solidarity if a Member State is the object of a terrorist attack
or the victim of a natural or man-made disaster and asks for assistance. On
26 March 2004 the European Council adopted a declaration on solidarity in the
face of terrorism stating that Member States will act, in accordance with the
solidarity clause incorporated in the draft constitutional treaty of Europe, jointly
and in a spirit of solidarity if one of them is the object of a terrorist attack.

**1. The Union and its Member States shall act jointly in a spirit of**
solidarity if a Member State is the object of a terrorist attack or the
victim of a natural or man-made disaster. The Union shall mobilise
all the instruments at its disposal, including the military resources
made available by the Member States, to:

(a)
– prevent the terrorist threat in the territory of the Member
States;
– protect democratic institutions and the civilian population from
any terrorist attack;
– assist a Member State in its territory, at the request of its political
authorities, in the event of a terrorist attack;

(b)
– assist a Member State in its territory, at the request of its political
authorities, in the event of a natural or man-made disaster.

30


-----

**2. Should a Member State be the object of a terrorist attack or the**
victim of a natural or man-made disaster, the other Member States
shall assist it at the request of its political authorities. To that end,
the Member States shall coordinate between themselves in the
Council.

**3. The arrangements for the implementation by the Union of this**
solidarity clause shall be defi ned by a decision adopted by the
Council acting on a joint proposal by the Commission and the
High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security
Policy. The Council shall act in accordance with Article 15b (1) of
the Treaty on European Union where this decision has defence
implications. The European Parliament shall be informed.

For the purposes of this paragraph and without prejudice to Article
207, the Council shall be assisted by the Political and Security
Committee with the support of the structures developed in the
context of the common security and defence policy and by the
Committee referred to in Article 61d; the two committees shall, if
necessary, submit joint opinions.

**4. The European Council shall regularly assess the threats facing the**
Union in order to enable the Union and its Member States to take
effective action. (TFEU Article 222)

Many of the provisions in the Treaty of Lisbon are already common practice.
The European Defence Agency has been founded, crisis management tasks
have been reviewed, rapid response elements have been created and the
solidarity clause is being applied as regards terrorism.

The European Defence Agency (EDA) is tasked to contribute to the development
of military capabilities, to promote armaments cooperation between EU Member
States and support defence research and technology cooperation. The EDA
also contributes to the creation of a competitive European defence equipment
market and strengthens the industrial and technological base of the European
defence sector.

31

#### EU crisis management

The volume and scope of the EU’s crisis management tasks have dramatically
increased in recent years and the Union has improved its military and civilian
crisis management instruments. Crisis management activities are implemented
in parallel with the EU’s other external action, including political and diplomatic
efforts, European Commission action such as Stability Instrument-based
assistance, development cooperation and humanitarian assistance as well
as Member States’ bilateral action. Challenges include the coherence of the
Union’s external action as well as a comprehensive approach.

The basic premise of EU crisis management is mutual commitment, with
Member States providing the necessary capabilities.

The Amsterdam Treaty provided the Union with the competence to execute
military crisis management tasks, the so-called Petersberg tasks which were
updated by the Treaty of Lisbon. The updated Petersberg tasks include joint
disarmament operations, humanitarian and rescue tasks, military advice and
assistance, confl ict prevention and peacekeeping, tasks of combat forces in
crisis management including peacemaking as well as post-confl ict stabilisation.
All of these tasks can be pursued in the fi ght against terrorism, including
support to third parties on their respective territories.

The Union is improving its capability to plan and execute crisis management
operations and is upgrading its crisis management mechanisms. The Council
Secretariat heads the Policy Planning and Early Warning Unit, Situation Centre,
EU Military Staff and the Civilian/Military cell which coordinates with the EUMS.
The planning capability of the European Union military staff is gradually being
reinforced. A planning and staff structure for civilian crisis management has
been established within the Council Secretariat to assist in the planning,
deployment and management of civilian crisis management operations.

The European Union implements a wide variety of crisis management operations.
For the most part they have been independent EU operations. However, the
Union has also conducted two military crisis management operations by relying
on NATO capabilities.

The focus of EU operations has been on civilian crisis management. In
December 2008 there were 3 ongoing military and 11 ongoing civilian EU crisis
management operations. The combined personnel strength in the military
operations was approximately 6,700. With its operations the Union seeks to
support the UN and promote international peace and stability.

32


-----

**Ongoing and completed EU crisis management operations**


33


-----

The European Union has implemented several operations in the Western
Balkans, the Middle East and Africa. In addition, civilian crisis management
operations have been conducted in Georgia on the Ukraine-Moldova border
area, in Aceh, Indonesia as well as in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In the Western Balkans the Union has participated in the stabilisation of
the region through military and civilian crisis management. In Bosnia and
Herzegovina there is an ongoing military operation as well as a civilian operation
with the objective of supporting the restructuring of the police service and
fi ghting organised crime. The civilian crisis management mission in Kosovo is
the largest civilian mission the Union has ever launched, consisting of some
2,000 international experts. The operation focuses on the rule of law and the
police.

Africa is becoming increasingly important in the EU’s crisis management
activities. The newest operation is the anti-piracy campaign off the coast of
Somalia. In addition to its own crisis management operations the European
Union supports the crisis management operations of the African Union by
being its largest donor and a provider of expert assistance.

The European Union is expected to concurrently implement several military
crisis management operations. The EU’s capabilities development process aims
at fi ne-tuning existing capacities for crisis management operations. This is an
integral element in the evolution of the ESDP.

The EU Member States have sizeable military capacities, albeit not perfectly
suited to crisis management operations. According to European Defence
Agency statistics, troops deployed from EU Member States to international
operations (EU, UN, NATO) totalled nearly 78,000 in 2007.

The European Union has improved its rapid response capability as an answer
to continuously evolving crisis management requirements. One EU battle
group is a unit comprising 1,600–2,700 combat troops and must be able to
deploy to the area of operations within 10 days of the Council decision to
launch an operation. The battle groups reached full operational capability in
the beginning of 2007. The Union is developing rapid response capabilities for
the navy and air force as well.

Potential battle group tasks include peace-enforcement operations, confl ict
prevention measures and evacuations in demanding environments as well as
support for humanitarian operations. Most battle groups are multinational.
This cooperation improves the Member States’ interoperability.

34


-----

National capacity building for civilian crisis management aims to identify more
and better qualifi ed experts that the Member States are willing to second to
EU civilian crisis management operations. The objective is to ensure that the
Union is always able to deploy a suffi cient number of highly qualifi ed civilian
crisis management experts to an area of operations on short notice.

The EU’s civilian crisis management rapid response capability is based on Civilian
Response Teams (CRT). A CRT consists of approximately fi ve members who
are intended for deployment to a confl ict area within 5-10 days from a Council
decision to launch a mission. The teams’ tasks encompass, for example, factfi nding and assessment of the area of operations, mission build-up or providing
support for existing EU crisis management activities by introducing additional
expertise.

#### Cooperation between the European Union and other crisis management actors

Typically several international organisations operate in the same crisis area.
These include the United Nations, the European Union, NATO, OSCE, the African
Union and non-governmental organisations. Coordination and harmonisation
of their respective activities is necessary.

In 2003 the European Union and NATO agreed on cooperation under which the
EU may use NATO’s assets and capabilities for EU-led military crisis management
operations, if required. The so-called Berlin+ arrangement has been successfully
employed in Macedonia as well as in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Parallel activities in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Darfur have introduced a new
element into EU-NATO crisis management cooperation. Since the previously
agreed collaboration arrangements do not cover the scope of these activities,
practical cooperation on the ground has been implemented by ad hoc
arrangements. Furthermore, the strengthening of the EU’s security and
defence dimension only highlights the need for new solutions for cooperation.
This, however, is politically diffi cult to achieve because of the dispute between
Turkey and Cyprus.

The European Union and NATO seek to reinforce their concerted planning of
capabilities development. They share the same shortcomings and challenges:
for the most part both organisations tap into the same military resources. The
EU and NATO also organise command post and staff exercises together.

35


-----

Collaboration with the United Nations is fostered on the basis of joint declarations
on UN-EU cooperation, adopted in 2003 and 2007. For example, the EU and
the UN closely cooperated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Also the
multi-sectoral international presence in Chad and the Central African Republic
calls for close cooperation between the organisations.

The Joint Africa-EU Strategy, adopted in December 2007, and the related Action
Plan provide a solid foundation for the strengthening of the partnership in the
area of peace and security. The European Union supports the development of
African crisis management capabilities, for example, by supporting the creation
of an African rapid response force.

#### World order in fl ux

The functioning of the multilateral system has proved to be wanting. Many
multilateral organisations, such as the UN, OSCE, WTO, IMF and the World
Bank have failed to adequately reform themselves in the post-Cold War
era. This has only increased the importance of unoffi cial groupings. Such
unoffi cial structures, such as the G8 or G20 meetings, may identify solutions to
individual problems but they cannot provide any long-term solutions to global
governance.

Climate change and the fi nancial crisis that shakes the very foundations of
the global economy show how vulnerable nation-states are on their own.
Globalisation increases interdependence between states and cross-border
problems cannot be solved without cooperation. The common global security
challenges include the reduction of poverty, climate policy, food crises, crisis
management and prevention of the proliferation of WMDs as well as counterterrorism.

Even if international trends point towards increasing multipolarity, the United
States continues to be the primary political, fi nancial and military operator
in international affairs. Russia’s position depends on whether it manages to
institute economic and social reforms. The rising roles of China and India,
in addition to Japan’s strong status, are fortifying Asia’s role vis-à-vis the
United States and Europe. The strengthening role of the European Union also
highlights the importance of interregional dialogue.

Great-power relations are still extremely important when it comes to
international affairs. Even though armed confl icts between the great powers
are extremely unlikely, power projection capabilities matter a great deal as

regards their relative importance. The great powers have demonstrated that
they are willing and able to use military force in defence of their interest as well
as in strengthening their great-power status.

#### The United States

The United States remains the key political, fi nancial and military superpower.
Its decisions and actions fundamentally shape international security.

Being the largest economy in the world, the United States is also of central
importance to global economic growth. This is visible, for example, through the
immediate effects of the US-originated fi nancial crisis on the world economy.

The United States is the only great power with global interests and the
capability for global power projection. It operates actively in global foreign and
security policy making and its military presence is felt almost everywhere in
the world.

The main pillars of the National Security Strategy of the United States of
America include the promotion of freedom, democracy, justice and human
dignity as well as action to combat cross-border challenges such as terrorism,
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and traffi cking in human
beings. The United States has also been willing to use military force outside its
own territory in advancing its fi nancial and security policy interests.

After the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States national security became the
leitmotif of American security policy. National preparedness and intersectoral
cooperation were improved in the wake of the terrorist attacks and Hurricane
Katrina.

The foreign and security policy of the new administration is still in the making.
High hopes are placed on President Obama. Policy styles and the tone by which
foreign and security policy objectives are stated may change much more than
the essence itself. Nevertheless, the signifi cance of multilateralism in foreign
and security policy may grow.

Terrorism is seen as a long-term global security problem, cultivated by Islamic
extremism and originating in North Africa, the Middle East, the Persian Gulf
and some parts of Asia.

Peace in the Middle East is still a key American foreign policy objective. The
Middle Eastern peace process, as well as responding to the Iranian security

37


-----

threat, is seen as a prerequisite for stability in the entire region. The stabilisation
of Iraq is also directly associated with stability in the Middle East, the onward
march of democracy, the war against terrorism and energy security.

Afghanistan continues to be a major challenge to the United States and the US
is prepared to support Afghanistan for a long time. In addition to Afghanistan,
the stabilisation of Pakistan is also a key American policy objective in southern
Asia.

In Eastern Asia the United States has provided security guarantees to Taiwan.
However, in line with the One China policy, the USA urges Taiwan to avoid
confrontation with mainland China. In order to prevent the proliferation of
nuclear weapons and stabilise Eastern Asia the United States tries to persuade
North Korea to abolish its nuclear programme. The United States cultivates
security cooperation with several Asian countries. Most recently it has improved
its relations with India, for example.

Africa is increasingly important to the United States. The continent is plagued
by abject poverty and instability which, combined, create a fertile environment
for terrorism and extremism. Americans, too, are interested in Africa’s oil
reserves and other natural resources. Proof of this is AFRICOM, the recently
created United States Africa Command.

The United States continues to play a predominant role in the stability of
Europe and the Baltic Sea region. NATO is the key forum as regards US security
cooperation with European countries.

The European Union and its Member States are the most important political,
fi nancial and military partners of the United States. The Union and the United
States also engage in a dialogue on vital international security policy issues. In
addition to multilateral questions these include, particularly, the Middle East,
Afghanistan/Pakistan and Russia. The fi ght against terrorism has expanded the
transatlantic dialogue to justice and home affairs, sanction regimes and the
international law framework of counter-terrorist activities. Climate and energy
questions are also higher on the transatlantic agenda.

In recent years the United States has been critical of the United Nations. The
US approach to multilateral action, international treaties and the justifi cation
for the use of force differs from European practices. The United States has
occasionally been unwilling to commit to such international arrangements that
could limit its future options, such as the Kyoto Treaty or the International
Criminal Court. The United States continues to permit the death penalty.

38


-----

The United States primarily aims to cooperate with its allies and aims to seek
international justifi cation for its use of force. Nevertheless, if national interests
so require, it is prepared to act without an international mandate in certain
cases, alone or within coalitions of willing countries. The pre-emptive use of
force is never ruled out. Still, lessons from the war in Iraq have strengthened
multilateralist trends as well as a comprehensive and preventative approach in
crisis management, which focuses on nation-building.

The personnel strength of the US armed forces is approximately 1.3 million and
the defence budget is approximately USD 560 billion. Central defence policy
guidelines focus on the transformation of the armed forces, the long ‘war on
terrorism’ as well as stabilisation and reconstruction operations in crisis areas.
The purpose of the transformation of the armed forces is to better respond
to homeland defence, the threat posed by WMDs and terrorism. Troops are
developed to be more streamlined and easily deployable. The signifi cance of
intelligence and special forces continues to grow. The United States has built
its own missile defence system.

The importance of allies and partners in defence policy has grown and
cooperation among public authorities is seen as increasingly important. The
United States urges Europe to modernise its armed forces and asks for more
active European participation in crisis management operations.

The areas of responsibility of the US military command structure cover the
entire Earth. There is growing American military interest in the Middle East and
the Pacifi c Ocean and, to some extent, Africa as well.

The Iraq War has put tremendous strain on the personnel and equipment
of the armed forces. On the other hand, the war also improves US military
capabilities and readiness. Since the National Guard and reservists comprise
an increasingly larger share of troop rotations, the consequences of the war
touch deep into society. US troops are expected to remain in Iraq for a long
period to come.

The United States is the world’s largest developer and manufacturer of defence
technology. It invests over fi ve times more in military R&D than the Member
States of the European Union combined.

The United States continues to reduce its military presence in Europe. US
bases will be closed and downsized on other continents as well. Most of the

39


-----

troops remaining in Europe will focus on Eastern and Southeastern Europe. In
the long term there will be 50,000 US troops in Europe, at most. Small staging
and training bases will be set up for the US Army in Poland, Romania and
Bulgaria. The United States plans to deploy parts of its missile defence systems
in the Czech Republic and Poland.

#### Russia

Russia is seeking to restore its great-power status and considers it very
important to alter the decisions of the 1990s, which it deems as unfavourable
to Russia.

The State Duma election in March 2007 as well as the presidential election
in the spring of 2008 sustained continuity in Russia. The restoration of
political and fi nancial stability can be considered President Putin’s biggest
accomplishments.

In recent years, power has been greatly concentrated in the hands of the state
leadership. The Prime Minister’s domestic and foreign policy roles are on the
increase. On the one hand, political stability and the continuity of governance
culminate in the relationship between the State Duma, the Government and
the President and, on the other hand, in securing the status of the fairly large
group of those that are affl uent. A sizable portion of the population desires to
have a strong leader, who would also point the way forward.

Russia is a party to almost every key international human rights convention
and treaty. Nonetheless, human rights and civil liberties in Russia leave much
to be desired.

Russia still has a long way to go in eradicating corruption and guaranteeing the
judiciary’s independence. These problems weaken the citizens’ and business
community’s confi dence in the authorities.

Russian self-esteem has risen along with the country’s strengthening economy
and re-emerging international status. Nationalist rhetoric is commonplace and
the state leadership use the media extensively for the purpose of advancing
their own objectives.

Russia criticises the fact that the OSCE’s activities concentrate on human rights
and democracy. It also strongly objects to the enlargement of NATO to CIS
countries. Russia has recently made a proposal on a new European security
structure.

40


-----

The relationship between the key bodies of Russia and the EU is still in the
making. Russia maintains close bilateral contacts with the largest EU nations
and tries to have a say on which issues are placed on the bilateral agenda
versus the EU-Russia agenda.

Russia and the European Union could cooperate in security affairs like the
peaceful resolution of frozen confl icts, Middle Eastern affairs and counterterrorism. In practice however, cooperation has been virtually nonexistent.

The European Union is Russia’s most important trading partner. More than half
of Russia’s trade takes place with EU countries. Russia and the EU depend very
much on each other, above all, regarding energy.

The Commonwealth of Independent States is the centre of gravity of Russia’s
foreign policy and geography. Collaboration within the CIS is built on bilateral
relations as well as geographical and historical interdependence. There are still
frozen confl icts in Nagorno-Karabakh, Transdniestr, Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
At the same time, Russia has tried to establish regional power groupings, such
as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.

Russia is also prepared to advance its interests by projecting military power
outside its national borders, as demonstrated by the crisis in Georgia in
August 2008. During the crisis Russia did not follow the key principles of the
international community. The crisis may also have knock-on effects on other
frozen confl icts and create new tension in the Russia-Ukraine relationship.

Russia’s discontent with European security affairs largely stems from the
international decisions and events of the 1990s. These include the evolving
role of the OSCE, problems related to the CFE Treaty, NATO enlargement and
the events which ultimately led to the independence of Kosovo. Russia feels
that the positioning of parts of the US missile defence system in the Czech
Republic and Poland is, in reality, aimed at Russia.

Ever since the Chechen Wars, counter-terrorism has been high on the Russian
security policy agenda. After 9/11 Russia defi ned the Chechen War as a war
against terror. The special feature of terrorism in Russia is the fact that it is
homegrown. Most terrorist attacks are associated with the fl ammable situation
in North Caucasus.

Russia’s stability relies on favourable economic growth. The main objectives of
the economic policy are a healthy state economy and robust economic growth.
Lately the state has clearly increased its role in the economy, for example the

41


-----

energy sector. However, the international fi nancial crisis and the plummeting
energy prices paint dark clouds on Russia’s economic outlook as well.

Energy is the keystone of Russia’s economy. Over 60% of export revenue
comes from energy exports and 50% of tax revenue comes from energy and
export taxes. Russia is obviously highly dependent on world market prices. Still,
the energy sector only employs approximately two per cent of the population.
Huge energy resources and an extensive energy transport network increase
Russia’s foreign policy clout as well as its eminence in global energy policy.

The European Union is its most important energy export market. The fact
that Europe is so dependent on Russia might develop into a security risk. It is
not certain that Russia can always deliver enough energy to meet European
demands.

From the standpoint of diversifying the production structure and long-term
economic prospects, it is worrying that the fi nancial reforms which were
implemented in the beginning of this decade have been so sluggish. Energy
production and other infrastructure are in poor condition. Furthermore, due to
the wasteful use of energy, power and natural gas shortages are also included
in Russia’s economic near-term threat scenarios. Energy production costs are
much higher in Russia than, for example, Saudi Arabia. The required large
investments further increase this gap.

In recent years, poverty and the pronounced regional disparity have been
eclipsed by the robust economic growth.

**Russia’s military capacity trends**

The threat scenarios of Russia’s political and military leadership include, among
other things, the hegemonic trends of the United States, increasing Western
economic, political and military presence in Russia´s traditional spheres of
infl uence as well as NATO enlargement. Russia aims to respond to these
threats by maintaining armed forces capable of providing suffi cient deterrence.
Defence development focuses on suffi cient nuclear potential as well as on
qualitative improvements in certain areas.

Russia’s favourable economic growth also facilitates the transformation
of its armed forces. In the coming years Russia plans to invest heavily in
the development and procurement of new defence materiel. Qualitative
improvement is its primary objective. On the whole, Russia’s military capabilities
will improve.

42


-----

Russia’s defence budget has grown throughout this decade. The public defence
budget in 2008 is approximately EUR 28 billion, amounting to 2.6–2.8 per cent
of the GDP. Defence-related items are also included in other administrative
sectors’ budgets, adding a considerable amount to the sum total. Prime Minister
Putin has announced an increase of 27% in the defence budget for this year.

Russia aims to achieve a status in which its capability to exert infl uence in its
security environment parallels its national strength. The main tasks of Russia’s
armed forces include the containment of military and military-political threats
to Russia’s interests and its security, the furthering of fi nancial and political
interests, peacetime military operations (counter-terrorism and peacekeeping
tasks) as well as the use of military force, including a surprise strike, to ensure
security. Russia’s leadership have often stated that Russia, if need be, will use
military force in protecting Russian citizens residing outside of Russia’s national
borders.

The Baltic Sea plays a central role in Russia’s foreign trade. This also has military
and political dimensions. The Kola Peninsula retains, or is even increasing, its
strategic importance to Russia.

Russia’s armed forces are being transformed from a traditional mass army
into a leaner and a more capable military. Once the organisational changes
have been completed the capacity of the armed forces will be developed by
improving the human resources system, weaponry and equipment. Russia is
already organising many more military exercises compared to the lull of the
1990s.

The Russian defence procurement programme for 2007–2015 amounts to
approximately EUR 145 billion. The objective of the programme is to maintain
Russia’s nuclear deterrence and simultaneously improve its conventional armed
forces. The programme aims to replace 45% of the present equipment and
modernise the remaining equipment by 2020. If the programme is fully funded
and serial production begins, Russia’s rearmament programme will be in full
swing in the coming decade.

The push towards fully professional armed forces will continue. However,
personnel problems in the Russian military are considerable. The problems
could also turn into security risks because of, for instance, the illicit arms trade
or illegal smuggling of substances and materials.

When the Soviet Union collapsed, the personnel strength of Russia’s armed
forces was 2.8 million troops. The plan is to reduce its strength to approximately

43


-----

one million troops. New equipment and contractual personnel will be primarily
assigned to high readiness formations in all services. The total number of
army, airborne and naval infantry high readiness divisions and brigades will be
approximately twenty. They include professional personnel as well as modern
equipment and weaponry.

#### China

China’s present international role is strengthened by the fact that it is the
fourth largest, rapidly expanding economy in the world with 1.3 billion
inhabitants. China is a nuclear power and a permanent member of the UN
Security Council.

China’s foreign policy has been fairly moderate, emphasising national
sovereignty and non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs. The key
exceptions to the rule have been questions related to the One China policy and
China’s territorial integrity.

China strongly objects to Taiwan’s pursuit of independence, even to the point of
hinting at the possibility of using military force to counter this. China’s military
potential expansion is thought to be linked, to a large extent, to the situation
in the Taiwan Strait. On the one hand, Western countries have told China that
the use of force as a solution to the situation with Taiwan is completely out of
the question. At the same time, by following the One China policy they have
persuaded Taiwan to refrain from provocative, independence-minded action.

A hallmark of China’s international role is the high demand for energy and raw
materials caused by its strong economic growth. China operates actively on
several continents in order to secure access to the raw materials and energy
necessary for its economic growth and stability. By doing so, it has also been
criticised for having supported questionable regimes in countries which are
unstable, yet rich in natural resources. China has also been criticised for
ignoring development policy principles in its activities in Africa.

In response to this criticism, China has begun to participate somewhat more
in the international community’s efforts to resolve diffi cult situations and
crises in countries like North Korea, Sudan and Myanmar. Simultaneously, it
has tried to meet this challenge by being a partner with the West, seeking
peaceful resolutions for international problems. This development will probably
continue, albeit in a more restricted manner than what the EU or the United
States would like to see.

44


-----

China’s march towards a free-market economy has thus far not transformed it
into a democracy. Progress in civil society lags far behind fi nancial reforms. Even
though advances in certain areas of civil society have even been encouraged,
activism critical of the party or powers that be is still not tolerated. The most
worrisome developments involve China’s human rights situation, control of the
media and continued censorship, despite the country’s rapid modernisation.
China regards human rights as being a national issue. The European Union is
engaging China in an ongoing dialogue over human rights issues.

As it is increasingly interlinked with international fi nancial structures, China,
like developed economies, has become more dependent on economic realities
and, accordingly, on Western markets. The EU area and the United States are
its most important trading partners as well as being major investors in China.
The fl ip side is that China plays a key role in international fi nances with its
large foreign currency reserves and investments. This, in turn, generates more
dependency on the part of the other side. It remains to be seen what role
China shall adopt in the fi ght against climate change. Nevertheless, it will be
one of global importance.

China is deliberately increasing its investments in the transformation and
improvement of its armed forces. This has resulted in the intensifi cation of
security cooperation and contacts with certain key Asian and Pacifi c countries,
including the United States.

At present, China is not challenging the military position of the United States
nor the stability in the area of the Pacifi c Ocean. However, the possibility of
escalation in the Taiwan Strait must be kept in mind. China’s power projection
capacity, in spite of its naval and space technology investments, is still limited
to regional operations.

#### The United Nations

The three pillars of United Nations activities are peace and security, development
and poverty reduction and human rights and democracy.

The United Nations has maintained its position in the international community
as the key norm setter, negotiating forum, actor, and guardian of international
law for the international community. The UN plays a signifi cant role in the
management of globalisation and in developing a comprehensive humanity
policy. The UN and especially its Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary
bodies as well as specialised UN agencies continue to play a major role in
promoting higher living standards, full employment and economic and social

45


-----

questions, as sustainable development is the most effective means of confl ict
prevention. The UN Millennium Declaration and its Millennium Development
Goals are crucial to realising these objectives.

In a globalising world, the UN agenda is crowded with new cross-border threats
such as climate change, international terrorism, organised crime, infectious
diseases, energy and food security as well as uncontrolled migratory fl ows.

Human rights are part and parcel of the comprehensive concept of security and
the realisation of human security. In addition, strengthening the rule of law in
international relations in general and in post-confl ict societies in particular is
a considerable challenge to the UN. An especially diffi cult challenge has to do
with building consensus among Member States on how to respond to global
challenges. At the same time, the UN must reform its own structures to meet
the requirements of a changing environment.

Comprehensive UN reform, vital for its capacity to act and its credibility, is
hampered by the confl icting interests of Member States. Industrials states,
which also carry the biggest burden of funding the organisation, are ready to
enact far-reaching and deep reforms. Developing countries, on the other hand,
are slowing down the reforms because they fear these could weaken the UN
as a development organisation.

This North-South confrontation manifests itself on many political issues, and
is often linked to state sovereignty and the responsibility of states to protect
their own citizens. The responsibility to protect was indirectly addressed by the
Security Council in its discussions about the situations in Kosovo, Darfur and
Myanmar.

United Nations activities refl ect the broad balance of international power at
any one time. China’s growing economic and political infl uence has also had an
impact on the UN. The role of the European Union in the UN has also become
more infl uential in recent years.

The UN is an environment where individual Member States of the European
Union  often actively pursue their national interests in addition to the agreed
common line. The European External Action Service, which the Lisbon Treaty
would create, could be expected to streamline common action in the UN as
well. Enhanced cooperation particularly in the Security Council would serve
to strengthen the Union’s common foreign and security policy vis-à-vis third
parties.

46


-----

**The UN Security Council**

The United Nations Security Council has primary responsibility for international
peace and security and its resolutions are legally binding. Even though the
Council deals primarily with individual crises, in recent years it has also included
broader themes of peace and security on its agenda.

The Security Council will probably retain its international signifi cance in the
future. The present permanent members will see to this because they share a
common interest in maintaining their special status. The Council’s effectiveness
and capability to act, however, vary depending on the issue at hand and the
state of great-power relations.

As far as the permanent members are concerned, the composition of the
Security Council has not changed since the end of the Second World War.
There have been attempts to reform its membership and working methods.
The goal of the reform is to create a more effi cient and globally representative
Security Council.

The principle of rotation followed among the Nordic countries ensures that one
of the fi ve is more or less constantly campaigning for a seat on the Security
Council. Finland is a candidate for a non-permanent seat for the 2013-14
term.

**UN crisis management**

Various crises in Africa have increased the volume of UN crisis management
activities signifi cantly. At present the UN runs 16 peacekeeping operations
and two political operations. They comprise 112,000 military and civilian
personnel, approximately 90,000 of whom are uniformed peacekeepers,
military observers and police. The total number of personnel is on the rise. In
addition, the European Union, the OSCE and NATO as well as the African Union
can implement UN-mandated crisis management operations.

The nature of UN crisis management has changed in many ways. Developing
countries are the largest troop contributors. The comprehensive UN approach
spans the spectrum of crisis management from confl ict prevention to postconfl ict reconstruction. UN missions engage in both traditional peacekeeping
and civilian crisis management.

The UN seeks to improve its early-warning capabilities particularly by enhancing
both preventive diplomacy and its regional presence. It has been diffi cult

47


-----

**Ongoing United Nations military and civilian operations**

48


-----

nonetheless to obtain political support for strengthening the structures needed
for preventive action because some UN Member States fear that new structures
and practices will lead to violations of their sovereignty. The UN, together
with regional actors, plays an important role in the international mediation of
confl icts.

The Peacebuilding Commission established as part of the larger UN reform
in 2006 has the mandate of contributing to post-confl ict stabilisation and the
prevention of renewed confl ict.

#### NATO

Along with changes in the security environment, NATO has increasingly
transformed itself into a broadly oriented, multilateral security policy and
crisis management organisation. At the same time, its memberships and
partnerships have expanded, now encompassing a network of over 60 countries,
Russia included. The Alliance seeks cooperation and aims to establish global
partnerships.

NATO and the development of the security environment were assessed in detail
in the Report on the Effects of Finland’s possible NATO membership, published
by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on 21 December 2007.

NATO’s impact on security and stability is positive. While crisis management
tasks have become increasingly important for NATO, collective defence remains
at the core of the Alliance. Pursuant to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty an
armed attack against one or more of the Parties shall be considered an attack
against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack
occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of self-defence recognised by
Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties
so attacked by taking such action as it deems necessary.

NATO has a special role as a transatlantic defence and security organisation.
Twenty-one of the 26 NATO nations are EU Member States. The status of the
United States as the single most important fi nancial, technological and military
actor in NATO also highlights the importance of NATO cooperation, even as
the security and defence dimension of the European Union becomes stronger
over time.

In connection with its Strategic Concept review, NATO assesses its security
environment, the tasks of the Alliance as well as its relationship with its

49


-----

partners. Preparations for the review will be discussed at the Alliance’s 60th
Anniversary Summit in the spring of 2009.

**NATO crisis management**

Owing to its operation in Afghanistan (ISAF), the shipping monitoring operation
in the Mediterranean, the training mission in Iraq and the mission to provide
logistic support to the African Union in Darfur, the geographical focus of
NATO operations has gradually moved outside of Europe. NATO’s naval assets
have also been used in protecting UN food shipments against pirates off the
coast of Somalia. NATO will most likely focus its attention increasingly on the
Middle East, Asia and Africa in the future. NATO has also undertaken relief aid
missions in the aftermath of natural disasters such as hurricane Katrina and
earthquakes in Pakistan. Operation KFOR in Kosovo is the only ongoing NATO
crisis management mission in Europe.

Operation ISAF in Afghanistan is a UN-mandated mission, comprised of over 40
participating countries. It is the Alliance’s most demanding crisis management
operation, having signifi cantly impacted NATO’s military capabilities as well as
the enlargement of the partnership and cooperation network. Operation ISAF
has also shown that several NATO member countries fi nd it diffi cult to identify
and sustain suffi cient troops for demanding military operations. NATO engages
in a continuous debate over mutual solidarity and burden-sharing.

Mainly as a result of the operation in Afghanistan, NATO has adopted a
comprehensive approach in crisis management. This approach emphasises
the importance of civil-military cooperation as well as the interdependence
between stability and development. When crucial civilian crisis management
capacities are required, NATO relies on the resources of other actors. The
relationship between NATO and other international actors, especially the UN
and the EU, has become increasingly important. NATO has called for a stronger
UN role in coordinating activities in Afghanistan.

Crisis management will continue to be the most important task for NATO and
Afghanistan will remain the most central challenge for the Alliance. In the
near term, NATO will likely seek solutions for funding problems and capability
shortfalls through increased common funding of operations.

**Partnership for Peace and other cooperation programmes**

The volume of crisis management operations is on the increase and, therefore,
the resources of NATO’s partner countries and other possible cooperation

50


-----

partners are needed in addition to the resources of the Alliance. NATO
cooperation programmes have also been opened to countries outside the EuroAtlantic Partnership Council. At the same time operational intelligence sharing
and the possibility of participating in operational decision-shaping have been
improved.

In addition to placing emphasis on crisis management, NATO fi nds it important
to promote stability in partner countries. Developed partners are expected to
participate in this activity by supporting, for example, security and defence
sector reform.

The relative importance of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council has diminished.
Partner countries differ with regard to their interest in NATO cooperation
as well as to their available resources. The possibility of a partner country
developing and focusing its cooperation in line with its own interests and
needs is an important trend. Good examples of this include the opening of the
NATO Response Force to willing and capable partners as well as the Strategic
Airlift Capability. While no structural changes are expected in NATO PfP and
cooperation programmes, their content may be further developed.

The purpose of NATO’s Planning and Review Process (PARP) is to promote
interoperability between the Alliance and its partners in crisis management
operations. New and fl exible forms of cooperation are being developed to
facilitate the increased participation of willing and capable partner countries.

NATO’s civil emergency preparedness activities are almost totally open to
partners. Participation in NATO Civil Emergency Planning supports national
preparedness and harmonises capabilities. NATO also runs a Euro-Atlantic
Disaster Response Coordination Center which provides relief aid in crises and
disasters, and organises exercises.

**NATO enlargement**

As was the case with EU enlargement, NATO enlargement, too, has signifi cantly
increased stability and eliminated political divides in post-Cold War Europe.
NATO has declared that it continues to observe an open door policy towards
potential member countries that want to become members and meet the
membership criteria.

Albania and Croatia have signed accession protocols and they are expected
to become NATO nations by the 2009 Summit. Of the countries in the
Western Balkans, also the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia

51


-----

and Herzegovina as well as Montenegro are pursuing NATO membership. At
the Bucharest Summit in April 2008, Allied leaders agreed that Georgia and
Ukraine, too, will become NATO members sometime in the future.

Owing to enlargement and changes in the security environment, the inner
cohesion of the Alliance is weaker in comparison to the Cold War era. At that
time a clear threat scenario unifi ed the member countries, then much fewer
in numbers. European NATO nations have closely integrated their defence
capabilities into NATO. The possible rejoining of France to the NATO military
command structure will widely impact NATO and the European security
architecture.

**NATO defence planning**

In the post-Cold War environment NATO mostly adopted a capability-based
defence planning concept. NATO no longer prepares country-specifi c defence
plans for all of its members against the threat of a large-scale attack. Nonetheless,
common defence planning as well as command and force structures are fl exibly
tailored to meet the requirements of the strategic assessment. NATO estimates
that it has enough time to launch and complete the required defence planning
to counter any large-scale attack, should such a threat appear.

Nevertheless, due to changes in the security environment the essence of
collective defence has expanded. It is no longer understood to only guarantee
the territorial integrity of NATO nations. Operation Active Endeavour, patrolling
the Mediterranean, is an example of present-day collective defence tasks
launched under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Several partner countries,
including Russia and Ukraine, have offered to support the operation.

NATO defence planning emphasises the comprehensive concept of security.
Furthermore, capabilities are being tailored to meet the requirements of
various security threats. If required, NATO will defend its members and their
vital interests beyond the Alliance’s traditional areas of responsibility as well as
through non-military means.

The most immediate threats to NATO are terrorism, the proliferation of WMDs,
fragile states, regional crises, and abuse of new technologies as well as the
discontinuation of vital energy supplies. Counter-terrorism tasks include the
protection of critical infrastructure as well as supporting the civilian authorities
in a post-terrorist attack situation. The crisis management operation in
Afghanistan has highlighted the need for force protection against terrorism.

52


-----

Protection against new technologies includes NATO’s Theatre Missile Defence
(TMD) Programme and the possibility of ‘bolting’ the TMD onto the US national
missile defence system.

The generation of capabilities for demanding and challenging crisis
management tasks also bolsters NATO’s ability to defend its territory, if need
be. Special attention is paid to the capabilities and interoperability of European
NATO nations. Moreover, work on NATO’s joint command and force structure
transformation is still going on. The objective is to create a leaner and more
fl exible structure.

The NATO Response Force (NRF) is of central importance in the development
of national and Allied capabilities. The varied tasks of the NRF range from
evacuation and crisis management to counter-terrorism and Article 5 operations.
In practice the need for improving rapid response capabilities arises specifi cally
from crisis management.

The objective of defence materiel cooperation is to improve the Alliance’s military
capabilities and to guarantee interoperability in NATO operations. Defence
materiel cooperation especially focuses on interoperable C3I (Command,
Control, Communications and Intelligence) systems as well as better equipment
for meeting the requirements of a mission. Priorities also include chemical,
biological and radiological defence, strategic airlift and improved logistic
support. NATO standards form the foundation for international interoperability.
International repair services and maintenance cooperation will be expanded
and the signifi cance of the NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA),
and corresponding arrangements, will increase.

**NATO-Russia relations**

The members of the NATO-Russia Council (NRC), the cooperation forum for
NATO-Russia relations, include the 26 NATO nations and Russia. The NRC puts
Russia in a privileged position in comparison to the other partner countries. It
also allows Russia to engage in a regular political dialogue with NATO countries
on topical security policy and regional issues. Both Ukraine and Georgia have
corresponding arrangements with NATO.

Topics in the NRC include military-to-military cooperation, the fi ght against
terrorism, civil emergency planning, exchange of air situation pictures and
defence reform. The most visible example of practical cooperation in the
NRC is the project aimed at preventing drug traffi cking from Afghanistan.

53


-----

Furthermore, Russia has decided to support the ISAF operation by allowing
land transit across its territory.

Changes in East-West relations also have an impact on NATO-Russia relations.
The confl ict in Georgia seriously impacted cooperation in the NRC.

Russia has been extremely critical of NATO enlargement into the area of the
CIS.

#### The OSCE

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is the sole
European organisation whose 56 participating states span the entire EuroAtlantic and Euro-Asian region. In addition to its large membership, the OSCE’s
special strengths include a broad range of instruments, versatility, cooperative
structure and fl exibility.

The OSCE was founded on a network of political commitments included in
the Helsinki Final Act, covering both traditional military security issues as well
as wider human security questions. The objective is to improve security and
promote democracy, human rights and the rule of law in the entire area of the
OSCE. The OSCE is the principal European actor when it comes to election
monitoring, minority rights and building military openness, trust and democratic
control of armed forces.

The organisation focuses on the ability to respond to new security challenges.
New areas of cooperation include border security and control, counterterrorism, control of small arms and the illicit arms trade as well as the fi ght
against the narcotics trade and traffi cking in human beings. The focus of the
OSCE’s activities is gradually moving from Southeastern Europe to the South
Caucasus and Central Asia.

The OSCE has developed versatile tools for confl ict prevention, early-warning,
crisis management and political reconciliation. Field operations are at the core
of its activities. The OSCE can fl exibly tailor its wide range of fi eld operations
and rapidly respond to changing crises. The OSCE’s capability to act was
strengthened in the autumn of 2008 when it was able to increase the number
of military observers in Georgia within a week or so.

The OSCE, which operates by consensus, is vulnerable to the ebb and fl ow of
international relations. In recent years, the organisation has squabbled over the
geographical focus of activities and, especially, the signifi cance of promoting

54


-----

democracy and human rights vis-à-vis traditional military security issues. The
crux of the argument involves election monitoring.

#### The Council of Europe

The mission of the Council of Europe is to promote democracy, human rights
and the rule of law in Europe in order to advance peace and stability in
Europe. The Council of Europe plays an important role in creating a treaty
regime. International monitoring arrangements have been established for the
most important treaties. The Council of Europe pays special attention to the
promotion of tolerance and minority rights. The Council of Europe Convention
on the Prevention of Terrorism, adopted in 2005, is recognised as an instrument
which combines effective counter-terrorist action and a comprehensive human
rights approach.

The enlargement of the Council of Europe has been a vehicle for infl uencing the
stabilisation of democracy and legal reform in countries in transition. It takes
years before human-rights thinking and democracy take root in a society even
after legislative changes and social reforms, required by membership, have
been instituted. This requires constant monitoring through well-established
parliamentary and other procedures as well as independent institutions such as
the European Court of Human Rights, the European Human Rights Commissioner
and the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance.

The prevention of discrimination, social inequality and confl icts as well as
the fi ght against organised crime and corruption remain pertinent tasks. The
detection of non-compliance with standards is an early-warning system. Welltimed intervention on the part of the European Human Rights Commissioner
and the Venice Commission, which specialises in constitutional matters, the
Committee against Torture and the rapporteurs to the Parliamentary Assembly
have often prevented crises from escalating and made the world more aware
of the root causes of confl icts. The organisation offers its expertise to host
nations and other international organisations through liaison offi ces.

#### Security developments in Finland’s neighbouring areas

The enlargement of the European Union and NATO as well as political and
economic changes in Russia have stabilised Finland’s neighbourhood.
Nevertheless, particularly tensions between the Baltic States and Russia and
between Poland and Russia are still palpable.

55


-----

Russia’s use of military force against Georgia will also have knock-on effects on
security thinking in Finland’s neighbouring areas. This might result in a review
of defence arrangements, especially, in the Baltic States.

In addition to military threats, new threats have emerged. The lessons from
Estonia and Georgia demonstrate that cyber attacks constitute a concrete
security threat. Deliberate disruptions of raw material or energy deliveries can
be used as instruments of political pressure. Security threats involving, among
other things, the environment, nuclear safety and security, organised crime,
narcotics trade, human traffi cking or infectious diseases constitute cross-border
threats. With the expansion of the Schengen Area, the Baltic States and Poland
have joined the area of free movement within the European Union.

The condition of the Baltic Sea impacts all coastal states of the Baltic Sea.
Because of increased shipping, the Baltic Sea is under constant environmental
threat and the possibility of a massive environmental disaster continues to
grow. Climate change may spur a race for energy rights and other natural
resources in the Arctic region. This may also have security policy and military
implications.

The enlargement of the European Union has accentuated the importance of
Baltic Sea cooperation. The European Union aims to promote the state of the
environment as well as trade, transportation and social contacts and stability
through the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region and other corresponding
policies.

In addition to EU and NATO cooperation, several other cooperation mechanisms
foster closer contacts and stability in Finland’s neighbouring areas. The most
important of these are Nordic cooperation as well as the collaboration between
the Nordic countries and Baltic States, the Northern Dimension of the European
Union and the Council of Baltic Sea States.

**Russia’s strategic interests in areas adjacent to Finland include the defence**
of its northern sea areas, military bases in the Kola Peninsula, the area of St.
Petersburg, the ‘other capital of Russia’, as well as the Baltic Sea transport
corridor. The strategic nuclear submarine bases of Russia’s Northern Fleet are
in the Kola Peninsula and the strategic importance of Kola remains high, or may
even increase. Large oil and natural gas deposits in Kola are further grounds
why this region remains so important to Russia’s defence.

There are over 100,000 defence ministry and other troops in the Leningrad
Military District. The district is capable of using tactical nuclear weapons. Army

56


-----

**Wartime military strength in Finland’s neighbouring areas**


57


-----

units include service branch troops as well as two high-readiness motorisedrifl e brigades, an artillery brigade as well as several brigades and divisions at a
lower strength which can be mobilised to full strength if required. In addition,
there is also an airborne division reporting to the General Staff of the Armed
Forces in the district.

The Russian air force has 14 bases in the vicinity of Finland, comprising over
200 combat and reconnaissance aircraft. Command and control aircraft,
electronic warfare aircraft and helicopters also use the bases.

Russia has announced that it will strengthen its Baltic Fleet.

It is important to Russia to protect its foreign trade transport corridors and
the growth potential in the Baltic Sea region. Approximately 40% of the oil
Russia exports is shipped through the Baltic Sea. The planned new natural
gas pipeline will give the bottom of the Gulf of Finland increased strategic
importance.

**The Nordic countries are intensifying their mutual foreign, security and**
defence policy cooperation. They are also studying ways on how to better
adapt regional cooperation agreements in the Barents Sea and Baltic Sea
regions.

Nordic societies are very similar. Therefore, they share many goals in key
security areas, such as the fi ght against climate change and the ambition to
cooperate in the globalising world. Far-reaching harmonisation processes are
ongoing between the Nordic countries.

The Nordic countries can also promote and advance their common objectives
on other fora, such as the UN, EU, OSCE and NATO. Crisis management is an
example of Nordic cooperation success stories. Nordic countries participating
in varying formations cooperate closely in improving training and civil-military
cooperation on the ground as well as in advancing indigenous crisis management
capabilities in the Western Balkans, Afghanistan and Africa.

Suffi cient defence appropriations are a key challenge shared by all Nordic
defence forces. The Nordic countries are developing new areas and forms of
cooperation which are wider in scope compared to the present ones. Should they
materialise, they will result in synergies and better operational preconditions.
The intention is to extend the common efforts beyond crisis management
cooperation so as to include the respective defence forces’ activities, such as

58


-----

naval and air surveillance, logistics, training, research & analysis as well as
defence materiel cooperation.

**Sweden continues to improve its interoperability with the other EU Member**
States and NATO. Operational units form the backbone of the present Swedish
armed forces at present. There are approximately 800 Swedish personnel
deployed to international crisis management operations. The objective is to
increase their number to approximately 2,000 persons.

The Home Guard, supported by mobile operational units, are responsible
for local defence. Sweden will probably change over to fully professional
armed forces during the coming decade. Recently the armed forces have
been developed with international crisis management in mind because the
current threat scenarios do not include the possibility of armed aggression
against Sweden. However, recent events may result in a reassessment of the
situation.

**Norway’s armed forces are tasked to maintain a defence capability which,**
supported by NATO, is suffi cient to repel armed aggression. This capability
shall also be capable of securing Norway’s interests in the north, where
Norway has boosted its military presence. While national tasks remain the main
tasks of the armed forces, the nation also participates in international crisis
management operations, together with its allies and partners. Norway has
deployed approximately 600 persons to international operations. In addition,
Norway has earmarked a reinforced battalion as well as naval and air force
elements for Allied operations.

The Norwegian Home Guard are the mainstay of wartime troops. There are
some 15,000 regular personnel in the armed forces. Norway has general
conscription. NATO remains the cornerstone of Norway’s defence and the
importance of the Alliance in maintaining stability in the northern regions is
emphasised. Norway’s defence appropriations are approximately 2% of GDP,
above the average of European NATO member countries.

**The Baltic States’ armed forces are tasked to conduct territorial surveillance,**
repel violations of territorial integrity and defend their territorial integrity.
International military crisis management also plays a signifi cant role. Estonia,
for example, has deployed more than 200 troops to operations in Kosovo,
Iraq and Afghanistan. Moreover, Estonia participates in the NRF. Nonetheless,
without Allied assistance the Baltic States’ capability to defend their territorial
integrity is still marginal.

59


-----

The personnel strengths of the Baltic States’ armed forces will remain small
in the 2010s. Latvia has abolished general conscription, Lithuania is about
to follow suit and even Estonia implements general conscription only to a
degree. Voluntary arrangements are highlighted in target protection, territorial
defence, mobilisation, reception of Allied assistance as well as international
crisis management tasks. Mutual defence cooperation plays a key role in
developing the Baltic States’ capabilities.

### 2 THE EFFECTS OF DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OF FINLAND

**Globalisation has primarily positive effects on Finland. Thanks to their**
readiness for change, effective employment of security networks in society, a
high level of education and new technology, Finland and Finns have been able
to turn globalisation into an advantage. Then again, global networking has also
increased Finland’s vulnerability.

The challenges of globalisation require goal-oriented good governance, an
international presence and the capability to rapidly react to changes in the
operating environment. Finland must prepare for wide-ranging threats as a
member of European and global cooperative arrangements and organisations.
Political, economic, military, scientifi c and technological cooperation within
these structures can enhance our national capabilities. The functioning of the
multilateral system and great powers’ commitments to commonly agreed rules
are important to Finland.

Interdependence between states is increasing. Changes in global security, global
economic dislocations and climate change have knock-on effects on Finland as
well. For instance, disturbances in energy or raw material production, even
far from our borders, may slow down Finland’s economic growth. It behoves
Finland to try to ease the long-term consequences of such changes, even if
they do not immediately impact Finland.

As a result of global warming, the growing season in Finland might become
longer in the long term. On the other hand, storm damage as well as fl ooding
and prolonged droughts or forest fi res will increase. In the long term, among
other things, the rising sea level and rapidly changing weather conditions may
cause serious problems and increase the need for cooperation among public
authorities.

Finland’s public **fi nances are sound at the moment. The Finnish economy**
is integrally linked to the global economy and to its development. The global
fi nancial crisis manifests itself as slower economic growth in Finland, among
other things.

The dwindling labour supply caused by the ageing of the population dims
economic prospects in the medium term. Paramount in strengthening
nationwide employment and public fi nances in the long term is to sustain

61


-----

suffi cient economic growth and expertise that are invaluable for Finland’s
competitiveness.

The strong integration development in recent years has greatly changed
Finland’s operating environment. Altered business structures and ownership
arrangements in the Finnish market also impact Finland’s crisis preparedness.

Electronic information and communications technology (ICT) systems expedite
both civilian and military activities. Simultaneously, however, the architecture
of the ICT systems facilitates the use of these systems for criminal purposes
and also in manipulating society’s vital functions from abroad. Decisionmakers, citizens, the media, energy sources, information networks or vital
national defence components, such as the air defence, can become the targets
of information warfare such as cyber attacks.

The European Union is gradually moving towards more effi cient and transparent
defence markets. Protectionism may impede this positive development.

**In international comparison Finland’s security of supply is well**
organised. Nonetheless, challenges include the dependence on imported energy
as well as increasing foreign ownership of critical infrastructure, production
and services. The worst-case scenario in preparedness arrangements is a crisis
in which the capability to produce critical articles or obtain them from abroad
is either disturbed or temporarily suspended. This applies particularly to ICT
systems.

Increasing foreign ownership and control over sea, air and land transport
equipment weakens the reliability of transports.

The Defence Forces rely on society’s security of supply and, consequently, on
the production which supports military defence and system maintenance.

While the current assessment is that the likelihood of **terrorism against**
Finland is low, it does exist, and hence requires preparedness arrangements.
In recent years the threat of terror has increased and concretised in the Nordic
countries. Also Finns abroad such as those deployed to crisis management
or other international tasks or on travel, may become victim of terrorist acts.
Terrorists might also use Finnish territory as a sanctuary for terrorist fi nancing
or for other purposes.

**The ageing of the population is a problem for competitiveness and the**
economic dependency ratio. Finland has a growing need for labour migrants.

62


-----

It is a challenge to the state to retain its attractiveness as an employer as the
workforce continues to age. The Defence Forces, too, will have to compete
more and more in order to recruit skilled personnel. Diminishing annual
conscript intakes will result in smaller wartime troop strengths as early as the
2010s.

**Organised crime and the grey economy benefi t from the increased freedom**
of movement. Increased human traffi cking is a serious human rights challenge,
both internationally as well as in our neighbouring areas. Finland is a transit
country and, to some extent, a destination of human traffi cking.

Dangerous infectious diseases, such as SARS, HIV/AIDS and serious animal
and plant epidemics, such as the avian infl uenza in various parts of the world,
also constitute a major threat to Finland. Food crises within the European
Union are often associated with slow-developing dangerous zoonoses or to
the spread of highly infectious animal diseases among domestic animals.
Should foreign substances manage to enter the food supply chain it could
result in extensive recalls of feed or food. Increasing travel heightens the risk
of epidemics.

Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis occurs in Finland’s neighbouring areas and,
thus far, the number of HIV infections keeps on growing.

#### Crises, confl icts and the use of military force

The increasingly multi-dimensional crises and confl icts require that Finland
adopt an active and comprehensive approach in which civilian and military
activities are coordinated.

Future crisis management operations will probably be implemented in more
demanding environments, where host nation support may be completely
nonexistent and in which the equipment rapidly wears out. Better coordination
and cooperation between the various organisations and international actors
operating on the ground is highlighted. An additional challenge is that the local
population may at times be openly hostile towards the crisis management
contingent. Operations may also incur the risk of terrorist attacks in Finland.

Finland must develop its rapid reaction capabilities as well as the needed niche
capabilities and special materials for military crisis management. Operations
are launched farther and farther away from Finland, multiplying operational
expenses. Therefore, Finland must continually reassess its crisis management
capacity and consider additional funding.

63


-----

|Realised crisis management expenses/peacekeeper/per year|Col2|Col3|Col4|
|---|---|---|---|
|Afganistan|Bosnia and Herzegovina|Kosovo|Chad (estimate)|
|EUR 150,000|EUR 124,000|EUR 89,000|EUR 221,000|


There are growing expectations on Finnish civilian crisis management
participation. Our civilian crisis management capacities must be improved and
made more versatile in order to meet the growing requirements.

Throughout our peacekeeping history there has always been a risk of casualties
in crisis management operations. More demanding environments also increase
the threats to civilian crisis management experts. Special attention must
be paid to arrangements for protecting crisis management personnel. The
threat of chemical, biological and radiological substances requires proactive
preparedness and better NBC defence capabilities from the national authorities
and crisis management contingents alike.

The defence of Finland continues to be the main task of the Defence Forces. In
addition to crisis management, Finland still needs to prepare for the prevention
or repelling of military threats to its territorial integrity or to the vital functions
of society.

Global arms control processes strengthen international security and stability.
Crises and confl icts may spawn rapidly advancing arms control processes
on certain conventional weapons. These, in turn, pose challenges to Finnish
defence policy and defence development, accentuating the need to cooperate
with like-minded states and exert infl uence in international processes.

Even if Finland is not a party to the Oslo Convention banning cluster munitions,
the convention signifi cantly impacts Finland’s defence and its resource
requirements.

#### The key actors

**The United Nations, being the most inclusive international organisation in**
the world, is important to Finland. The UN hopes that Finland will strengthen
its participation in UN action promoting development, peace and security as
well as UN peacekeeping activities and training.

**The European Union acts in line with UN principles and supports the UN. The**
Union is Finland’s most important frame of reference and channel of infl uence
in efforts to respond to most security threats.

64


-----

While implementing the EU’s climate and energy policy decisions, Finland can
secure its energy supplies in a sustainable manner. The EU’s multi-dimensional
policy on combating international crime and terrorism also bolsters Finland’s
security.

The European Security and Defence Policy focuses on crisis management,
counter-terrorism and defence materiel cooperation. These policy areas also
meet Finland’s requirements.

The European Union is in the process of assuming responsibility for increasingly
demanding military and civilian crisis management operations. Finland must
take this into account when national capacities are being built.

Battle groups have introduced rapid deployment as a new qualitative element
in the EU’s military crisis management. The Union has created Civilian
Response Teams for situations which require rapid action. Finland is expected
to actively participate in rapid response capability development as well as in
actual deployments.

The clauses which relate to solidarity and mutual assistance in the case of
armed aggression strengthen the Union’s internal security and solidarity among
the Member States. Both obligations advance Finland’s security as well.

Finland has already reviewed its legislation in order to enable the provision of
assistance to another EU Member State under the solidarity clause. Finland
must reassess its capacity to implement the mutual assistance obligation.
Nevertheless, the European Union is not creating a common territorial defence
capability, as most EU-countries carry out their defence arrangements through
NATO.

The strengthening of the ESDP only accentuates the importance of cooperation
with **NATO. The EU and NATO are organisations with almost the same**
memberships. The possible return of France to NATO’s military command
structure will further increase the linkage between the organisations, possibly
creating challenges over infl uence for the non-NATO EU Member States.

Finland develops its military capabilities in accordance with NATO standards.

Finland follows NATO’s transformation which will continue with the revision
of its Strategic Concept, defi ning the tasks of the Alliance. In this context the
debate will also refl ect on EU cooperation.

65


-----

NATO is aiming for a more comprehensive approach in crisis management.
This calls for closer Finland-NATO cooperation.

Active participation in cooperation and crisis management open to NATO
partners advances the development of Finland’s military capabilities and
interoperability and thus increases Finland’s security. With regard to military
capabilities and interoperability, the PfP Planning and Review Process (PARP)
and the Operational Capabilities Concept (OCC) are of central importance to
Finland. Participation in activities supplementing the NATO Response Force
would require enhancing Finland’s own rapid response capabilities.

Civil Emergency Planning is a continuously growing area almost completely
open to NATO partners. Finland has found participation benefi cial in many
sectors of CEP and Finland is expected to participate extensively in these
activities.

**The** **OSCE continues to concentrate on new security threats. Its regional focus**
will also move towards the South Caucasus and Central Asia. This provides
Finland and the European Union with new opportunities for supporting stability
and promoting European values in these regions.

**The United States continues to be the primary international security operator.**
It is important for Finland to foster relations with the United States in EU
and NATO contexts, and to maintain close bilateral relations with the United
States.

When it comes to Finland’s security environment, the most important questions
relate to Russia’s political and economic stability and to the evolution of its
international relations.

Russia has political, economic and military interests in our neighbouring
areas.

Russia’s most stable neighbouring areas border on Finland and other countries
in Northern Europe. Still, the possibility of change in the security situation of
our neighbouring areas cannot be excluded, nor can the possibility of armed
aggression or the threat thereof.

During the Georgia crisis Russia demonstrated that it is willing and able to use
military force in defending its interests. The crisis may have created long-term
tensions in Europe, further complicating security cooperation. The crisis in

66


-----

Georgia also demonstrated that events even far from us can impinge on the
EU-Russia relationship and thereby also affect Finland.

Russia is modernising its armed forces and equipment, which will also have an
impact in Finland’s neighbourhood. While the number of its troops will probably
not increase, the quality of defence materiel and capabilities will improve.
Russia continues to deploy nuclear weapons in Finland’s neighbouring areas.

Security in our **neighbouring areas also depends on developments in the**
interrelationships of the European Union, Russia and NATO. Increased shipping,
the question of natural resource rights in the Barents Sea as well as declining
wartime troop strengths in our vicinity pose new kinds of security and defence
policy challenges.

The armed forces’ personnel strengths in Nordic and Baltic countries are
diminishing through modernisation processes. The other Nordic countries
emphasise international military crisis management as a military task.

Many of the risks to the Baltic Sea coastal states such as shipping, nuclear
safety-related disasters and environmental threats fall under the rubric of
comprehensive security. Furthermore, international organised crime, narcotics
trade and human traffi cking as well as infectious diseases require vigilance
from Finland. National and international inter-authority cooperation across
administrative sectors becomes increasingly important.

Finland considers that Russia’s increasing oil transports and other shipping
in the Baltic Sea constitute a signifi cant environmental concern. Other
major challenges from the Finnish standpoint include Russia’s inadequate
infrastructure, obsolescent nuclear plants and non-eco friendly industry.

The Member States of the European Union are extremely dependent on
Russian energy. This may also have security policy repercussions in Northern
Europe if Russia uses its energy resources as an instrument of political
infl uence and pressure. The increasing interdependence between Russia and
the EU intertwines them closer together, creating a positive effect on regional
stability.

Finland continues to import most of its fossil fuels from Russia. Russia’s
electricity generation is already insuffi cient at times because of its rapid
economic growth. This results in rolling blackouts which may also impact
Finland if the reliability of electricity imports suffers. The National Climate

67


-----

and Energy Strategy, extending into 2020, aims to achieve a calculated selfsuffi ciency of electricity generation.

Russia is in the process of comprehensively reforming its border control
structure. Personnel have been reduced and many border guard stations on
the Finnish border have been closed. Hence, the Russian border control system
is now more easily permeable. The requirements for Finnish border control and
management of border situations are increasing.

**China affects Finland primarily through the global economy, bilateral trade**
and investments and through social and environmental questions regarding
China. Compared to the other European countries, Finland is slightly more
dependent on economic cooperation with China.

#### The challenges of the security environment to defence development

Finland must be able to prevent the use of military force against it or the threat
thereof. However, should military force be used against Finland, the Defence
Forces must be capable of independently repelling the attack while utilising
any possible assistance from abroad. A correctly scaled defence capability
strengthens and promotes stability in the security environment.

In addition to the Defence Forces’ main task, other important tasks include the
provision of executive assistance to the other authorities as well as participation
in international military crisis management.

In Finland the core functions of society as well as the population are
concentrated in cities. This sets new requirements for defence, civil protection
and the functioning of the civil society. It is increasingly important that the
Defence Forces fl exibly employ military capabilities as required by place, time
or function.

The use of military capabilities in controlling wide-ranging security challenges
calls for national and international cooperation. It may be impossible to respond
to asymmetrical threats by employing conventional military means alone.

The Defence Forces must concentrate on their core functions, increasingly
integrate with society and tap into the resources of the business sector and
society.

68


-----

The rapidly growing price of defence materiel and dependence on international
security of supply require national and international cooperation as well as
suffi cient resources for defence development.

Finland, a militarily non-allied country, cannot build its defence planning on
military assistance from abroad. Nonetheless, Finland must be prepared to
provide and receive international assistance.

The result of the changing nature of war is that various threats are best
countered by fl exible, situationally aware and mobile units. Finnish defence
development must be capability-based. Progress leads to units that are more
capable, albeit smaller in terms of personnel.

Firepower remains a key deterrent. The importance and means of employing
standoff precision-guided weapons, electronic warfare and satellite technology
as well as information warfare are on the increase.

Nordic defence cooperation may identify security-enhancing means of
collaboration and projects which, in the long term, create savings and
synergies. However, Nordic cooperation is no surrogate for closer EU or NATO
cooperation.

The defence and security sector can tap into an increasingly larger pool of
civilian research and innovation. However, the challenge is whether research
projects and innovations can be identifi ed and exploited early enough in the
process of defence development.

### 3 FINLAND’S SECURITY AND DEFENCE POLICY GUIDELINES

#### General

The most important functions of Finland’s foreign, security and defence policy
are safeguarding Finland’s independence, territorial integrity and society’s basic
values, advancing the security and well-being of its citizens and sustaining the
functioning of society.

The security and defence policy guidelines take into account changes in the
global operating environment in accordance with the comprehensive concept
of security. Globalisation requires goal-oriented, consistent and proactive
action as well as the capability to swiftly react to changes in the environment.
National interests are best advanced through international cooperation.

Finland promotes and strengthens bilateral relations globally and, especially,
with its neighbours.

Finland fosters the strengthening of the Common Foreign and Security Policy
of the European Union and its operational capability, and for its part, bears
global responsibility.

Finland actively contributes to security and cooperation by means of security
and defence policy. Finland maintains and develops a credible defence which is
appropriately scaled to its security environment. In addition to national defence,
the Defence Forces provide executive assistance to the other authorities
and participate in international military crisis management. Participation in
international activities strengthens the national defence.

The Province of Åland Islands has a recognized status under international law.
The special status of the province does not prevent Finland from intensifying
defence cooperation within the European Union and in international
organisations.

#### The European Union

Membership of the European Union strengthens Finland’s security. An
internationally strong Union, capable of action, serves Finland’s interests.

70


-----

Membership of the Union is a fundamental security policy choice for Finland. As
a Member State of the Union Finland belongs to a close-knit political grouping,
the members of which share a strong sense of unity and the will to act in
unison. Finland is strongly committed to this union.

The European Union affects Finland’s security policy on many levels. On the
one hand, the Union steadfastly develops its security-related activities (CFSP,
crisis management, materiel cooperation, internal security). Yet, the Union is
also a key actor in several other fi elds which directly affect security, such as
energy, transport and infectious diseases.

The action of the European Union per se deepens solidarity among the Member
States, which in turn has a direct positive effect on the security of the Member
States. Concurrently, the Union’s external action brings stability to its vicinity.
The enlargement policy serves a specifi c purpose in all of this and, among
other things, helps to stabilise the Western Balkans.

Finland aims to develop the European Union into an increasingly effi cient
and coherent actor. This would directly contribute to Finland’s security and
international position. A more effi cient and internationally viable Union serves
Finland’s interests.

A credible Common Foreign and Security Policy advances Finland’s security
policy goals. Finland is fi rmly committed to the common goals of the Union and
seeks to ensure that its security policy interests are observed in EU decisionmaking.

Finland considers it important that the European Union has a European
Security Strategy defi ning common security policy threat scenarios and policy
guidelines.

The security of Finland and the common security of the European Union
are strengthened through deepening integration, enlargement and properly
managed neighbourhood policies as well as a solid EU-Russia partnership.

Finland supports a comprehensive approach which recognises the
interrelationship between internal and external security.

Finland believes that it is essential to develop the Union’s area of freedom,
security and justice.

71


-----

The solidarity clause included in the Treaty of Lisbon reinforces the employment
of the instruments and capabilities of the Union and its Member States,
and strengthens their mutual solidarity. Finland acts in accordance with the
solidarity clause.

The strength of the Union is its ability to promote security with a wide range
of instruments, such as political dialogue and crisis management as well as
human rights, development and trade policies. Actions taken by the European
Union foster security within the Union as well as in its neighbouring areas and
globally.

Deepening of the European Security and Defence Policy bolsters Finland’s
security. Finland actively participates in developing the ESDP as well as in its
full implementation.

It is in Finland’s interests to actively contribute to EU crisis management
operations, civilian and military crisis management capability cooperation
as well as the activities of the European Defence Agency. The permanent
structured cooperation provides an effective mechanism for improving military
capabilities. Finland supports the permanent structured cooperation and will
participate in it.

Finland supports closer EU-NATO cooperation. It is important to develop
capabilities between the European Union and NATO in a mutually coherent
manner. Rather than being competitors in crisis management, the organisations
complement each other.

Finland maintains that the obligation of mutual assistance strengthens solidarity
among the Member States, binding equally all member states. Pursuant to the
obligation of assistance, Finland will provide assistance to the other Member
States and expects the others to act likewise. Finland believes that a mutual
assistance obligation covering military means is but a natural commitment in
a close-knit entity such as the Union. It goes without saying that the strong
solidarity within the Union also refl ects on military activities and the readiness
to defend the other Member States by all available means.

The mutual assistance obligation is directly binding on the Member States and
its application does not require unanimous decision by the Member States. It is
up to each Member State to decide on the provision and forms of assistance.

Finland takes into consideration the fact that the Union has no common defence
planning capability or structures for common defence. Crisis management

72


-----

participation brings about interoperability which contributes to the reception
and provision of military assistance. The prospect of receiving assistance from
the other EU Member States raises the threshold of armed aggression and
improves Finland’s capability to deter any possible attack.

#### Multilateral cooperation

Finland fosters the strengthening of multilateral cooperation and international
law. Finland emphasises the role of the UN as the most comprehensive
multilateral cooperation mechanism. The Security Council has a primary role in
the maintenance of international peace and security. Finland supports the UN
reform aimed towards better response to the changing global challenges.

Finland plays an active role in the UN both nationally as well as through
EU and Nordic cooperation. Furthermore, Finland advocates a more visible
and coherent European Union in the United Nations. The Union can wield
considerable infl uence in the UN, especially when it acts in a unifi ed manner.

Finland is a candidate for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council for
2013–14.

Finland supports the OSCE and Council of Europe in advancing stability, security,
rule of law and human rights. The OSCE’s fi eld missions have a key role in the
activities of the organisation.

#### Neighbouring areas

Promotion of security and stability in Northern Europe is a key goal of Finland’s
security and defence policy.

Sweden and Norway are Finland’s close security policy partners. Finland
highlights the importance of Nordic cooperation as well as collaboration
between the Nordic and Baltic countries.

Finland deepens security and defence policy cooperation with the Nordic
countries as well as with the countries in the Baltic Sea region in areas such as
multilateral training and exercises.

Finland promotes the EU’s Northern Dimension and the elaboration of associated
partnerships concerning the environment, social well-being and public health
as well as transport and culture.

73


-----

Regional cooperation arrangements in the Baltic Sea region need to be
further clarifi ed. Finland’s objective is that all countries in the region be fi rmly
committed to the shared objectives.

It is in Finland’s interests to advance stability in the northern regions. Finland
also has commercial and economic interests as regards utilising the natural
resources in the Arctic region. Finland implements its Arctic policy both
domestically and in the European Union as well as through bilateral and
multilateral cooperation. Participation in the work of the Barents Euro-Arctic
Council and the Arctic Council is particularly important.

Finland wants to exert its infl uence via the upcoming EU Baltic Sea Strategy,
among other things, so as to more effi ciently focus the Union’s actions and
capabilities on improving the environment, trade and transport arrangements,
as well as social contacts in the Baltic Sea region.

#### Russia

Finland considers it essential that Russia commit to international cooperation
and institutions as an actor that bears its share of global responsibility and
respects the principles of international law. Russia’s development towards a
functioning democracy, a state respecting human rights and the rule of law,
and a market economy is in Finland’s interest.

Finland fosters its relations with Russia both bilaterally and as a Member State
of the European Union. Political, offi cial, economic and civil society interaction
is being intensifi ed.

A well-functioning EU-Russia dialogue is needed, thus refl ecting the parties’
interdependence.

Finland supports Russia’s WTO membership and works for the conclusion of a
new EU-Russia agreement and a modern free trade agreement.

Finland follows developments in Russia, which is the most important factor in
Finland’s security environment. Further improvements in Russia-NATO relations
would promote stability in the region. Finland considers that the development
of relations between Russia and the Baltic States is important and exerts
infl uence to bolster multilateral cooperation in the Baltic Sea region.

74


-----

#### The United States

Finland intensifi es political, economic and security cooperation with the United
States both bilaterally and as a Member State of the European Union. Bilateral
relations are being intensifi ed through active dialogue and cooperation in order
to solve major international problems. Defence materiel cooperation with the
United States is of particular importance.

Finland promotes an intensifi ed partnership between the European Union and
the United States in combating climate change, eradicating poverty and solving
global economic problems, among other things.

Partnership cooperation with NATO furthers transatlantic security
cooperation.

#### Prevention of crises and confl icts

Finland contributes to crisis and confl ict prevention, especially, by means of
development, human rights and arms control policies, and by participating in
international crisis management.

Through a coherent development policy Finland helps societies respond to
the needs of their citizens, eliminate the root causes of threats and advance
stability, security and sustainable development. Finland has pledged to raise its
development cooperation appropriations to 0.51% of GNI by 2010, followed by
a further increase to 0.7% of the GNI by 2015. Finland supports preventative
action, mediation and peace processes, post-confl ict reconstruction as well as
post-crisis transition from crises and natural disasters by means of development
cooperation.

Finland actively advocates human rights, democracy and respect for the
rule of law all over the world. Respect for human rights and the creation
of preconditions for social and individual dignity constitute a key element
of comprehensive security. Finland pays particular attention to the status of
women and children in confl icts. Finland supports the International Criminal
Court as well as the other international war crime tribunals.

#### Arms control

Finland participates in the efforts to intensify multilateral arms control including
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, NPT. In its actions Finland pays particular
attention to the linkage between arms control and international security as well

75


-----

as to promoting development in a comprehensive manner. Finland underscores
the importance of the UN as the cornerstone of multilateral arms control and
disarmament machinery as well as the principal forum for multilateral treaty
regimes.

Finland participates actively in major international arms control processes and
intensifi es its cooperation with like-minded states. Because of certain special
features in its national defence, Finland needs to infl uence international arms
control processes.

In 2008 Finland did not sign the Oslo Convention banning cluster munitions.
Nevertheless, Finland regards the Convention as important from the
humanitarian standpoint. Finland also supports the goals of the Convention as
well as the efforts towards its universalisation.

Once a study relating to the Defence Forces’ capabilities has been completed
and the international development work on cluster munitions, procurement
options and costs have been analysed, the Oslo Convention will be reassessed.
The Cabinet Committee on Foreign and Security Policy will review the
developments yearly.

Finland will participate in the implementation of the Oslo Convention through
humanitarian mine action.

Finland maintains and develops non-proliferation-based export controls in
accordance with internationally established standards as well as national
policy. Finland abides by the EU regime of export controls, contributes to its
development and strives for a strengthened status of the regime.

#### Securing the functions vital to society

Finland prepares for security threats both nationally and as a member of the
key European and global cooperation structures and organisations.

In order to prepare for and respond to security threats, Finland must engage
in close international and national cooperation as well as develop collaborative
mechanisms between different public authorities, the business sector and
NGOs. Furthermore, Finland must effi ciently implement its Strategy for Securing
the Functions Vital to Society as well as the Internal Security Programme.
During the period of the present Government in offi ce, an all-inclusive study
on preparedness, including the so-called comprehensive defence approach,
will be completed.

76


-----

The European Union is currently preparing a European Programme for Critical
Infrastructure Protection to prevent and minimise the damage caused by
disturbances or failures in the infrastructure. Finland actively participates in
the implementation of the programme.

Security of supply safeguards the continued functioning of society. Finland
maintains a national security of supply and supports the improvement of the
Union’s security of supply. A smoothly functioning single European market and
uninterrupted foreign trade create the preconditions for security of supply.
Finland also utilises public-private sector partnership arrangements as well
as bilateral and multilateral international agreements. Critical infrastructure is
sustained to ensure functioning of the society, national defence and citizens’
livelihood.

Society’s vital functions are secured by safeguarding the fuel supply, electricity
and heat generation capacity as well as the transmission and distribution
of energy in view of any possible disruptions in imports. Domestic energy
production is expanded in order to guarantee access to energy and to reduce
dependence on imports. Finland contributes to the functioning of the Nordic
electricity market.

When it comes to securing the electronic information and telecommunications
systems, the main emphasis is placed on nationally guaranteeing the functioning
of communication networks and ancillary arrangements. However, international
cooperation is also sought. Particular attention is paid to safeguarding
communications for the state leadership and the security authorities.

Finland combats global warming and actively participates in solving climate
change and energy-related issues both within the European Union as well as
in global fora. Finland regards it as important that security questions related
to the environment and climate change be addressed in the UN as well as in
other relevant security fora. Finland supports the adaptation of the poorest
and most vulnerable countries to the consequences of climate change.

Finland prepares for counter-terrorism and the prevention of violent
radicalisation. Finland shall prepare a national counter-terrorism strategy,
defi ning and clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the authorities in
counter-terrorist action. Furthermore, Finland participates in cooperation in
the EU, the UN and other international organisations, aimed at reducing the
terrorist threat and addressing its root causes.

77


-----

Finland intensifi es and expands national and international cooperation among
public authorities in combating terrorism and international organised crime.

Finland actively contributes to the development of border security in the
European Union and underlines the primary responsibility of the national
authorities. The smooth fl ow and security of cross-border traffi c is improved
by upgrading the functioning of international border crossing points and
increasing their staffi ng.

Finland takes the consequences of possible epidemics into account as regards
securing the vital functions of society. Pursuant to the national preparedness
plan, every administrative sector must see to it that they have coordinated
contingency plans in case of pandemics and infectious diseases.

The national authorities’ preparedness and cooperation is intensifi ed in order
to improve the capability to respond to chemical, biological and radiological
threats.

#### Crisis management

Finland strengthens its participation in international crisis management in order
to promote peace and security as well as development and respect for human
rights. Participation in crisis management is part of Finland’s security and
international burden sharing. It also bolsters the national defence capability.

Means for military and civilian crisis management instruments will be further
strengthened. Suffi cient fi nancial, material and personnel resources will be
earmarked for crisis management. Finland is developing interoperable, versatile
and high-quality civilian and military crisis management capabilities so as to be
able to meet the requirements of different confl ict situations.

Finland makes a signifi cant contribution to EU, NATO, UN and OSCE-led crisis
management operations. Finland maintains and develops its military rapid
reaction capabilities and readiness by participating in the EU’s rapid response
force. Finland intends to participate in the training, exercises and evaluations
of the NATO Response Force (NRF). As regards civilian crisis management,
Finland participates in the development of the EU’s rapid reaction capabilities.
Finland strengthens its participation in UN-led crisis management. The number
of women assigned to crisis management tasks will be increased.

Finland increases its participation in international civilian crisis management
through various organisations and cooperation mechanisms. The number of

78


-----

Finnish personnel and Finnish resources in civilian crisis management will be
increased.

Finland strengthens a comprehensive approach in crisis management and
post-confl ict reconstruction. Consequently, Finland considers it important that
military and civilian crisis management as well as development cooperation
and humanitarian aid be coordinated so as to achieve optimal synergies and
lasting effects.

Cooperation between the administrative sectors on allocation of development
cooperation resources to confl ict prevention, peace process support and postconfl ict management will be intensifi ed.

In its activities, Finland places emphasis on the development of local security
structures and crisis management capabilities in the confl ict areas, and on
the training of local security authorities as a part of strengthening the basic
structures of society. Finland supports the inclusion of questions related
to natural resources, climate and the environment in crisis prevention and
resolution as well as in post-confl ict management.

#### NATO

Finland’s strategic thinking aims at broad European cooperation and integration,
which would help eliminate antagonism and prevent security threats.

Finland does not expect to face military pressure or armed aggression outside
the context of a wider international confl ict.

NATO is a politico-military alliance; Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is its
raison d’être. In its practical activities NATO is above all a crisis management
organisation. It is a central intergovernmental cooperation organisation for
members and partners alike.

Finland takes an active part in the cooperation open to partners as well as
in the development of partnership and cooperation programmes. Finland
engages in regular political dialogue with NATO and participates in NATO-led
crisis management operations.

In order to develop international crisis management capabilities and strengthen
its national defence capabilities Finland aims to participate in supplementary
activities of the NATO Response Force. This also improves Finland’s participation
in the EU battle groups and in the Union’s capability development.

79


-----

Finland supports NATO’s efforts contributing to the stability and defence reform
in its partner countries. In addition, Finland continues to participate in NATO’s
Civil Emergency Planning.

Finland’s possible NATO membership would have repercussions in the security
situation of Northern Europe and in Finland’s neighbouring areas.

According to the report published by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the
effects of Finland’s possible NATO membership, membership in the Alliance
would have a deterrent effect, thereby strengthening Finland’s security.
NATO membership would provide Finland with Article 5 security guarantees.
Conversely, the possible membership would obligate Finland to provide
assistance to other NATO nations, should they become victim of an armed
attack.

The possible membership should be considered from the perspective of Finland’s
foreign policy position, defence as well as the evolving crisis management
cooperation. The European Union provides equal opportunities to its Member
States for participating in crisis management cooperation. As a member of
NATO, Finland would fully participate in the Alliance’s decision-making. Finland
would also participate in the NATO-Russia Council.

However, as a NATO nation Finland would face increasing political expectations
to participate in the Alliance’s crisis management tasks on the grounds of general
burden sharing and solidarity. Nevertheless, Finland would independently
decide on participation in operations, as is currently the case. Finland has been
able to participate in a crisis management manner it considers appropriate,
even while being outside of NATO.

Finland considers NATO’s objectives in promoting international stability and
security to be compatible with the foreign and security policy goals of Finland
and the EU.

As a member of NATO, Finland would participate in NATO defence planning and
defence materiel cooperation. This would improve Finland’s defence capability
and also enhance interoperability in national defence, cooperation among
public authorities and international crisis management. As a member Finland
would participate in the Alliance’s military security of supply arrangements.
Moreover, NATO membership would foster Finland’s international civil protection
cooperation, improve its ability to receive assistance from abroad and benefi t
the Finnish defence industry. NATO recommends that its members spend two
per cent of the GDP on defence. In 2007 fi ve of the 26 NATO nations reached

80


-----

this target. Should the membership be considered, an assessment must be
made on how the fact that NATO nations develop professional armed forces,
rather than general conscription, would affect Finland’s defence system.

Even as a NATO nation Finland would independently decide on the key principles
of its national defence.

The Parliamentary Security Policy Monitoring Group published a report, stating
that Finland’s basic security policy guidelines are sound and that they do not
require any fundamental review. Even in the future Finland must see to its
credible defence and participate in the developing European security and
defence cooperation. The basic premise is that the entire territory of the nation
will be defended and that the defence system will continue to be based on
general conscription. Finland is not a member in any military alliance but it
closely cooperates with NATO and maintains the option of seeking membership
in the organisation.

Also from now on, strong grounds exist for considering Finland’s membership of
NATO. As regards a decision on possible membership, broad political consensus
is essential, and it is important to take public opinion into consideration.

#### The defence of Finland

Finland’s defence is based on a successful foreign and security policy. However,
the foundation of defence is based on the fact that the possibility of armed
aggression against Finland or the threat thereof cannot be categorically
excluded.

Finland maintains a credible national defence which takes the international
treaty regime into consideration as best as possible. Finland prepares to repel
any use of military force against it as well as counter the threat thereof. The
primary objective is to maintain such defence capabilities and readiness which
make it unbenefi cial for an aggressor to use military force against Finland.
Well-trained troops equipped with state-of-the-art materiel as well as an
unwavering will to defend the country constitute elements of credibility.

Finland’s defence is based on territorial defence, general conscription and a
large reserve. It is also built on a steadfast will to defend the country as well as
on international defence cooperation. Relying on regional troops and nationally
deployable mobile troops, the defence system covers the entire territory of the
nation.

81


-----

Finland’s defence capability is scaled to guarantee the country’s independence,
the citizens’ living conditions and to secure freedom of action for the state
leadership. Finland’s territorial integrity shall be guaranteed in all situations.

Defence readiness will be regulated to correspond to the prevailing security
environment. This calls for a good early-warning capability, a real-time situation
picture, constant readiness as well as capable troops. The troops must be
appropriately equipped and trained.

Finland will be defended by focusing the resources of the entire society on
national defence efforts, in line with the principles of the comprehensive defence
approach and the Strategy for Securing the Functions Vital to Society.

Finland is also prepared to employ its defence capabilities to support other
public authorities in order to secure society’s vital functions, both at home and
abroad.

The citizens’ will and commitment to defend the nation will be supported by
improving different voluntary defence activities.

International defence cooperation bolsters the capacity and credibility of
Finland’s defence. Participation in international crisis management improves
Finland’s security and fosters international interoperability. The capacity
to receive and provide international assistance must be created in normal
conditions.

### 4 FINLAND’S SECURITY

#### Securing the functioning of society

This Report discusses the securing of functions vital to society insofar as it
is related to Finland’s security and defence policy. Society’s vital functions,
the management of comprehensive security threats, countermeasures and the
recovery of the society after crises are discussed in more detail in the Strategy
for Securing the Functions Vital to Society (SSFV/2006) and the Internal
Security Programme (2008). While the SSFV focuses on the management of
threats in all conditions, the Internal Security Programme mainly concentrates
on threats in normal conditions. The Strategy for Securing the Functions Vital
to Society is to be reviewed before the end of the present Government’s term
of offi ce, coordinated by the Security and Defence Committee.

The Government’s crisis management model will be further developed as part
of the SSFV strategy and all administrative levels shall ensure that they are
able to implement it. The model builds on the Constitution and other legislation
as well as on the Government Resolution 2006 on the Strategy for Securing
the Functions Vital to Society. Key areas in developing crisis management
capabilities include situational awareness, management support systems,
structures and premises as well as planning and communications. Improved
management systems, reliable in all conditions, are included in the planning of
the government’s secure network architecture.

External and internal security are more closely interlinked than before. Many
comprehensive security threats are intertwined, diffi cult to foresee, complex
and offer little in terms of early warning. Open intersectoral collaboration and
partnership arrangements with NGOs, companies and other non-state actors are
more and more being emphasised in national and international cooperation.

Public authorities, the business sector and NGOs coordinate their contingency
plans in view of different crises, thus making it possible to promptly tap into
every actor’s resources in any security situation. International cooperation
is highlighted. The Government is responsible for the functioning of this
operational model in all situations.

83


-----

**Present comprehensive defence approach**

Finland has a long-established preparedness system and for
decades the so-called comprehensive defence approach has laid the
foundation for collaborative arrangements between different actors
in society. This approach has created the basis for coordinating the
preparedness measures of the public and private sectors as well as
citizens’ voluntary activities. This entity constitutes the crisis readiness
network relying on our collaborative preparedness measures.

‘Comprehensive defence approach’ means all of the military and civilian
functions by which Finland’s sovereignty and the living conditions and
security of its citizens are safeguarded against any external threats,
threats from other nations or any other threats. Coordinating the
comprehensive defence approach involves synchronising measures
of the public sector — that is, the Government, State authorities and
the municipalities — and the private sector and voluntary activities
by citizens in order to maintain the functions vital to society under all
circumstances.

The Government is responsible for ensuring that society can function in
all situations. The Cabinet Committee on Foreign and Security Policy also
deals with the most important matters related to the comprehensive
defence approach. Each ministry as well as government agencies and
public bodies are responsible for the preparation and implementation
of the area of the comprehensive defence approach that falls within
their purview, pursuant to Section 40 of the Emergency Powers Act.
The Ministry of Defence is responsible for overall coordination between
the branches of government. The Security and Defence Committee
assists both the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Committee on
Foreign and Security Policy in matters related to the comprehensive
defence approach.

Nevertheless, changes in the operating environment, administrative reforms
as well as possible changes in legislation require a comprehensive analysis
of preparedness in society. This is to be completed during the term of the
present Government. The report shall evaluate the present comprehensive
defence approach, the SSFV strategy and the Internal Security Programme
as well as their content, arrangements, lines of authority, responsibilities and
implementation. In conjunction with this, consideration should be given to

84


-----

whether a national security council should be established. The Government
shall decide on this review at a later date.

The Government has appointed a committee to prepare the necessary reforms
to the Finnish Constitution. In conjunction with the review, the following
questions will also be assessed: the role of Parliament and the need to improve
parliamentarism, the foreign policy decision-making mechanism as well as the
development of the structures of the European Union.

The Emergency Powers Act, presently under review, lays down the central
principles of the actions of the state leadership and central government in
emergency conditions.

The nation’s crisis resilience is expressed in the collective determination to
defend the independence of the state as well as in sustaining the livelihood
and security of the population in all situations. Psychological crisis resilience
and general preparedness in the society are taken into account in controlling
special situations, protecting critical infrastructure, preventing marginalisation
and educating the public. Voluntary organisations play an important role in
this.

Crisis communications are coordinated between many authorities. Government
information shall be disseminated in a systematic and professional manner,
taking the international dimension into account. Particular attention is paid to
crisis communications intended for the general public.

Linked with the strategic development of the state sectoral research, a
comprehensive security research programme is being prepared, supported by
the upcoming national security research strategy.

#### Functioning of the economy and infrastructure

Economic dislocations are prepared for by sustaining suffi ciently robust public
fi nances. The importance of low government debt is particularly evident in
extraordinary circumstances. Disturbances in fi nancial markets may make it
much more diffi cult to obtain foreign fi nancing; investors might also demand
better return on their investments. Government debt management and cash
management must also prepare for sudden dislocations. This enables the use
of recovery measures during various disturbances and crises that utilise, for
example, fi nancial policy actions.

85


-----

Serious turmoil in the fi nancial market could also impact Finnish banking and
fi nancing systems. A serious downturn in the economy could result in solvency
problems among banks. Furthermore, confi dence in the banking and fi nancing
system could be shaken due to technical disturbances in payment transactions
and in the stock exchange.

The nature of the fi nancial market demands international cooperation between
the authorities. International fi nancial crises are mostly controlled through
bilateral or multilateral agreements and verifi cation protocols. In 2008 the
fi nance ministries, central banks and fi nancial supervisory authorities of the
European Union signed a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation in
cross-border fi nancial stability. Under the auspices of the European Union,
Finland participates in the G20 group in developing common rules for the
international fi nancial market. The goal is to increase transparency, trust and
predictability in global fi nancial markets.

Crisis legislation permits the regulation of the fi nancial market in abnormal
conditions. However, the restrictions and policies included in the Treaty
establishing the European Community and those set by the European Central
Bank must then be taken into consideration.

As a rule, appropriations earmarked for preparedness must be scaled to the
spending limits approved by the Government. Any needed additional resources
are primarily obtained by reallocating appropriations within the administrative
branch in question.

The Government’s overall objectives for the security of supply defi ne the
minimum levels of preparedness for different functions of society. Critical
infrastructure, production capacity and services must be safeguarded in
order to sustain the security of supply. This makes it possible to secure the
functioning of society, the livelihood of citizens and national defence even
during serious disturbances of normal conditions or in emergency conditions.
Well-functioning private-public partnership arrangements are fostered and
international contractual arrangements are developed in order to guarantee
the security of supply.

The International Energy Agency, the European Defence Agency and NATO’s
Partnership for Peace programme, among others, address security of
supply. Arrangements on medical supplies, defence materiel and securing
electricity transmission systems have been made under the auspices of Nordic
cooperation.

86


-----

Because of critical infrastructure and production capacity or national defence
requirements, it may be necessary for the state to retain control or ownership
in strategically important companies.

The national climate and energy strategy promotes diverse energy production
that relies on several types of fuel and a multitude of sources. Domestic energy
production and domestic fuels are promoted in order to guarantee energy
availability. It is important to improve energy effi ciency to, among other things,
reduce dependence on imports. The EU’s energy market increases energy
supply security. Correspondingly, it is important to improve the EU countries’
energy cooperation and advocate energy effi ciency as well as the use of
renewables.

Transport operations that are vital to Finland shall be safeguarded in all
conditions. Suffi cient transport capacity must be under Finnish control or
available to Finland so as to manage the necessary foreign trade and vital
transport services. Moreover, the usability of infrastructure and availability
of services must be secured. Improving and maintaining transport and other
infrastructure as well as the functioning of the reinsurance system are taken
into consideration in preparedness arrangements.

Water supply shall be guaranteed in all conditions. The distribution of potable
water and wastewater treatment are necessary in order to safeguard the basic
functions of society as well as public health and food production. The capacity
of water supply plants as well as the suffi ciency of alternative sources of water
is to be safeguarded.

Food supply is based on suffi cient primary production of basic foodstuffs.
International agreements with the Nordic countries as well as with other EU
Member States are further elaborated in order to guarantee access to critical
production inputs.

Information security is the cornerstone of social functions, services, applications
and IT infrastructure. Open information networks are its most vulnerable points.
Electronic ICT systems are secured in order to control serious disturbances in
offi cial and business sector functions and those threatening the security of
citizens.

Finland upgrades the information security of electronic services and of the
IT infrastructure. Real-time public-private collaboration is required to combat
cyber crime. The most important issues relate to preventative measures,

87


-----

clarifi cation of the different actors’ roles and responsibilities as well as better
information sharing.

The public authorities must have access to modern early-warning and alerting
systems. These can be used to prevent or mitigate the effects of sudden
occurrences which impact the safety of the population and the functioning of
society. The future of the authorities’ terrestrial trunked radio network, VIRVE,
is guaranteed via suffi cient resources. Moreover, the joint use of the security
authorities’ information networks is encouraged.

Key legislation of the communications branch is reviewed in view of
preparedness requirements regarding emergency conditions and disturbances
in normal conditions. The preparedness requirements ensure the functioning
and availability of electronic services in all conditions.

#### Issues related to the population

Finland prepares for a labour shortage caused by the ageing of the population
by taking advantage of the free movement of labour in the European Union as
well as by encouraging labour migration in the long term. A labour shortage
must be prepared for because, despite the recession, the population trend in
Finland will result in a signifi cant increase of pensioners.

Nonetheless, immigration is but one instrument in the prevention of a labour
shortage. The labour reserve is also more effi ciently utilised, which integrally
includes supporting the preconditions of providing employment to immigrants
already in Finland.

Finland actively participates in the development of the common EU immigration
and asylum policy. Immigration-related decision-making is further streamlined
in order to provide reasonable processing times and fi rst-rate permit
consideration for all applicants.

The efforts against traffi cking in human beings are increased in accordance
with the National Plan of Action against Traffi cking in Human Beings and by
utilising the activities of the national rapporteur versus human traffi cking.

Good ethnic relations require active measures in all sectors and levels of society.
It is important to promote employment and swift integration among immigrants
as well as their participation in Finnish society. Social exclusion, particularly
among adolescents, must be prevented. The signifi cance of conscription shall
be taken into account in the integration of immigrants.

88


-----

The expertise of immigrant organisations is utilised. Simultaneously, the aim is
to prevent the emergence of possible extremist movements.

Successful immigration policy also presupposes good and extensive collaboration
networks, both within the public administration as well as in relation to the
third sector. By doing so it is possible to create an accurate situation picture on
immigration and population trends with regard to any necessary actions.

#### Infectious diseases

Notifi cation systems for infectious diseases, animal and plant diseases and pests
as well as suspected foodborne and waterborne epidemics are maintained in
order to detect and prevent infectious diseases and environmental health risks.
Furthermore, the authorities collaborate in risk assessment and epidemiological
research. Effi cient and continuous cooperation between the health care, food
safety and veterinary authorities is maintained in monitoring infectious diseases
and epidemics.

Finland has a national infl uenza pandemic plan. Preparedness requires the
clarifi cation of the social and health care services’ capacities and powers as well
as suffi cient material resources. The functioning of society during a pandemic
is secured by procuring protective gear and medicines.

The EU’s health care activities must be developed so as to advance the
security of supply and common preparedness for infectious diseases. Nordic
cooperation as well as other intergovernmental collaboration is intensifi ed.
Finland highlights the importance of international cooperation, an open and
transparent information exchange, the World Health Organization and other
international health organisations in the development of prevention, earlywarning and monitoring systems.

#### Environmental challenges and climate change

Climate change exacerbates extreme meteorological and oceanic phenomena.
The threats as well as adjustment to the changes of climate change shall be
taken into account in land use planning and other activities related to zoning
as well as in training, and rescue service procurements.

When it comes to international climate policy, Finland mainly operates through
the European Union. It is important that the Union maintain a leading position
as regards combating climate change on an international scale. The European

89


-----

Security Strategy must also better consider the security-related effects of
climate change.

Finland promotes multilateral cooperation in combating threats related to the
environment and climate change. The most important topics include the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change as well as the ongoing
negotiations on a comprehensive climate change convention for the post-2012
climate regime. Finland actively strives for the climate pact.

Finland supports a comprehensive approach in studying environmental and
climate-related security factors under the auspices of the UN system. This
requires reforming and strengthening the United Nations Environment
Programme.

#### Major accidents and natural disasters

Finland continues to especially improve its preparedness for extensive storm
damage, environmental threats and accidents involving hazardous substances.
Contingency plans must not discount the intentional use of chemical, biological
and radiological substances. Intersectoral cooperation is improved. The Internal
Security Programme and the Rescue Services Strategy 2015 steer the rescue
services’ development. The EU’s solidarity clause includes the possibility of
receiving assistance from other Member States in managing major accidents
and natural disasters.

Finland improves its present preparedness for the increasing risk of fl oods.
This calls for risk assessment and risk management planning as well as better
warning systems and collaborative mechanisms.

Finland prepares for major accidents, natural disasters and similar catastrophes
abroad in which Finns may be among the victims. Appropriate health care and
evacuation arrangements are assessed, inter alia, during reviews of pertinent
health care legislation. In addition to national airlift capacities, such as Finnair,
Finland can also tap into strategic airlift assets made available through
international collaborative arrangements to evacuate Finns from disaster and
crisis areas.

Finland participates in international civil protection cooperation and civilian
crisis management. In addition, Finland improves its preparedness for assisting
neighbouring states as well as for receiving assistance. The European Union
and the UN have established minimum standards for rescue service units.
Those participating in this cooperation must meet the requirements. Finland

90


-----

supports cooperation within the EU to reinforce civil protection services. The
capacities required by EU decisions and Finnish commitments are maintained
and improved.

The maritime actors action group (Maritime Environment Tri-authority Operations,
METO) continue their mutual cooperation and procedures for improving joint
situational awareness and the capabilities to prevent accidents at sea. The
maritime search and rescue authorities must be able to immediately launch
rescue efforts in a demanding maritime accident with multiple complications in
our neighbouring areas together with foreign emergency service authorities.
The capability of the rescue services to support maritime search and rescue and
the environmental authorities in major accidents at sea and natural disasters is
improved in accordance with the Internal Security Programme.

The Ministry for Transport and Communications is presently preparing a Baltic
Sea Maritime Safety Programme. Pursuant to it, the safety of oil transports and
transports of other hazardous substances is ensured by setting standards for
vessels and their licensed deck offi cers. Moreover, vessel traffi c services and
preparedness at sea are being improved. An adequate fl eet of vessels is also
maintained for the purpose of oil recovery on the open sea and littoral areas.

Coordinated multi-sectoral cooperation between the authorities is being
developed in Finland as well as in the Baltic Sea states and the European Union.
The purpose of this cooperation is to anticipate environmental risks as well as
to prevent and combat serious accidents. Better international civil protection
capabilities support domestic rescue service preparedness and improve our
capability to receive assistance from abroad.

#### Terrorism and international organised crime

Finland participates in international cooperation to combat and prevent
terrorism under the auspices of the UN, other international organisations and
the European Union. In all such endeavours it must be ensured that none of
the actions taken violate basic human rights. Developing countries’ counterterrorism capabilities are created and strengthened both through the European
Union and national actions.

Finland is committed to a system under the EU’s solidarity clause through
which the Union’s common instruments are made available to a Member State
which falls victim to a terrorist attack or the threat thereof. The Member States
have also pledged to provide assistance to each other in these situations. The
solidarity clause also applies to natural and man-made disasters.

91


-----

Finland prepares a national counter-terrorism strategy. The proposals included
in the EU’s strategies and programmes on the fi ght against terrorism,
radicalisation and recruitment to terrorism shall be taken into account in
counter-terrorist action. Activities are enhanced by improvements in key sectors
such as a systematic use of human intelligence sources, technical intelligence
gathering methods, coercive measures affecting telecommunications and cyber
intelligence. In addition, measures relating to the methods of uncovering and
investigating terrorist fi nancing are being further developed.

In Finland the police are responsible for counter-terrorism. The Security
Police are the central authority for national and international operational
inter-authority cooperation. The counter-terrorism capabilities of the police
are improved. Counter terrorism units of the police improve their procedures
by collaborating with other European police counter terrorism units. The use
and readiness of Border Guard and Finnish Customs expertise is increased in
police-led counter-terrorist and other special operations. Some Border Guard
special response units are being trained and equipped for counter-terrorist
action so as to be capable of operating alongside the police counter terrorism
units. The Defence Forces support the competent authorities in the prevention
and fi ght against terrorism.

As regards measures against terrorism offences and organised crime, the
growing need for close national and international cooperation between the
security authorities and other authorities is taken into account.

The capability to effi ciently fi ght international organised crime requires both
a real-time and accurate crime situation picture. For this purpose, organised
crime intelligence is exchanged with Europol, for example. International police
cooperation prevents crime which could extend into Finland. Common situation
pictures, investigation teams and the target selection procedure ensure that
criminals are brought to justice in their home countries. The Treaty of Prüm
creates, among other things, the legal framework pursuant to which the law
enforcement offi cials of the signatory states can improve joint operational
cooperation.

The key cooperation activities of the police, customs and border guard include
joint crime intelligence and analysis, a joint situation picture on serious crime,
joint profi ling and common pre-trial investigations. The Act on police, customs
and border guard cooperation currently being prepared solidifi es the statutory
framework of the aforementioned activities.

92


-----

It is possible to prevent organised crime from taking advantage of the legal
structures of society through legislative means, the authorities’ actions and
cooperation with the business sector and special interest groups.

Witness protection and the protection of the authorities are improved. The
capabilities and the powers of the police to protect information systems as
well as telecommunications and electronic services are modernised, as is their
capability to combat cyber crime.

#### Border security

Finland aims to preserve the good border security situation. Special attention
is paid to maintaining a secure and well-functioning eastern border. A credible
surveillance capability, in line with risk analyses, is maintained along the
entire eastern border. The primary focus of the surveillance is in the region of
southeastern Finland. The functioning of international border crossing points is
secured so as to guarantee smooth and safe border crossings. When it comes
to maritime border surveillance, the focus is in the Gulf of Finland.

Close international cooperation, especially with the Border Guard Service of
Russia, advances stability on the border. National inter-authority cooperation
prevents, exposes and combats cross-border crime.

Finland actively implements the four-tier access control model included in the
European Border Management Strategy. It is possible to prevent threats to
Finnish border security by taking determined actions in the countries of origin
and transit and at the external borders of the EU as well as by cooperating with
the other Member States. The operational capability of the European Borders
Agency FRONTEX to respond to sudden situations and extended operations is
improved. In addition, the EU’s border security situation picture covering all
borders is enhanced.

Finland promotes the operation of FRONTEX and contributes to the evolving
European border control systems. Special emphasis is placed on encouraging
the Russian border authorities’ commitment to EU-Russia cooperation.

The smooth fl ow and security of cross-border traffi c is improved by upgrading
the functioning of international border crossing points and increasing their
staffi ng. New technologies are introduced to achieve the goal of having highly
automated, biometrics-based border checks. The modernisation and expansion
of technical surveillance at land borders continues and the capacity to control
border situations is upgraded. There is a need to create a joint, reliable

93


-----

information exchange environment for the Union’s sea areas. This environment
should encompass, inter alia, the joint situation picture of all of the authorities
and cover the needs of immigration, cross-border police cooperation, maritime
surveillance and sea fi shing control as well as environmental protection.

Cooperation between Finland’s diplomatic and consular missions abroad, the
authorities and transport companies is intensifi ed so as to improve border
security.

The crime-fi ghting capabilities of the Border Guard are improved. The Border
Guard concentrates its efforts especially on fi ghting illegal immigration, human
traffi cking and the facilitation of illegal entry.

#### Finland’s external action

Finland’s main foreign, security and defence policy objectives are safeguarding
the country’s independence and promoting the security, well-being and core
values of its population.

As an active member of the international community, Finland contributes to
global solidarity and attends to its own opportunities to exert infl uence in the
changing environment. Finland’s foreign and security policy is based on good
bilateral relations, a strong role in the European Union.

Finland promotes multilateral cooperation which is based on respect for
international law and functioning institutions. States should adhere to commonly
agreed principles and obligations in advancing security and stability.

Close and comprehensive cooperation with the Nordic countries is important
to Finland. Finland will deepen Nordic cooperation in the areas of security and
defence.

Finland has established a wide range of contacts with Russia at all levels and
this cooperation will be further intensifi ed. Finland seeks to increase trade,
tourism and investments with Russia, and to prevent negative phenomena
which also impact Finland, such as crime and health hazards. The Government’s
Russia Action Plan establishes the guidelines for the management of relations
with Russia in different sectors. The intention is to set up a Russia forum, led
by the Prime Minister. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs will be responsible for the
preparative work of the forum.

94


-----

Finland continues to develop its relations with the United States. A transatlantic
network has been created in support of this action. The task of the network
is to consider the deepening of the cooperation in the fi elds of foreign policy,
economy, culture, science and innovation.

Finland supports the UN reform and greater effi ciency of its activities. Within
the UN Finland advocates the comprehensive security approach in order to
respond to global challenges such as environmental problems, food crises,
water and energy shortages, migrations, pandemics, crime, poverty, inequality,
terrorism and disasters.

Finland acts in the UN as a nation as a Member State of the European Union
and as a Nordic country. Finland strives for EU coherence. Through active
participation in the Union and contribution to Nordic cooperation Finland can
exert indirect infl uence in the Security Council. Finland’s long-term goal is a
seat for the European Union in the Security Council.

Candidacy for a seat in the Security Council for 2013-14 is an important goal
for Finland. As a member of the Security Council Finland could contribute to
the maintenance of international security and advance the values and positions
of Finland and the European Union. The key topics of Finland’s Security Council
campaign are intensifi cation of UN crisis management, development, and
human rights activities.

Finland has a long tradition of participating in the UN. This provides a solid
basis for proposing Finns to postings in peace processes, such as special
representatives and special envoys. Finland should continue to provide its
expertise to peace mediation and other international assignments within the
UN.

Finland actively contributes to the work of the OSCE and the Council of Europe
to strengthen stability and security, and to foster cooperation.

Finland supports the elaboration of international law in the key areas of foreign,
security and defence policy. These include, inter alia, questions related to the
justifi cation of the use of military force, human rights, humanitarian law and
the development of international treaty law. Finland, on its own as well as
through the European Union, promotes the strengthening of international law
and associated monitoring and enforcement mechanisms.

Finland supports the strengthening and improvement of international
monitoring practices as well as peaceful dispute settlement instruments, and

95


-----

the efforts of the International Criminal Court and the other international war
crimes tribunals.

#### The European Union

Finland fosters an internationally competent and capable European Union and
gives priority to a prompt entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty.

The Union should improve its cooperation with other international security
policy actors, such as NATO and the UN.

Finland for its part works with a view to developing a functioning partnership
between the EU and Russia.

Finland endeavours to improve its security through the EU’s Northern
Dimension. The Baltic Sea Strategy will complement the work done under the
auspices of the Northern Dimension. One of its priority areas is the state of
the Baltic Sea.

Finland values the European Neighbourhood Policy. It is important to deepen
the relations with the EU´s eastern neighbours, Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus,
Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan within the framework of the eastern
partnership. Participation in the multilateral cooperation within the eastern
partnership should be open to third countries, particularly Russia and Central
Asian nations, in all relevant fi elds. Political and economic cooperation
stimulates progress in the countries in the South Caucasus and Central Asia,
bringing them closer to European values.

The enlargement policy of the European Union promotes stability and wellbeing in Europe. Finland supports the enlargement of the Union in the Western
Balkans as well as Turkey’s aspirations in fulfi lling the requirements and
obligations of EU membership.

Finland considers it important that the European Union actively protect EU
citizens, both inside and outside of Europe. The Union’s expanding area of
freedom, security and justice increases the EU’s inter-authority cooperation in
the fi ght against organised crime, border surveillance and travel safety-related
matters as well as in disasters and crises.

The EU’s solidarity clause and the mutual assistance obligation strengthen
solidarity among Member States. Finland will establish the capabilities to

96


-----

provide and receive assistance pursuant to the solidarity clause as well as the
obligation to aid and assist another Member State.

The appropriations of the general budget of the European Communities for the
CFSP have grown over the last years. Still, they constitute only a minor portion
of the Union’s external relations funding. Finland considers securing suffi cient
and sustainable funding as one of the preconditions for the development of the
Common Foreign and Security Policy.

Finland, for its part, must ensure that the Union has the capacity to meet the
increasing challenges of crisis management. Finland supports the increase of
common funding covering the costs of military operations.

The European Union’s capabilities to plan and execute crisis management
operations will be strengthened. The EU Operations Centre is ready to be
activated within the EU Military Staff (EUMS). In 2007 the Council Secretariat
established a Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability. Finland commends
the trend and welcomes efforts to establish an operational headquarters to
conduct the EU’s military crisis management operations.

Finland emphasises the need to develop and plan the EU’s civilian and military
crisis management in a comprehensive manner taking into account the full
range of instruments of the Member States and the Commission.

Finland participates in the Union’s military capability cooperation and long-term
strategy cooperation. The EU’s capacity goals must be taken into consideration
when Finland plans the volume and scope of its crisis management capabilities.
The European Defence Agency is the primary European defence materiel
cooperation forum for Finland.

Finland will contribute to the shaping of the permanent structured cooperation
and prepares to participate in it. It is important to Finland that participation
be open to any Member State which fulfi ls the criteria. The criteria should
encourage new commitments and development of capabilities.

The Union’s rapid reaction capabilities should be further improved. Efforts
should be made to supply the EU Battle Group concept in a fl exible manner.
Finland will participate in the standby period of two battle groups in the fi rst
half of 2011. The battle groups also contribute to the development of Finland’s
national defence.

97


-----

The number of the EU’s civilian crisis management missions has been on the
increase. Finland supports the Union’s civilian crisis management capabilities
cooperation and will make efforts for its part to ensure that the Union has
a suffi cient number of trained personnel to EU civilian crisis management
operations.

It is important to Finland that political dialogue, cooperation concerning
capacity development and interoperability between the Union and NATO be
promoted.

#### NATO

Finland regards NATO as the most important military security cooperation
organisation. Finland also fosters wider transatlantic security policy cooperation
through NATO. Finland closely follows the evolution of NATO’s activities as well
as the enlargement of its partnership. Enhanced cooperation between NATO
and the EU, UN, OSCE and other international and regional organisations is
important to Finland.

Finland endorses the development of NATO’s Partnership for Peace (PfP)
and other cooperation activities within its present structures and encourages
the use of more fl exible forms of cooperation. It is important to respect the
diverging needs and goals of NATO partner and other cooperation partners.

Participation in crisis management operations and the development of
associated military crisis management capabilities are key elements in
Finland’s PfP cooperation. Finland participates in activities supplementing the
NATO Response Force (NRF) as well as in crisis management exercises open
to partner countries. By doing so Finland improves its interoperability and
acquires expertise and experience that serves the development of its national
defence.

Finland seeks to improve the possibilities of partner and other cooperation
countries in NATO-led operations to infl uence relevant operational decisionmaking.

Finland continues close cooperation with the Nordic countries. Crisis
management operations and participation in activities supplementing the NRF
provide signifi cant opportunities for cooperation. Cooperation with Sweden,
another Nordic PfP partner country, is especially important with regard to the
development of partnership and cooperation programmes.

98


-----

Finland intensifi es its participation in NATO activities that reinforce stability and
security sector reform in its partner and other cooperation countries. In addition
to this, the signifi cance of NATO’s voluntary PfP Trust Funds is accentuated in
the organisation’s external action. Finland increases its participation in stabilityadvancing NATO efforts to promote stability and in the Trust Funds, giving
priority to projects of key importance to Finland.

Finland continues to participate in NATO’s Civil Emergency Planning activities
and preparedness planning in order to improve its own expertise, when
appropriate and benefi cial from the standpoint of Finnish interest. More civilian
and military experts will be seconded to NATO staff and training duties.

Finland contributes to the development of cooperation and continues intensifi ed
dialogue with NATO.

#### Crisis management

Crisis management is Finland’s key foreign policy instrument by which it aims
to promote the stability of crisis areas in the world. Crisis management is about
responsibility and participation in international cooperation. At the same time
it improves Finland’s own security and contributes to national defence and
international interoperability.

Crises and confl icts call for a comprehensive and systematic approach from
crisis management organisations and participating states. Humanitarian aid
and development assistance must be considered alongside crisis management
instruments. Finland´s actions at national level should strengthen and
supplement the efforts of the international actors. A comprehensive approach
calls for better harmonisation between national planning, coordination and
resourcing.

When crisis management operations are being planned, cross-cutting themes
will also be taken into account, such as respect for human rights, strengthening
the position of women and children and the rule of law, and environmental
security issues.

In August 2008 the Ministry for Foreign Affairs set up a working group to
promote strategic approach for Finnish crisis management activities and to
prepare a comprehensive crisis management strategy by the end of 2009.

Participation in EU, NATO, UN and OSCE-led crisis management operations
requires improved interoperability. Finland particularly develops its rapid

99


-----

reaction readiness and niche capabilities by participating in the European
Union’s battle groups and the NATO Response Force. Finland employs the
capabilities developed in the battle groups in crisis management, such as in
Chad and Afghanistan.

In addition to the rising costs and increasingly demanding operational
environments, Finland is expected to deploy more specialised units and
niche capabilities to crisis management tasks. This refl ects on materiel
and maintenance costs. Retaining the present qualitative level of military
crisis management requires that appropriations are gradually increased to
approximately EUR 150 million

Also naval and air force capabilities can be used in future crisis management
operations. In order to improve overall performance Finland will review the
capabilities earmarked for international crisis management activities.

Finland will participate on important operations from the standpoint of Finland’s
foreign and security policy objectives. Emphasis is placed on the impact of our
participation.

More often than not, both military and civilian crisis management capabilities are
increasingly required in confl ict areas. Civilian and military crisis management
employ different, yet mutually complementary, means.

Finland actively participates in the civilian crisis management of the EU and
international organisations as well as in developing these activities.

In civilian crisis management, the objective is to signifi cantly raise the present
number of approximately 150 Finnish experts serving in different missions.
This will require additional appropriations for the purpose of seconding experts
and in building national capacities for civilian crisis management.

When it comes to civilian crisis management, Finland emphasises expertise
in law enforcement and the rule of law as well as border security and human
rights.

Finland promotes the role of women in the prevention and reconciliation of
confl icts and calls attention to the implementation of UN Security Council
Resolution 1325. The work is guided by a National Action Plan. Likewise,
Finland underlines the importance of implementing UN Security Council
Resolution 1612, which addresses the protection of children affected by armed

100

-----

confl ict. Special attention is paid to the rights and equal opportunities of easily
marginalised groups such as ethnic minorities.

The strengthening of Finnish crisis management participation necessitates
a suffi cient number of civilian and military experts who have the required
competence to serve in international operations. Crisis management experience
should contribute to a person’s career development in Finland. The terms of
employment for crisis management personnel must be improved.

Domestic civilian crisis management capabilities are improved and strengthened
in line with the National Civilian Crisis Management Strategy. The Crisis
Management Centre, co-located with the Emergency Services College and
reporting to the Ministry of the Interior, is responsible for domestic operational
tasks related to civilian crisis management. Training and research cooperation
between the Crisis Management Centre and the Finnish Defence Forces
International Centre (FINCENT) is being intensifi ed.

Special attention is paid to the security of personnel serving in demanding and
changing conditions in crisis management operations. Troops and personnel
must be able to operate in demanding and changing conditions. Simultaneously,
they must be prepared to counter asymmetric threats such as terrorist attacks
and organised crime in all shapes and forms. This highlights the importance of
effective exchange of information.

Finland prepares to continue longer term military and civilian crisis management
participation in Afghanistan and Kosovo. Afghanistan, Kosovo, the Middle East
and Georgia will be formidable civilian crisis management challenges for the
EU in the coming years.

The goal is to increase participation in UN crisis management. Finland has
traditionally supported UN peacekeeping activities and will contribute military
and civilian resources to UN-led operations also in future. Among other things,
Finland is preparing to participate in the upcoming UN operation in Chad.

Finland improves its ability to participate in training, advice and support tasks
in crisis areas. The exit of crisis management troops is often dependent on the
capability of the post-confl ict society to independently provide for the security
of its citizens. As for the most important crisis management operations, such
as Afghanistan and Kosovo, Finland participates in security and defence sector
reform.

102


-----

As part of wider support for African peace and security, Finland is preparing
to participate in crisis management training in Africa. Furthermore, Finland
is studying the possibility of providing more support for the development
of African crisis management capabilities. Additional assistance is provided
through participation in EU cooperation and by intensifying Nordic cooperation
as well as through NATO’s voluntary PfP Trust Funds.

#### Arms control

Finnish arms control policy highlights the promotion of security and development
as well as human rights and attention is paid to the needs of Finland’s national
defence.

The UN retains its signifi cance as the foundation of multilateral arms control
and disarmament and the primary forum for new multilateral agreements.
Finland emphasises the need to intensify the implementation of arms control
arrangements and to improve monitoring mechanisms. Developing countries
are supported within existing means to empower them, too, to commit to
international arms control obligations.

Finland’s arms control policy focuses on international cooperation in preventing
the proliferation and the use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their
means of delivery. The European Union’s WMD Strategy paves the way for
Finnish action.

Finland emphasises the importance of Security Council Resolution 1540 on
non-proliferation of WMDs and participates in the intensifi cation of international
export controls.

Finland stresses the central importance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT).

Finland monitors the follow-on arrangements concerning the forthcoming
expiry of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) between the United
States and Russia as well as any possible effects thereof in our neighbouring
areas.

Finland employs arms control measures to prevent the proliferation of biological
and chemical weapons, substances and associated expertise. Finland continues
to support the destruction of Russia’s chemical weapon stockpiles under the
Global Partnership Program, which was launched by the G8 countries in 2002.
Finland participates extensively in the implementation of the programme.

103


-----

The EU Strategy on small arms and light weapons (SALW) provides the
framework for Finnish SALW-related action. Finland fully supports the UN
Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in
Small Arms and Light Weapons as well as the regional activities of the EU and
the OSCE. Finland, being one of the original sponsors of the project, actively
contributes to the process aiming at the conclusion of an international Arms
Trade Treaty (ATT).

Finland participates in the international efforts to respond to humanitarian
concerns caused by cluster munitions. Finland takes part in the negotiations on
the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) in Geneva.

Finland carries out an evaluation of defence capabilities and analyses the
international development work along with the supply and cost options of
cluster munitions. The Cabinet Committee on Foreign and Security Policy will
monitor the situation on an annual basis. The Oslo Convention banning the use
of cluster munitions shall be revisited once the evaluation and analysis have
been completed.

Finland participates in the implementation of the Oslo Convention on Cluster
Munitions by supporting humanitarian mine action.

Finland has pledged to join the Ottawa Mine Ban Convention in 2012 and to
destroy its anti-personnel mine stockpiles by the end of 2016. Finland supports
humanitarian mine action which reduces the post-confl ict threat and impact of
landmines and unexploded ordnance, cluster munitions included.

Finland believes that the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE)
contributes to stability in Europe. Finland hopes that the parties could reach
agreement on how to continue with the regime and that the Adapted CFE
Treaty could be ratifi ed.

Finland monitors developments in the fi eld of international arms control,
anticipates their effects on Finland’s national defence and takes them into
account in Defence Forces development programmes. The defence
establishment, for its part, fulfi ls the various obligations included in
international arms control agreements as well as supports and participates in
inter-authority cooperation relating to arms control.

104


-----

#### Security and development

Finland strengthens societies’ capabilities to respond to the needs of their
citizens and eradicate the root causes of security threats by conducting a longterm and consistent development policy in its various forms of operation. By
doing so violent confl icts can be prevented, structural inequality diminished and
opportunities for the underprivileged to make a difference in their individual
and national development improved. The underlying root causes of violent
crises related to political, economic and social structural problems must be
addressed. This requires support for social, economic and environmentally
sustainable development. Finnish assistance activities emphasise local
ownership and responsibility. The objective is to promote good governance
and the rule of law.

Finland promotes coherent crisis management, development cooperation and
humanitarian aid in line with EU Council decisions concerning security and
development. The ambition is to bring about a comprehensive approach in
preventing and controlling confl icts as well as in post-confl ict management. Both
security and development actors have separate, yet mutually complementary,
roles and responsibilities.

Finland supports the reconciliation of armed confl icts as well as peace processes
and post-confl ict reconstruction through the means traditionally employed in
development cooperation. Respect for human rights is an essential element of
preventing and controlling armed confl icts.

Environmental issues and sustainable use of natural resources as well as HIV/
AIDS prevention are taken into account in peacebuilding.

Finland supports the strengthening of judicial processes in transition societies.
These include, inter alia, truth and reconciliation processes, the development
of independent courts, and redress arrangements for victims of war crimes and
human rights violations.

Finland supports the development of post-confl ict societies’ indigenous security
structures as well as the disarmament and reintegration of ex-combatants.
Democratically controlled national armed forces as well as integrated police
forces and a well-functioning judiciary are integral elements of peacebuilding
and the rule of law.

Particular attention is paid to coherence between crisis management and
development cooperation so as to make personnel resources and funding

105


-----

options cater to the needs of comprehensive crisis management. The
possibilities of development cooperation are utilised in accordance with
Finland’s Development Policy Programme. In order to secure the continuation
of crisis management, sources of funding for security sector reform must be
mutually complementary.

#### The Foreign Service and representation abroad

The core task of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs is the implementation of Finland’s
foreign and security policy by means of diplomacy and the maintaining of
international relations. The signifi cance of preventive diplomacy, comprehensive
international networks and cooperation mechanisms is increasingly emphasised
in the globalising world. The Finnish Foreign Service is facing new demands.

The Foreign Ministry’s global network of diplomatic missions serves the entire
Finnish society. Other administrative branches engage in international activities
as well. A study on Finland’s representation abroad was written so as to take
the needs of the citizens, the business sector and the central government into
consideration as well as to avoid unnecessary overlap.

The expanding fi eld of responsibilities of the Foreign Service, deepening
interdependence and the global repercussions of even distant events call for
fl exibility, extensive expertise and the maintenance of a broad and competent
network, both at home and abroad.

Growing business and leisure travel raises citizens’ expectations of the Foreign
Service. The Foreign Service must be able to provide a full range of services as
well as up-to-date travel advice and warnings. In order to assist Finns abroad,
the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and its diplomatic missions are guaranteed
suffi cient consular service staff and response capabilities as well as effi cient and
timely provision of information to the public, the media and the authorities.

Finland prepares for a labour shortage because, despite the recession, the
demographic trend in Finland will result in a signifi cant increase of pensioners.
As a consequence of increasing work-related and other immigration, the
associated public services, under the purview of the Ministry of the Interior, will
become an important part of the work of Finnish missions abroad.

Suffi cient resources for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs are guaranteed in
order to cope with the constantly growing demands on the Foreign Service,
the ageing of its staff, increasing competition for a skilled workforce and the
requirements of the State productivity programme.

106


-----

Finland implements its foreign and security policy, fi rst and foremost, as a
Member State of the European Union. Increasing EU cooperation requires
additional secondments to the main bodies of the Union.

Finland endorses the establishment of a European External Action Service
included in the Treaty of Lisbon. This would create continuity in the conduct
of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The External Action Service
would open up new vistas for small Member States as they have only limited
opportunities in setting up national missions.

Finland endeavours to second a signifi cant number of civil servants to the
European External Action Service. The Union’s External Action Service would
broaden the Finnish civil servants’ fi eld of operations, increase their infl uence
and add to their competence. This would not diminish the need for Finland’s
own diplomatic representation.

#### Finland’s defence

The pillars of Finland’s defence capability are an active defence policy, military
defence, society’s other resources and international cooperation. The defence
capability is scaled in accordance with the security and defence policy guidelines
established by the state leadership. The primary goal is to prevent military
force being used against Finland.

Defence policy instruments promote the security of the state and the population,
support national decision-making and create the preconditions for a credible
defence. An active defence policy provides a wider range of instruments for the
state leadership and supports Finland’s foreign and security policy goals.

The defence establishment networks with national and international actors.
The aim is to strengthen Finland’s status, infl uence the security environment
and maintain defence capability. Proper situational awareness of the security
environment is a necessary requirement for planning and implementing
defence policy.

Finland’s military defence is based on a robust defence system implemented
in accordance with territorial defence principles, general conscription and a
strong will to defend the nation as well as international military cooperation.

A comprehensive approach is vital from the standpoint of defence capability.
The public and private sectors and NGOs engage in national and international

107


-----

cooperation as regards different security situations, in line with the principles
of the comprehensive defence approach and the SVFS Strategy. This approach
makes it possible to commit the resources of the whole society to the defence of
the nation whilst securing the other functions vital to society. Correspondingly,
military capabilities can be assigned to support the other authorities as they
prevent different crises facing society.

The European Union and NATO are key organisations in terms of military
capabilities and international military crisis management. Finland also
participates in the activities of the UN and the OSCE and cooperates with
NGOs. Nordic cooperation and bilateral cooperation with countries that share
Finland’s objectives in areas including crisis management and capabilities
development are also important to Finland.

**The preconditions of a credible defence include:**

**- An unambiguous desired end state and a strategy for**
**achieving it,**

**- Situational awareness,**

**- A reliable Command and Control system,**

**- Competent personnel,**

**- Suitable materiel,**

**- Capable troops,**

**- Suffi cient funding,**

**- Up-to-date legislation,**

**- Appropriate infrastructure, and**

**- A strong will to defend the nation.**

The long-term maintenance and development of the defence capability are
based on the goals adopted by the state leadership as well as the strategic
plans of the Ministry of Defence and the Defence Forces, built on these goals.
The strategic plan of the Defence Ministry lays the foundation for long-term
planning and development within the administrative branch. The strategic plan
of the Defence Forces provides long-term guidelines for the maintenance and
development of defence capabilities. Strategic planning is implemented via
medium-term and short-term plans.

Research, foresight and evaluation seek to identify changes that could impact
its activities and the defence capability. They also establish the grounds for
comprehensive development and assess the impact of said activities. The
Ministry of Defence aims to further improve its capability to maintain an active
role in central government and to lead its administrative sector.

#### Employment of the defence capability

The Defence Forces, pursuant to their statutory tasks, are employed in the
military defence of Finland, in supporting the other authorities as well as in
international military crisis management.

**Finland’s military defence**

Finland prepares to repel the use of military force, or the threat thereof,
against the nation. This highlights the importance of deterrence. The defence
capability and readiness are scaled to correspond to the situation at hand.

In line with the comprehensive approach, it is necessary to estimate whether it
is possible to carry out the required tasks with national capabilities alone. Should
the capabilities prove inadequate, during normal conditions it is necessary to
guarantee the reception of military and other assistance needed in a crisis
situation. This can be achieved through close international cooperation or
through being allied with others.

Finland’s membership of the European Union also requires national military
capability so as to implement the mutual assistance obligation and the solidarity
clause.

Defence planners prepare for different scenarios in order to achieve the
strategic goals of foreign, security and defence policy.

Strategic goals set the requirements for the Defence Forces’ capabilities and
activities:

|Strategic goals|Requirement|Precondition|
|---|---|---|
|Guaranteeing the freedom of action of the state leadership|- Situational awareness - Deterrence - P articipation in international military crisis management|- Credibility - Interoperability - C omprehensive defence approach|
|Guaranteeing the livelihood and basic rights of the population|In addition to the above: - T he capability to assist other authorities - P rotecting vital targets and functions|In addition to the above: - S uffi cient and adequately trained and equipped troops|
|Defending Finland’s territorial integrity and independence|In addition to the above: - T he ability to conduct joint operations in key areas - T he ability to receive assistance from abroad|In addition to the above: - H ighly capable troops|



109


-----

Finland does not expect to face the prospect of military pressure or armed
aggression outside the context of a wider international confl ict.

For example, the protection of interests associated with the population and
society’s vital functions may create confl icts in our neighbouring areas as well.
These, in extreme cases, may have military repercussions on Finland, possibly
resulting in armed aggression or the threat thereof.

Finland must maintain correctly scaled deterrence to prevent and repel any
military threats to the nation. Moreover, Finns and foreigners alike must
consider the deterrence credible. It must be possible to detect early enough
the emergence and sudden escalation of threats so as to provide suffi cient
early-warning in normal conditions in order to bolster defence readiness.

Deterrence demands that the Defence Forces be capable of repelling an attack.
The requirements for this are:

-  A comprehensive situation picture and early-warning capability,

-  Constant readiness in the chain of command,

-  Highly capable key troops and systems in every service,

-  Good operational mobility across the nation,

-  The capability of cooperating with the other authorities and key actors of
the business sector,

-  Adequate self-suffi ciency in logistics,

-  The capability to fl exibly reallocate resources and control readiness as
required, and

-  International interoperability.

The Defence Forces must be able to operate in the entire area of the nation
and to create the centre of gravity of defence as required. The goal of territorial
defence is to engage the aggressor at the border and prevent him from
reaching strategically vital areas and targets, and to frustrate his ambitions to
paralyse functions vital to Finnish society. Suffi cient local superiority is created
in selected decisive areas to repel and defeat an aggressor.

Defence Forces’ troops comprise both the most capable operational mobile
units that are used across the nation and regional troops.

The army maintains control over militarily important areas and, supported
by the other services, protects the functions and targets vital to society.
Operational units as well as all services’ joint operations constitute the force
multipliers by which an aggressor will be defeated.

110


-----

The services support each other and participate in joint operations. The troops’
operational principles and equipment are tailored to the Finnish climate and
geographical conditions.

Maritime defence secures the vital sea lanes by protecting shipping against
threats from the air, the surface and below the surface all the way from the
open sea to port. Moreover, naval attacks are repelled.

Air defence protects targets of national importance, denies an aggressor air
superiority and repels attacks from the air.

The services are supported by joint intelligence, surveillance, logistics and
targeting as well as by increasing the effect of engagement. Elements of joint
effect include, among other things, long-range fi repower such as air-to-ground
fi re against an adversary’s key functions and targets.

The Defence Forces command, control, communications, computers,
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems generate an
integrated military situation picture (land, sea and air as well as information
and the IT environment). The national system is utilised to expedite planning,
command and control and execution. Defence capability against an adversary’s
cyber attacks is maintained and improved. The nationwide logistic system taps
into the resources of the entire society in supporting military defence.

The Border Guard, an integral element of the defence system, participate in
national defence. Border Guard units can be seconded to the Defence Forces
when readiness is raised. The situation picture, checks, territorial surveillance
and counter-special forces operations are of great importance in preventing
and repelling armed aggression. Border Guard troops’ composition, operational
principles and materiel are being developed.

**Assisting the other authorities**

In line with the Strategy to Secure the Functions Vital to Society (SSFV),
the different branches of administration prepare to support the defence
establishment in the military defence of Finland. Correspondingly, the defence
establishment assists the other authorities in all security situations when their
own resources prove insuffi cient for the tasks at hand. The Defence Forces
offer their broadest possible special expertise, capabilities and resources for
society’s use.

111


-----

In line with the principles of the solidarity clause, Finland is prepared to provide
military executive assistance to the other EU Member States.

The Defence Forces’ capability to assist the other authorities is based on
contingency planning and readiness exercises that focus on the means available
along with lead times and collaboration practices. Defence Forces assets are
particularly suitable for activities such as explosive ordnance disposal, cordoning
off areas, search and rescue and traffi c control as well as diving operations.
In addition, the Defence Forces assist the other authorities with NBC defence
and rescue services, intelligence information and by supporting environmental
rescue efforts.

Assistance from the Defence Forces includes niche capabilities, equipment
suited to executive assistance, suffi cient manpower as well as capabilities
that support logistics and command. The Defence Forces are prepared to use
military force in counter-terrorist activities at the request of the police and
under their leadership.

Close intersectoral cooperation prevents unnecessary duplication and facilitates
rapid access to the means of assistance. The Defence Forces prepare to provide
executive assistance on the basis of jointly prepared contingency plans as well
as ad hoc requests for any immediately available resources. Even immediately
provided executive assistance can include a wide range of instruments.

The Defence Forces provide executive assistance approximately 400-500 times
per year. Local defence troops are also used in these tasks.

**Participation in international military crisis management**

Finland participates in international crisis management in order to control wideranging security threats. This is based on a comprehensive approach which
utilises different forms of participation. In addition to foreign and security policy
goals, crisis management cooperation strengthens Finland’s national defence.
The target level of military crisis management and participation criteria are
defi ned in chapter 4, section ‘Crisis management’.

Finland participates in EU, NATO, UN and OSCE-led crisis management
operations. When it comes to practical collaboration on the ground, Nordic
countries, the key EU countries and nonaligned PfP countries, such as Ireland
and Austria, are the most important partners.

112


-----

Finland primarily deploys land forces to military crisis management operations.
The capabilities of the navy and the air force to participate in crisis management
operations are being developed.

Operations take place farther and farther away and rapid reaction capabilities are
becoming increasingly important in their implementation. Crisis management
contingents are technologically, tactically and operationally interoperable and
widely deployable in various conditions. They can operate in all forms of crisis
management, ranging from combat forces tasks to humanitarian operations.

In the future, both national and the EU’s and NATO’s collaborative strategic and
tactical transport arrangements will support crisis management participation.
For example, Finland gains access to strategic airlift capabilities through a
collaborative arrangement that encompasses ten NATO nations, Sweden and
Finland.

Crisis management capabilities are divided into rapid reaction, lower readiness,
niche capabilities and enablers. Rapid reaction troops require high readiness,
continuous training and a sustained operational capability. Lower readiness
troops are also required in the stabilisation and continuation phases of future
operations. Niche capabilities can belong to rapid reaction or lower readiness
capabilities.

The Defence Forces use the same troops and materiel in national defence as
in international crisis management. All troops deployed to operations must
be suffi ciently trained and suitably equipped to also carry out demanding
crisis management tasks. They must be prepared to operate amid chemical,
biological and radiological agents.

A diverse troop register comprising versatile capabilities is the optimal enabler
of comprehensive crisis management participation and fl exible decisionmaking.

Civil-military cooperation is being improved. Military crisis management
capabilities are prepared so that they can be used in supporting other crisis
management actors. The assistance could include cooperation in materiel,
logistics, expert assistance and situational awareness.

Finland shall also create suffi cient preparedness for expert assistance
and security sector reform as well as disarming and reintegrating former
combatants.

113


-----

#### Improving the defence capability

Defence capability is developed to repel attacks and meet the requirements
of protecting the key areas and functions of the nation. The capability and
preparedness of the Defence Forces to also provide assistance to the authorities
is improved. The need to upgrade capabilities for progressively more demanding
operations is taken into account in military crisis management. As defence
is developed, care is taken that no practical obstacles for possible military
alignment are created.

National and international cooperation guarantees interoperability, costeffective development and competence. Wide-ranging cooperation provides
for the internationalisation of Finnish competence and expertise.

National networking particularly develops competence and a sustainable and
comprehensive infrastructure. Networking raises society’s crisis tolerance and
security of supply. Close cooperation between the authorities, the business
sector, non-governmental organisations and individual citizens bolsters the will
to defend the nation.

The European Union and NATO provide natural venues for developing the
national defence and military crisis management capabilities. International
networking enables the provision and reception of assistance, participation in
crisis management, cost-effective procurement projects and better security of
supply. Cooperation is especially intensifi ed with the Nordic countries, the most
important EU countries, the United States and the Baltic Sea nations.

Finland participates in the EU’s long-term strategy and Headline Goal processes
as well as military capabilities development in the European Defence Agency.
Finland supports closer defence materiel cooperation as part of the EU’s
deepening security and defence dimension. Through its participation Finland
aims to create the preconditions for, inter alia, cost-effective procurement
projects, wide-ranging capabilities cooperation, defence-related R&D and
participation in European defence industry cooperation.

The European Security Strategy, capabilities cooperation and lessons learned
from crisis management operations are taken into consideration when the
focus areas of the Defence Forces’ international activity and military crisis
management capabilities are reviewed.

European Security and Defence Policy emphasises capabilities that can
be used in several different types and phases of operations. The European

114


-----

Defence Agency endeavours to develop the following six capability domains:
Command, Inform, Engage, Protect, Deploy and Sustain. Interoperability
requirements increase along with expanding crisis management activities and
closer international cooperation. It is necessary to ensure that the development
projects of the EDA and NATO are both compatible and complementary.

Finland actively participates in the development of military interoperability
and capabilities under the auspices of NATO’s PfP programme, as well as in
reforming the modes of PfP cooperation.

Finland aims to increase military cooperation with Russia to improve the safety
of navigation in the Baltic Sea, among other things.

Trilateral cooperation between Finland, Sweden and Norway continues on the
basis of a progress report submitted in June 2008. In addition to traditional
Nordic crisis management cooperation, collaboration is being intensifi ed
in maritime and air surveillance, logistics, training, defence-related R&D
and materiel cooperation. Denmark and Iceland will also participate in this
cooperation in the future.

Despite their dissimilar basic defence solutions the Nordic armed forces face
similar challenges. Moreover, numerous international crisis management
issues unite the Nordic nations. The goal of cooperation is to rein in budgetary
pressures induced by the rising costs of operations and defence materiel as
well as improve interoperability. In the long term this cooperation is reckoned
to improve the participating countries’ capabilities.

Closer Nordic cooperation entails permanent structural arrangements between
the participating countries, such as liaison offi cer exchanges. The effects
of this cooperation are taken into account in the Defence Forces’ long-term
development programme.

**Maintaining and improving the Defence Forces’ capabilities**

The Defence Forces capabilities are developed for all defence tasks, ensuring
the troops’ and systems’ ability to participate in international operations.

The defence system is an entity that comprises a command and control system,
an intelligence and surveillance system, a readiness control system, a logistics
system and troop structure, i.e. all services’ command echelons and units.

115


-----

A particular challenge to defence development is the rapid obsolescence of
army equipment in the middle of the next decade.

The combined capability of the Defence Forces consists of maintaining and
developing the capabilities of:

-  Command and control,

-  Intelligence, surveillance and targeting,

-  Joint effects,

-  Logistics,

-  Land defence,

-  Maritime defence, and

-  Air defence.

The combined capability equals the sum total of the effects of the individual
capability domains.

The number of wartime troops will be reduced in the long term, refl ecting the
changes in the security environment and available resources as well as the
diminishing annual conscript intakes and the ageing of materiel. Appendix 1
lists the Defence Forces’ key wartime troops.

The organisational make-up of regional troops is made more adaptable,
thereby allowing for more active tactical solutions in defensive operations.
The fi repower, force protection and especially the tactical mobility of the most
important regional units is being upgraded.

Pursuant to the Government Security and Defence Policy Report 2004, the
focus of defence development is on air defence until 2012. Thereafter, the
focus shifts to the army’s regional troops. In the post-2016 period the army’s
operational units are to be upgraded.

**Operational command is upgraded by continuing with the construction**
of a command and control (C2) system capable of effi ciently controlling all
capabilities. The integrated C4ISR system will generate accurate information
for the military situation picture as well as information for planning purposes,
execution and battle damage assessment.

The focus is on creating joint situational awareness as well as secure IT services.
The Defence Forces’ joint C2 system will replace the services’ standalone legacy
systems and applications. Network-centric warfare is taken into consideration
in development.

116


-----

The highest national expertise is utilised in developing the Defence Forces’ IT
systems.

**Intelligence, surveillance and targeting are developed in line with the**
requirements of the security environment. Focus areas include better earlywarning capability, the capability to analyse and replicate the situation picture
as well as the generation of a real-time surveillance and targeting picture.
Concurrently, systems that do not support the joint C4ISR system will be
decommissioned.

The present coverage of the C4ISR system is maintained and system integration
will be increased. This also facilitates the real-time targeting of long-range
weapon systems.

**Joint effects comprise a targeting system, a targeting information system,**
weapon systems and ordnance as well as non-kinetic technologies. The goal
is to engage the adversary’s major operations and key functions or structures.
Focus areas include operational fi repower and replacing legacy artillery systems
with new munitions and an air-to-ground capability.

**Logistics are improved by creating a joint logistic system for the Defence**
Forces with the focus on supporting the operational units. The most important
improvements involve replenishment and transport assets.

Logistic operations employ uniform basic structures and operational principles
in all security situations. The Defence Forces cooperate under the auspices
of strategic partnerships as well as with the other authorities, companies and
NGOs in order to meet the requirements and needs of emergency conditions.

International networking is intensifi ed. Logistic planning takes into account the
possibility of receiving assistance from abroad as well as the provision of host
nation support.

**Land defence capabilities consist of mobile operational units that possess**
formidable fi repower as well as the regional troops, which are being reformed.
During the period of this Report the focus of land defence is on upgrading the
present regional troops, supported by transforming the army’s present depot
and training structure.

The most important regional troops will have the capability to engage in
active defence. Ground surveillance and night vision capabilities are being
improved.

117


-----

As regards the operational units the focus is on maintaining the capabilities of
the army’s three readiness brigades.

Pursuant to the Security and Defence Report 2004, Finland will destroy its
anti-personnel mines by 2016. It is possible to replace a part of the landmines’
purpose with special munitions, Claymore mines and ground surveillance
sensors as well as modern anti-tank mines.

Relating to the development of capabilities, the Defence Forces will analyse
progress concerning international development work on cluster munitions and
their procurement options and costs.

**Maritime defence development focuses on protecting the sea lanes vital**
to society. The maritime defence capability is sustained by replacing fi xed
defences with mobile systems.

The mine-laying capacity will be improved during the period of this Report.
An internationally interoperable minelayer squadron will reach full operational
capability by 2012. This coincides with improvements in underwater
surveillance.

National and international situational awareness as well as inter-authority
cooperation is improved. Coastal units’ protective gear, mobility and fi repower
are upgraded.

**Air defence is developed with the goal of maintaining and improving the**
capability to defend targets and create local air superiority in the most important
areas. The focus is on modernising the ground-based air defence of the capital
region. Fighter defence performance is kept abreast of progress and the battle
damage tolerance of air bases is improved.

The prospects of increasing international cooperation as well as the associated
requirements will be taken into consideration when the air force’s pilot training
system is being developed.

**Border Guard wartime troops’ development is included in the**
abovementioned capabilities. The focus is on improving the surveillance and
situation picture system, mobility and force protection, command and control
as well as intelligence and combat equipment.

118


-----

**Human resources and competence**

Regular personnel

The defence establishment’s human resources management centres on the costeffective training of competent and profi cient personnel, in line with wartime
capability requirements. The age structure of personnel is maintained so as to
meet the requirements of wartime troops. These are the basic premises that
steer the quantitative and qualitative development of the human resources
management system.

The defence establishment must assure the suffi cient recruitment of competent
personnel in the continuously increasing competition for skilled workforce.

Qualitative improvements guarantee competent and motivated personnel.
Furthermore, they improve the Defence Forces’ attractiveness as an employer.
Quantitative measures regulate the personnel structure and ensure the
allocation of human resources to functions that will be developed.

The requirements of international cooperation and military crisis management
are taken into account in the human resources management system.
International assignments shall be considered a plus with regard to a person’s
career advancement. Particular attention must be paid to informing personnel
serving in international assignments of their next domestic post as early as is
possible. The terms of service of military crisis management personnel shall
be improved.

The presence of the defence establishment in international structures,
particularly in the European Union and NATO, shall be increased.

Persons liable for military service

General conscription is the basic pillar of our national defence. The social
impact of conscription also extends beyond that of military defence. These
impacts shall be further analysed.

All able-bodied men in the annual age groups must be trained in order to
generate the required wartime reserve. The number of men who do not serve
as conscripts and national service dropouts has increased in recent years. At
present approximately 80% of the age group completes the national service. If
the number of those not serving continues to rise, it may jeopardise the entire
conscription system. This could also generate other social repercussions. The

119


-----

reasons for dropping out, as well as preventing this trend, must be tackled via
the different sectors of society. In addition, the training arrangements of those
that do not serve as conscripts must be improved.

In order to secure the functioning of general conscription in the future as well,
the substance of conscript service must be further improved. The economic
and social status of conscripts must be upgraded in order to improve their
motivation. Special attention will be paid to the status of conscripts who
serve longer period. In order to improve the physical fi tness of conscripts
the defence establishment shall cooperate with other administrative branches
and organisations before the conscripts enrol in national service. Another aim
is to increase the recognition of national service in civilian studies, where
appropriate. Suitable advancement in their duties, incentives included, shall be
provided to reservists.

Individual skills must be better recognised and utilised in conscript and reservist
training. The quality and syllabus of the training system is improved to better
meet the needs of the Defence Forces. Refresher exercises concentrate on
increasing the performance of operational units and local defence troops.

A report shall be made on improving the call-up system; the objective of the
study is to modernise the system to better serve the needs of the Defence
Forces. Women are encouraged to enrol in voluntary armed service

Voluntary defence activities are developed to better serve the Defence Forces’
total capability in training and maintaining wartime troops, among other things.
Voluntary defence training increases the capability of operational units and the
most important regional troops as well as the Defence Forces’ capability in
providing assistance to the other authorities. Voluntary defence training also
generates competence and readiness for comprehensive defence.

The National Defence Training Association of Finland trains citizens and
organisations on topics ranging from everyday security to the most demanding
situations in emergency conditions. In its training activities the Association
cooperates with the competent authorities as well as other organisations.

The Defence Forces only have the capability of improving the conscription
system. An intersectoral working group, led by the Ministry of Labour and the
Economy, shall assess the options for improving the content of non-military
service. As non-military service is developed, care must be taken that its
substance serves society’s various crisis preparedness requirements. Those

120


-----

liable for non-military service must be taken into consideration as regards crisis
preparedness.

Reports on the wider impacts of conscription, guaranteeing the functioning
of conscription as well as developing non-military service shall be prepared
without delay. Once the reports have been completed, immediate actions shall
be taken.

**Materiel and research**

In order to guarantee credible and modern defence capabilities, the aim is to
spend a third of defence appropriations on materiel procurement.

In principle, only such materiel which is tested and in operational service
elsewhere is procured for the Defence Forces. This applies, particularly, to
foreign procurements. NATO interoperability is typically a requirement. The
maintenance of interoperability calls for life cycle-long cooperation within the
user community and requirements harmonisation. Life cycle management of
materiel is continuously improved.

International defence materiel cooperation lays the foundation for providing
and receiving foreign military assistance, guaranteeing the security of supply
as well as cost-effective procurement projects. Furthermore, it enhances
the Defence Forces’ ability to participate in international crisis management
operations.

If the Finnish defence industry intends to succeed in the international market,
it must continuously update itself and make suffi cient investments in R&D. The
competitiveness of the domestic industry is strengthened in accordance with
the Defence Ministry’s Defence and Security Industrial Strategy.

The primary purpose of industrial participation being included in large
procurement projects is to guarantee the vital maintenance and integration
expertise for the materiel in question. Furthermore, it facilitates the participation
of the domestic defence industry in procurement projects as well as the transfer
of new technologies to the industrial and research community. Direct projectrelated industrial participation involving the domestic industry is prioritised.

Domestic production and competence are particularly important in system
integration, situational awareness expertise, command and control as well
as NBC defence and land forces mobility. The integration and maintenance
skills of the domestic defence and security industry as well as crisis repair

121


-----

capabilities are also vital from the perspective of security of supply and
society’s crisis tolerance. The defence industry’s export promotion as well as
its internationalisation is actively sponsored.

Gunpowder and ordnance manufacturing capabilities, including the associated
know-how, are retained for the time being. A comprehensive report on the
long-term availability of heavy ordnance and gunpowder for the Defence
Forces shall be submitted by 2010.

A guaranteed defence capability requires national and international
arrangements-based collaboration as well as long-term strategic partnerships
with materiel and service providers. Strategic partnerships create long-term
relationships and such modi operandi between the industry and the Defence
Forces that function well even in the different phases of raising military
readiness.

The launching, implementation and life cycle management of Defence Forces
projects are supported through long-term R&D programmes. The Defence
Forces research programmes prioritise the key capabilities as well as areas
which best generate competence for the national defence. Simultaneously,
they boost the competitiveness of the defence and security industry. When
it comes to technological research, the possibility of increasing jointly funded
projects is explored.

The Defence Forces participate in European research and technology strategy
cooperation as well as joint research projects, particularly, within the European
Defence Agency. Whenever possible, national research and technology projects
are merged with European R&D cooperation projects, bilateral or multilateral,
that are commissioned by the EDA or some other body.

The interrelationship of technical research, the technology branch and other
R&D activities is strengthened. The activities of the Scientifi c Advisory Board for
Defence are further developed to better support the comprehensive defence
approach as well as national security research guidelines and strategic planning
within the administrative branch.

**Infrastructure and the environment**

By way of developing the defence establishment’s infrastructure and
environment, it is possible to ensure that suitable grounds, premises and
structures, such as garrisons, depots, live fi re ranges and training areas for the
military defence are appropriately maintained.

122


-----

As part of the surrounding society, the Defence Forces’ areas are developed in
a sustainable and consistent manner. National defence requirements must be
taken into consideration in land use planning in accordance with the nationwide
land development goals.

Real estate costs are taken into consideration in policy and programme planning.
Individual projects are cost-effectively implemented by paying special attention
to life cycle expenses, and are in line with the state’s real estate strategies.

Particular attention is being paid to eliminating health hazards at premises and
to repairs that improve energy effi ciency, upgrading the explosives storage
system, live fi re ranges and training areas during the period of this Report.

It must be possible to fl exibly close properties, premises and structures that
are no longer needed because of organisational and functional changes in
the Defence Forces. As real estate framework agreements are renewed,
the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Finance shall together review all
germane administrative, fi nancial and legal issues.

Defence materiel storage shall be concentrated and some stores as well as
depots be closed. By the end of 2012 explosives storage conditions shall meet
the requirements.

The report on state IT services, the administrative network security project
and the development of information management structures shall be taken
into account as information management partnerships are being developed.

The key objective of the defence establishment’s environmental policy is to see
to it that the military defence has the proper environment-related operational
and development preconditions. Operational considerations permitting, the
environmental perspective shall be observed in all activities.

There are many special features in military activities that differ from civilian
activities. These must also be taken into account when real estate and
environmental legislation and other standards are being reviewed. This
particularly applies to Finland’s sustainable development, the implementation
of climate and energy strategies as well as the Defence Forces’ live fi re training,
exercises and fl ight operations. As the operating environment changes,
suffi cient airspace must be earmarked for military aviation.

The defence establishment’s community and environment branch is developed
in cooperation with the European Union, NATO and the Nordic countries.

123


-----

Its goals include effi ciency, cost-effectiveness, interoperability, improved
crisis management activities and endorsing the multinational use of military
facilities.

**The will to defend the nation**

A strong will to defend the nation is the bedrock of military defence.
Transparent and rational action strengthens support of the citizens and public
opinion towards defence policy objectives and the Defence Forces’ activities.
It is possible to maintain and promote the will to defend the nation and a
favourable opinion of the Defence Forces by making it easier for citizens to
enrol in voluntary defence activities.

The citizens’ will to defend the nation is expressed in favourable opinions
towards national defence, general conscription and Defence Forces’ activities
as well as participation in international military crisis management, to name
a few. Voluntary defence training and the active participation of businesses
and NGOs in defence-related activities play a key role in maintaining a robust
defence will.

General national defence instruction is conducted on National Defence Courses
and Provincial Defence Courses, their respective Advanced and Continuing
Education Courses as well as in Special Courses on National Defence. National
defence courses are conducted by the Defence Forces and the regional courses
by the civilian authorities, supported by the Defence Forces. When regional
administration is reorganised, care must be taken that regional defence courses
retain their high quality.

Defence courses increase comprehensive defence approach-expertise among
persons in leadership positions as well as among those occupying key
preparedness positions. Moreover, they improve the collaboration possibilities
between the different actors of society.

**The Defence Forces’ organisation**

The Defence Forces’ peacetime organisation and command echelons are
primarily tailored to meet wartime requirements. The key objective of
administrative reform is to free up administrative resources for key wartime
functions. Among other things, command structures are streamlined by seeking
to achieve synergies using IT systems.

124


-----

While the requirements of the Government Productivity Programme are taken
into consideration in the development of the administrative branch, they must
not compromise the Defence Forces’ core functions. The goal is to develop
activities and to extensively assess different strategic partnership options.
In addition to studying the direct costs and synergies, the impacts of the
requirements on interest groups and society, crisis preparedness, security of
supply, competence requirements and the Defence Forces’ capabilities shall
also be analysed.

The training system is scaled to correspond to the shrinking annual age groups.
The Defence Forces’ training organisation and the basic structure of the army,
navy and air force shall be reviewed by 2011. Regional military command
headquarters shall be downgraded to regional offi ces by 2010. A report on
developing the services’ materiel commands as well as a follow-up study on
the implementation of the army’s military logistics partnership shall be made.

As the needs for reforming the peacetime and wartime structures of the navy
and the air force are reviewed, centralised surveillance, command and control,
use of aircraft and vessels as well as the base structure and the capabilities
developed for international crisis management shall be taken into account.

The National Defence University educates the training personnel and wartime
commanders for the Defence Forces. The tasks of the National Defence
University are military research and education which builds on the results of
this research and best possible practices in education. The University interacts
with society and generates leadership and expertise as regards security, crises,
wars and securing the vital functions to society. The staff of the University
forms a skeleton wartime army corps headquarters.

#### Resources

A credible defence capability and the implementation of statutory tasks require
guaranteed long-term assets for the defence establishment.

The goals of maintaining, improving and employing the defence capability
presented in this Security and Defence Policy Report can be achieved with the
2008 real term level defence appropriations, revised in line with cost increases
caused by technological advances. This requires, barring any organisational
changes, full compensation for annual price and cost increases as well as an
annual 2% increase in defence appropriations as of 2011.

125


-----

Additional needs on defence procurements caused by fl uctuations in exchange
rates as well as other unanticipated changes in costs will be separately assessed
during the planning period as government spending limits or budget proposals
are discussed. In addition, the possibly increasing quality of maintenance
at government premises needs to be covered, in case the present owner of
premises does not pay for it.

The increasing requirements of crisis management require that annual crisis
management appropriations be gradually raised to EUR 150 million. Crisis
management operations are funded in accordance with established budgeting
principles.

Balanced defence capability development and maintenance require that
approximately one third of available resources be allocated to the maintenance
of materiel readiness, approximately one third to personnel expenses and
approximately one third to other operational expenses.

The personnel strength of the Defence Forces shall remain at the level of
approximately 15,000 persons. The number of regular personnel may decrease
as a result of possible Public-Private-Partnership arrangements. The number
of uniformed personnel, however, is not being cut from the present level.
None of the abovementioned partnerships may lower the level of defence
appropriations. Neither the Ministry of Defence nor other agencies and bodies
in the administrative branch are included in this assessment.
