###### Ricardo Lagos Escobar


_President of the Republic of Chile_


#### Foreword by the President of the Republic

###### As with all public assets, Defense must benefit everyone equally, but it is a service that can only be provided by the public sector.

 This is why the citizens must take responsibility for ana- lyzing and determining the best defense policy, including its objectives and direction, as well as the most effective and efficient way to achieve these with the public funds allocated to this sector. This second edition of the Book of Defense contributes to this analysis and allows for a more transparent discussion of these issues, at both the nation- al and the international level. Of special importance in this sense, is the standardized measuring of military ex- penses in Chile and Argentine, which both countries car- ried out in conjunction with the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC). This standardized measuring constitutes an open proposal to the region as a whole and to other devel- oping countries.

 The Armed Forces are a part of Chile, a country that is integrating rapidly into the world through an open and pluralistic democratic system, which aims to ensure growth with equity. They have regained their republican status, which was ensured to them shortly after Chile ob- tained its independence as a nation. Today, as along with the rest of the public sector, they are working towards modernization through democracy.

 Consequently, the Armed Forces participate in the living history of the Chilean people. Far from being predeter- mined, this history marked by our quests and by our dis- agreements, by our successes and our mistakes. On the national level, in a democracy, this involves a search for institutions that serve all Chilean citizens. The purpose of National Security is to assure that this effort is not inter- rupted by external aggression.


-----

###### The Ministry of National Defense directs this process, beginning with an appraisal of the regional and global security situation, which is flexible and must incorpo- rate the political, economic and social dynamics of inter- national relations. Modernization involves the incorpo- ration of strategic systems of the future, including sus- tained development to achieve full interoperability among the Armed Forces services.

 Chile’s objectives are not aggressive; they are dissuasive. Chile and its Armed Forces are working towards peace in the region and in the world. It is therefore a cause of pride to us to see our flag in Peacekeeping Operations of the United Nations.

 There are still important issues that need to be addressed: a modern defense requires updating the Armed Forces so- cial security system and reorganizing the upper echelons of the Ministry of Defense. The integration of women into the Armed Forces will be an issue of growing importance. We have also opened a debate on how the annual De- fense budget should be financed.

 The progress compiled in this Book of National Defense and the definitions which we, as a country, will continue to adopt in this sphere, are and will be directed towards achieving our will to guarantee peace in a safer world for all of us.

###### Michelle Bachelet Jeria


#### Prologue by the Minister of National Defense

###### The publication of a National Defense Book five years af- ter a similar text appeared for the first time in Chile, is the Chilean State’s response to the commitment it made at that time. At the core of this formal commitment lies the Government’s political will to evaluate the international scene and ascertain which situations have remained un- changed and which have changed, to register the interna- tional commitments in Defense issues which the country may have made during this time, and to examine their contents accordingly.

 It also reflects the will of the Government to endow Defense issues with a transparency that allows Chilean citizens and the community of nations to evaluate the actions of the Chilean State in this sphere in accordance with the inten- tions, objectives and capabilities we have publicly stated.

 With respect to our society, the text strives to provide Chileans with a greater knowledge and understanding of the tasks performed by Defense. It aims at demonstrating that issues concerning this sector are not alien to our everyday life and it attempts to be another way through which citizens can give their support to the National De- fense Policy and to the men and women who make up the different institutions in this sector. For these Chileans in particular, both military and civilians, this book consti- tutes a working tool and a set of general guidelines for the activities they must perform.

 In addition to these objectives, the Book reflects Chile’s commitment to transparency towards the international community. This statement of intentions, objectives and capabilities toward other countries, helps to generate a new trust from inside and to open new doors for strategic cooperation. The publication of a Defense Book also pro- vides the community of nations with the possibility of re- quiring fulfillment of declared intentions and of observing declared capabilities. In other words, it has in its hands a tool for measuring the responsibility with which a coun- try acts on the world scene and for verifying its compli

###### ance with international commitments. This new Book of National Defense also expresses the Government’s will that the broad opportunity for dialogue and work between the representatives of the State, includ- ing the Armed Forces, and other academic, political and economic actors related to or relevant to Defense issues is kept active. All of these agencies contributed their thoughts on various matters concerning our Defense to the preparation of this text.

 It was certainly an exercise in integrating legitimately dif- ferent perspectives: those of the military itself (land, sea, air and combined forces) and those of academic, political and technical sources from other sectors of the State and society. And this interaction took place within the frame- work of the political guidelines set by the President of the Republic for the Defense sector within the Constitutional legal system.

 An effort of such magnitude is essential for getting the cit- izenry to take part in formulating a public policy, but also for the renewal of ideas, concepts and approaches. This task required an effort to organize the discussion and the resulting documentation and then to prepare successive drafts before this final text could be made available to the reader.

 In summary, transparency, trustfulness and participation were, in my opinion, three important reasons that are more than a formal commitment, that propelled the Gov- ernment to make the effort to publish a new version of the Book of National Defense.

 The Book of the National Defense 2002

 Because the 1997 text was the first of its kind, it was mainly directed towards providing an explicit definition of National Defense of a more ideological nature and to- wards determining its basic concepts in a common lan- guage, which largely determined the structure of the de- bates that took place in Chile during these last five years. In this new Book we have wanted to include the program- matic dimension of Defense. Although this edition main- tains the essential ideological aspects, we believe the new text provides a clearer, more complete and more systemat

-----

###### ic product. It is truly a Book of public policy. In broad outlines, the Book of National Defense describes Chile’s Defense Policy.

 Complementarily, the Book takes a dynamic approach to tackling the different areas of Defense. While concepts were once approached from the point of view of how they fit into a theory, now they are treated within the frame- work of analysis. Where the elements of a structure were once described in statistics, they are now described dy- namically in terms of how they work within that struc- ture. Therefore, in this book the emphasis is on describing processes rather than on explaining paradigms and orga- nizational charts.

 This Book also attempts to use an more current language in the analyses it includes and in the concept references it makes. We believe that by updating the language used in discussing Defense issues that may seem to be part of out- dated conceptual frameworks, they will be treated in a modern fashion, that coincides with the language used in international circles as well as in other sectors of the same Chilean State.

 In terms of its contents, the new Book addresses the changes taking place on the international stage, to which our Defense Policy must respond. Chile’s international commitments in security matters have been updated and the book delineates the progress made on these issues. This is particularly true with regard to participation in Peace-Keeping Operations, reporting the evolution of defi- nitions made by the Chilean State in this respect during the last five years; to the demining obligations incurred through the signing and ratification of the Ottawa Con- vention; and to the standardization with other countries of the methodology for measuring defense spending. The 2002 Book also deals with the modernization process of the Armed Forces, of the Compulsory Military Service, of the Ministry of Defense itself and of the economic man- agement and Defense resource allocation institutions. Fur- thermore, it addresses matters which are being currently applied or developed in the field of Defense by countries with a greater development in this area, as with the case of joint military operations and its corresponding princi- ples.


-----

###### Contrary to the conventional image that exists in some sectors of society, Defense is a field of dynamic, continu- ing public activity. Together with elements of continuity there are also components of change. Several of the sub- jects covered in this text were in the process of change as the Book went to print; and there are also some issues still needing elaboration or reflection. It is the goal of the Ministry of Defense, as these issues come up for discus- sion at national and international levels, to update this book with specific annexes or through separate docu- ments.

 The Defense Agenda

 Certainly, this edition of the Book marks a step forward in the fulfillment of the Government’s Defense Agenda. This agenda has been designed around three large, inter- dependent areas: updating of the contexts in which the National Defense has been molded, modernization of the Defense sector, and development of the Defense interna- tional insertion.

 Part of the first of these areas is precisely the text I am now presenting to my fellow citizens and to the interna- tional community. Since Chile published the 1997 Book, debate on the generation of Defense policies within the framework of democratic regimes, and its expression in Books of Defense, has been expanding throughout the con- tinent. Several countries have already published docu- ments of this kind, while others are at different stages of the process. The subject has also been incorporated in the agenda of the Hemisphere Security Commission of the Organization of American States (OAS), which has con- tinually moved this initiative forward. It is my hope that this new version of the Chilean Book will serve as an in- centive to the region’s efforts to continue consolidating such processes, which find in this type of document a concrete measure of the trust that all American countries are pledged to promote.

 The second challenge is to continue the processes of modern- izing the different institutions that comprise the National De- fense, already mentioned in this Book, including institution- alizing the progress made in civilian-military relations as a result of the general effort to modernize the Chilean State.


-----

###### Lastly, our Agenda includes a strong thrust toward inter- national cooperation in security and Defense issues, in accordance with the Foreign Policy objectives of the coun- try. We face security problems that are becoming increas- ingly global, and therefore common, but we also have dif- ferent responses that must be harmonized with the com- mon objective of cooperating to maintain peaceful and safe international conditions so as to be able to work for the well being of the people, including ours.

 One of the main expressions of this effort is the commit- ment to support actions undertaken by the United Na- tions Organization, specifically, through participation in Peace Operations carried out under its mandate. Chile de- cidedly adheres to this particular commitment, which is why it has been gradually increasing its collaboration with the UN in this matter. For identical reasons we have moved forward in emphasizing the humanitarian dimen- sion of international security issues, by fulfilling the com- mitments we made through the Ottawa Convention con- cerning the banning of Anti-Personnel Mines within the given methods and timings.

 With respect to the continental situation, Chile is aware that a flexible architecture of security is emerging in the region, formed by old collective security institutions and new cooperative regimes. This new architecture has pro- vided the American region with a growing level of stabili- ty and governance within the sphere of security and De- fense, in order to face both traditional threats and threats that have emerged as a result of the globalization process.

 In addition to fostering confidence building measures and developing combined exercises and actions with the Armed Forces of the region, we have encouraged other countries of the continent to adopt the Common Standardized Methodology for Measuring Defense Spending, which we established in 2001 in full agree- ment with Argentina. In this sense, our new Book of National Defense confirms the consolidation attained during the five years covered by the text, through the strategic association process we have promoted with Argentina, as well as through the improvement of coop- eration with Peru on the basis of developing mutual trust and transparency.


-----

###### I would like to conclude by thanking the political authori- ties of the defense sector in office during the time the Book of National Defense 2002 was being prepared. I especially wish to thank my predecessor, Minister Mario Fernández Baeza, who initiated the project and directed it during the first phases of its preparation. During the entire time of preparation of this book, the Undersecretaries of the Min- istry of National Defense effectively supported both him and me. I would like to mention in particular, the Under- secretary of War, Gabriel Gaspar Tapia, who headed the work involved in preparing the Book. I would also like to thank the military authorities, especially the Chief and Vice Chief of the National Defense General Staff during that period, for the outstanding role they played in this initiative. I conclude by thanking and congratulating all the teams that worked in formulating and executing this ministry project, and in the drafting, design and printing of the final text.

## PART I
 The Conduct and Organization of the National Defense


###### Chile shares with many countries, espe- cially with those located on the American continent, a number of institu- tional and cultural characteristics. However, it also possesses other charac- teristics which distinguish it not only from them, but from the whole communi- ty of nations in general. These distinctive features are the result of the Chilean peo- ple’s historical experience, its cultural heritage, its traditions, and the evolution of its public institutions from the time in which national independence was forged.

 As a State, Chile participates in the inter- national system in the same way as other countries do, but it is precisely because of these distinctive features that the Chilean State must define the partic- ular way in which Chile take part.

 The country’s population with its distinc- tive features, the national territory and


###### the institutions of the Republic are the objectives of National Defense.

 The State’s responsibility to protect the elements which are vital to it, including the sovereignty to make the decisions that affect the future of the nation, entails the need to report what we are, who we are, where we are located, and what we want. This is a pre-requisite for laying the foun- dations of what we want to defend. Therefore, finding a clear answer to these issues and disseminating it to the people as a whole, through a tool such as this Book of National Defense, help to outline the type of defense we need.

 Because subjects related to the character- istics of the State, of the population and of the national territory are important foundations of Defense Policy, this book begins with a section devoted to these topics.


-----

## 1. Foundations and Characteristics

###### The principles of Chile’s institutional

 republican and democratic order and

 its national objectives play a crucial

 role among the elements on which

 National Defense is based. They are the

 foundations of the Defense architecture

 and they guide the State’s actions in

 pursuit of external security. Through

 them we can understand the impor
 tance of the security challenges the

 country faces in the international

 arena.


###### 1. BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE STATE

The Political Constitution of the Republic, in its
First Chapter on “Foundations of an Institutional
System” establishes the principles that guide the
legal and political system in Chile and that express the continuity of the nation’s republican
tradition.

They are principles which are also recognized by
other countries also guided by the premises of a
democratic regime and of respect for human beings and their rights, but to which each country

**BOX 1**


imprints its personal seal in the daily process of
putting them into practice.

In Chile there is broad recognition of human beings, their dignity and rights, and the communities in which they live, starting with the family.
Full respect of the rights of the people require
that the State abide by the objectives set out in
box 1 (See Box 1).

The equality and dignity inherent to every individual are the basis for the socio-economic objectives that are a priority for the country, such


**OBJECTIVES OF THE STATE**
!To be at the service of human beings and to promote the public welfare.
!To respect and promote the essential rights that emanate from the human nature.
!To protect the family as the core of society, and to work to strengthen it.
!To protect the population.
!To promote the harmonious integration of all sectors of the country.
!To contribute to the creation of the social conditions that will allow each and every member of the
national community the best possible self-realization both spiritually and materially.


-----

as cohesion, social integration and overcoming
poverty.

**1.1. Institutional Order: Democracy and the**
**Constitutional State**

Chile is a democratic republic, as established in
Article 4 of its Political Constitution, governed by
the rule of law and the principles of constitutional supremacy, of due process, of judicial protection and oversight of State administrative actions. Within this context of democracy and pluralism, the State ensures the right of individuals
to participate with equal access in national life
with full use of their individual freedoms.

The State of Chile is a unified state with sovereignty over its entire continental, island and
Antarctic territories, as well as over air and sea
space, in accordance with the respective international laws and treaties. It exercises its sovereignty through the people and the authorities
that represent them in accordance with its Political Constitution, recognizing as a limit of its actions the essential rights that emanate from human nature.

In its international relations, Chile fully adheres
to the principles of peaceful resolution of conflicts, of non-intervention in the domestic affairs
of other states and of respect for international law.

**1.2. National Objectives**

The State of Chile pursues general objectives
that are set forth in its constitution, which in
turn is the result of the historical experience and
political and cultural heritage of the Chilean people. These objectives give rise to goals that can
therefore be considered as expectations of the
Chilean people as a whole. These goals guide
and give consistency to the overall activities of
the State, including Defense. Within this specific
sphere, where they are known as permanent national objectives, these goals are the basis for the
planning function. (See Box 2).

In the form in which they are expressed in box 2,
these permanent national objectives are in keeping with Chile’s constitutional tradition and it is
the duty of each government administration,
from its own political positions, to promote a
public agenda that implements them. In other
words, the permanent national objectives are updated and carried out through decisions, instruments and actions that express the politic will of
the Chilean democratic institutions.


Governments prepare these up-dated (or political) national objectives for a varying periods of
time, but the time schedules they set don’t generally end with their own terms of office.

Naturally, it is easier to get citizens to make a
commitment to defense and security if there is a
greater awareness and consensus concerning the
final objectives to be attained.

###### 2. CHARACTERISTICS: STATE AND DEFENSE

The primary functions of the Chilean State are
domestic governance, foreign relations and administration of justice, gathering and allocation
of financial resources and defense. Generally
speaking, the functions of defense are to protect
the population, to preserve the national territory
and to safeguard the State’s capability to exercise
its sovereignty when faced with external threats
to these fundamental elements of the country, as
well as to support the achievement of national
objectives in the international sphere.

Defense must be considered a public asset in an
overall sense. It fulfills a basic social function for
the existence of society that only the State can
provide. As part of the security which the country needs, Defense helps to make society’s development possible.

**2.1. Defense as a Function**

Defense is an asset available to all members of
the national community; once it is produced no
**BOX 2**


**NATIONAL PERMANENT OBJECTIVES**
! Preservation of the Chilean nation.
! Conservation and enrichment of its identity
and cultural patrimony.
! Maintenance of its political independence.
! Maintenance of its sovereignty.
! Maintenance of its national territorial integrity.
! The achievement of high, sustained and
sustainable economic development.
! The achievement of a social development that
harmonizes with economic development and
is based on individual capabilities and equal
opportunity for all.
! Maintenance of a peaceful and cooperative
coexistence among civilians.
! International projection.
! Maintenance of good international relations.

body enjoys it to the detriment of others. In order to guarantee this effect, it is necessary that
the following conditions be met:

**a) The monopoly of the legitimate force must**
belong to the State.
**b) The State must organize it, endow it with re-**
sources and assign objectives of national significance.
**c) The State must carry out this task continu-**
ously over time, whether in peace or war.
**d) The exercise of this function must encompass**
all State entities needed for Defense since its
sphere of action exceeds the limits of what is
strictly military.

**2.2. Defense, Security and Development**

The relationship between defense and security
and development is one of the most complex
among those existing in the public sphere. This
complexity is due to theoretical and political doctrines arisen after II World War, as well as to the
tendency to use some concepts as interchangeable.

The security of the nation cannot be defined as
any State action directed towards preserving the
nation’s institutional legal system and ensuring
the free exercise of its sovereignty both internally and externally. Rather, it is the result of a series of actions carried out by the State in order to
make progress in achieving its objectives and
safeguarding national interests when dealing
with significant risks, threats or interference.
Therefore, the establishment of security becomes desirable since it allows for the implementation of the objectives set forth by the nation and the State, particularly those of social
and economic development.

National security is achieved through well-defined state functions. External security is basically achieved through diplomatic and defense
functions. Internal security is achieved through
the “Domestic Order” function and security
against catastrophes is achieved through the
“Civil and Environmental Protection” function.
The implementation of each one of these functions requires an organic structure capable of
planning and execution, a supporting legal
framework, funding and a guiding policy.

Even though security and defense are closely related, the concept of defense is more specific
than that of security. Defense does not inherently produce the security desired, but it is certain

ly one of the essential factors in achieving it.

Defense contributes to the security of the country, through both deterrence and international
cooperation. One of the ways cooperation takes
place is through the participation in peacekeeping operations, in military interchanges and in
combined multinational training exercises,
which are part of the array of mutual confidence
measures.

Within the overall function of security and external security, and as part of security and development –which is, after all, the general objective of the State– a dynamic relationship is created, but one in which security cannot be understood as an end in itself. The State function of
providing security is limited by the requirement
of providing the nation’s public welfare and of
serving humanity. Therefore, it not ethically permissible to trample the permanent values of justice and human dignity in order to achieve the
security of a nation.

**2.3. Human Security**

This is an emerging concept in the sphere of international policy which involves nations committing to act within the framework of International Humanitarian Law under international
conflict scenarius; this commitment is similar to
that which countries owe to their own citizens in
matters concerning their rights and freedoms.
The principal value of this concept lies in changing the concern for security issues by complementing the traditional concept which is centered on the State and shifting it to individuals,
thus minimizing the negative effects produced
by increasing insecurity and tensions. This introduces a new sensibility to the way security
matters are handled, since it encourages an understanding approach and takes into account
their multidimensional character.

This approach serves as a basis for handling
problems typical of the globalization era. Many
of these problems transcend the sphere of international conflicts and therefore cannot be approached through defense policies. Such is the
case, for example, of efforts to reduce the existing technological gap between developed and
poor countries, to reduce the impact of criminal
violence in large cities or to address the consequences of a spreading pandemics such as AIDS.
But the concept is applied in relation to United
Nations Peacekeeping Operations and could be
applied in actions taken to handle conflicts that


-----

may give rise to crimes against humanity or
cause regional crises and increase the level of insecurity among affected persons.

Although the human security approach still offers some aspects in need of a more precise definition, it represents progress in conceptualizing
the notion of security and for this reason it has
drawn growing international support. This is due
to international law’s acknowledgment of the individual and to the importance that observance
of human rights has acquired in the international agenda. To help create mechanisms that truly
permit safeguarding the life of each person
against conventional and unconventional threats
constitutes a political objective of Chile’s international action.

**2.4. National Defense and the Internal Order of**
**the Republic**

The functions of National Defense have to do
with external security, which is defined by society’s consensus of what differentiates external
security from the tasks of internal order and public safety that the Political Constitution of the Republic delegates to the Police Force and the Investigations Bureau.

For certain emergency situations, Article 39 and
following of the Constitution set up the rules for
the use of the Armed Forces in tasks of internal
order: internal war or internal disturbance, severe disruption of internal order or evident
threat to national security of internal an origin,
and public disaster.[1]

# ❦


###### ✪

**1 States of emergency defined in the Constitution are: a State of Siege (can be declared by the President of the Republic, with the approval of the**
National Congress, in the event of internal war or internal disturbance); a State of Emergency (can be declared by the President of the Republic,
with the approval of the National Security Council, in the event of severe disruption of internal order, damages or threats to national security by a
cause of internal origin), and a State of Catastrophe (can be declared by the President of the Republic, with the approval of the National Security
Council, in the event of public disaster).

## 2. The Territory and Population of Chile

###### Protecting the territory and its popula
 tion is, ultimately, the essential objec
 tive of Defense. For this reason, the dis
 tinctive features of the national territo
 ry and of the Chilean people constitute

 the basic references to be considered in

 drawing up a National Defense Policy.

 The following pages describe the most

 relevant characteristics of our territory,

 its geography and the people who

 inhabit it.


###### 1. THE NATIONAL TERRITORY

The Chilean territory is defined and delimited by
borders that are the result of existing treaties,
freely and legitimately agreed upon, and by arbitral award. Of the 6,630 km comprising its borders, it shares 180 km with Peru, 850 km with Bolivia and 5,600 km with Argentina[2] (See Box 3).
For administrative purposes, the land portion of
the national territory is divided into thirteen regions (See Figure 1).

The area of Chile in the American continent
makes it the longest and narrowest country in the
world. Proportionally, it is also the country with
the largest sea and air space, where international
law allows the country to exercise varying degrees
of sovereignty. In general, it has sovereignty over
a trapezoid that borders on Peru (to the north), Bo

livia and Argentina (to the east), includes Easter
Island (to the west) and the South Pole. This large
land space, with its corresponding sea and air
space, but not including the high seas within it, is
what we understand as “national territory”.

The continental portion of the national territory
covers a surface area of 756,626 km[2]. Its peculiar
geographical features have given it island characteristics: in the north, it has vast areas of
desert and arid lands; in the south the Drake
Pass; in the east of its territory the high Andes
mountains rise, further south the mountains
penetrate into the land stretching towards the
ocean. The Strait of Magellan crosses the territory between the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans.

In addition to the continental portion, the sea islands and the Chilean Antarctic Territory also
form part of the Chilean territory.

The island portion of the national territory includes several islands in the South Pacific. The
closest of these are the Robinson Crusoe Archi

pelago, at 360 nautical miles (667 km) from the
continent and the islands of San Félix and San
Ambrosio at 500 nautical miles (926 km). The
most distant ones are the Island of Sala y Gómez
at 1,870 nautical miles (3,463 km) and Easter Island at 2,000 nautical miles (3,700 km) from the
central coast. These latter islands enlarge the
Chilean continental shelf from 200 to 350 nautical miles, which provides Chile with a total sea
bed of 4,633,615 km[2], a little over six times the
surface area of its South American continental
territory.


The Chilean Antarctic Territory is located south
of Drake Pass and beyond the South American
continent, forming a rounded triangle stretching
towards the South Pole between meridians 53º
and 90º west, with an approximate surface area
of 1,250,000 km[2]. On the basis of valuable geographical, historical and juridical and administrative title deeds, these boundaries were stated
precisely by Executive Decree Nº 1,747, dated
November 6, 1940. The area possesses potential
fishing, mining and water resources, which are
under investigation by several countries, includ

ing ours. Chile has exploited part the marine resources; the development of potential mining resources has been banned for the next 50 years, as
from February 18, 1998, when the Protocol for
the Protection of the Antarctic Environment
came into force. The potential of water resources
from the ice represents an enormous wealth for
the future, which has not been appraised.

###### 2. CHILEAN GEOGRAPHY

The national territory is closely related to national defense, not only because its protection is
one of the purposes of defense, but also because
its distinctive geographical features require
unique defense approaches, originating unique
geostrategic problems, difficult to face and solve.

**2.1. The Land**

Chile’s territory on the South American continent is formed by a long narrow belt which in
part lies between the Andes Mountains and the
Pacific Ocean, or incorporating the Andes into a
vast area of its southern sector, with a profusion
of islands and coastal archipelagos. Its total
length is 4,300 km and its maximum width is 460
km. It is located between latitude 17º30’ and
56º00’ S and between longitude 66º30’ and
74º40’ W, not including the occasional sea islands or the Antarctic territory.

Seen from another perspective, the American territory of Chile is divided into three large geographical areas to which the sea islands and
Antarctic territory must be added. The first area
is located to the north of the country (regions I, II
and III). It has a desert climate, a low population
density, and is rich in mineral and marine resources. It is endowed with important, fully
equipped ports that provide the necessary shipping services from and into Chile as well as from
and into Bolivia, extending Chile’s influence towards the center of the South American continent. The second area (regions IV through X)
forms the large central zone. With a temperate
climate, it houses more than 85% of the national
population and the largest portion of industry. It
is the main production and consumer sector of
the country. Here are located the most important
port and airport complexes of the country. They
are responsible for the dispatch of 65% of national cargo. Finally, the third area, is the southern
zone, (regions XI through XII). Its climate is cold,
and it is characterized by the presence of a great
number of islands and small coastal villages,


which end at Region XII of Magallanes and the
Chilean Antarctic. This latter region depends
mainly on its sea and air routes to connect itself
with the center of the country. Its main port, the
city of Punta Arenas, also offers air and sea connections with the Antarctic continent. The interoceanic passages of the Strait of Magellan and
the Drake Pass constitute salient features of the
southern zone. The Beagle Channel also constitutes an important sea route in this area.

**2.2. The Sea**

The national sea territory is equivalent to the
“Chilean Sea.”[3] It comprises all the oceanic waters that bathe or encircle territories under or entitled to national sovereignty up to 200 nautical
miles (370 km). Taking into account that Chile
has a latitudinal coastline of 4.300 km, its sea
surface area totals 3,464,462 kms[2], not including
the maritime projection of the Antarctic territory, over which Chile has jurisdiction in accordance with existing international legal instruments applicable to this area. This sea area
places our country in a privileged position on an
ocean that is gaining in importance day by day,
in addition to having, in proportion to its territory, one of the largest coastal surface areas in the
world.

Within this sea territory it is necessary to keep in
mind the following conceptual definitions:

**_a) Territorial Sea, of 12 nautical miles (22_**
km) of surface area, measured from the base
lines, over which full sovereignty is exercised, acknowledging the right of innocent
passage to foreign vessels pursuant to the
terms of the United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea.

**_b) Contiguous Zone, of 24 nautical miles (44_**
km), measured from the base lines where
the width of the territorial sea is calculated.
Inspections are carried out in this zone both
to prevent as well as to penalize violations of
customs, government, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations.

**_c) Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), under-_**
stood as the sea area extending up to 200
nautical miles (370 km), measured from the

###### ✪  

**3 Defined in Executive Decree Nº 364, of May 30, 1974..**


-----

base lines, where the State exercises sovereign rights with respect to the exploitation,
exploration, preservation, and administration of living and non-living natural resources that exist in the water mass, ocean
floor and ocean subsoil, as well as jurisdiction with respect to the installation and use
of artificial islands, facilities and structures,
marine scientific research, protection and
preservation of the environment and other
rights recognized by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

In addition, Chile conceives as “Presential Sea”
the ocean space comprised between the border
of our Exclusive Economic Zone and the meridian that going through the western side of the
continental shelf of Easter Island stretches out
from the parallel of Boundary Mark Nº 1 towards
the Southern Pole. This concept expresses the
will to have a presence in this area of high seas
for the purpose of projecting maritime interests
with respect to the rest of the international community, monitoring the environment and preserving marine resources, with unrestricted adherence to International Law.

The Convention on the Law of the Sea, on the
drafting and approval of which Chile played an
active and important role, the existence of other
international agreements ratified by Chile and
the existence of national legislation on the Environment, as well as the Fishing Law both currently in force and the current policy on the use
of the Coastline4 are clear and intense expressions of Chile’s maritime vocation. International
legislation on the sea comprises a set of conventional and customary rules and regulating instruments for specialized issues that are at present under negotiation. It is essential for the
country to maintain an active participation in
the forums that address this issue, to express its
continuing maritime vocation, to protect its sovereignty and rights on the basis of the treaties
and international agreements that support them
and to project its interests on this subject.

In addition to the opportunities offered to Chile
to develop and exploit its maritime resources,
the international law of the sea contains other
important areas that our country must work on
in the future to ensure essential resources.
Among them, the study of the Antarctic continental shelf in the light of the principles and
methods contained in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the maritime delimitations of the Chilean Antarctic territory and


the preservation of Antarctic living sea resources, in compliance with applicable regimes,
need to be stressed.

With respect to trade, the sea provides a fast, safe
and efficient communication route for the transportation of large volumes of cargo. The fast development of nations located at the other side of
the Pacific basin, which has made them attractive markets for national and regional products,
allow us to consider this ocean as an important
sea faring route of fast growing activity which we
must utilize and control properly. However, our
export and import trade is not restricted to the
Pacific basin area but also encompasses the east
coast of the United States, Europe, the Middle
East and all the trading centers of the world.

Statistical studies point out that approximately
90% of our foreign trade is carried by sea. Our
main export product (copper) and our main import product (oil) are transported entirely by sea.
Their protection, therefore, is of special importance. It is also important to safeguard live and
mineral resources of our Exclusive Economic
Zone, which requires permanent monitoring and
means to stop depredation.

Within this context, Chile has acceded, since
1929, to the International Agreement for the
Safety of Human Life at Sea, and has acquired
specific responsibilities of sea rescue and salvage
on the southeastern quadrant since 1953. It contributes to the General Oceanic Bathymetric
Charter since 1962, acts as Coordinator of the Pacific Southeastern Maritime Area for the International Office of Hydrography since 1987 and
for the Maritime Traffic Control since 1989. In
addition, Chile is an active member of the Red
Alert against Tsunamis on the Pacific Ocean Network. All of the above falls within the framework
of a maritime zone of national responsibility exceeding the 30,000,000 kms2 measured from
meridian 131º W, which the country must honor
before the international community, and must
have available the necessary navy and maritime
means for proper fulfillment of its commitments
(See Figure 2).

**2.3. The Airspace**

In accordance with international law, the sovereignty of the State of Chile also extends to the air
space over its territory and territorial sea. This
space is determined by the presence of gases, especially oxygen, which permit the flight of craft
sustained on the aerodynamic resistance offered


-----

by gases to moving objects at specific speeds.
The upper limit of this space is located within a
range of 80 to 100 kilometers in height which
marks the border with outer space a universal
heritage of humanity.

For air traffic control purposes, the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) recognizes
Chile’s protection over an area which in general
extends from the northern border (latitude 18º
21’ N) to the South Pole, and from the international political boundary to the east as far as
meridian 131º 00’ W. As a total, the air space under Chile’s control covers a surface of 26.8 millions of km2, which includes its continental and
island territories, its jurisdictional waters and the
high seas they contain (See Figure 3).

**2.4. The Polar Territory**

This cannot be confused with the land and sea
territory, and least of all, with the air space.

The Chilean polar space delimited by meridians
53º y 90º West has an area of 1,250,000 kms[2].


Contemporary international law does not have
universally accepted rules about the way to acquire and preserve sovereignty over polar space.
It is for this reason that the Antarctic Treaty, in
force since June 23, 1961, decided to restrict the
use of the Antarctic to peaceful and scientific activities and placed a 30-year freeze on litigious
claims without altering the positions of the signatories either in favor or against alleged sovereignties.

###### 3. THE POPULATION OF CHILE

During the process of becoming a nation, its inhabitants developed a number of distinctive
characteristics and a wide spectrum of specific
features that would later differentiate it from
other nations. Normally, through this same
process a nation organizes itself politically into a
State which it endows with the basic functions
required for its development, including the function of defense. The population of a country is
the most valuable asset that its defense must
protect.


**FIGURE 2**


-----

**FIGURE 3**


-----

**3.1. National Identity**

The defense as such is ultimately based on the
most elementary parts of the national State.
These parts —compiled or expressed in the Principles and Objectives of the State— correspond to
elements that form part of the goods and purposes that Chile is decided to protect, since they
are what give it life and provide it with an identity among the nations. Chilean society is the
specific result of the combination of different
ethnic groups, all of which have enriched the
population of Chile5 through the mixing of races.

**a) The Chilean People**
From a historical perspective, the process of development of our national identity is associated
with another long process: the culture mixing resulting from Spanish rule through the conquest
of the territory. In Chile it began in 1535, with
the arrival of the first Spanish expedition, which
had traveled from Cuzco towards the southern
lands. The collision of European civilization with
the indigenous cultures reveals, as nothing else
can, the painful and bloody process of initial syncretism in the construction of the sense and
meaning of Chilean people. The imposition of
the political authority of the Spanish King over
the native people of the New World, and the latter’s natural and legitimate rebellion, resulted in
a disposition to resist adverse conditions, a legacy that would leave an imprint on both cultures
and constitutes an integral part of our character.

As years went by, the shaping of language, traditions, values, customs, religion, the rules and
structures, were slowly being integrated into the
incipient social texture of the Capitanía General
de Chile. This process denotes a feature of our
identity which is already very much our own, because in no other place in America was that
process so long and so hard. As a result, Spanish
culture remained dominant and many elements,
particularly those of a religious and cultural nature, were deeply ingrained in our ethos as a nation. Because of this, the mixing of races in Chile
was very peculiar and quite different from what
happened in other Spanish-American countries.

Successive social and political changes brought
with them the incorporation of new elements,
which were to form part of the so-called “identifying deposits”. For example, the process of
emancipation from Spain was a significant milestone because it produced a national feeling
within the population of Chilean-born Spaniards.
Republican institutionalism, the common desire


to strive for progress and to a community life
ruled by freedom and growing participation are
components which had already been incorporated by the 19th century, even though the task of
perfecting them has fallen to successive generations of Chileans

Some essential aspects of the legacy of western
culture that have contributed to these “deposits”
that form our national identity, are expressed in
the chapter on “Institutional Foundations” of the
Political Constitution: for example: the dignity of
human being, the protection of the fundamental
rights which such dignity requires, the consideration of the family as the core of society and the
consideration of the State as an entity at the service of humanity. In short, the elements compiled
in those “Institutional Foundations” constitute
substantive features that society as a whole must
safeguard.

**b) Contribution of Defense to National**
**Identity**
The effects associated with military activity in
the different periods of our history were influential in the process of shaping the national identity described above. Historians, sociologists, anthropologists and, in general, people who have
studied Chilean society agree that the conflict
and the human tragedy it entailed explains some
of the characteristics involved in the formation
of Chile as a unique national unit.

Many episodes that took place during the 19thcentury conflicts, starting with the battles for independence, helped shape the traditions and
symbols of the Republic and the nation. These
are the traditions and symbols that have nourished the Armed Forces, which have in turn
helped to transmit and revive them within society.

It should also be noted that, on the whole, during
those historical moments in which new elements were incorporated into the Spanish matrix
of Chilean society, already distinguished by the
heritage of the struggle between the Spanish and
Mapuches, other events also left their imprint on
the Armed Forces: the early settling of English
immigrants in the Valparaiso area and the early
Britannic influence on the Navy which had already started during the battles for independence; and the importance of French culture in
Chilean society in the mid-1800s, which also influenced the army. The opening of the country
to German immigration at a time when Germany
enjoyed its greatest prestige in 19th-Century Eu

rope and the Prussian influence on the Army of
the late 1800s and early 1900s, among others.

It can be said that during this long process, the
Armed Forces have found a double role to their
existence. They formally emerged as organizations in a national sense, prepared to assume the
defense of the Chilean people, their territory and
their sovereignty expressed in the national State.
At the same time, they emerged as institutions
associated with the values in which this defense
is founded. To the sovereignty and freedom of
spirit that sprung up from independence from
Spanish rule, the demands for harmonious coexistence, for organization, for development, and
for equity and stability are to be added.


**3.2. Data and Background Information**


**6**


The number of inhabitants and the different aspects of population distribution are both relevant
data from the point of view of defense, given the
conditions they impose on the use of human resources which the country must use to maintain
external security.

In recent years, Chile has experienced a noticeable change in its quality of life. Nevertheless,
the country has remained one of the countries
with a lower population growth. The census carried out in April, 2002 has revealed the variations
occurring in the last ten years and statistical figures indicate that Chile’s current population is
15,116,435. In other words, it has risen by 13.2%
over the figures from the previous census carried
out in 1992, which reported 13,348,401 inhabi
###### ✪

(INE)], Census of 2002, Preliminary Figures. June 2002.


tants. So then, in ten years, Chile’s population
has increased, in absolute figures, by 1,768,034
inhabitants.

In terms of gender distribution, the number of
women and men is balanced; with women numbering 7,668,740 and men 7,447,695. With regard
to the population as a whole, these figures reveal
that women account for 50.7% of the population
and men for 49.3%. These figures are similar to
those obtained in 1992. With respect to population distribution, the recent census showed that
the urban population had reached 13,044,221 inhabitants (86.6%) and that the rural population
totals 2,006,120 (13.4%), which places Chilean
society of the early 21st century among the other modern industrialized societies of the 20th
century. In addition to this information is the
fact that, during these ten years, the distribution
of the population by regions has not experienced
a significant change, since 40,1% of the total population is concentrated in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago, 12.3% in the Bío-Bío Region
and, in third place, 10.2% in the Valparaiso Region, figures that are similar to those obtained in
the previous census.

Population density is presently 19.9 inhabitants
per km[2]. In other words, there have not been any
significant changes, which indicates that the
population increased more slowly than in the
first half of the 20[th] Century.[7]

## PART II Defense Environment


###### Never before has the world been so inter- connected and so interdependent. Long distances have been surpassed by the speed of communications. Problems emerging in far away countries affect ours, and this forces us to be constantly monitoring and analyzing the different scenarios that have a bearing in the political and economic decisions that Chile feels are appropriate for ensuring its development.

 In many ways these scenarios have a particular effect on the decisions our country must make on Defense issues. Thus is the State that must respond by drawing up a policy, which while pre- serving its most stable elements has the necessary flexibility to adjust to the con- stant changes that these scenarios experi- ence over time. This is particularly true in present times, when these changes are faster and more comprehensive than in the past.


###### New technologies, new international actors and new types of threats are some of the factors influencing these changes. As a result, a new world order has emerged that forces States to look, through new international systems, for new ways of reducing the level of uncertainty in which they evolve. Finally, uncertainty remains as a component of the conditions in which the world develops.

 Today, the different segments of the world scenario, the peculiarities of our regional environment, the type of rela- tionships we keep with our neighbors, the type of threats that surround us and the geostrategic characteristics of our territo- ry, are elements that shape our defense.

 In summary, the subjects contained in the second part of the Book and issues addressed in Part I constitute the bases for Chile’s National Defense Policy.


-----

## 1. International Security Trends

###### The nation’s defense policy requires a

 systematic analysis of the evolution of

 trends and in particular of international

 conflicts, from both a conceptual and

 empirical perspective. Even though the

 period of time from 1997 (the year in

 which the first Book appeared) to

 today is relatively short, the interna
 tional system has undergone substan
 tive changes whose influence on the

 sphere of defense need to be appraised.


The international analysis performed in 1997
was done using the end of the Cold War as a
framework of reference and globalization as the
emerging phenomenon. However, at the beginning of the 21st century, the most important
characteristic of the international system is the
consolidation of the globalization process which,
in recent years has begun to introduce political
and strategic changes of a qualitative character.
Some of these transformations are the following:

###### 1. DIVERSIFICATION OF THE ACTORS INVOLVED IN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY

Globalization has diversified the type of actors
that take part in the international system which
was formerly restricted to States. Transnationalization and the globalization of the economy
with the consequent increase in the movement
of goods, information and people, have created
the necessary conditions for enterprises, nongovernmental organizations inspired by the most


diverse objectives, and even individuals, have all
gained a greater capacity for action within international spheres, a situation that has consequences to Security and Defense.

**1.1 The Economic Agents**

The consolidation of globally operating markets
has allowed several economic agents, particularly enterprises, to make decisions that directly affect the international system in a relatively autonomous manner and in real time. Among other effects, economic globalization has stimulated
the deregulation of international economic relations, which has triggered integration processes.
These processes, in turn, have encouraged the
growth of cooperation among states involved in
different spheres of activities –including Defense– and have brought changes in the political
relationships between them. We can see this
trend in several places of the world, such as
Northern America, the European Union, Southern Africa, Central and South America.


-----

**1.2 The Civil Society**
Diverse civil society groups, with varying degrees of organizational development, have also
become international actors. Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs) concerned about a variety
of issues have developed the capacity to create
international political agendas and to influence
decision-making of States, either formally,
through participation in international institutions, or informally through direct action. The
activities of NGOs can also have direct or indirect effects on the international security sphere,
and on Defense, either at the global level or at
the regional and national levels. For example, the
role played by NGOs was decisive for the 1997
approval of the Convention on the Prohibition of
the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of
Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction.

###### 2. CHANGES IN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CONCEPTS

The concepts of international security were
formed on the basis of the fact –which was true
until a few years ago– that the only actor able to
exercise real political action in the international
sphere was the State. With the consolidation of
globalization and the emergence of new international actors, the concept of state-centered international security has undergone changes in
some of its basic assumptions: the State is no
longer the exclusive objective of security; there
are now other claimants of security which are
not the State. This is why, for some time now,
the international community has been making
efforts to review the concepts of international security and develop notions that take into account
the new realities. These were the lines followed,
for example, by the debate regarding human security - a concept first formulated by the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) in 1994.[8]

###### 3. THE STATE AS COORDINATOR AND REGULATOR OF THE GLOBALIZATION PROCESS

It is particularly important to re-establish and define the importance of the State in the context of
globalization. Even though it no longer has a mo
###### ✪

port on Human Development. The Chilean position on matters of human security appears in Part I Chapter II of this report


nopoly on international policy and its relative
power has lessened and the use of force as a
mean of resolving certain types of conflicts has
decreased within the framework of growing interdependence, the State still retains essential
characteristics:

!It is still the only agent with the capacity to organize the democratic representation of society.
!It is still the only agent with the power
to establish rules of law, either directly or
indirectly, through international organizations. The effectiveness of these rules also
rests ultimately with the State.
!It is still the only international actor that
has the capacity for legitimate use of force
during international conflicts, whether between states or within a single state.
!It is still the only actor empowered to
put the lives of some of its members in
jeopardy, in pursuing some of its essential
objectives.
!Lastly, it is still the actor endowed with
the greatest and most complex resources
of power.

###### 4. DEVELOPMENT OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE REGIMES

Faced with the new international scenario,
which has been taking shape in recent years,
governments have responded by redefining concepts and practices applied in international policies, particularly within the field of security.
However, as this process intensifies, some common responses have emerged. Examples are the
tendency to favor a greater international cooperation, especially within the scope of the United
Nations and regional organizations. If this trend
is adequately supported by countries it can contribute to international security, even in cases
where disparities observed in the capacities of
states interested in cooperation make it difficult.
International agencies for cooperation are becoming more and more effective instruments for
addressing international conflict between states
(the ‘traditional agenda’). There are many examples of this trend, particularly the strategic agreements between Russia, the United States and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).[9]

###### ✪

**9 On May 14, 2002, the United States and Russia signed a treaty**
on the disarmament of the strategic nuclear stockpiling. On May 28,
2002 Russia was accepted as a member of NATO


-----

A similar development has arisen in the case of
the ‘new security agenda’, generally comprised
of elements derived from the globalization
process. In effect, even though they face problems of a different nature (generally threats of a
non-state character and with a transnational dimension), the most efficient responses are those
based in intensifying international cooperation,
which has been particularly evident in the case
of the international struggle against terrorism.

In summary, the globalization process has had,
until now, an apparently paradoxical result:
while it has reduced the State’s monopoly on international politics, it has also strengthened the
State’s role in those issues in which is still the
sole irreplaceable actor. In addition, although
globalization sets conditions for the appearance
of “asymmetrical threats”, it has also reinforced
the importance of international regimes of cooperation in those areas where cooperation is of interest to states. During this time, an important
portion of international politics remains in the
hands of state management, but international
regimes have expanded in proportion to the expansion of globalization and a more complex and
diversified international agenda that requires coordination among governments. In this manner,
international regimes have began to interrelate
as institutions through which countries attempt,
with varying degrees of success, to bring some
governability to the process of changes taking
place in the international sphere.

###### 5. A GREATER DEMAND ON UN PEACE- KEEPING OPERATIONS

The need for international cooperation has created growing demands on the United Nations to
perform its essential mission of world peacekeeping established in its founding Charter
signed in the city of San Francisco (USA), in
1945, by different countries, among them, Chile.

For half a century, the structure of the UN consisted basically of reacting to situations that required peacekeeping efforts. Over time, particularly beginning in the 1990s, the United Nations
has reformed its structure to make it able to respond to the increasing demands for operations
aimed at establishing or imposing peace, an issue that requires different political and military
capabilities clearly superior to the current ones.
This reorganization requires reaffirming the legitimacy of the United Nations as the only institution accepted by the international community


to use force in resolving international security
problems under the regulations described in its
founding Charter.

The new requests for UN peace operations require organic solutions and more elaborate objectives since they involve changing from military operations to intervene between fighting
parties who have reached a peace or cease-fire
agreement, or verifying cease-fires, which are
relatively simple tasks, to peace imposition operations with different rules of engagement and
which often involve the objective of organizing a
government. The UN agency for maintaining
peace and security has become more complex
and has changed into a huge, sophisticated network of political and strategic decision-making,
as well as crisis management. These are the kind
of decisions and actions that require more efficient political and military coordination within
the UN and between it and participating countries and taking into account the participation
and coordination of other actors from international institutions, transnational civil organizations and even the mass media.[10]

## 2. International Settings that Influence Defense

###### The classification of settings adopted

 here must be understood in the follow
 ing way: the world context is the whole

 international sphere; the continental

 context is the entire American conti
 nent; the regional context refers to

 South America; the subregional context

 refers to areas or zones within this

 region, and the neighboring context

 consists of Chile’s bordering countries.


###### 1. THE WORLD CONTEXT

During the last decade, after the end of the Cold
War, a kind of global governing system has been
taking shape. As mentioned in the previous
chapter, this concept describes a phenomenon
still in its developing stages. Although its nature
is still in flux, the term is used for a number of
procedures and institutions linked to each other
on the basis of shared values: among them the
promotion of democracy, mandatory observance
of human rights, growing deregulation of the international economy and a preference for cooperation as the political option to address a sophisticated international agenda of a global and
transnational nature.

Countries with differing degrees of power and influence participate in this system, which is also
comprised of other international actors, including blocs of countries and non-state actors. It
should be noted that not all actors participating
in this system share identical approaches to
these values or adopt each and every one of the


international mechanisms through which they
are expressed.

The existence of this system of cooperation does
not mean that countries are prevented from taking unilateral action when they consider it necessary. Moreover, the international security
framework that this system has created is not incompatible with the creation of bilateral alliances (United States-Japan, for example) or of
multilateral alliances of a regional scope (collective security of NATO). However, it has opened a
space for the establishment of a concept of
“democratic peace”,[11] as well as a propensity to
limit and inhibit the use of force as a means of
resolving conflicts in the geographical areas
where its influence is greater.

###### ✪

**11 “Democratic peace” is understood as possibility of an armed con-**
flict between democratic countries being low in comparison to other types of political regimes.


-----

The United States continues to maintain its supremacy on the world map, particularly on military issues. However, the European Union, Russia, China and Southeast Asia share the economic and political power.

The propensity to establish large political or
commercial-political blocs (NAFTA, EU, APEC,
MERCOSUR) has increased, placing new demands and projecting new responsibilities on
the exercise of state sovereignty, which is acquiring different dimensions in the decisionmaking sphere at the international level.

With regard to perceived threats, terrorism in its
various manifestations and associations, ethnic
struggles, drug trafficking, corruption, depletion
of natural resources and trends toward religious
fundamentalism, are the issues that determine
the current international agenda. In some cases
this leads to the polarization of some states and
in others to their alignment with one pole or the
other. The US interest in keeping the international struggle against terrorism at the forefront
and making it the common denominator of the
different national priorities on matters concerning security and Defense should be noted.

###### 2. THE CONTINENTAL CONTEXT12

From a general perspective, the region’s development has revolved around globalization and
regional development activities. Globalization
has had positive and negative effects on the continent and governments and companies of the
American countries, are searching for appropriate policies to optimize their insertion into the
globalization process.

Even though it still has significant features of its
own, the American continent is not immune to
the impact that the global tendencies are displaying on the international security agenda. In
general, the countries of the continent are participating in the globalization process and largely share values and interests with the powers
that give shape to the international systems engaged in making the globalization process governable. In fact, some of the most important
principles that have directed the Americas Sum

mit process have been: promotion of democracy
and, in particular, democratic consolidation in
the Latin American and Caribbean countries; respect for human rights; development of an international system based on the law and capable of
distributing the risks and benefits of globalization more fairly; in short, the search for a more
stable and safe international environment.

The analysis of the most important trends that
influence the security of the continent must
then consider the following elements:

**2.1. America: a Region that Contributes to**
**Strategic Stability**

With the exception of the United States and
Canada, the American continent is, in general, a
region that remains on the fringe of the more significant international conflicts and, taken as a
geographic unit, it is also an area free from intraregional conflicts of importance. The relative
strategic stability of the continent is reflected in
the fact that its indicators on inter- and intrastate conflicts are the lowest in the world in spite
of current potential conflicts. In accordance with
information issued by the SIPRI (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute), with the
exception of the Colombian conflict, America
has not registered any serious conflict on its soil
for over a decade. Even the conflict between Peru and Ecuador, which culminated in 1998, was
not serious enough to be classified as a significant conflict.

**2.2. Threats to the Continent**

The American continent faces security problems
of varying intensity, both conventional and unconventional. The overview provided here is a
relative evaluation of the situation, based in a
comparison with security conditions in other regions of the world.

**_a) Conventional Threats_**
These last few years have seen the consolidation of a decline in conflicts between nations on the American continent. However,
it would be premature to state that conflicts
between countries have disappeared. Some
territorial issues remain between some
countries, both in Central and South America, which eventually could give rise to a crisis, and therefore the policies directed toward preventing conflicts and cooperation
will continue to be of major importance.


-----

**_b) Unconventional Risks and Threats_**
As stated previously, the unconventional
risks and threats which have emerged during
the globalization process affect states in different ways, and therefore each country
should define perceived threats for itself, as
well as the policies and instruments it will
use to contend with them (See Box 4).

It is important to point out however that even if
traditional and emerging problems of security
can turn into threats and eventually require of
the use of force on the part of the government
–especially military force—, they largely originate in the difficulties the states and societies of
the region face in implementing sustainable development processes that would reinforce the legitimacy of political, economic and social insti

tutions. The solution to many of the security
problems of the region is, therefore, strongly
linked to the success of economic policies and to
the legitimization of democracy as an efficient
political regime.

**2.3. A Governance in Security issues**

The American institutional framework related to
security and defense issues is changing from the
framework of collective security, which was created during the Cold War towards a more varied
and extensive system. The model combines institutions already in existence with an ever increasing number of cooperative regimes of international nature with different intended goals
(continental, regional, subregional and neighboring). The different kinds of systems, as a whole,


**BOX 4**

###### THE MOST SIGNIFICANT UNCONVENTIONAL THREATS

**Terrorism**

Among the risks and threats that have emerged with globalization, the irruption of new forms of terrorism
has been particularly severe, such as those on United States territory in September of 2001.With these
attacks terrorism has become the most important threat to international security. Reactions to this type of
action have varied in accordance with the intensity with which the phenomenon threatens each particular
country and its capacity for response, but the general trend is to resort to greater international cooperation,
a method that has also appeared among American countries.[15] In fact, the new forms of terrorism have had
equivalent versions in other countries of the continent. Argentina suffered a terrorist attack on her own territory which destroyed the Jewish community building, massively affecting Argentine citizens during the
90s.

**Drug Trafficking**

Until the terrorist attacks against the United States in 2001, drug trafficking was the most severe threat to
the continent in the globalization era. However, the illegal drug trafficking and drug use continues to grow
and its importance, as a security problem for all the countries of the continent –and a defense problem for
some of them– has not disappeared; especially in those countries where coca and poppy production, and
drug preparation is concentrated (Andean region), those who have the main distribution routes (Central
America and the Caribbean), and main consumption (United States).

**Mass Migration**

Generally speaking, the migratory phenomenon has acquired world relevance, and constitutes one of the
most important changes associated with globalization during the 1990s. Although this process can have
different manifestations (migration as a result of conflicts —displaced persons— or migration as a result of
societal changes) it has challenged the capacity of receiving states to exercise effective jurisdiction over
their territories and to carry out the internal and external policies they have defined for themselves as sovereign nations, thus generating a heavy political impact. At the same time, it has become an important factor in the generation of international crises among affected countries. In addition to diplomatic actions and
internal measures, receiving states have sometimes been forced to use armed force, military and/or the
police, to control this situation.

On the continent, beginning in the 1990s, numerous security problems have occurred which originated in
illegal mass migrations, mainly to the United States, but also to other Latin American countries, and therefore this migratory issue has been included in the continental agenda.

are leading to a de-facto system that provides
new solutions to new problems and strives to attain greater levels of governance for the continent, within the security context .

From a conceptual perspective, the main elements that form this developing system are the
following:

**_a) Democracy_**
Democracy has been adopted as political system by nearly all the countries of the American continent. Within this context and in
spite of the existing differences in the degree
of progress towards the consolidation of
democratic regimes, the countries of the region have developed numerous initiatives
within the framework of the Organization of
American States (OAS) and, later, within the
wider context of the America Summits
Process, directed towards the promotion and
strengthening of democracy and human
rights observance as the political bases that
favor stability and security in the continent.
This process has had several salient points
during later years, of which the approval of
the Santiago Commitment and OAS Democratic Charter are worthy of mention.

The existence of democracy does not inherently eliminate the risk of conflict or guarantee predictability in the international performance of states. However the international historical records indicate that democracy
offers better conditions for achieving peace
and stability than other political regimes, as
well as greater assurance that countries will
bind their mutual relations to more predictable patterns of behavior. This is due to
the characteristics of the democratic system.
Through the division of the powers of the
State, control mechanisms and their balance,
submission of authority to public scrutiny
and the regulations of the Constitutional
State, democracy reduces the possibilities
that decisions will be left to the discretion of
a one-person government.

In accordance with the Summit process, the
OAS has achieved important agreements on
the control of drug trafficking, especially
through the multilateral certification mechanism and the set of agreements whose supervision was established at the Interamerican Commission for Drug Abuse Control (ICDAC), after the Santiago Summit. The same
can be said with respect to the agreements


achieved that encompass a wide spectrum of
issues related to transparency in the acquisition of conventional weapons(1999) and control of light arms trafficking (1997).

With the coming of the 21st Century, the experience accumulated on the American continent during the past decade tends to confirm the above. Despite the economic and institutional difficulties that began to affect
several countries by the end of the 1990s,
democratic regimes have continued to exist
on the continent, favoring a relatively more
stable continental environment. Also contributing to this purpose is the idea that the
maintenance of a stable international and
continental setting is a factor that works in
favor of achieving the internal stability necessary for the consolidation of democracy
and which is a requisite for insertion into an
unavoidable globalization process; particularly in order to be able to participate in regional and subregional integration processes
that can improve each country’s possibilities
for taking part in globalization where competition among the different economies of
the world has not disappeared.

The effectiveness of democracy has thus been
acquiring a growing strategic importance and
has been institutionalized through the incorporation of democratic clauses in Inter-American institutions, as well as in integration
agreements including bilateral agreements.

**_b) Cooperative Regimes of Security_**
The decline in conflict situations among
countries of the continent, which became
clear during the 1990s, has created an opportunity for a significant increase in the will to
cooperate among states and to advance towards an environment of security for all, i.e.,
founded on the basis of shared perception instead of on the concept of a security associated with a specific global strategy.

Within the scope of the inter-state security
agenda, there are at least two principles that
enjoy a growing consensus and are perceived as the driving force behind the evolution of cooperative relations: the will to
make intentions and capabilities transparent
and the will to reduce the perception of mutual threat through initiatives that facilitate
development in bordering areas, mutual confidence measures (MCM) and armament
control agreements (See Box 5).


-----

**BOX 5**

###### PRINCIPLES OF CONTINENTAL COOPERATION
**Transparency**

Within the scope of transparency,it has already been mentioned that countries are making important progress with
the publication or preparation of their books of defense.

Another effort to this end has been the development of common standard methodologies for measuring defense
spending among the countries of the continent.Some of them,like the USA and Canada apply a methodology in use
within NATO (i.e.,an extra-continental alliance).However,no standard method accepted by two or more countries of
the continent for comparing their respective defense spending existed until 2001.In 1997,after discussing the possibility of promoting such an initiative,Chile and Argentina approved a Common Standardized Methodology for
Measuring Defense Spending,designed by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC)
in 2001.Subsequently,during the first half of 2002,Chile initiated similar efforts with Peru for the same purpose.

There is also a transparency system with respect to conventional arms acquired or owned.Even though its regulations
are not compulsory,Chile sends annual reports to the conventional arms registers that are kept by the UN and OAS.

**Mutual Confidence Measures (MCM)**

In the strictly military sphere the continent has seen an increase in the application of Mutual Confidence Measures
(MCM),with the objective of attenuating the perception of mutual threats,as well as of avoiding situations that could
generate crises due to unexpectedness or error,thus favoring the political stability of the countries that establish them.

In broad outlines,MCMs are conditions that may or may not generate an international system.Taking into account
that MCMs are not suppletory measures of defense, they cannot be conceived in such a way as to undermine the
dissuasive effect of the defensive system itself,which would weaken the Defense system’s capability to safeguard
national possessions.

In order to produce a useful effect, they must be conceived as a means and not as an end in themselves.In addition,
their special nature should be reinforced:the fact that they are applicable to concrete cases aimed at addressing
“new destabilizing factors”,such as unconventional threats.After analyzing and evaluating results, these measures
should form part of the preparation of an international system of security through which countries would bind
themselves to universal and interrelated regulations to deal with conflicts.

**Arms Control**

Arms control is a mechanism that helps to eliminate the possibility of conflicts thus facilitating the stability of the
region.

The international community has negotiated only one multilateral instrument dealing with conventional weapons,
called the “Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be
Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects”. The Convention was opened for signature in
1981 and entered in force at the end of 1983.To date Chile is not a party to the convention but its signing of the convention is under legislative discussion.

It should be noted that other weapons of mass destruction are not only nuclear in nature,but also bacteriological
and chemical.Even though it is a country which does not produce these types of weapons,Chile has signed the following conventions which regulate their use:the “Convention on Chemical Weapons”signed in 1993 and ratified in
1996,and the “Convention on Bacteriological (Biological) Weapons”,signed in 1972 and ratified in 1980.

In addition,Latin America has benefited indirectly from the “Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons”
(TNP),which made it a nuclear-weapon-free zone.Chile ratified this treaty in May of 1995.

Chile consolidated its condition as a nuclear-weapon-free zone through the Tlatelolco Treaty.This treaty not only bans
nuclear weapons but also freezes atomic development for military use at the level that each country had reached at
the moment the treaty took effect.In this way it reduces the effects of disparity of military atomic development.
Nevertheless,scientific development and the peaceful use of atomic energy do not oppose these treaties to which
Chile is a party.


-----

**2.4. Interamerican Security Institutions**

A very important feature of the evolution of security on the American continent has been the
emergence, since the 1980s, of a greater variety
of institutional forms than existed earlier. These
forms have in fact been shaping a new architecture of cooperative security that provides a
greater relative degree of governance to the continent. Today it is clear that the security institutions of the continent are not restricted to those
established in the Río Agreement, in particular
the Interamerican Treaty of Mutual Assistance
(TIAR). In this sense the collective security system is only a portion of a wider, growing and interrelated network of collective security regimes.

This provides a more functional system to deal
with the array of security problems faced by the
continent: those linked to the perception of conventional threats as well as those related to unconventional risks.

The shaping of this new security architecture
has been guided by two criteria: the type of security problems to which it responds (conventional or unconventional) and their scope.

Thus, for example, during the 1990s a significant
number of the countries of the continent have
signed and/or ratified the most relevant international instruments of the United Nations System
on matters such as nonproliferation and limitation of weapons of mass destruction. Likewise,
many countries of the continent have signed other international instruments, such as the Convention on Antipersonnel Mines or the treaty on
Missile Technology Control, and many have coincided with the growing interest in increasing
their contributions to peacekeeping operations
of the United Nations.

With respect to the traditional security agenda,
on the initiative of Chile and other countries, the
OAS organized two regional conferences to foster
Mutual Confidence Measures, one in 1995 and
the other in 1999. Based on these, a monitoring
mechanism has followed, which is added to the
conflict prevention instruments established
within the Interamerican system and the United
Nations.


###### 3. THE REGIONAL CONTEXT

The difficulties that emerged on the continent in
the late 1990s, particularly in some of its regions,
are associated with serious economic uncertainties and the perception of the electorate that
many public and private institutions were not
adequately addressing their demands in social
issues or dealing with phenomena, such as corruption, that pervert the use of goods of special
sensitiveness to society. Even though these difficulties do not affect all American countries,
some of them could reach a situation of social
anomaly and institutional uncertainty that impairs the stability that all countries need to develop sustainable political, economic and social
models.

However, such difficulties have not been transferred to the sphere of security and, in fact, the
decline in conflict situations between states has
been of particular relevance in the South American region. A first stage was to surmount si-tuations of rivalry or conflict that affected relations
on the Southern Cone area or subregion, particularly between Argentina and Brazil, as well as
between Argentina and Chile. This process started in the mid 1980s and continued during the
1990s.[13 ]The conclusion of the Peru-Ecuador dispute was added to the change in strategic relations between Argentina, Brazil and Chile. Furthermore, in 1999 some outstanding clauses of
the 1929 Treaty and its Complementary Protocol,
between Chile and Peru, were finally met.

A set of agreements of regional scope has also
helped to strengthen the inter-state security
framework in South America. The Río Group,
acting as a consensus mechanism, has held relevant dialogues on matters such as nonproliferation, disarmament, military spending, the environment, humanitarian operations and drug trafficking.

On the other hand, the experience acquired during these last two decades has demonstrated that
security policies must encompass the diversity
and specific rationale of the different regions of
the continent. Accepting the fact that these regions have their own distinctive driving forces, it
has been possible to develop, within the field of
security, some particularly effective policies for

conflict resolution or to expand cooperation at
regional or subregional levels. The momentum
of integration processes can be seen in different
regions of the continent.

Important advances can also be seen in the subregional sphere, as is the case of the Andean
Community and of the MERCOSUR zone. In this
latter case, of special relevance to us, Chile expressed its political will to contribute to the subregional cooperative effort when it decided to
join MERCOSUR in 1996, in spite of the fact that
it has propitiated a policy of openness to foreign
trade with the region and in spite of having an
economic policy with features that distinguish it
from the economic principles of the bloc.

Although the context of the present difficulties
affecting some member countries makes
progress towards newer forms of inter-state relations more complex, the truth is that MERCOSUR has acquired the characteristics of a subregional opportunity for convergence that can be
useful in addressing security issues, such as the
case of the issuance in 1998, of the “MERCOSUR,
Bolivia and Chile Statement as a Zone of Peace”.
The challenge is to develop opportunities for coordination and political cooperation for the
achievement of common objectives.

It is indisputable that cooperation at the bilateral
level has been important to the positive changes
in the subregional context, in some cases even
influencing the entire region, as were the cases
of the Argentina-Brazil agreement on nuclear
matters and the Chile-Argentina cooperation in
the field of mutual trust and transparency.

###### 4. THE NEIGHBORING CONTEXT

From the late 1980s and during the 1990s the
American countries of the Southern Cone strove
to achieve political changes and to renew their
development policies, an initiative that has had
positive effects within the field of security and
Defense, with special characteristics in each
country. Some of the significant progress
achieved in this field has been the result of singular bilateral goodwill agreements. Furthermore, the changes that have taken place in development models, from closed economies towards a constant opening of economies, have
opened new horizons for cooperation and associations between neighboring countries, which also have an effect on the field of security and Defense. All of this certainly represents a historical


transformation in the strategic relations of the
Southern Cone.

**4.1. Chile and Argentina**

In a little over a decade Chile and Argentina
have moved the focus of their relations towards
cooperation, association and integration.

This change has had significant effects in the
field of security and Defense. With relations
moving from discord towards association, the
center of strategic relations has also moved towards cooperation in identifying shared interests
in this stage of globalization, integration and
achievement of common objectives.

During these years, the progress experienced
through this bilateral process in the area of Defense has been founded on two main pillars that
have taken shape gradually: the building of trust
and the search for relations of association.

**_a) The Building of Trust_**
Trust has been developed in the fields of Foreign Policy and Defense, and in this case,
within the field of military policy.

In the setting of the American continent, the
bilateral agenda of Chile and Argentina does
not have pending border issues. On the
Antarctic continent, the territories of both
countries overlap by 21 geographical degrees, between longitudes 53º and 74º,
where the border has not yet been defined.
The two nations have mutually recognized
their sovereignty between longitude 25º and
90º West, in compliance with the Vergara-La
Rosa Declaration of March 4, 1948. In the
Antarctic region not yet defined the two nations agreed to act with a spirit of cooperation. In 1984, with the mediation of Pope
John Paul II, the Treaty of Peace and Friendship was signed, by which they definitively
moved out of one of the most difficult and
risky periods of bilateral relations, through
the observance of international law and consolidating the explicit commitment of both
countries to abstain from using force. In
1991, the Presidents of Chile and Argentina
reached an agreement on 22 of the 24 border
points under litigation. In this agreement
they also agreed to submit the controversy of
Laguna del Desierto to arbitration. The arbitration award came in 1994, and was duly
obeyed. Lastly, the two nations signed in the
Agreement to precisely define the border

Efforts made during the bilateral process of
consolidating trust were initially focused on
initiatives directed towards stabilizing strictly military relations between both countries.
These tasks took much of the first half of the
1990s. During the second half of the decade
further progress was reached, several proposals were made in other relevant areas of
Defense and from 1995 onwards both countries began to institutionalize relationships of
cooperation within this field.[14]

**_b) Political Association and Common_**
**_Policies_**
The second pillar on which the bilateral defense relations with the Argentine have developed has been one of a gradual convergence of policies in this field, on the basis of
an enlarged agenda on common objectives
within the context of globalization and integration processes.

Chile and Argentina have tended towards a
growing convergence in defense matters of a
world scope. One example is the importance
assigned to the maintenance and building of
international peace under the mandate of
the United Nations. This has made it possible
to carry out military exercises directed towards achieving greater cooperative operations between the two forces.

Both countries have also been able to coordinate common endeavors intended to consolidate post Cold War stability in the region. For
example they have promoted the banning of
weapons of mass destruction and have also
played important roles in the course of the
Conferences of Ministers of Defense of the
Americas –the second conference was held
in Argentina (Bariloche, 1995) and Chile organized the fifth (Santiago, 2002, see Box 6)[15]–
and in the promotion of mutual trust both at
the meeting of experts in Buenos Aires (1994)
and the Conference of Santiago (1995).
Within the subregional sphere, cooperation
between the two governments has acquired


**BOX 6**

**DECLARATION OF SANTIAGO**

Approved at the 5th Conference of Ministers of
Defense of the Americas, the Declaration of Santiago sets forth a list of cooperative recommendations for dealing effectively with the new security problems within the region. These include:

!The regard of democracy and its institutions
as essential elements for the security of the
American continent.

!The importance of constitutional
subordination of the Armed and Security
Forces to the legitimately constituted civil
authorities of each State.

!The adoption of effective policies to reduce
poverty as a significant contribution towards a
greater democratic stability and security in the
American region.

!The rejection of all forms of terrorism and the
increase of international cooperation for
addressing it jointly.

!The confirmation that the region is gradually
progressing towards a sophisticated security
system, formed by a network of traditional and
new institutions and security regimes, both
collective and cooperative of a hemispheric,
regional, subregional and bilateral scope and
that a new architecture of flexible security has
been taking form.

!The suitability of progressing in updating and
systematizing the common principles for the
security of the region.

!Full accession to the International Humanitarian
Law, with the consequent strengthening of the
introduction, integration and continuity of
education programs about Human
Rights and the International Humanitarian Law
within the professional education process of the
armed and security forces.

!The promotion of the publication of Defense
Books, in accordance with the specific
situation of each State.

!The promotion of transparency in the Defense
budgeting process, as well as strict compliance
with requirements for submitting data to the
United Nations Standardized Report on
Military Spending.

!The increase in the scope and efficacy of the
Measures to Promote Mutual Trust and Security
among States, especially the implementation of
combined exercises of the Armed Forces.

great importance through proposals ranging
from fighting terrorism to protecting the air
and Antarctic environments.

In the strictly military sphere, in 1999 the navies
of Chile and Argentina began combined Antarctic navy patrols. Both navies also signed an
agreement for the joint production of naval
units. The first result of these agreements was
the overhauling, at the Shipyard and Workshops
of the Chilean Navy (ASMAR), of the destroyer
Hércules, the flag-ship of the Argentine Navy.
Both cases are an excellent example of the potential of military cooperation as a way of achieving common policy objectives.

**4.2. Chile and Peru**

A close and fruitful relation with Peru is a highly important objective to Chile, considering the
geographic proximity and the potential for economic development which integration offers to
both countries.

Chile and Peru have expressed coinciding points
of view on different issues of global and regional
interest, especially after signing the Minutes of
the Chile-Peru Mixed Commission responsible
for the verification of the position of border mark
N°1 and to demarcate the maritime boundary, of
August 19, 1969.

In later years, both countries have achieved new
progress. The “Act of Execution” of the Treaty of
1929 and its Regulations, signed in 1999 under
the provisions of Article 5 of that Treaty and Article 2 of its Complementary Protocol, as well as
the unveiling of the Christ of the Concord at
Morro de Arica, in 2000, were milestones in their
relations.

In the Joint Declaration of the Presidents of
Chile and Peru signed on July 30, 2001, the
Heads of State of both countries agreed that the
two countries are called to develop exceptional
and permanent links within the framework of an
associated strategy founded on the two governments will for cooperation and coordination, on
shared principles, values and objectives, on their
neighboring status and on a common view of the
future of their respective peoples, with the purpose of promoting regional development and integration. In particular they agreed to strengthen
and intensify cooperation and mutual trust relations within the scope of security and defense
and agreed to develop an “homologation”
process in their respective defense spending


measurement systems.

On this occasion, the Heads of State arranged for
the introduction of the “Two plus Two Meetings”
with the establishment of a Permanent Advisory
and Political Coordination Committee comprised
of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Defense of
both countries. They also agreed upon the establishment of a Defense and Security Committee
(COSEDE), comprised of high-level officials of
the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Defense of
each country, including the Armed Forces.

To date, this Committee has met twice: in Chile
(Santiago, October 25, 2001), when they approved the “Memorandum of Understanding between the Republic of Chile and the Republic of
Peru for the Strengthening of Cooperation in
Matters of Mutual Interest concerning Security
and Defense”, and in Peru (Lima, March 26,
2002), when it agreed to establish a working
group to start preparing a common methodology
for measuring defense spending.

On August 23, 2002 the Presidents of Chile and
Peru met in Santiago and signed a Joint Declaration and several bilateral agreements. One of
them established the terms of reference to be
used as a basis in the work of the experts responsible for preparing a proposal on a standard
common methodology for measuring defense
spending.

**4.3. Chile and Bolivia**

Relations with Bolivia are characterized by the
sustained efforts made by the Presidents of both
countries to hold talks for the purpose of achieving a higher level of cordiality and understanding on a wide variety of issues concerning development on the basis of the essential framework
of these bilateral relations.

As a result, these conversations have reaffirmed
the principles, treaties and agreements that sustain these relations, in accordance with which
there are no outstanding territorial issues between the two countries. In turn, the free transit
regime at the ports of Arica and Antofagasta,
which benefits Bolivia, based on the Peace and
Friendship Treaty of 1904, constitutes a basic issue to consi-der in these bilateral relations.

Since 2000, the meetings of both Presidents within the framework of multila-teral summit meetings in Brasilia, Québec, Santiago, Lima and San
José de Costa Rica, reveal that relations have


-----

reached a stage that allows for progress in the
analysis of different subjects of mutual interest.
Both Presidents have taken several steps towards
restoring trust and thereby developing different
initiatives that will help to initiate development
possibilities to mutual advantage. On these occasions, specific issues of mutual interest have
been analyzed, such as those concerning energy,
mining, water resources, infrastructures linked
to transport, cooperation in agricultural matters
and regional and local cooperation.

These presidential meetings have also led to
meetings on different technical issues, including
the Border Committee, Political Meetings, the
Joint Commission against the Drug Trafficking
and negotiations on a Treaty for the Exchange of
Convicts.

Today Chile and Bolivia have relations in the
fields of politics, economics, national borders
and culture, which represent ongoing work by
various bilateral bodies and coordinated efforts
in different forums of regional integration. Within this context the effective establishment of
physical interconnection corridors with Bolivia,
as well as project to establish a framework agreement for energy interconnection, are worthy of


mention. These are some of the efforts that work
towards closer relations in the fields of politics,
economics and strategy.

An unprecedented event worthy of note is the
visit paid by the Commander in Chief of the
Army of each country at the Conferences of
American Armies (CEA), when these have been
held in Bolivia and Chile, respectively.

Within this general framework, there is frequent
interaction with Bolivian government officials in
activities related to defense — such as academic
and professional events. Bolivia also participates
in FIDAE (International Fair on Air and Space)
which takes place every other year in Santiago.
The Air Force Hospital has also treated several
members of the Bolivian Armed Forces and in
the field of industry ENAER (Chile’s National
Aeronautics Enterprise) has done some work on
air force equipment for the Bolivian Air Force.

## 3. International Conflicts

###### States, the basic political units of inter
 national relations, interact within an

 international system that humans have

 gradually made progress in regulating.

 However, in this environment states

 are not free from threats that may

 sometimes interfere with their normal

 development. This suggests that con
 flicts continue to be one of the ele
 ments that put pressure on world envi
 ronment.


###### 1. RISKS AND THREATS

Debate about what the concept of security
should entail in our contemporary world reveals
the importance of the concept of threats to defense policy matters.

Threats, understood as real or perceived actions,
provoked consciously or unconsciously, by a potential enemy who presumed to have the intention and capacity to affect our own interests negatively, has always been considered the central
element in the structuring of a nation’s defense.
In effect, Defense begins by establishing what is
to be protected, which are the risks or threats to
the object to be defended, when this defense action should take place, and then, defining the
means through which defense will act.

However, this approach leads to a conceptual
distortion of the notion of threat. Although it has
a strong influence in Defense planning, it does
not encompass the entire spectrum of situations
that modern Defense should consider. There are


some fields within the scope of action of Defense
that are not necessarily determined by threats,
such as those that deal with cooperation and the
international commitments a State must assume
in a world where some contemporary processes,
such as globalization, require cooperative behavior. Hence the importance of identifying the opportunities in which it is possible to act cooperatively in search for peace.

An adequate understanding of threat demands
that it be considered in conjunction with other
concepts, which today form part of the interests
of the nation.

A series of current phenomena has led to the design of an international security agenda that is
more varied and sophisticated. These issues
have been analyzed in previous chapters. Suffice
is to point out here that this type of phenomenon includes such items as the diversification
of the actors who play a part in the international
system; the emergence of new problems associated with or derived from the globalization


-----

process; the fact that crises are emerging as a recurrent type of conflict and, lastly, the strategic
changes that are becoming appa-rent at the beginning of the 21st century. It can then be said
that the complexity of the international security
agenda reveals a reality where traditional elements of international conflicts are mixed together with other elements that are not necessarily new but which have acquired unprecedented features in the light of the changes in the
international setting following the end of the
Cold War.

On the other hand, globalization has developed
on the basis of a qualitative advancement of information technologies, which has introduced
changes in the field of strategy that can be summarized under the heading of “Revolution in Military Affairs”. These changes have produced an
enormous gap, or differences in capabilities,
among the states that produce high technology
and those states that depend on it. Among the
latter, some countries or groups of countries supported by them have tended to design strategies
that allow them to achieve their objectives without becoming involved in open conflict within a
setting that favors the countries that possess
state-of-the-art technology. This is how “asymmetric” threats have emerged.

All this has required nations to not only set aside
the view of a threat as an element isolated from
other components of national interest, but to be
open to new definitions of threats in addition to
those considered as “traditional ” or conventional. Some of these new types of threats are those
called “emerging” or unconventional threats and
they also include asymmetrical threats such as
those against the United States and other countries, and even some in our own region.

**1.1. Conventional Threats**

Conventional threats to countries in the Americas are linked to security situations that have afflicted relations between them since the 19th
Century. Classified as of state origin, they generally have to do with conflicts between states of a
territorial or sovereignty nature. The existence
of situations of this type, which can become
threats, is not a thing of the past within the contemporary world or the region. That is to say, the
current international situation and the emergence of new types of threats, does not rule out
traditional threats.

Traditional threats can have an internal or exter

nal origin:
**_a) Internal Threats_**
Internal threats are those that emerge inside a country and affect both the normal
functioning of legitimately established institutions and coexistence and national development. It is common practice for democratic states to have available an array of
nonmilitary instruments to meet these
threats, the use of which is constitutionally
and legally regulated, as well as the potential intervention of national military
forces.[16] Therefore this type of threat is of
interest here only to the extent to which
they can generate situations of internal
crises that may result in international
crises affecting sovereignty or the territory
and triggering the political and/or military
intervention of third parties for their resolution or control.

**_b) External Threats_**
External threats are those that affect the State
and originate outside its borders. Behind
them is a political will –either state or nonstate in character– to cause a specific effect
and they are therefore deliberate actions.

**1.2. Non-conventional Threats**

Unconventional threats are characterized by situations not necessarily linked to states. Many of them
are situations of a social or transnational nature.

The existence of these threats introduces a factor
of conceptual difficulty because they combine
typically domestic issues with external security
considerations, or they influence a nation’s domestic environment and spread from there to
the international arena. This implies the need to
define clearly the role that the Armed Forces
should play in these matters.

In this respect, there is consensus in Chile regarding the idea that unconventional threats
generally constitute security-related problems
rather than Defense ones. Consequently, Chile
should deal with them through the Order and
Security Forces. The role reserved for the Armed
Forces is to offer their support to State authorities and to the police forces in these matters, in
compliance with the rules of law currently in
force. With regard to the international sphere,
the defense policy supports the nation’s foreign

###### ✪

**16 For the case of Chile, see Part I, Chapter I.**


-----

policy in that it should address these threats
through interstate cooperation under established
agreements.

These are threats that do not originate from
sources equivalent to the state that is challenged,
but although their perpetrators are militarily inferior, they can cause serious damage to a state.
They are characterized by their high degree of
unpredictability.

Some of the significant issues in unconventional
threats discussed in the region during the last
few years are:

**_a) The Difficulty of a Single Agenda_**
The principle of the 1997 National Defense
Book –that unconventional threats do not affect states in the same way or with the same
intensity– has been confirmed in recent
years. In effect, the impact of these issues on
each country varies in accordance with the
perspective of each State.

For this reason, it is difficult to establish a
single agenda on new threats for the continent.

**_b) Ordering of Priorities_**
Just as it is difficult to establish a single agenda for unconventional threats for the entire
continent, setting priorities in addressing
them is also a complex task. Even if regional
discussions established the use of a single
agenda, the fact that emerging threats have a
different urgency or priority for each country would be difficult to avoid.

This is why prevention and international cooperation presently appear to be the best and
most effective way available for addressing
this type of threat facing the continent.

**_c) Diversified Response_**
Even though no country is exempt _a priori_
from the danger of unconventional threats,
even asymmetric threats, their impact on
the countries of the continent varies in function of constants such as geographical location and size, or variables such as strategic
importance or the range of the State’s material and human resources. Therefore, the
way in which each country deals with them
and joins international commitments to prevent or combat them is also different.


###### 2. PREVENTION AND REACTION

In order to cope with different threats, countries
adopt precautionary and reaction measures in
the form of public policies aimed at preventing
or combating each situation that can be detected
in the described scenarios. For each kind of
threat, the State will prepare a public policy for
prevention and reaction, with the necessary
components to implement the processes of decision-making and actions required to counteract
their effect.

**2.1. Conventional Threats: Prevention and**
**Reaction**

In general, countries identify potential situations
in which conventional threats could materialize.
These potential situations have been labeled
“conflicts hypothesis” and are generally characterized by:

!Their origin varies based on their wolrd
geographical location.
!The identification of a hypothetical conflict is different from its probability of occurrence.
!Within the context of interaction and cooperation, the probability of a hypothetical
conflict materializing decreases and this decrease, in turn, stimulates the will to identify new opportunities for interaction and cooperation.

Although “conflicts hypothesis” have a low rate
of probability in the region, they still constitute
potential situations and, therefore entail a potential risk. These potential threats persist for Hispanic nations, either as unresolved border demarcation problems arising from the administrative structure of the Spanish Empire, which was
transferred to the newly independent nations, or
from antagonisms resulting from armed conflicts
between them or between one of them and another country, or as a consequence of or associated with a propo-sal to review current treaties
or differences in the interpretation of instruments, particularly if they have been executed.

The integration and cooperation processes in different areas of the American continent, which
began at the end of the 20th century and still
continue, have been accompanied by the challenge of generating trust so as to remove those
elements that make for potential conflict in
those areas and to promote progress towards
closer relations between states. This process,


-----

which could eventually resolve these potential
conflicts, progresses at varying rates, since it depends on the political will of states to promote its
progress.

In this process, the Armed Forces can play an active role in establishing new ties of cooperation
within its sphere of action, but they must not deviate from the constitutional role which the State
assigns to them.

In this sense it does not seem appropriate to reduce the use of Armed Forces in cases of traditional potential conflicts, which have varying degrees of effect and validity. The Armed Forces
act in compliance with the guidelines of a Defense Policy that is closely related to the country’s foreign policy and both must follow the general direction of the Head of State in order to ensure an environment of peace that will allow the
nation to make progress in ensuring the national
welfare.

**2.2. Non-conventional Threats: Prevention and**
**Reaction**

In addition to seeing unconventional threats as
security rather than Defense issues, with the
consequent effects that this view implies for the
use of police and military forces, the State of
Chile’s approach to the challenges they pose
takes the following elements into account:

!Within the current international context, the
State of Chile favors cooperation among states as
a means of dealing with this type of threat.
!This approach requires implementing a national intelligence system, which is presently
under development.
!Defining which situations are considered
threats to the security of the country and what
priority should be assigned to dealing with them
is an exclusive right of the Chilean State.

Based on this approach and the dynamics of international events, Chile has signed a number of
agreements related to international terrorism.
The most recent of these are a direct expression
of the our country’s commitment to the international effort against terrorism that has gathered
momentum after the attacks perpetrated against
Washington D.C. and New York on September 11,
2002 and round out the set of international conventions and protocols that Chile signed earlier
on the same subject (See Box 7).


###### 3. TYPES OF CONFLICTS

The origin of international conflicts can be found
in the existence of opposing interests among
states, between a state and a social or political
group, or between social or political groups
themselves. These opposing interests can be related to historical, ethnic, social, religious, economic or ideological factors. So then, it is geopolitical reasons, economic interests or political actions that most frequently produce an international conflict, even when something else is the
apparent cause.

Conflicts generally fall under one of two basic
categories: crisis or war, although it is perfectly
possible for one to turn into the other with no relation of continuity. In any case, the analysis
presented in this Part II reveals that the type of
conflict that could appear in the region in the future is that of crisis.

**3.1. International Crisis**

Crisis is a conflict of limited intensity involving
actors in the international system attempting to
achieve certain objectives through pressures or
negotiations without resorting to confrontations
or a generalized use of force.

From a political perspective, a crisis may occur
for different reasons. The factors that can set it in
motion may be found in the sphere of relations
between states, but it can also have its causes in
the country’s domestic environment and manifest itself as an international crisis. This is the
situation addressed here, when the situation
brings about the involvement of third parties.

It is important to stress that not all of the causes
of crises are necessarily controlled by the actors
involved. Herein lies the difficulty in dealing
with crises.[17 ]However, it may be the case that
one of the actors thinks he will benefit or achieve
his objectives if he moves his relations with other actors towards a crisis situation. Along these
lines, history has recorded actions taken by other states with the deliberate purpose of triggering a crisis situation, which they will use as a political instrument to achieve their objectives.

###### ✪

**17 “Crisis management” is a means of dealing with situations that**
could escalate in varying degrees but without resorting to a generalized use of military force.


-----

**BOX 7**


History also teaches us that this type of behavior
can only meet with success if such a behavior
does not lead to war, that is to say, that the interests at work are not of vital importance to the
actor or to the other challenged actors, so that
when faced with implicit or potential punishment, the latter would resign themselves to surrender to the pressures or demands received.

Even though the defining conditions of a crisis
exclude or limit the use of force, its use should always be considered. In this same way, for many
different reasons there will always be the risk
that the situation will not be resolved, but will
escalate into a generalized use of military force.
One of the most important features of a crisis is
precisely the degree of uncertainty as to its effects, outcome, conclusion or escalation.

The use of the concept of crisis in all its complexity, and methods of crisis management, requires coherent, uniform conceptual criteria at
all levels of Defense. At the strategic level it is also essential to have clear, well-defined rules of
engagement.

**3.2. War**

War is a conflict in which the vital interests of a
country are under threat. It is the most extreme
of conflicts and commits the entire potential of
the country to action.

War does not spring up suddenly; it is usually
preceded by a situation of crisis. The lack of
agreement in a crisis situation may lead to an escalation, which can in turn lead to the generalized use of force to achieve the desired objectives.

In war, once hostilities have been initiated, the
use of military force gains in importance as the
central element of a country’s response. Definitively, the role of the Armed Forces is nothing
more and nothing less than to crush the will to
fight of the enemy forces, which can be achieved
either through complete defeat or by placing
them in a situation in which it would be completely useless to continue fighting.

## 4. The Geostrategic Challenge

###### Chile’s geography has peculiar features

 that require careful study considering

 its defense. The variety of the geo
 graphical features within our territory

 comprise geostrategic characteristics

 that must be considered in designing

 and implementing the National Defense

 Policy. They affect both its infrastruc
 ture and the deployment of its Armed

 Forces during peacetime.


###### 1. THE GEOSTRATEGIC PERSPECTIVE

From a geostrategic perspective, the following
are some of the factors involved in planning for
Defense:

**1.1. The terrestrial factor**

The nation’s continental territory in the shape of
a long narrow strip is one of the most important
factors to consider. It requires making a choice as
to where to concentrate the nation’s defense efforts, since it is impossible to distribute forces
along the entire length of such an extensive border. Also, the need to ration manpower and
equipment increases as the distances between
extreme regions increases the difficulty of executing strategic maneuvers. Lastly, the narrowness of the territory located on the South American continental shelf implies a lack of strategic
transversal depth which makes it very difficult to
carry out any east-west defensive action.


Access to the opposite ends of the country is difficult: the North at one end (Regions I, II and
III) encompasses the world’s most arid desert
and the South, at the other end (Regions XI and
XII) has no land link to the central area of the
country.

The differences in climate and terrain require
different acclimatization and training for personnel and different equipment for the different regions of the country, all of which makes mobilization and training of reserve personnel more
difficult. This situation also entails logistic difficulties, since it requires maintaining equipment
and materials that adapt to different altitudes
and weather conditions. The result is a need for
a significant investment in personnel and equipment.

The unequal distribution of the population and
the low densities at opposite ends of the country
require considering the transfer of manpower
and material resources from the central zone


-----

(Regions V through VIII) to those areas, making
maintenance and training of reserve forces more
difficult.

The country’s long, narrow shape and its rough
terrain pose serious challenges to the network of
highways, and affect operational and logistic
transportation, which implies countless provisions of all sorts, especially those resulting from
national mobilization.

Due to these factors, National Defense has long
had to maintain personnel and equipment permanently deployed at the extreme ends of the
country, a situation that cannot be changed until
there is a substantial change in the variables that
make this condition imperative.

**1.2. The maritime factor**

The portions of the ocean of interest to the country –as described in previous sections on Chile’s
ocean territory and the analysis of Chile’s territory and population,[18]– are of vital importance to
its development, since the greatest portion of its
imports and exports flow through it.

The following are some of the factors involved in
defense of Chile’s ocean territory:

The narrowness of the national territory and the
difficulty and lack of flexibility of surface and air
routes, makes it necessary to perform the majority of operational, military forces and administrative and logistical support services transportation by sea, making use of the national sea lines
of communications.

The strategic importance of the straits between
oceans in the south constitute a daunting task
that must be taken into account in the development of any situation involving National Security and which affects the strategic deployment of
the naval force.


mestic and international, is a strategic imperative if a situation of crisis or conflict occurs, since
interruption of these links would cause problems, in a relatively short period of time, that
would affect the very survival of the country as
well as jeopardize the vital support of its northern and southern tips.

The situations described above do not only require the demanding and traditional tasks of protecting our sovereignty against a military threat
that may reach us by sea, or protecting the sea
routes for military or trading purposes in the
event of conflict. We must also be on guard
against other challenging issues, such as effective protection of our vast Exclusive Economic
Zone, or changes in international maritime law.
This implies that, just as in the rest of the national territory, it is imperative for National Defense to make use of its influence and activities
within a framework of peace in the Chile’s ocean
territory.

**1.3. The Aerospace Factor**

Within this sphere, the objective of Defense is to
influence from the air, the events that take place
on the land and sea. In accordance with the geographical demands of the country, the air space
has features that determine the methods utilized
to achieve this objective.

The following are some of the factors that affect
Defense from the air perspective:

The size and shape of the national territory impose serious logistical demands and a need for
land support structures for air operations. Consequently, an effective instrument of deterrence
requires logistical means capable of a fast, effective reaction, which in turn requires the building
and equipping of air bases for training in peacetime and operations during wartime.

-----

The rough terrain of the national territory limits
the use of monitoring elements located on the
land surface. In addition, the narrowness of the
territory impo-ses serious demands on early
warning alarm systems designed to anticipate air
threats and react appropriately. The technological limitations imposed by the geography of the
country aggravate this condition if the speed of
modern combat planes and the short distances
between the border and our air bases or
other vital points of the country are taken into
account.

Extreme weather conditions restrict the use of
air weapons in some regions of the country.

The support for the other components of the military is limited by available means, but it clearly
poses exacting demands on air alarms since most
of the operations performed by the Army and
Navy require protection from the air.

###### 2. CONCLUSIONS OF THE GEOSTRATEGIC ANALYSIS OF THE NATIONAL TERRITORY

Analysis Considering the geostrategic factor as a
whole, we must bear in mind that Chile’s geography constitutes one of the most significant factors in strategic operations of the Armed Forces.
Geography sets favorable or unfavorable conditions on any consideration of the use of force.
While it is true that the magnitude and length of
Chile’s land, ocean and air borders offer potential for integration and development, they also
increase the potential for conflict because, as
they enhance the relations and diverse types of
contacts, they also present more opportunities to
increase the potential for disagreements that can
lead to crisis and conflict situations when states
have opposing interests.

The characteristics of the geographical factors, in
the form of geographical discontinuity, long distances from the central nucleus, relative non

population of the two ends of the country and, in
general, the island characteristics of the national
territory, make the permanent presence of
Armed Forces in the north and south regions of
the country an imperative. On the other hand
the scanty flexibility offered by the national land
communication network, restricted by geographical features, requires the use of sea and air
transportation for logistics maintenance, as well
as transport, making sea lines of communications, both domestic and international, of vital
importance for the survival of the country in the
event of conflicts. The construction of important
road works which would run parallel to the
north-south National Highway 5 through the
whole length of the country, would provide land
transport with greater flexibility.

All these conditions, in conjunction with the
weather characteristics and the land forms of the
different areas of the national territory, as well
as the large area of air and ocean spaces that
must be guarded and protected, require different, specific ideas and solutions for each of the
different theaters of operations. Each requires
appropriately trained units with personnel and
equipment that is suitable for the particular characteristics of each area’s geography.

In most cases, forces are present to fulfill a military mission, but they also constitute a valuable
contribution to national development, especially
in isolated areas or areas considered isolated due
to their small populations.

All these factors must be taken into account
when defining the structure, organization, deployment, equipping, instruction and training of
personnel that comprise the institutions of the
Armed Forces, to enable them to effectively perform their essential mission.

## PART III National Defense Policy


###### The concept of Defense is related to the action and effect of preserving the pos- session of an asset or of maintaining an adequate degree of freedom of action that will allow access to that asset.

 National Defense can be defined as a set of human, ethical and material means with which a Nation is able to oppose an enemy’s threats to its nation- al objectives, in order to ensure its sov- ereignty and territorial integrity. Its purpose is to achieve the degree of exter- nal security the country needs to attain its national objectives free from external interference.

 The Armed Forces constitutes the core of the instruments of Defense. These instruments are directed and organized by a state policy that expresses the will of the Chilean State to use them either in deterrent or cooperative actions dur- ing times of peace, and through mili- tary operations in wartime, to contend with external interference that threat- ens the achievement of our national objectives.


###### In short, Defense, on the one hand, pro- tects the population, the territory, the goods and the activities that take place within the nation’s boundaries and, on the other, helps to support the implemen- tation of Chile’s foreign policy that is founded on the search for a world order regulated by law and consequently, one in which all States, including ours, will be committed to the obligations that emanate from international law.

 Defense can be analyzed from different perspectives: as a function, as a set of regulations, as an organization and as an economic challenge. This part of the Book basically addresses the first of these perspectives, while the others are described in the following parts.

 Finally, although Defense is essentially directed towards the external security of the country, at the same time it supports the national development through the human and material resources that each one of the Armed Forces institutions pos- sesses.


-----

## 1. Concepts and Definitions

###### When analyzing Defense as one of the

 basic functions of the State, an

 attempt is made to explain its daily

 routine. The idea is to observe the wide

 range of activities that Defense under
 takes to safeguard specific possessions

 that are essential to the country. This

 chapter addresses issues such as the

 objectives of Defense, the characteris
 tics and sources of National Defense

 Policy, and the context in which it is

 applied.


###### 1. OBJECTIVES OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

In broad outlines, Defense, on the one hand, protects the population, the territory, the goods and
activities that take place within the nation’s
boundaries and, on the other, helps to support
the implementation of Chile’s foreign policy that
is founded on the search for a world order regulated by law.

In order to fulfill this general purpose, Defense
pursues the following objectives:

**_a) To preserve the independence and sover-_**
eignty of the country.
**_b) To maintain the integrity of the national_**
territory.
**_c) To help establish the external security_**
conditions needed to achieve the public welfare of the country.
**_d) To support Chile’s international projec-_**
tion.
**_e) To help maintain and promote interna-_**
tional peace and security, in accordance


with national interests.
**_f) To contribute to national development and_**
cooperate with the achievement of a balanced and harmonious realization of the nation’s different capabilities.
**_g) Within the institutional sphere, to help_**
preserve Chile’s institutional system as a Democratic Republic and Constitutional State.
**_h) Likewise, because it embodies national_**
traditions and symbols, to help safeguard our
historical and cultural identity, but not preventing the renewal and enrichment of these
traditions and symbols.
**_i) To contribute to the State’s activities aimed_**
at strengthening of civil society’s commitment to Defense.

Furthermore, in order to achieve these objectives, Defense has a number of different instruments, among which the Armed Forces constitute the core element. These instruments are directed and organized by a state policy that expresses the will of the Chilean State to use such
means in deterrent or cooperative actions during


-----

peacetime and in military operations in wartime,
to contend with external interference that threatens the achievement of our national objectives.

###### 2. CHARACTERISTICS OF CHILE’S NATIONAL DEFENSE POLICY

Our National Defense Policy is a set of principles
and criteria that guide the State’s function of Defense with a view towards preserving the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our nation and
to contributing to the achievement of other national objectives. It provides the general outlines
for structuring, coordinating and attuning efforts
made to contend with the obstacles, risks and
threats that third parts may raise against national interests.

Defense Policy is a State policy and therefore it
must be considered over and above all political
contingencies and at the same time it transcends
the projects and actions that successive governments of the country may undertake.

As a state policy it is also a public policy and,
therefore, must be formulated, implemented
and verified under the same general conditions
as other public policies, including being subject
to the approval of civilian opinion and objections. However, Defense Policy must have certain protections due the nature of some of its issues or elements, which differentiate it from
other public policies. This is why is a public
statement that Defense activities should be protected through special legal systems. For these
reasons, Defense merits specific treatment and
sensitive handling.

Like every activity of the State, Defense Policy
has a dual nature of continuity and change. This
sector embodies national traditions and symbols,
and many of the factors that guide it are of a permanent nature or very stable over time. However, their permanence over time is only valid to
the extent that they will not be changed by the
emergence of new elements that have to be considered or due to shifts in the conditions behind
their development. In other words, it needs sufficient energy to be able to adapt to international changes that would affect the security of the
nation. In addition, it is necessary that they be
consistent with the position the country takes towards the world, with risks and threats to be
faced, and with the nation’s geographical environment and finally with the national traditions
in Defense matters.


All the agencies of the State that have direct responsibilities in Defense must participate in the
formulation of Defense Policy. Particularly important is the leading role played by the Ministry
of National Defense and the Armed Forces, as
well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the
Defense Commission of both Chambers of the
Legislature. Because Defense is the expression of
a national concept, it is also advisable to consider the opinion of other institutions, both state
and private, that have a qualified knowledge of
the subject. One of these is what is known as the
“Defense Community”, a group comprised of
military and civilians, mainly from academic
centers and political parties, whose common denominator is their knowledge and experience in
Defense matters. The purpose of this group is to
establish the lines of civilian and military
thought in the investigation and discussion of
general issues that bear a relation with National
Defense.

Along with providing general guidelines for the
work of the institutions of the sector, Defense
Policy includes the criteria and basic direction to
the precautions that should be taken to neutralize external threats, as well as to deal with domestic emergencies when the constitutional
states of emergency so determine[19], to help reduce the effects of natural disasters and to support Chile’s image abroad. Such guidelines are
intended for all state agencies that take part in
Defense matters rather than to the Armed Forces
in particular. For these there is a Military Policy,
derived from the Defense Policy that lays the
foundations for the actions of the armed forces
during peacetime.

###### 3. REFERENCE FRAMEWORK

Chile’s Defense Policy is formulated in line with
the following general principles:

**_a) The Chilean State does not hold any ag-_**
gressive intentions towards any country in
the world; neither has it had territorial
claims in the neighboring context.

**_b) The Chilean State has the will to protect_**
its population, to defend its national interests, and to safeguard its political independ
###### ✪

**19 For further information about the domestic role played by the**
Armed Forces, please see Part I, Chapter II.


-----

ence, its national sovereignty and its territorial integrity.

**_c) The Chilean State has the responsibility to_**
maintain an adequate military capability to
assist in the achievement of its national objectives, bearing in mind that the development of that military capability is proportional to the development of the country’s
other capabilities.

**_d) The Chilean State has the responsibility to_**
use all its national capabilities and, particularly its military power, for the Defense of
the country and the protection of the national interests in the face of foreign threats, if it
is necessary.

**_e) The Chilean State should encourage civil_**
society’s commitment to National Defense,
with objectives, that include, among others,
the necessary provisions for the fulfillment
of Compulsory Military Service, the meeting
of the needs of national mobilization and the
need to maintain the competence and capabilities of reserve personnel.

**_f)_** For the Chilean State –as for all states in
general–, its relative geographical location is
a significant factor in the formulation of its
Defense Policy.

**_g) The Chilean State has situated its Defense_**
Policy entirely within the institutional legal
framework currently in force in the country
and recognizes and respects the treaties and
international agreements incorporated to
this framework, in such a manner that its
Defense Policy has the legitimacy which is
proper for all policies of State and that it represents the political commitment that, on
one hand, binds the State to the nation’s citizens and, on the other, to the international
community.

**_h) The Chilean State considers as particular-_**
ly important and advisable the existence of a
close relationship and coordination between
its Defense and its Foreign Policy, so that
they complement and reinforce each other,
although the former will act in support of the
latter.

**_i) The Chilean State shall uphold its commit-_**
ment to contribute to the defense and promotion of international peace, in accordance
with national interests.


###### 4. SOURCES OF THE DEFENSE POLICY

The 1997 Book of National Defense identifies as
the main sources of Defense Policy, the National
Security Policy and the Global Political-Strategic
Assessment (AGPE). It should be noted that the
notion of “source” should not be understood in its
basic sense, as the basis or origin of something,
but in its meaning of documentary, work or materials, in the sense that they serve as information or inspiration for a research work or, as in
this case, for the elaboration of a public policy.
Consequently the National Security Policy and
the AGPE fulfill a role of this type in the formulation of the Defense Policy.

**4.1. National Security Policy**

In theory this is the policy that establishes,
among other aspects, the criteria to coordinate
actions to be carried out in the spheres of development and of Defense, with the purpose of
eliminating or reducing the vulnerabilities of the
country so as to achieve a condition that will permit the attainment of national objectives. Consequently, National Security Policy should identify
which vulnerabilities will be addressed through
Defense, which through development, and
which in coordination between the two of them.

It should be stressed, however, that the Chilean
State has not created any set of criteria or guidelines that, as a general framework, could be understood as a National Security Policy. It should
also be emphasized that this situation has not
prevented Chile from having a Defense Policy,
implicit in the past and increasingly explicit following the publication of the 1997 Book of National Defense. In order to achieve a coordinated
management of a global approach to the task of
eliminating or reducing the country’s vulnerabilities, it would seem sufficient to have an adequate coordination between the Defense Policy,
the Foreign Policy, development policies and
those of public order and internal security,
which would probably require establishing earmarked institutional bodies to act as liaison between the different public sectors or, perfecting
those already in existence.

**4.2. The Global Political-Strategic Assessment**
**(AGPE)**

The rule that formalizes the Global PoliticalStrategic Assessment (AGPE) as a pattern for the
basic analysis of National Defense, dates back to
1950, a time when the State perceived the need


-----

for a method by which its political authorities
could relate the national situation to the world,
continental, regional and neighboring scenarios
during a future period. In order to achieve this,
Chile adopted a method of analysis that was used
to visualize potential scenarios within the political or strategic contexts and to indicate the possible effects of State decisions on international
actors that were the targets of those decisions
(See Box 8).

The AGPE constitutes the central element of the
Political-Strategic Planning System that includes,
among others, the National War Plan and the
Plan of National Mobilization.[20]

Because it is a link between Defense Policy and
the goals and priorities of the public agenda, the
AGPE consists of an ongoing, systematic and
prospective analysis of national objectives (current and permanent). Its aim is to propose objectives that not only support Defense Policy but
also the policies of related public sectors.

Its current format is the result of successive
amendments, made since the time it was adopted, for the purpose of adequately relating national objectives to the different international
scenarios, attempting on the one hand, to reduce
external risks and threats to the country derived
from detected controversies as well as to take advantage of cooperation possibilities with other
countries resulting from coinciding views.

The results obtained through the AGPE include a
wide variety of background data and recommendations that can be of help to the President in
making the best decisions on issues involved in
safeguarding the national interest and therefore
constitutes an important basis for political-strategic conducting, as well as for the process of political-strategic planning taken as a whole.

## 2. Elements of the National Defense Policy

###### Chile’s Defense Policy is based on ele
 ments that endow it with particular

 characteristics. Many of these elements

 have been described in the text pub
 lished in 1997. This Book incorporates

 some new elements, such as new ways

 of using Defense means and the legal,

 international and national frameworks

 recognized and in force in Chile.


###### 1. ELEMENTS OF THE CHILEAN DEFENSE POLICY: NDB 1997

The 1997 version of the National Defense Book
(NDB) constituted a significant measure of transparency, because it revealed certain central aspects of our Defense Policy to both the national
and the international community. Some of its
elements are reiterated in the present text, but it
is important to summarize some of its general
contents, since in the process of compiling this
2002 version of the Book, they have retained
their general characteristics and were not modified. The following are some of the more significant of these elements:

**1. 1. National Objectives**

It has been pointed out that Chile’s national objectives excluded territorial claims on its neighbors’ territory and emphasized our country’s definite vocation for peace. Along these lines, Chile supports its national objectives through a Defense Policy whose purpose is to safeguard na

tional interests through a defensive attitude, although it would not be inconsistent to opt for deterrence mode in the political-strategic context.
In summary, it has been stated that Defense continues to rely, primarily, on its own national capabilities and on balancing factors that can be
found within the international system, due to
the political-strategic stature attained by the
country and international ties established as well
as all the diplomatic activities undertaken.

**1.2. International Context**

The international context has been characterized
as complex, with a globalization process currently under way that is not, however, eradicating national diversity nor implying a uniformity
of positions and objectives among states. Therefore, the nation-State continues to be the central
–although not the only– unit of international order. We have concluded that it is necessary to
preserve national identity and that the relative
geographical location occupied by each State in
conjunction with its national interests shall con

-----

tinue to be a significant point of reference for the
respective Defense policies.

**1.3. World and Regional Stability**

Peace has been appraised as an element of vital
importance and Chile’s willingness to participate
in peacekeeping operations sponsored under the
United Nations Charter has been clearly stated,
considering that the maintenance and promotion of world peace are among the objectives of
its Defense Policy. We have also established the
value of the integration process promoted since
the early 1990s, emphasizing the promotion of
trust among states as the political basis of these
processes. Although we pointed out that Mutual
Confidence Measures were not an additional mechanism of Defense, we have duly noted the importance that Chile attributes to the promotion
of confidence within this sphere. We have highly
commended the expansion of democracy in the
continent and defined arms control as a mechanism that helped to reduce the potential for conflicts, thus facilitating regional stability.

**1.4. Defense and Security**

With respect to the relation between Defense
and security, in addition to defining the different
areas encompassed by these state functions, we
have affirmed that it is not ethically justifiable to
ensure a country’s security by trampling on the
enduring values of justice and human dignity.

###### 2. CRUX OF THE NATIONAL DEFENSE POLICY

The Chilean State has a Defense Policy directed
towards protecting the coun-try’s population, defending its national interests and safeguarding
its political independence, national sovereignty
and territorial integrity. But it is also clear, in a
comprehensive and modern sense, that stability
and international security are influential factors
in a nation’s own security.

On this basis, we can say that the fundamental
pillars that support Defense Policy to do so, are
the renovation of the institutions of the Defense
sector, including the Armed Forces, the incentive
to cooperate with the region in matters concerning defense and security, and working towards
world peace and security.

Both cooperation within the region and contributing to world peace and security are imple

mented within the framework established by
Chilean Foreign Policy and the foundations of
our Defense Policy.

###### 3. USE OF THE DEFENSE MEANS

The Defense Policy has established three general
forms of using Defense resources. These forms
are detailed below:

**3.1. Deterrence**

Chile maintains a defensive attitude as a fundamental orientation of its Defense Policy, as well
as its deterrent character in the political-strategic
sphere. It must be noted that the deterrent form
refers to conventional deterrence, since Chile
holds to its international commitments on issues
regarding the non-proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction.

In broad outlines, deterrence is a political-strategic way of using Defense means, in which the
Armed Forces play a primary but not exclusive
role. What deters is the nation’s overall power, directed by the political authorities of the State and
supported by political consensus, as well as by
the population’s determination to support the objectives of Defense. In other words, it is impossible to deter without the existence of military force, but deterrence is basically achieved by virtue
of the political-strategic stature the country has
been able to achieve.

Deterrence is an effect. It is a psychological and
subjective state that one seeks to produce in the
mind of a potential adversary. It therefore centers on the available capabilities and the determination to use them, to make deterrence a viable option. Deterrence attempts to discourage, as
early as possible, any enemy intention to interfere against one’s own vital interests, by demonstrating that the cost of interference will be
higher than its expected benefits. The most effective deterrence is that which insinuates one’s
potential capacity to win. That is, the best form
of deterrence is preparing oneself to win.

Deterrence helps to stabilize international relations, convincing parties not to resort to force to
impose solutions in the event of conflict.
Through deterrence, the State can also prevent
conflict from escalating and becoming an armed
confrontation. As the international system has
developed, other actors with varying degrees of
power have appeared, some capable of disputing


-----

and even threatening the power of a state. Consequently, they must also be considered as potential enemies to be deterred.

It is important not to confuse the orientations of
Defense Policy with the way in which the alternative between defensive and offensive strategic
attitudes operate. In this sense, within a policy
oriented towards protecting the country’s population, defending its national interest, and safeguarding its political independence, national sovereignty and territorial integrity, deterrence
cannot be limited solely to a defensive strategy.
Strategic defense alone, unyielding as it may be,
may not suffice to deter a potential enemy that
threatens force or has decided to use it.

**3.2. Cooperation**

In particular, after the last decade of the 20th
century, the Chilean State has incorporated bilateral and multilateral cooperation on issues concerning Defense and security into its Defense
Policy within the framework established in the
integration processes it promotes and through
active participation in maintaining and building
international peace and security and enforcing it
under certain conditions.

This is not inconsistent with the fact that our Defense Policy has a fundamental defensive orientation and a deterrent character in the political
strategic sphere. On the contrary, Chile is determined to increase its present degree of international cooperation, at different levels or contexts
(neighboring, regional-subregional, continental
and global).

We must keep in mind that Chile’s cooperation
in the region dates back a long time, and there
are military cooperation systems in the American Continent, such as the Conference of American Armies, the Interamerican Navy Conference and the Conference of American Air Force
Chiefs; combined exercises such as Unitas, Rimpac, Team-Work, Red Flag, Passex, Cabañas, and
other more recent efforts, that deal with cooperation, integration and transparency, which demonstrates that cooperation has been ongoing
since the mid-20th century, though, certainly
with different emphases during that time.

The security of Chile depends, primarily, on its
most adjacent strategic environment, but the importance of its relations concerning security with
other international actors and the implications of
an international agenda less linked to definitions


of an exclusive territorial nature has increased.
Because of this, Chile should not restrict its Defense Policy to a mere protection of its territory,
which of course continues in effect. It should be
enriched by the opening of its economy, the renewal of the international political institutions in
which the country participates, the dynamics of
globalization and the growing importance of international crises that have their roots in conflicts between states or non-state threats.

Cooperation does not mean minimizing or changing the roles and missions which the Armed
Forces have been performing and fulfilling
throughout their history, but it also implies that
part of their efforts should be directed towards
collaboration with the national drive towards integration.

**3.3. Coercive Use of Military Power**

The Chilean State recognizes as situations of legitimate use of military forces, in cases of international conflict, those included in the framework established by the United Nations Charter.
In effect, its Article 51 recognizes the immanent
right to legitimate defense, individual or collective, in cases of armed attack against one of its
members. The Chilean State also allows the individual or collective use of armed forces undertaken on the basis of a resolution of the United Nations Security Council, pursuant to Chapter VII
of the above-mentioned Charter.

In any case, Chile will regulate the use of force
in accordance with the conventions and international agreements that govern International Humanitarian Law and the general rules of national
law.

**_a) International Humanitarian Law_**
International Humanitarian Law (IHL)[21] is
the set of international rules, originating in
conventional or common law, that, for humanitarian reasons, restrict the right of parties in an armed conflict, international or
not, to use the means and methods of warfare. The purpose is to protect people or assets
that are or could be affected by the conflict.

With relation to persons, IHL protects every
individual who is not participating, or is no

###### ✪

**21 Also called International Law on Armed Conflicts (ILAC) o**
simply Law of War.


-----

longer an active combatant in the conflict;
the civilian population; military personnel
sick or wounded in war on land; persons
wounded and/or shipwrecked during war at
sea, medical personnel belonging to the Armed Forces, prisoners of war, personnel belonging to religious orders, and staff of civilian protection organizations.

With respect to assets, IHL protects cultural
assets, especially historical monuments,
works of art, or places of worship. It protects
the environment against extensive, lasting or
serious damages. For this purpose, it prohibits means and methods that may cause this
type of harm or impair the health or survival
conditions of the population.

For purposes of applying IHL, an armed conflict can be either a situation of declared war
recognized by the parties or de facto situations in which armed hostilities have begun
without a prior declaration of war. IHL must
also be applied by forces intervening in international conflicts by virtue of the authority established in Chapters VI, VII and VIII
of the United Nations Charter.

However, IHL is not applicable to cases of international terrorism, whether they take place within the context of an international or
internal armed conflict or as isolated or combined actions intended to create panic in the
population, regardless of the goals they pursue. In case of acting against terrorism, the
provisions of international human rights law
set forth in general and special conventions
established to combat terrorism will be observed. These include the international conventions on the “Suppression of Terrorist
Bombings” and on the “Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism”. Both international
instruments oblige countries to include these offenses in their legislation; they facilitate
the rules for the investigation and prosecution of offenders and establish more effective regulations for extradition and mutual assistance in penal matters.

Neither does IHL apply to situations of internal violence, which do not reach the level of
an armed conflict. In these cases, internal legislation and the regulations concerning the
respect for human rights should be applied.

**_b) IHL measures observed in Chile_**
Taking into account the wide conceptual me

aning encompassed by the term war or armed conflict, Chile states that IHL should be
fully applied in all cases where armed struggle between parties with opposing interests
take place. Therefore, our country participates actively in all such instances that help
improve the means and methods of efficiently teaching and applying IHL.

In this respect, on August 31, 1994, Executive Decree 1229 on Foreign Affairs was enacted. The Decree created the National Commission on Humanitarian Law, comprised of
representatives from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defense, Justice, Education
and Public Health. The functions of this
Commission include preparing proposals for
the full compliance with international commitments subscribed by Chile, to which end
has made progress towards identifying, studying and proposing legal reform bills in order
to incorporate the regulations contained in
the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their
additional Protocols of 1977 into national legislation.

Additionally, Chile is at present engaged in a
legislation process aimed at approving and
endorsing other conventions and treaties related to IHL. The attached table shows the
present status of approval and/or endorsement of these pieces of legislation.

Lastly, in the sphere of IHL education, Chile
is presently carrying out a process of incorporating this subject into the general and
specific education programs that are usually
suggested or implemented as a matter of State policy. In general, respect for human
rights and IHL are objectives inherent in all
Chilean education. More specifically, the
instruction about IHL is integrally and systematically imparted to the Armed Forces. The
military institutions are implementing dissemination programs about IHL by increasingly incorporating these subjects into the
study plans of their professional training institutes and into the training of recruits. IHL
is also a relevant issue of education programs implemented at the Chilean Joint
Training Center for Peace Operations (CECOPAC) (See Figure 4).

ties in charge of the management of all levels of National Defense with a set of provisions of different legal rank, which will give
flexibility and adaptability to the State organization, as well as with an opportune and
effective capacity for reaction when faced
with any eventuality. These provisions establish a national legal framework for addressing external threats and their effects include the virtue of making significant modifications to the organization of State administration and its procedures, thus enabling it to
deal with those threats in the best way possible.

Book Four, Title III, Article 418 (on “Complementary Provisions”), of the Military Code of
Justice, establishes that, for the effects of
that book and by extension for all rules governing National Defense, a state of war shall
exist, not only when it has been officially declared, but also when it is de facto or when
an order for mobilization has been given.


An official declaration of war is a special power of the President of the Republic, as is set
forth in the provisions of Article 32, Number
21, of the Constitution. To declare war, the
President must propose to the National Congress a law requesting authorization to make
the declaration and he must also hear the
opinion of the National Security Council on
the matter.

In turn, and in accordance with the provisions of Law 18.953, Art. 1, which establishes
the regulations for Mobilization, The National Mobilization is the combined activities
and measures taken to prepare a part or all
of the human, material and industrial potentials to adequately address a state of war. The
application of these activities and measures
can only take place during the enforcement
of the last stage of emergency and begins on
the date stipulated in the respective executive decree for mobilization. It is important to
note that without prejudice to the above, so

-----

me of the mobilization activities and measures, those corresponding to the preparation
stage, are carried out in a state of normality
without the need to previously establish a
state of war.

The state of assembly has been envisioned
for foreign war situations and is declared by
the President of the Republic in agreement
with the National Security Council under the
provisions contained in the Constitution.

The mere existence of and external war is
sufficient to declare a state of assembly, without the need for a previous enactment of a
law authorizing the declaration of war. It
must not be understood, however, that all
declarations of a state of assembly will automatically precede an official declaration of
war.

A state of assembly is declared through an
executive decree signed by the President of
the Republic, the Minister of the Interior and
the Minister of Defense and is in force as


from its date of publication in the Official
Gazette. A state of assembly can also be declared for either the entire national territory
or for only a portion of it, for a maximum period of 90 days. However, the President is
empowered to request an extension or a new
declaration if the circumstances that caused
it persist.

Nevertheless, Chilean law also allows using a
state of emergency for cases of harm or danger to national security due to causes of foreign origin. Establishment of a state of
emergency is not sufficient basis for declaring mobilization. With the agreement of the
National Security Council, the President
shall call for mobilization under the provisions of the Constitution, to be in force in all
or part of the national territory for a maximum period of 90 days, and can declare it
again or extend it, if the circumstances that
advised its adoption persist.

## 3. The Defense Sector and International Policies

###### This chapter sets forth and describes

 the activities of the sector that are

 part of the National Defense Policy but

 also pertain to policies in the interna
 tional context related to foreign securi
 ty. It particularly addresses progress

 made in the field of cooperation with

 United Nations peacekeeping opera
 tions and the fulfillment of commit
 ments on demining.


###### 1. UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS (UNPKO)

The term “Peacekeeping Operations” is not mentioned in the United Nations Charter. The practice of carrying out these operations since 1945
has created a series of universally accepted principles that constitute the legal framework for the
implementation of peacekeeping operations.

**1.1. General Considerations**

The Chilean State recognizes the United Nations
Charter, signed in San Francisco, USA, in 1945, as
the basic legal framework for international security. Two chapters of the Charter specifically deal
with the regulations of peacekeeping military operations. Chapter VI gives the rules for peacekeeping operations (PKO) and Chapter VII deals
with peace enforcement (PE). The basic difference between the two lies in the fact that the operations carried out under Chapter VI do not provide for the use of coercive force (which is only
authorized in situations of legitimate defense),


while those performed under Chapter VII include coercive actions. More precisely, Chapter
VII refers to “action with respect to threats to the
peace, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression” and includes the measures that the UN Security Council may decide to take in this respect,
either of a provisional order without involving
the use of force or those which are necessary to
maintain or restore international peace and security through the use of air, sea or land forces.

Peacekeeping operations require a special agreement reached between the UN and member
states that have decided to participate in peacekeeping operations, and shall be subject to ratification by the signatory states in accordance with
their respective constitutional processes. For this
reason, the legal framework in which these
peacekeeping operations are carried out calls for
regulations of an international order as well as
for internal laws for participating countries.

Some of the issues defined by these agreements
are the scope of operations, the countries or ar

-----

eas where they will take place, their length, the
type and quantity of resources to be committed
and, in particular, complementary aspects and
limitations that may be “agreed upon”.

Peacekeeping operations are a dynamic concept
that evolves in accordance with changes undergone in the form of using resources to address
different situations that require action. In fact,
in the beginning, military forces were used in
procedures adopted to deal with conflicts between states, with extensive participation of military observers supervising conditions of ceasefire, but the situation underwent substantive
changes over time. Particularly with the end of
the Cold War, there has been an increase in the
number of cases of internal conflicts, i.e., those
in which contending factions belong to the same
State.

Within this context, the need for the United Nations to maintain its legitimacy in the preservation of international peace and security, has led
it to promote the participation of multinational
forces, in accordance with different regional or
international arrangements for which participating countries need to have pro-perly trained military forces available, thus enabling them to provide a fast response, upon authorization of the
Security Council. This policy of the United Nations entails that once the situation that gave rise
to such an intervention has consolidated, a peace
operation would be deployed in order to support
the building of peace.

**1.2. Chile’s Policy for Participation in UNPKOs**

Taking into account the changes that have taken
place internationally, the Chilean State policy of
participation in peacekeeping operations has also changed, but still maintains its conceptual,
doctrinal and political-strategic principles.

Chile’s participation was established through an
executive decree approving the pertinent policy
in November 1996. This document specified
what the State understands as peacekeeping operations and clearly limits the scope of Chilean
participation to Chapter VI of the United Nations
Charter.

The following are some of the prominent general, political and operating criteria established
through that decree:

**_a) UNPKOs must meet the national interest_**
that is related to commitments entered into


with the United Nations and to a concern
about peace issues.

**_b) The Chilean State does not place contin-_**
gents at the disposal of the United Nations so
that this organization can autonomously decide upon their assignment.

**_c) The Chilean State shall assess each United_**
Nations request for participation in peacekeeping operations separately, on its own
merits. The President shall make the final
decision about Chile’s participation in peacekeeping operations.

Since 1997, the Chilean State has made some
changes to its UNPKO participation policy.

In 1999 a Memorandum of Understanding was
subscribed with the United Nations SecretaryGeneral that establishes Chile’s contribution to
the UN’s Stand By Forces Agreements[22] (See Figure 5).

In addition, Executive Decree (G) 68 was enacted in October 1999, with wording that incorporates the provisions of the 1996 executive decree
into the changes made.

The executive decree of 1999 extends Chile’s participation in UNPKOs to participation under certain powers included in Chapter VII of the Charter, but with restrictions on involvement in some
of the actions it provides for.

One limitation that has been maintained is that
of not authorizing the use of Chilean Forces for
the search and/or capture of criminals, belligerents or war criminals.

Chile also maintained its limitation to the effect
that it will only assign professional staff, either
civilian or military, and preferably volunteers, to
UNPKOs. These leadership groups may not contain drafted personnel.

Another important innovation is the creation of
the Chilean Joint Training Center for Peace Operations (CECOPAC), with the purpose of training both national and foreign military, police and
civilian staff who will participate in peacekeep

Nations Organization of November 11, 1999..

ing operations. As an agency under the Ministry
of National Defense, the Center receives advise
from the National Defense General Staff, which
in turn can advise the Ministry on UNPKO issues
and thereby inform the rest of the government
system.

**1.3. The Armed Forces in UNPKOs**

The Services of the National Defense participate
in peacekeeping operations in accordance with
the policy and instructions of the Chilean State.
Determining which resources will be used basically depends on the type of operation the President of the Republic has decided to accept and
on an analysis of the capabilities that can best
fulfill the proposed mission.

This UNPKO participation commitment does not
deviate the Armed Forces from their essential
and primary mission, which is that they exist to
defend the homeland. When the Chilean State
decides to participate in a certain UNPKO and to
assign a mission to fulfill it, it should consider
contributing funds in the event they are needed
to complement the funding allocated by the
United Nations.[23]


Each operation involves creating a certain particular set of Rules of Engagement, which must
be approved by the national authorities of the
participating countries. In Chile’s case, these
rules must comply with both the legal regulations in force and the conditions imposed by International Law, with the emphasis that they
may not, under any circumstances whatsoever,
limit the right to legitimate defense.

**1.4. Participation of Chile in UNPKOs since**
**1997**

Chile’s participation in peacekeeping operations
dates back to 1948. At that time, Chile began its
participation in Treaty or Cease Fire Observation
missions, through Officers acting as observers,
including those in India-Pakistan and the Middle
East, that still continues today. However, Chile
has increased its participation since 1990, taking
part in operations in Iraq-Kuwait in 1991 (Air
Force), Cambodia in 1992 (Navy), Iraq in 1996

###### ✪

**23 Official Gazette N° 36.510 of November 10, 2000.**


-----

(Air Force), Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1997 (Police Force), and Eastern Timor in 2000 (Army).

In August 1996, as the 1997 Book of National Defense was being prepared, the Air Force sent a
helicopter group, comprised of 41 permanent officers and staff, on a UN mission to Iraq to verify
its compliance with regulations prohibiting it
from producing nuclear, chemical or biological
weapons. In 2000, an Army officer joined this
group as weapons inspector.

In April 1997, in response to a UN request, a contingent of 50 members of the Chilean Police
Force was ordered to participate in the International Police Task Force (IPTF) for Bosnia and
Herzegovina under the Dayton Agreements
signed between the enemy parties of that republic belonging to the Former Federation of Yugoslavia.

In 1998, in view of the significant increased
number of peacekeeping operations taking place
throughout the world at that time and the need
to establish a permanent liaison between the
Ministry of National Defense and Chile’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations, an officer
was added to the Mission as Defense Attaché.

In January 2000, the army deployed a group of
helicopters comprised of 3 airships and 41 officers and NCO personnel to the United Nations
Mission in Eastern Timor (UNTAET). An army
officer was also added to the mission, as planning officer in the General Headquarters of UNTAET.

In the same year, Chile added an army officer to
the Office of the Chief of Staff of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo to act as Liaison Officer
between the forces of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and of the UN that are participating in that peace mission.

Lastly, in 2001, a naval officer was added to the
staff of the Training Center for Peace Operations
in the Republic of Argentina (CAECOPAZ) and
another naval officer was added to the Infantry
Battalion of the Argentine Navy deployed in the
peacekeeping mission in Cyprus.

###### 2. MUTUAL CONFIDENCE MEASURES

Since the publication of the 1997 Book of the Defense and within the sphere of Mutual Confidence Measures, a number of activities have


been taking place that have helped significantly
in achieving greater transparency and mutual
understanding among the Armed Forces of Chile,
Argentina and Peru.

As part of the Memorandum of Understanding
for Closer Cooperation in Security Matters of
Mutual Interest, signed between Chile and Argentina in 1995, experts from both countries began in 1997 to draft a “Glossary of common terms
for combined Chile-Argentina exercises,” which
should be approved by both parties during 2003.

A clear sign of the strengthening of the bonds of
friendship between the armies of Chile and Argentina, a combined support exercise called
“Araucaria,” to deal with catastrophe and natural
disaster situations in border zones took place in
2002. Cooperation in Antarctic issues has also
seen substantive progress. Examples of this are
the agreement of the Antarctic Departments of
both armies to carry out surveillance and route
demarcation tasks that will facilitate safe and
clear traffic between the O’Higgins (Chile) and
Esperanza (Argentina) bases; to organize, beginning in 2003, a permanent combined land patrol
for search and rescue; to undertake a permanent
system of cooperation and exchange on logistical
issues such as health support between both
bases, meteorological information and environmental procedures. In addition to these activities
there is the decision to make a combined ascent
of Mount Vinson in 2003, the highest point on
the Antarctic continent.

The two countries have undertaken several combined naval operations in the “Integración” and
“Viekaren” exercises (for Naval Control of Maritime Traffic and Maritime Search, Rescue and
Salvage). The latter effort is limited to the southernmost zone and is part of the Peace and
Friendship Treaty of 1984. Air-sea units and support sea units normally assigned to these areas
also participated in the exercises. Another prominent effort is the Combined Naval Antarctic Patrol, which takes place every year to provide support to the units normally operating in the area
in the event of possible rescues and salvages, as
well as to control and combat pollution caused
by possible disasters.

The Air Force has carried out the SAR “Andes”
search and rescue exercises, with air resources
from both countries in different locations of the
territory. Relations between the Chilean Air
Force and its Argentine counterpart have included crew exchanges in several different fields and


-----

carrying out different activities in the air-medical field. In the field of maintenance, the
Chilean Air Force has inspected the engines of
the “Tucano” aircraft of the Argentine Air Force.
An important feature of these institutional relations is the participation of air combat units of
both countries in the “Cruzex” exercise, held in
Brazil in May 2002.

The bilateral conferences between the Chiefs of
the General Staffs and the services, as well, have
significantly increased the exchange on the professional level, between both armed forces. Some
of worthy of mention are participation in staff
courses, exchange of instructors in the Training
Centers for Peace Operations, incorporation of
Chilean officers into the Argentine Battalion deployed in Cyprus, participation in the “Cabañas”
peace operation exercises, technical courses in
high technology and scientific and technical cooperation in the field of military industry.

Additionally, as a result of the cooperation agreement on matters related to catastrophes, a cabinet exercise took place in 2001, with the objective of strengthening and perfecting the bilateral
cooperation relations for responding to crises
caused by natural disasters.

This exercise will be carried out for the first time
on land in 2003, in the general area of Puerto Natales and Río Turbio, in the southern part of both
countries, with the participation of civilian authorities and military units of both nations.

This ongoing exchange and the visits between
units and staff of the different military and air
garrisons and navy districts, have led to a better
mutual understanding and prevented situations
which could result in errors and misunderstandings or crises.

Chile has undertaken mutual confidence measures with Peru and since 1999, they have become even more dynamic. Within the framework of the Round of Conversations between the
General Staffs and Senior Military Leadership of
the Armed Forces of Chile and Peru, the two
countries have adopted several agreements for
the exchange of staff, academic activities and
training and support of Antarctic activities.

Some of the more important military exercises
have been the “Reskatamuy” exercises, in which
naval units participate in maritime search and
rescue operations in northern Chile and southern Peru, the combined oceanographic voyages


to study of the El Niño weather pattern and the
“Passex” exercises involving units from both
navies during the passage of Chilean ships past
the coasts of Peru. In 2002 the multinational
“Unitas Pacífico” exercise took place along the
Chilean coast with the participation of naval
units from Peru, the United States, Colombia,
Ecuador, Mexico and Panama.

Since 1999 the respective air forces have been
carrying out search and rescue exercises along
border zones.

###### 3. INSTRUMENTS OF COOPERATION AND UNDERSTANDING

As part of the general guidelines for Chile’s Foreign Policy, the Defense sector has been promoting a series of instruments to foster cooperation
and understanding with the different countries
of the world.

**3.1. Cooperation Mechanisms**

**_a) With Argentina_**
Since 1995, the Republics of Chile and Argentina have been carrying out a series of activities as part of the promotion of mutual
confidence measures, a framework within
which political and military relations have
obtained qualitative benefits for both countries. (See Box 9).

**_b) With Peru_**
Both countries have been collaborating in
the promotion of mutual confidence measures since 1986; however, the establishment
of cooperation mechanisms has witnessed a
growing impetus in recent years. Within this
process new areas of agreement, reflection
and analysis have been found that forecast
increasing agreement in matters related to
security and defense. (See Box 10).

**_c) With Brazil_**
Bilateral relations have grown since 2000, in
response to the challenge of strengthening
historically close bilateral relations. As with
Argentina and Peru, the establishment of cooperation mechanisms in the sphere of security and defense attempts to reinforce common views, reflections and analyses, so as to
build a shared approach to these matters.
(See Box 11).

**BOX 9**

###### CHILE-ARGENTINA: INSTITUTIONS FOR COOPERATION IN DEFENSE AND SECURITY ISSUES
**Consultation and coordination mechanism between the General Staffs of the Armed Forces.**
Established in 1994, within the framework of the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1984, this institution has
performed an important role in the establishment of measures for the promotion of mutual confidence
between both countries.

**Permanent Committee on Security (COMPERSEG)**
The Chile-Argentine Permanent Committee on Security was established on May 7, 1996, in Buenos Aires,
and is comprised of high-level and senior officials of the Ministries of Foreign Relations and of Defense of
Chile and Argentina. It was created through the Memorandum of Understanding for Strengthening
Cooperation in Security Issues of Mutual Interest, signed on November 8, 1995, and it has an executive function with regard to decisions adopted by the Presidents and Ministries of Foreign Relations and of Defense
of Chile and Argentina.

Between 1996 and December 2002 twelve meetings were held, which have achieved very high levels of
cooperation in different spheres of Defense.

The COMPERSEG has also been a good opportunity for carrying out joint academic activities in subjects that
include analysis of security in the region.

**2+2 Meetings**
They are called 2+2 Meetings because they involve the Ministers of Foreign Relations and of Defense of both
countries. They were established in 1997, in response to the will to consolidate the progress in bilateral relations in the fields of security and Defense.

By 2002 this institution had met four times: twice in Chile (Zapallar, 1997 and 1999) and twice in Argentina
(Campo de Mayo, in 1998, and Buenos Aires, in 2001).

These meetings have led to agreements concerning combined exercises between the Chilean and Argentine
military forces and the establishment of systems for cooperation in the Antarctic; a deeper joint analysis of
measures for implementing the Political Declaration of MERCOSUR, Bolivia and Chile as a Peace Zone; discussions on the strategic situation of the region and progress on issues within the disarmament agenda.

**BOX 10**

###### CHILE-PERU: INSTITUTIONS FOR COOPERATION IN DEFENSE AND SECURITY ISSUES
**2+2 Meetings**
The First Meeting of the Permanent Committee on Consultations and Political Coordination, comprised by
the Ministers of Foreign Relations and Defense of both countries was held in Lima on September 9, 2001.
This Committee began the process of standardizing the respective systems of calculating Defense spending.
They also led to agreements to eradicate anti-personnel mines, thus complying with the Ottawa Convention
commitments; to carry out combined naval operations and to exchange military and teaching staff between
institutes and academic development centers of the Armed Forces.

**Committee for Security and Defense (COSEDE)**
This committee is comprised of officials from the Ministries of Foreign Relations and of Defense of both
countries, as well as members of the Armed Forces.

It has met on twice: in Chile (Santiago, October 25, 2001), when it approved the “Memorandum of
Understanding between the Republic of Chile and the Republic of Peru for Strengthening Cooperation in
Security and Defense Issues of Mutual Interest,” and in Peru (Lima, March 26, 2002), when it agreed to establish a working group to begin preparing a common methodology for measuring Defense spending.

The COSEDE provides a new framework for the meetings of the General Staffs‘ Senior Leadership of the Armed
Forces of both countries,with a view to reinforcing cooperation and bilateral transparency within the military sphere.


-----

**3.2. Cooperation Agreements**

In conjunction with Defense cooperation mechanisms, Chile has signed a series of complementary agreements that strengthen relations within
the sphere of Defense with countries in all regions of the world. These agreements, since 1997
are detailed in the adjoining figure. (See Figure 6).

###### 4. POLICY ON HUMANITARIAN DEMINING

One of the areas of the Chilean Foreign Policy related to issues of international security, and
which evidences the support of the Defense Policy, is the promotion and implementation of International Humanitarian Law and its effective application. To achieve this goal, Chile has supported international efforts to eliminate conventional
weapons that could be considered as excessively
injurious or having indiscriminate effects.

Chile also adheres to the international principles
that hold that parties in an armed conflict do not
have a right to an unlimited choice of means or
methods of combat; the banning of the use of
weapons, projectiles, materials and means of
combat that inflict superfluous or unnecessary
suffering; and that a distinction should be made
between the civilian population and military
forces.

Chile adhered to the Ottawa Convention in 1997
by virtue of these international principles, the
evolution of the country’s foreign relations and
its national defense needs. The fact that anti-personnel mines are weapons that do not discriminate between the civilian population and military forces has been of particular importance.

**4.1. Humanitarian Demining under the Ottawa**
**Convention**

As established in the Ottawa Convention, humanitarian demining broadly includes:
**_a) The destruction of stockpiled anti-person-_**
nel mines (mines in storage), and the removal and destruction of mines disseminated in mined fields. It also involves including
provisions that regulate the prohibition of
the use, stockpiling, production and transfer
of anti-personnel mines into a country’s national legislation.

**b) Humanitarian demining also includes com-**
pliance with the rules and procedures concerning humanitarian assistance to victims of

**CHILE-BRAZIL: INSTITUTIONS FOR COOPERATION**
**IN DEFENSE AND SECURITY ISSUES**
**Bilateral Working Group on Defense (GTDB)**
The Working Group was established through the
agreement of the Defense Ministers of Chile and
Brazil when they met in Brasilia on July 13, 2000.
To date, two meetings of this Group have been
held: the first in Santiago, on December 14, 2000;
the second in Brasilia, on November 13, 2001.

This group has turned into a mechanism for
political consultations intended to develop bilateral relations in the field of Defense, scientific
and technological cooperation and institutional
cooperation between the Armed Forces of both
countries.

These ministerial meetings have served the purpose of complementing bilateral relations
between Chile and Brazil especially on the subjects of organization of ministerial structures and
promotion of the exchange of officers attending
academies of advanced studies in both countries.
This instrument has also been useful in disseminating the ECLAC study on “Standardized
Methodology for the Measurement of Defense
Spending” approved by Chile and Argentina.

This working group also decided to hold meetings between the Defense General Staffs of Brazil
and Chile.

**4.2. Humanitarian Demining and Human**
**Security Policy**

Humanitarian demining is one of the areas of interest to the Human Security network, of which
Chile is a member. This implies that the Chilean
State, without neglecting its essential commitment to safeguard the security of the State, also,
as a complement, approaches security issues
from the perspective of the human individual
and his or her rights. (See Box 12).

**4.3. Implementation of the Ottawa Convention**

Two prominent aspects of Chile’s process of complying with the commitments made through the
Convention are: the establishment of the National Demining Commission (CNAD) and the submission of the Report on Transparency Measures.

## 4. The Defense Sector and National Policies

###### As an integral part of Defense, the

 Armed Forces help in the performance

 of activities carried out within the ter
 ritory –such as support for initiatives

 related to border and isolated zones–

 and cooperate with national industry

 and with national cultural, scientific

 and technological progress, a task they

 have performed since the birth of our

 nation as a republic.


###### 1. TERRITORIAL POLICIES

The concept of sovereignty assumes the existence of a territory circumscribed by physical or
geospatial boundaries and the ability to hold it
under the exclusive jurisdiction of the State. This
idea of exclusivity allows the government to direct its administrative management in accordance with its policies and objectives, with the
defense sector playing an important role in policies aimed at the development of those zones of
the territory that require special State support
due to their characteristics and location.

**1.1. Development Policies in Border Zones**

From a Defense perspective, border zones are of
particular significance because of the convergence of historical aspects with the fact that they
are a tangible reference for estimating potential
risks and threats. This is why integrating
processes, which are normally initiated in connection with specific, operational objectives, can
become a closer economic and even political re

volved in the integration process accept their respective national identities and mutually recognize the territory over which they each exercise
sovereignty.

Chile has defined its border zones taking into account the special characteristics of its territory
along international borders and areas where international treaties of permanent effect are applied. Its border zones are governed by specific
legislation that calls for effective coordination
between the National Office of State Borders and
Boundaries, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
the Ministry of National Defense. This sphere
has special mechanisms for decision-making,
which guide the State in issues of government
owned land, water resources, natural resources,
scientific and mountain climbing expeditions in
the Andes, and with respect to enforcing legal
provisions at the remote ends of the country.

This concern is reflected in the importance attributed to the initiatives for physical integration
with neighboring countries, with a direct impact


-----

It must be stressed that the initiatives, which
each State desires to promote in its border zones,
can be of a unilateral, bilateral or multilateral nature. Chile has adopted initiatives of a unilateral
nature, which are State decisions with the objective of promoting the development of an area of
the national territory without the participation of
another State.

Complementarily, Chile has taken part in conjunction with Argentina in the promotion of joint
initiatives to promote the development of some
parts of the long border they share. The solution
to the boundary disputes that were still outstanding between the two countries during the
last decade of the 20th century not only helped
raise these bilateral relations to what perhaps
can be defined as its best historical level but also
helped promote joint initiatives of great relevance for both countries.

There are also initiatives of a multilateral nature,
the most striking example of which may be that
of the European Union.

The experience of the European Economic Com
**FIGURE 7**


munity, which preceded the current European
Union, shows that acceptance of national identities, including holding sovereignty over a defined and recognized territory, with respect to
which no claims are encouraged and consequently the overcoming of territorial and boundary litigations, are essential if a progressively
closer integration is desired.

**_a) Unilateral Initiative: Southern Maritime_**
**_Tourism Routes_**
As part of government policy following a
global analysis in which the Chilean Navy
participated, it was decided to open three
new navigation routes in the Beagle Channel-Cape Horn area. The purpose was to promote tourism in the surrounding areas, with
subsequent benefits for the inhabitants of
Region XII.

The opening of these routes created the need
for upgraded and updated cartographic maps
of the area, as well as the corresponding
state-of-the-art navigation aids needed to effectively protect human life at sea and to
navigate safely through the channels and
fiords of this region. (See Figure 7).


-----

**_b) Bilateral Initiative: Mining Treaty be-_**
**_tween Chile and Argentina_**
This Treaty opens the border to mining projects originating in the neighboring country
and hopes to encourage coordinated international work in promoting mining activities,
the use of copper and defense against trade
protectionism. This instrument is consistent
with the broadening of border demarcation
agreements and the expansion of physical
integration agreements. These include the
opening and closing of border passages and
the scheduling of investments to establish a
connection infrastructure across selected
passages.

The Treaty determines the scope of applicability through coordinated demarcation. This
area does not extend to the entire national
territory and does not include maritime
spaces, island territories or the coastal border, as they are defined by each country. The
border line shall be preserved and when the
nature of the works so require, the Ministers
of Foreign Affairs, through the Joint Border
Commission, have the authority to decide
any question or request made by the parties
with respect to the precise determination of
that border line, for the effects of application
of the Treaty.

The scope of application does not imply a
repeal of the Chile’s mining legislation or the
creation of an extra-territorial area, or that
the Management Commission would have
supranational status. Neither is it part of the
concept established in Chile’s Constitution
concerning zones declared by law of importance to national security (Art. 19, N° 24,
Sec. 10). This scope is an essential reference
point for the jurisdiction of the Treaty Management Commission and deals with the
possibility of using this space for an operations area and facilities connected to concessions and plants located in the other country’s territory.

Another issue of interest relates to the establishment of water rights and the possibility
of guaranteeing that a mining project has access to this natural resource within the territory of the other party under the Treaty. The
use of water resources located in the territories of the parties could be permitted in compliance with each country’s applicable internal legislation, even when they are not
shared water resources. This is an innovative


facilitation and to the cross-border movement of goods, particularly from the point of
view of constituting rights over water located
in another State.

The Treaty includes a wide range of mechanisms and instruments for resolving disputes
between the parties in accordance with the
matter or object under dispute. (See Box 14).

**1.2. Development Policies in Isolated Zones**

The low population density that characterizes
some regions of Chile constitutes a significant
vulnerability factor. This should be added to the
fact that different conditions existing in these
zones have imposed a relatively slower development than experienced by other areas of the
country, even though the zones have considerable economic potential based on their abundance of natural resources.

In contrast to Chile’s projected population
growth, which is rather moderate, forecasts of its
economic growth are significant. As a consequence of the combination of both factors, Chile
has become an attractive destination for both foreign investment and, eventually, for the population of less developed or overpopulated countries lacking physical space. A significant portion
of these potential flows of investment and migration can be largely channeled towards those

**BOX 14**

###### MINING INTEGRATION AND COMPLEMENTARITY TREATY BETWEEN CHILE AND ARGENTINA
This Treaty originated in the Agreement signed
by the Presidents of Chile and Argentina on
December 29, 1997, as well as in the Protocol and
Complementary Agreement signed on August 20
and 31, 1999, respectively. On August 29, 2000,
the Chilean Senate approved the Mining
Integration and Complementary Treaty between
the two countries and on December 20 of the
same year both Presidents signed the ratification
documents.

The Mining Treaty provides for a Management
Commission (Art. 18) which is defined as a nonsupranational body, to administer it. The
Commission is comprised of representatives of
the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Mining of
Chile and Argentina (Art. 18 MT), and can summon the pertinent representatives of public
agencies when it deems it advisable.


-----

remote areas, a challenge that is also shared by
the National Defense.

The Chilean State has strived to implement
measures that will benefit those remote areas, so
as to promote their development, increase their
population and fully integrate them into the rest
of the country. The first of these goals has taken
the form of development plans for the northern
and southern ends of the country and the promotion of initiatives to channel domestic migration towards those areas.

The presence of Armed Forces units in these remote areas located far from the vital centers of
the country, have attracted settlers and given
birth to communities. The history of our country
is marked by situations in which population centers emerge after a military presence has been established or a military presence has enabled the
maintenance and development of a social group.

Ever since 1953 the Chilean Army has been establishing a presence throughout the length of
our national territory and has cooperated in the
development and flexibility of our land route
system. To date, these works have enabled the
Chilean State to build more than 3,500 kilometers of roads, 6,000 linear meters of runways and
air fields and 3,000 linear meters of bridges, thus
promoting territorial integration and generating
centers of development which, along with the
improvement of the socioeconomic conditions of
their inhabitants, have improved the presence
and action of the State. At present, the Army
through its Military Work Corps (CMT), and in
close contact with the Road Construction Office
of the Ministry of Public Works, is focusing its attention on consolidating the axes of action defined by the Andean Route, the Main Coastal
Highway and the Longitudinal Southern Highway and their secondary roads, with emphasis in
Regions I, II, IX, X, XI and XII.

Also working towards territorial consolidation,
the Navy has promoted the development of the
city of Puerto Williams, which since its foundation in 1953, has provided ongoing support to the
isolated areas of the Tierra del Fuego archipelago
at the southernmost tip of Chile, to island territories and to the territory of the Antarctic Chilean
peninsula, as well as assisting and giving security
to navigators by maintaining lighthouse keepers
who live in desolate areas and barren islets.

The Air Force, in turn, connects the continental,
island and Antarctic territories by air and helps


in places where other means of access are difficult or cut off. It has also installed air bases in territories that are not accessible through other
means, so as to reaffirm and consolidate national
sovereignty, as in the case of Campo de Hielo Sur.

**1.3. Policies Related to Maritime Interests**

Maritime interests correspond to national development activities that generate benefits of a political, strategic, economic, scientific and social
order for the country as a whole. They are related to the exploitation, enjoyment and use of the
resources or benefits provided by the sea, the
seabed and the subsoil, which are under the maritime jurisdiction of the State. They take place on
the high seas, and in the coastal zone and interior waters.

In order to obtain the maximum benefit from
this oceanic potential, the Chilean State has taken measures to legislate and develop sea activities and has fostered an awareness of maritime
issues within the country.

Within this field, the work of the Chilean Navy is
directed towards achieving conditions that will
ensure national sovereignty at sea and achieve
the environment of peace necessary for growth
and development. Additionally, it will provide
our people with a maritime perspective that will
give Chile a leading role in the development of
the Pacific Basin and help them to value the sea
as a real source of growth and development for
our country. Lastly, it seeks to create a national
awareness of the sea’s importance to our economic development, which is largely dependent
on foreign trade, more than 90% of which is carried by sea.

Chile’s maritime interests include some specific
objectives, which the Navy, with its distinctive
skills, helps meet. For example:

**_a) To facilitate a more efficient use of the_**
natural resources of the national oceanic territory.

**_b) To develop scientific research and tech-_**
nologies related to all the activities that support and sustain the use, exploitation, preservation and management of the natural resources of the national oceanic territory.

**_c) To improve the legal framework and to rein-_**
force the administrative agencies in charge of
this territory and maritime activities in com

-----

**_d)_** To protect and preserve the sea environment within the national oceanic territory
and to prevent the sea activities of other
States from affecting Chilean interests or the
quality of life of its inhabitants.

**_e) To provide effective security for the na-_**
tional oceanic territory, maritime interests
and sea routes that are of vital importance to
the country in the event of possible threats,
unlawful actions or aggression that may
harm the State’s jurisdiction and sovereignty, and to take proper precautions to neutralize them.

**_f)_** To promote and develop the shipbuilding
industry in Chile, utilizing the installed capacity of both private and State dockyards,
with the active participation of ASMAR
(Navy shipyards and repair shops).

The projection of the country towards the Asian
Pacific through its maritime routes is one of the
country’s maritime interests. Easter Island,
Chile’s nearest territory to the nations situated
on the eastern rim of the Pacific basin plays an
essential role in the achievement of that objective.

Easter Island is the westernmost of the oceanic
islands within Chilean territory. It is located at
latitude 27º 07’ South and longitude 109º 11’
West, 3,700 km offshore from the port of Caldera.
It covers an area of 165 km[2] and has an approximate perimeter of 61 km. It was incorporated to
Chilean sovereignty on September 9, 1888 by
Policarpo Toro Hurtado, a Lieutenant Commander of the Chilean Navy, who took possession of
it in the name of the Chilean Government on
that date. Statutory Decree 575, of 1974, established the Chilean Province of Easter Island, under the authority of Region V. Its capital city is
Hanga Roa and it has a population of 3,837 inhabitants. The presence of the Chilean sea authority in that area of the Pacific is exercised
through the Port Authorities.

Apart from its archeological and tourist attractions, Easter Island is Chile’s door to the Pacific,
constituting an essential support point for the
sea and air routes that travel across the southwest quadrant of the Pacific.

**1.4. Antarctic Policy**

The Chilean Antarctic Territory is an important
element in the definition of Antarctic policy.


on that frozen continent in 1940, through Executive Decree 1747.

This decree establishes that the Chilean Antarctic or Chilean Antarctic Territory comprises all
lands, isles, islets, reefs, glaciers, and others
known or unknown, in the respective territorial
sea within the limits of the segment between the
meridians of 53° and 90° longitude to the west of
Greenwich.

Chilean Antarctic rights are founded on historical,
geographical and legal bases. Under these bases
Chile attended negotiations on the Antarctic
Treaty of 1959, in conjunction with 11 other
states.

With relation to territorial sovereignty rights, Article IV of this Treaty establishes that none of its
provisions can be interpreted as detrimental to
the bases of territorial sovereignty rights or as
their relinquishment on the basis of previously
made claims. In this respect the Treaty protects
the legal status of the Chilean Antarctic Territory
and guarantees the position of parties with respect to relevant issues regarding sovereignty
over that continent.

As the Antarctic Treaty acknowledges in its Article IV, Chile maintains its irrevocable right of territorial sovereignty in the Antarctic.

It is worth noting that two other countries have
filed territorial sovereignty claims in portions of
the same geographical area where Chile claims
sovereignty rights. However, Chile and Argentina (one of the two other countries) have mutually recognized their Antarctic rights, without demarcating their respective territories, before subscribing the Antarctic Treaty.

As a founding member of this instrument, Chile
participates with voting rights, in decision-making processes related to the Antarctic and is willing to consider international control and cooperation programs, to the extent that they do not affect its sovereignty rights. Chile aims to project
its national interests in that region of the world,
without ignoring environmental issues and
strictly observing the different conventions on
the Antarctic System, which have been subscribed.

Additionally, on October 4, 1991, it subscribed
the Additional Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on
the Protection of the Environment (Protocol of
Madrid), with the objective of further protecting

In this territory the Chilean State has established
and operates the harbor master’s offices of Bahía
Fildes, Bahía Covadonga, Puerto Soberanía and
Puerto Paraíso, all agencies that provide support
to human safety at sea and perform tasks related
to safeguarding the local marine environment.

Of these, Soberanía and Covadonga are active
year-round, since they have been operated by
staff from the Prat Naval Base since 1947, and
from the O’Higgins army base since 1948, and
their complete rehabilitation is included in institutional plans.

**1.5. Space Policy**

Since 1959, the year our country signed an agreement with the United States of America for the
installation of a satellite tracking station at Peldehue, Chile’s space technology has been a tool
used by different organizations, universities, research centers, and enterprises. However, Chile
is only a user country of this technology and
therefore depends on other states to obtain information, services and satellite images. Therefore
Chile has a peremptory need to participate with

system elements.

###### 2. DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION POLICIES

The Defense Policy includes a series of elements
to enable its institutions to devote part of their
efforts to national development, utilizing their
individual and collective skills.

**2.1. Environmental Policy**

The general objective of the Chilean State Environmental Policy is to promote the sustainability
of the environment within the development
process and its final objective is to improve the
quality of life of Chilean citizens and of future
generations.

Each State sector must develop an environmental policy to be applied in its own sphere, within
the framework established by the national policy. To this effect, the Ministry of National Defense has prepared a sector policy called the Defense Environment Policy, which will serve as a
general guideline to the specific policies of the
different organizations and institutions under
the Ministry of National Defense. The legal
framework in which the National Defense Institutions operate in this field are Law 19.300, “Constitutional Organic Law on the General Foundations of the Environment” and the declarations
and international agreements and treaties to
which the Chilean State is a party.

In order to organize the activities of the Ministry
within this sphere, the National Defense Environment Committee, under the Chief of the National Defense General Staff, was established on
January 30, 2001. In April 2001 an Agreement on
Environmental Cooperation was signed between
the National Commission for the Environment
(CONAMA) and the Ministry of National Defense. Its objectives are to establish a working,
collaborative relationship between the two institutions; to ensure that the Defense Policy is an
environmentally clean policy, and to identify environmental issues that the Armed Forces and
the Forces of Order and Security are to address
and to take actions that will result in the effective resolution of these environment problems.

Environmental activities carried out by the Na

-----

two large categories. The first category deals
with the environmental sustainability of the normal activities of the Defense sector organizations. These organizations have been gradually
incorporating procedures that will minimize the
environmental effects of their normal activities.
The second category is participation by the National Defense institutions in the State’s National
System of Environment Management (SNGAE).

The national environmental system currently in
force assigns specific obligations and responsibilities to some specific institutions of National Defense, with respect to the control, prevention
and care of the environment in Chile or in areas
where the State has made international commitments to use its resources for preservation of the
environment.

Some of the most significant activities carried
out by the armed institutions are the Army’s efforts to achieve clean production in its industrial
and chemical complex located in the Metropolitan Region and the education and training of
staff at the Army’s Military Polytechnic Academy
in subjects related to environmental management. Environmental concerns are now one of
the variables that must be taken into account in
the planning or performance of all the Army’s
field activities. Project are also being undertaken
to optimize the handling of contaminating
wastes in environmentally sensitive areas such
as along the coast, agricultural, tourist or archeological zones, and neighboring natural reserves.

For its part, the Navy has undertaken an especially intensive environmental work due to national and international legislation that assigns it
specific functions in environmental matters.

In order to carry them out, the Service for the
Preservation of the Water Environment and Combating Pollution was created in 1993. Its efforts
are directed towards safeguarding the quality of
the water environment in the sea, rivers and
lakes of the country, minimizing risk situations
through the prevention, control and combat of
pollution and spillage of any harmful substances.

In order to meet this objective, the Service has a
National Plan for the Research, Oversight and
Control of Water Pollution. It also carries out its
activities in different work areas, particularly in
those that derive from the Permanent Commission of the South Pacific (PCSP), the National Advisory Committee on Global Change, the application of the Protocol on Environmental Protec

the National Oceanographic Committee (CONA),
and the International Maritime Organization.

The Navy plays a particularly important role in
stimulating the development of the system of environmental institutions dealing with the water
environment, and through its efforts to achieve
the full environmental sustainability of its facilities and to ensure that all Navy ships meet the
requirements established in current international regulations (MARPOL).

Lastly, the Air Force has incorporated environmental criteria and procedures aimed at protecting the environment, in particular from sound
pollution. One particularly important task is that
performed by the Office of Meteorology of the
Chilean Air Force, which provides information
about different environmental variables, thus
contributing to the environmental management
of the country and, in particular, to prompt reaction to environmental emergency situations. Additionally, this agency is responsible for the administering the Global Warning monitoring stations in Chile (in the southern city of Valdivia
and Easter Island).

**2.2. Military Industry**

The Defense Industry and the military industry
in particular, contributes to the country’s development by providing innovative technology and
possibilities for the transfer of technology.

Within this sphere, the Army’s contributions are
centralized in the Military Industry and Engineering Command. Factories and Workshops of
the Army (FAMAE), the Chemical and Industrial
Complex and the Research and Control Institute
carry out the most important activities. Military
manufacturing capability, mainly represented by
FAMAE, Although its technological development
permits the manufacture of weapons of different
types and calibers, armored vehicles, rockets and
ammunition, it is also utilized for the manufacture of tools and articles for national production.
Similarly, military chemical production manufactures explosives and supplies used in industry
and in mining enterprises.

The Navy has its shipyards and repair shops,
Shipyards and Workshops of the Navy (ASMAR)
and its related enterprises SISDEF y SOCIBER.
ASMAR is an autonomous State-owned enterprise that has grown into a highly-professional
industrial complex, with the capability of meeting increasing demand for careening mainte

ing to the Chilean Navy and to the National Merchant Marine, as well as for maintenance and repair of navy ships from other countries. It has
three dockyards located in Valparaíso, Talcahuano and Magallanes. To date, ASMAR has
built 95 ships and other sea craft in its dockyards.

The Air Force basically channels its efforts
through the National Aeronautics Enterprise
(ENAER). This enterprise has achieved strategic
business alliances in the national and international spheres for different projects. In the manufacturing field, the “Pillán” basic training aircraft constitutes a distinctive item and is in full
operation in several air forces around the world.
It also manufactures pieces and parts in conjunction with various foreign companies of recognized prestige in the world of aeronautics.
Lastly, ENAER has incorporated state-of-the-art
retrofitting technology for combat aircraft and its
installed capacity allows it to overhaul the Air
Force’s inventory of aircraft, as well as that of
military and civil aircraft from other countries.

**2.3. Science and Technology**

In this field, Defense institutions have made several contributions to the national community. As
part of joint agreements with State, private and
university institutions, they carry out scientific
researches, which have resulted in the pooling of
know-how to the benefit of these institutions as
well as to that of the private development sector.

Using the CEOTAC computer program, the Army
has developed an Institution and Organization
Management Training Program (SEGIO). The SEGIO includes training for different civilian and
military institutions, including the “Catastrophe
Training System”, directed towards State public administrators and the “Disaster Training System”,
with the objective of boosting the preparedness of
authorities responsible for decision-making in cases of crises at the political-strategic level.

Naval architecture is one of most significant contributions of the Navy through her dockyards,
shipyards and workshops, in addition to the development of weapons control and command
and control systems as well as propulsion systems for its combat units. In the field of scientific research, the Navy also contributes, through
the Navy Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service (SHOA), to the dissemination of the national oceanographic plan that meets research requirements coordinates efforts undertaken by
different organizations, universities and research


The Air Force itself is continually incorporating
new technology into its activities. The development of ENAER has allowed the incorporation of
technologies that go beyond aeronautics, reaching an advanced development of technology,
which has been recognized worldwide. This is
the case of Bureau Veritas prepared for ISO 9002,
the MIL-9858 A military specifications and those
for the United States Federal Aviation Agency
(FAA). Furthermore, the special activities undertaken by the Air Force has permitted the incorporation of satellite technology to operate a satellite station within the country.

With regard to geographical information technologies, the Defense sector has the basic territorial information required by the country. This
activity is implemented through the preparation
of land, sea and air cartography carried out by
the Military Geographic Institute (IGM), the
Navy Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service
(SHOA) and the Aerial Photogrammetry Service
of the Air Force (SAF).

The IGM prepares the official cartography of the
country, in the different forms and scales used
for mining, public works, urbanization, education, health and statistics activities, and, in general, to support development decision-making of
administrative authorities.

The SHOA has implemented the hydrographic
mapping of the Chilean coast. This task was initiated in 1843 at mouth of the Río Bueno and its
scope was later increased with constantly improving technologies, until the current electronic mapping of the entire national coast, including its
fiords, channels, bays and ports as well as their accesses. These places are thus open to the safe traffic of freighters both for domestic and foreign trade
and their passage is facilitated through the implementation of a complete system of lighthouses
and buoys that are essential for navigating through
the channels and allowing vessels to avoid the rigors of the southernmost ocean waters.

Lastly, through the use of different aerial photography techniques, the SAF provides an important service to the planning and development of
road infrastructure, survey of native forests, determination of zones suitable for habitation and
production of different agricultural products,
mine prospecting, environmental assessments
and other similar matters.

## PART IV
 The Conduct and Organization of the National Defense


###### The fact that Defense is a regulatory activity determines the way in which it is implemented. Since it is essentially a matter of national concern, the President of the Republic is responsible for its man- agement and conduction, with the assis- tance of different advisory and coordinat- ing services. These include all the institu- tional agencies of the Republic involved in the decisions to assure the country’s external security.

 The importance of the decisions made at the higher levels of the Defense structure, as well as in the defense sector itself, for the country’s development during peace- time as well as in wartime or any other type of armed conflict, requires compre- hensive advisory services to the Head of State. These take the form of political col- laboration from State agencies, institu- tions or political authorities and the mili

###### tary collaboration of the Armed Forces. According to the Political Constitution, the Minister of National Defense should work right alongside the President of the Republic in governing and administrat- ing the defense sector. It is the Minister’s job to head the Defense Ministry, com- prised of advisory and work bodies, pub- lic services, and subordinate organiza- tions, as well as the Armed Forces and Police and Security institutions.

 The Minister of Defense is responsible for submitting the National Defense Policy for the consideration of the President of the Republic. In the event of armed con- flict, the law provides that the State be organized into Fields of Action and makes the Minister of Defense responsi- ble for coordinating the different min- istries compliance with the measures adopted by the President of the Republic.


-----

## 1. Conducting the National Defense

###### Given the nature and impact of deci
 sions involved in National Defense, its

 conduction requires a specific system

 and order. The President of the

 Republic bears the main responsibility

 for these matters. This chapter summa
 rizes important aspects of the conduct

 and organization of the Defense sector.


###### 1. CONDUCTING THE NATIONAL DEFENSE

The Conduct of the Defense is a process used to
make the decisions required to guide and direct
the country’s defense. Based on a specific organizational structure, this process flows through a
regulated and systematized channel starting
from the highest level of the State (the office of
the Executive), where decisions are made, to the
strategic or military level. Conduct occurs when
command is exercised. The President of the Republic directs the Commanders in Chief of the
Armed Forces through the Minister of National
Defense, who acts as the regular channel for this
purpose, though his duties differ in peace and
war.

The rules governing the conduct of the defense
in Chile are based on different instruments that
vary in their legal rank and the different contexts
of the times in which they were enacted. The
conceptual evolution of the field of Defense has
attempted to better reflect the practical exercise
of the modern State in this matter, and has given


place, for example, to a typology that distinguishes between the political and strategic level
and the military strategic level. However, the
rules governing the conduct of the Defense have
not followed a similar evolution of the concept.
Nonetheless, this section attempts to provide a
systematic presentation of the ideological principles and current legislation and of the modern
approach to conducting military operations at
different levels in academic and institutional defense spheres, both in Chile and abroad.

###### 2. SUPERIOR INSTITUTIONS OF DEFENSE

Under Chile’s system of presidential government, the highest Defense institution is subordinate to the President of the Republic. Other bodies that perform varied duties according to the
laws of our country are the National Congress,
the National Security Council, and the Superior
Council of National Security. As a whole, these
State institutions and agencies that act at the
highest level of conducting the defense consti

-----

**FIGURE 9**

tute what is known as the superior structure of
the Defense. (See Figure 9)

**2.1. President of the Republic**

Article 24 of the Political Constitution of Chile
refers to the President of the Republic as the one
responsible for governing and administrating the
State, and extends the President’s authority to
everything related to the maintenance of public
order and external security of the Republic.

In terms of the defense duties (i.e., the duties regarding the country’s external security), the President of the Republic has the following authority:

!To dispose, organize, and distribute the
land, sea, and air forces.
!To assume the position of Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces in the event of
war.
!To declare war, with prior authorization of
the legislature, placing on record that the
opinion of the National Security Council was
considered.
!To declare, together with the other bodies
of the State, the constitutional states of emergency and siege.[25]

These duties comprise the main exclusive decision-making authority of the President of the Republic in the area of Defense.


**2.2. Minister of National Defense**

The Minister of National Defense is the direct
and immediate collaborator of the President of
the Republic for governing and administrating
the area of defense. The Minister governs the
Defense Ministry in accordance with the policies
and directions given by the President.

The Minister’s general task is to plan and direct
the activities of the Ministry, and to provide direct and immediate advice to the President about
national defense conduct, during peace and war.

As shown below, the Minister of National Defense performs his duties with the advice of the
Board of the Commanders in Chief of the Services (JCCJ), which act as the Minister’s main
advisory body in these issues. It also has the
support and advice of the National Defense General Staff (EMDN), an agency of the Ministry of
Defense, and of ad hoc organizations that deal
with specific matters: the General Advocate
Committee, the Personnel Directors Committee,
and the Health Directors Committee. Other
agencies, some under one of the Undersecretary
Offices or the National Defense General Staff,
are the Office of National Mobilization (DGMN),
the National Academy of Political and Strategic
Studies (ANEPE), the Superior Council of National Defense (CONSUDENA), and others.

**2.3. National Congress**

The National Congress is comprised of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Each legislative chamber has a Committee on Defense,
which is responsible for analyzing and reporting


###### ✪

**25 Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile, Article 32, Nos. 7,**
19, 20, and 21.


-----

to its chamber’s plenary all bills related to national defense in general and to the Armed
Forces in particular.

In addition to analyzing and approving the defense sector budget, which includes the financial
resources for defense, the Congress meets with
the Executive Branch to approve laws to authorize or reject the entry of foreign troops into the
national territory, as well as the posting of national troops abroad.

The Congress also has the authority to approve
or reject the State of Siege, proposed by the Executive

**2.4. National Security Council (COSENA)**

Created in 1980 by Chile’s Political Constitution,
its mission is to advise the President of the Republic on national security issues as requested
by the President. It is empowered to provide the
President, the Congress or the Constitutional
Court with its opinion on any event, action or
subject that it believes to be a serious threat to
the foundations of the nation’s institutional system or which may compromise its national defense. Among its other powers, the Council may
also gather, from the authorities and officers of
the State administration, any information related
to the country’s external and internal security.

The Council is chaired by the President of the
Republic, and is comprised of the following authorities, all of which have the right to vote:

!President of the Senate
!President of the Supreme Court
!Comptroller General of the Republic
!Commander in Chief of the Army
!Commander in Chief of the Navy
!Commander in Chief of the Air Force
!General Director of the Police Force

The following authorities are also part of the
COSENA, but without the right to vote:

!Minister of Internal Affairs
!Minister of Foreign Affairs
!Minister of National Defense
!Minister of Economy
!Minister of Finance

This Council may be convened by the President
of the Republic, or at the request of its members,
and its agreements are adopted by absolute majority of the members with the right to vote.[26] Its


Secretary is the Chief of the National Defense
General Staff.

**2.5. Superior Council of National Security**
**(CONSUSENA)**

Legislative Decree 181, created this agency in
1960, to advise the President on issues related to
the nation’s security and maintaining the country’s territorial integrity.

In addition to its advisory function, the CONSUSENA is responsible for analyzing and proposing measures to coordinate the work of the different ministries in implementing the decisions
and guidelines of the President of the Republic.

In this task, the Superior Council will determine
the national defense needs and enforce all measures established by the President to increase the
country’s economic and defensive potential and
decide how to use the country’s resources in
emergencies. It shall also determine the National
Defense needs and request, from the appropriate
agency, the funds needed to create, develop and
maintain the essential power and operational capabilities of the Armed Forces. It is also responsible for reviewing and approving the national or
primary documents of the national defense.

The Superior Council consists of the President of
the Republic and the following authorities:

!Minister of State
!Minister of Foreign Affairs
!Minister of National Defense
!Minister of Economy
!Minister of Finance
!Commander in Chief of the Army
!Commander in Chief of the Navy
!Commander in Chief of the Air Force
!Director of State Borders and Limits
!Chief of the National Defense General Staff

Its Secretary is the Secretary of the Superior
Council of National Defense (CONSUDENA).

The Superior Council is exclusive an advisory
body; the President of the Republic has the exclusive right to accept or reject the resolutions of the
Council. In this issue, it differs politically from
the National Security Council, that adopts its resolutions by agreement of its voting members.

###### ✪

**26 Political Constitution, Articles 95 and 96.**

###### 3. CONDUCTING AT THE POLITICAL-STRATEGIC LEVEL

Conducting at the political-strategic level refers
to the leadership of the President of the Republic,
with the assistance of the Minister of Defense, in
decision-making and decision taking processes in
issues of international cooperation in which
Chile provides a specific number of military
forces. In addition, in the case of events in which
Chile participates to prevent or manage a conflict
including war, but which involve developing and
employing all or part of the armed forces and
other means of national power in a synchronized
fashion to secure national objectives.

The process that leads to political-strategic decisions by the President of the Republic bring together the political and technical perspectives of
different sectors of the State administration, as
well as the military or strategic perspective.
Based on this, the President decides how to address a situation.

The country’s legislation establishes that the
body where these political, technical and strategic perspectives come together is the Superior
Council of National Security (CONSUSENA).
Within this Council, the Minister of Defense is
responsible for proposing the National Defense
Policy for the approval of the President of the
Republic, both in peace as well as in war. The
Minister is especially responsible for:

!Considering and assessing the manpower
and material needs of the Armed Forces, required to maintain its potential, preparation
and proper training.
!Proposing, according to the corresponding
plans, the missions to be carried out by the
Armed Forces and their priority.
!Proposing to the CONSUSENA, for its consideration and approval, all issues related to
national security in which the National Defense Field must take actions.
!Establishing the necessary contacts with
the other ministries and civilian organizations to make the best use of the state services related to national security.
!Participating in the study of the preliminary plans and implementing the part for
which his office is responsible.

Since the CONSUSENA meets only when convened by the President of the Republic, many duties concerning political and strategic conduct are
routinely performed by the State, particularly by
the National Defense General Staff, including:


!Preparation of the Global Political-Strategic Assessment.
!Conduct of the National Primary Planning
Process
!Order and oversee the strategic (secondary) planning deriving from the national primary planning.

###### 4. CONDUCTING THE ARMED FORCES AT THE STRATEGIC LEVEL

Statutory Decree 181 and its implementing regulations use the concept “strategic conduct of the
Armed Forces” to mean the action by which the
Superior Council of National Defense advises the
President of the Republic and studies and proposes measures for coordinating the work of the
different Ministries to carry out the policy set by
the President.

The President will have at all times –in peace,
war or state of emergency– a direct chain-ofcommand relationship with the corresponding
Commanders in Chief, through the Ministry of
Defense. When war or a state of emergency
make it necessary to establish joint forces in certain areas, the line of command between the
President and the military commanders on the
field in charge of those joint forces will be
through the Minister of Defense and the Chairman of the Board of the Commanders in Chief of
the Services.

In times of war, the President of the Republic assumes as Supreme Commander of the Armed
Forces and the law authorizes him to personally
exercise the strategic conduct of the Armed
Forces or to delegate this responsibility to the
Chairman of the Board of the Commanders in
Chief of the Services.[27]

In addition to the tasks already mentioned, in
which the Minister of Defense must submit proposals for the approval of the President of the Republic, the Minister must also:

!Propose directives and orders for the
strategic conduct of the Armed Forces.
!Approve the strategic (secondary) plans,
implemented through the Board of the Commanders in Chief of the Services.

###### ✪

**27 See Executive Decree 272, of 1985, “Regulations for the consti-**
tution, mission, hierarchy and duties of the Armed Forces”.


-----

To enable the Minister of Defense to best perform the functions assigned to the position, the
law provided it with its own advisory body to
deal with issues involving the three branches of
the armed forces: the Board of the Commanders
in Chief of the Services (JCCJ), which has the
National Defense General Staff (EMDN) as its
permanent working staff. The Board is comprised of the Commanders in Chief of the Army,
Navy and Air Force. In peacetime, the Minister
of Defense chairs the Board. During wartime, the
Board is chaired by a military officer appointed
by the President of the Republic to act in the capacity of Chairman of the Board.

In addition to advising the Minister of Defense,
the Board of the Commanders in Chief of the
Services (JCCJ) also has some specific duties,
such as:

!Reviewing and proposing military policy
and measures related to national defense involving the Armed Forces, and reviewing
and evaluating their needs.
!Proposing solutions to all problems related
to military strategy and its development in
wartime.
!Issuing instructions and provisions for the
strategic conduct of the Armed Forces, deriving from the primary (national) and secondary (strategic) planning.
!Proposing the establishment of joint commands or forces where required by National
Security.

In peacetimes as well as during wartime, each
member of the Board, i.e., each Commander in
Chief, shall be responsible for enforcing the decisions adopted in relation to their respective
service.

###### 5. MILITARY OR JOINT STRATEGIC CONDUCT OF THE ARMED FORCES

This level of conduct includes formulating and
directing activities carried out by the Armed
Forces preparing and executing war and its campaigns. The direction and coordination of the activities of each of the services is crucial in function of the strategic objectives established.

The Board of the Commanders in Chief of the
Services (JCCJ) is in charge of the coordination
of the activities rooted from the military or joint
strategic conduction. For this purpose, in addition to its responsibilities outlined in the previous point, this Board have the following duties:


!To study and approve the plans of the subordinate joint commands.
!To plan the Armed Forces training in all
aspects of joint actions.
!To order the direction and execution of
joint exercises and maneuvers.

In wartime, the Chairman of the Board of the
Commanders in Chief of the Services (JCCJ) is
in charge of the strategic conduct of the Armed
Forces, whenever the President of the Republic
so decides, and, with the approval of the Minister of Defense, will always execute all decisions
related to joint forces.

###### 6. FIELDS OF ACTION

In order to deal with threats or risks to the country’s security, and to the national defense in particular, Chile’s legislation groups all the ministries, institutions and agencies under them into four fields of action: Internal, Diplomatic, Defense, and Economic.

The 1960 legislation that constituted the Superior Council of National Defense and the fields of
action established that the planning of measures
for national defense purposes was to take place
during times of peace, excepting measures that
might be adopted in wartime. In order to facilitate the planning, coordination and execution of
various actions related to conflict prevention,
and more importantly to conflict resolution, the
fields of action have been considered as the
State’s permanent mode to face conflicts, both in
peacetime and in wartime.

However, Chile’s normal routine in times of
peace is organized into ministries and their subordinate institutions and agencies, rather than
into fields of action. There are two reasons for
this arrangement. The first is the nature of the
public functions in times of peace, oriented to
highly specific sectors, with unique needs and
therefore unique requirements. The second is
the fact that the fields of action were formulated
on the basis of their immediate predecessors: the
“fronts” structured, in the 1950 legislation, for national mobilization purposes in the event of
armed conflicts. These “fronts” were: Interior,
Exterior, Military, and Economic.

It is headed by the Minister of National Defense,
who delegates his authority to the institution’s
Director General, who is responsible for directing
and administrating the service.

Volunteer individuals or organizations form the
Civil Defense of Chile. The Civil Defense agency
also has “on-duty” personnel, (remaining personnel
from the military service draft) which, according to
the provisions of Law Decree 2306, Article 30, of
1978, must be provided by the Head Office of
National Mobilization. This personnel is assigned
to serve in the Civil Defense of Chile for a period

Destinations, and Aquiculture Concessions.

These spaces are a limited resource that allows multiple uses some of which are exclusive and others that
are mutually compatible. The basic purpose of the National Policy on Coastal Exploitation (PNUBC) is to
determine the best use of coastal areas.

This policy provides for the operation of a National Commission for Coastal Use, and a Regional Commission
for Coastal Use, which is comprised of the authorities, related to the sector and has the mission of proposing the appropriate zoning.

## 3. National Mobilization and Military Service

###### This chapter describes National

 Mobilization as the provision and

 preparation of the manpower and

 material resources to serve the State in

 order to deal with an armed conflict.

 Compulsory Military Service gives Chile

 enough forces to perform Defense

 tasks in peacetime and to generate

 trained reserves for any mobilization

 process.


###### 1. NATIONAL MOBILIZATION

It consists of three stages: preparation, execution,
and demobilization. The preparation takes place
during the normal, non-emergency state, through
the planning and enlisting of manpower, material,
and industrial potentials. Preparation is decentralized and involves, among other matters, the organization of the entire State administration in Fields
of Action.

**1.1. Mobilization of Manpower**

In the event of a foreign armed conflict, considered
in the Political Constitution of the Republic as an
emergency state called a “State of Assembly,” the
criteria for allocating resources to increase the
forces are changed in response to emergency situations associated with the state of alert. National Mobilization is an attempt to prepare the country without producing obvious changes in the normal
course of the country’s activities.

The ongoing preparation and updating of the mobi

lization documents and plans is the duty of the National Defense General Staff (EMDN), while the enlistment that includes the coordination and execution of the preparatory mobilization measures is the
duty of the Head Office of National Mobilization
(DGMN).

It recent years there has been a constant concern to
modernize concepts and procedures in order to
take the mobilization process to more realistic scenarios in keeping with its needs.

For this reason, the DGMN implemented its “Advance” project, which essentially involves updating at
all levels (EMDN, DGMN, Services’ General Staffs, operational units, naval zones, air bases, and Mobilization Base Units), the validation and control procedures of the reserve management, and requirements
of the field of the national defense. The project also
aims at improving the consultation, analysis and
evaluation processes involved in the assignment of
resources, ensuring effective, timely management of
the data during the stage of preparation, and consequently, in the mobilization of the human potential.


-----

###### 2. COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE

Compulsory Military Service was established in
Chile by means of Law 1362 on “Army and Navy Recruits and Replacements,” passed on September 5,
1900. Though its application is nationwide, in other
words, based on the compulsory, binding nature of
the public obligation, the cost of this model of recruiting is very high and not in keeping with the
current needs of the National Defense. During most
of the 19th Century, it was applied selectively,
through a recruiting system designed to select
troops from the conscript base. This system has
been maintained over time with some variations,
giving rise to a model known as a compulsory-selective recruiting model.

**2.1. Modernization of Compulsory Military**
**Service**

Throughout the century in which compulsory military service has been in force, Chilean society has
undergone a significant and important process of
changes, to which this service to the country has
had to adapt from time to time. The new social, economic and cultural realities, mainly since the
1960’s, as well as Chile’s defense needs deriving
from the changes in the international and strategic
arena, especially after the end of the Cold War,
made a substantial modernization of compulsory
military service advisable.

In 1994 the country began to modify the military
service, to introduce some elements to compensate
for the compulsory-selective nature of its recruiting, without affecting its military foundations. In a
second stage in 2000, a National Forum on Compulsory Military Service was held, with the participation of several organizations representing civil
society and State agencies and institutions, particularly the Armed Forces.

On September 5 of that year, Executive Decree 81 of
the Ministry of National Defense approved a proposal to modernize the Compulsory Military Service, based mainly on a series of ideas outlined in
this forum.

The proposal mainly considers designing a recruiting system that promotes voluntary enlistment to
perform this service to the country, to be complemented by a selection of the percentage of troops
not covered by voluntary recruits, through a public,
universal lottery mechanism. Some of the innovations to be introduced are related to the objectivity
and transparency of the recruiting system, the establishment of automatic enrollment in the Military


Registries of all Chilean citizens, the improvement
of types of service and the creation of a control and
supervisory system for the entire selection and recruitment process. The intention is also to strengthen and improve the legislative and institutional
treatment of the rights and responsibilities of the
recruits, and to regulate the causes of exclusion
more precisely. It also promotes voluntary military
service for women.

This proposal, that involves considerable modification of Law Decree 2306, of August 2, 1978, was
prepared based on certain initial conditions that
comprise the foundation of the State’s general policy on military service. These initial conditions are:

!The State has the responsibility of guaranteeing the country’s defense and, for this purpose,
must keep the Armed Forces in a condition to
meet the operational requirements of its missions.
!The State has limited funds to execute the
plans and projects designed to meet the various
needs and demands of society, and thus lacks
the financial resources required to have a full
professional force.
!Through the Constitution, the State has set
forth every citizen’s ethical imperatives of solidarity and service to the society where they
were born and of which they are a part, which
requires a personal contribution to the defense
of the country by means of military service.
!The State is responsible for providing for society’s aspirations concerning the principles of
equality in public duties and human dignity,
and for establishing the institutional mechanisms that ensure respect for these principles.

The amendments included in the bill that modernizes compulsory military service, submitted to the
Legislature in December 2001, meet the needs of
the Armed Forces on the one hand, and, on the
other, respond to the universal aspirations of civil
society.

However, this does not mean that the obligatory nature of the military service as established in Article
22 of the Constitution is changed. Instead, the objective of the government’s policy is to make voluntary enlistment the preferred means of troop selection.

This initiative is included in a schedule of several
stages until full implementation of the new compulsory military service model in 2005. This modernization of the compulsory military service involves modifying laws and regulations, adapting the


-----

structures of the National Defense institutions, and
assigning more resources and incentives to facilitate the goal of significantly increasing the recruitment of volunteers.

###### 3. RESERVE FORCES

The reserve forces are a group of people, with or
without military training, who are part of the country’s manpower, but not included in the conscript
base or in active duty in the services. Personnel in
the military reserves or in the Armed Forces are
called reservists and will be classified as trained
and untrained reserves.

The law defines the concepts involved as follows:

**_a) Manpower: people who reside nationwide_**
or who may enter the country and, because
they are Chilean citizens, constitute the total
human resources available to the country.

**_b) National Reserve: people, without distinc-_**
tion of gender, who meet the psychological,
physical and morale conditions to be mobilized
or to perform other duties in benefit of the
country.

**_c) Military or Armed Forces Reserve: people,_**
without distinction of gender, of the required
military age, with or without military training,
that meet the conditions to be mobilized by the
Armed Forces. The military or Armed Forces
reserve is formed with the following personnel:

!Personnel retired from the permanent
staff of the services of the Armed Forces
!Personnel from the Officers and NCO
schools of the Armed Forces, ho-norably discharged.
!Personnel with military training from
compulsory military service, a professional
military course or other special course.
!Personnel without military training.

## 4. The Armed Forces

###### To protect the population, the territory

 and property and activities carried out

 within the national borders, and to sup
 port the administration of the country’s

 Foreign Policy, the State has the

 resources of the National Defense.

 Among them, the Armed Forces is the

 only military component and consti
 tutes the foundation of Chile’s defen
 sive power.


###### 1. MILITARY POLICY

Military Policy is the set of guidelines that the
Ministry of Defense gives to the Armed Forces to
implement the military norms deriving from the
National Defense Policy. This policy provides a
guideline for the work of the Armed Forces as a
harmonic, coordinated body, thus, providing the
foundations for jointness. Military Policy attempts to strategically respond to the requirements of the Defense Policy and to establish the
basis for the specific policies of the services. It establishes the criteria or standards for the materials, weapons systems and equipment commonly
used in the three services, logistical and resource
management procedures, standard operating procedures, joint training and doctrine, and issues
that help optimize the performance of common
and joint tasks of the services, among others.

###### 2. MISSION OF THE ARMED FORCES

The Chilean Army, Navy and Air Force are the


only services that constitute the Armed Forces,
which are subordinate to the Ministry in charge
of the National Defense. These services exist to
defend the nation, are essential for national security, and guarantee the institutional order of
the Republic. In their capacity as armed services,
they are essentially obedient, non-deliberating,
professionals, hierarchical, and disciplined.

In relation to defense or external security, the
general mission of the Armed Forces is to deter
or combat all foreign threats in order to safeguard sovereignty and maintain the integrity of
the national territory. They also cooperate with
military forces of other countries in bilateral or
multilateral initiatives, always in the best interest of the country.

Based on these purposes, the work of the Armed
Forces is constant and hinges on the oath taken
by each member entering its ranks, to serve the
country and defend its essential values, and on
the proper enlistment of the personnel and resources of each of the armed services. For these


-----

reasons, and due to the nature of the missions assigned, this profession is considered primarily
vocational. This is reflected in the corresponding
legal texts that establish, among other aspects,
that “incorporation into the ranks and staffs of
Officers and personnel of the Permanent Staff is
only allowed through their own Military Academies.”[31]

Considering the specific demands imposed by
military duty and the professional career, the organizations and personnel exercising them, as
well as its institutes of professional training,
comply with jurisdictional, disciplinary and administrative principles set forth in the specific
legislation.

The Armed Forces personnel is comprised of the
permanent staff (Officers, NCOs or Sailors, and
Civil Employees), contract personnel, and reserve staff called to active service. Complementarily, though they are not part of the permanent
staff, ensigns, cadets, cabin boys, apprentices,
and students of the institutional schools, as well
as recruits, are also subject to the hierarchy and
discipline of the Armed Forces and corresponding laws.

The Armed Forces need to be prepared and
trained to fulfill their missions with enough flexibility and dynamism. In general terms, they
have to be prepared for combat and for maintaining the state of peace of Chile, and also to
participate in the State’s effort to maintain peace
in the world. For this reason the Armed Forces
must be conceived to face the full spectrum of
military operations, i.e. from peacekeeping and
peace building to crisis prevention and war.

Their peacetime deployment and organization
must grant them sufficient capacity to become
the military might the State needs to address potential conflicts or to assume the tasks of international cooperation assigned by the State.

###### 3. FUNCTIONS OF THE ARMED FORCES

In order to perform the tasks assigned, the
Armed Forces carry out a series of joint, common and specific activities.[32]

###### ✪

**31 Officers of the Religious Service and Officers of the professional**
services (M.D, Vet., lawyers) are excepted from this law. See, Constitutional Organic Law of the Armed Forces 18.948, February 1990.


The joint and common activities performed give
evidence of the usefulness of acting in coordination under the concept of a “unity of war” Normally, joint and common activities are coordinated and ordered by the National Defense General Staff.

**3.1. Joint Functions**

These are activities that, in order to meet a specific goal, require the active, integrated participation, under a single command, of the means
and combat capabilities of the Army, the Navy,
and the Air Force, or at least of two of these services.

**3.2. Common Functions**

These are activities that, though they pursue a
similar purpose, are performed individually by
the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, without
detriment to the corresponding coordination.

**3.3. Specific Functions**

These are the activities that are exclusively performed by each service of the Armed Forces.

The singularity of each society and the capabilities and limitations with which each State develops in the international arena determine that the
roles, missions and characteristics of the Armed
Forces are special and unique for each particular
country. They are encompassed within each
State’s freedom of action to establish its own concept of national security and its own Defense
Policy.

###### 4. CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING JOINTNESS

In the search for strategic solutions according to
our reality and the availability of resources, and
considering the experience of countries that
have been in conflict recently, there is a clear
need for jointness in order to integrate capacities
and thus achieve results that make timely, efficient and effective use of the military means.

Though this approach has gathered special mo

mentum since the end of the Cold War, Chile has
been undertaking a sustained increase of its
training capacity and joint forces operation since
1951, implemented through a series of joint activities by the Armed Forces. One of the most relevant manifestations is the Southern Military Region (RMA), a joint combatant command. Other
joint efforts are represented by the joint academic activities in the War Colleges. In term of
the services, there are joint courses, joint war
games, and joint exercises that teach and train
the personnel of all ranks and services’ units in
joint issues. The National Defense General Staff
(EMDN), a military organization of the Ministry
of Defense, created in 1942 can be considered
the highest representation of jointness— acting
as integrator, planner, coordinator and advisor in
joint issues, projects, doctrine, planning and organizing the forces in a joint fashion.

The fulfillment of the missions assigned to the
Armed Forces, presumes that they need to carry
out complex military operations requiring significant land, sea, air, logistical and intelligence efforts that must be duly coordinated at the highest
strategic level. This assumption is valid, for not
only reaching objectives in a war, but also when
they are limited as in cases of crisis. This necessary coordination is reflected in the strategic solution adopted by the Armed Forces. When this solution requires attaining a specific strategic objective through an integrated, coordinated and wellbalanced effort of the land, sea and/or air means,
the consequence is the imperative to create a joint
force, or joint command with these characteristics; that, necessarily leads to jointness.

**4.1. Introductory Concepts**

Military or joint strategy is defined as “the art
and science of developing, conceiving and directing the use of military forces in the preparation and execution of war and its campaigns, coordinating the activities of each of the services of
the Armed Forces and joint commands to attain
and secure the objectives stated by Policy.”

In other words, the Armed Forces as a whole
constitute a joint force per se, that may form other subordinated joint forces of permanent nature
(joint combatant commands) or circumstantial
(joint tasks forces) such as, airborne joint task
forces or amphibious joint task forces, if the situation so recommends.

The way in which the means and their characteristics (joint, combined or ser-vices) are organ

ized will depend on the nature of the objective,
of the strategic imperatives, of the analysis of the
strategic conducting elements, and of the assigned mission. This is why the use of joint
means is a command responsibility of the commander who is entrusted with the mission and
objective.

**4.2. The Conduct of Joint Operations**

Consists of the activities performed to exercise
the command and coordination between forces
of two or more services whenever they are required to participate in joint operations, to obtain
an strategic objective that cannot be secured only by one service’s effort.

The conduct of joint operations is a strategic decision that has to be made at the level of the Armed
Forces and its natural projection goes down to a
Joint Combatant Command. But it can be implemented at levels lower than a joint command, i.e.
at the level of joint task forces and joint operations
(Airborne or Amphibious Ops), whether they
originate in the Armed Forces or through a joint
combatant command. (See Box 19.)

**4.3. Joint Operations**

A joint operation is an offensive military action
conducted by a specific joint task force generated by the Armed Forces or by joint combatant
commands, for a specific period. It comprises
forces of two or more services under a single
joint command, in order to reach a strategic objective that would not be possible otherwise.

**4.4. Conclusions about Jointness**

This general overview of the subject of joint conduct of campaigns and operations leads to some
conclusions:

**_a)_** Modern warfare is inherently a joint action and it is unfeasible to think that one of
the military components of the Armed
Forces could, attain by itself, the strategic objective assigned.

**_b) Nevertheless, in order to attain the strate-_**
gic objective at the lowest cost possible and
within the period established, instead of
structuring permanent joint forces, it is important to use resources appropriate for the
purpose.

**_c) The relative importance of each service_**


-----

**BOX 19**

###### CONDITIONS FOR JOINT COMMAND
**In terms of the objective: to have strategic characteristics or repercussions in order to justify the use of means**
from the different services under a common command.

**In terms of the forces: to be those of two or more services, in quantity or size proportional to the nature of the**
objective to be attained. A special characteristic of the forces is that they do not have to be always under the
Joint command.

**In terms of command: to be exercised by an officer of any of the participating services, with the advisory of a**
Joint Staff comprised proportionally of members of the participating services and whose task is to advise the
Commander on joint issues and the particular doctrine, characteristics and capabilities of each participating
service.

**In terms of the scenario: The characteristics of the scenario, together with the nature of the objective, are**
probably the most relevant elements to consider for the organization of a joint force or a joint operation (airborne or amphibious). In this case, it is evident that the scenario and the objective are such that they are possible only through a joint force. If an objective is possible to be attained by forces of one service by itself or by
one service with the support of another (combined forces), a joint command or the organization of a joint
force is unjustified.


could vary in each theater depending on its
superiority, on its permanent comparison of
forces, the threats to be addressed, the strategic situation and the scenario. However, in a
joint theater, the components must have
similar strategic capacity and responsibility
in the achievement of the strategic objective.

**_d) Defining the strategic objectives that can_**
only be achieved through the coordinated
use of land, sea or air resources is the origin
of joint command.

Lastly, it must be stressed that Chilean legislation establishes that the Board of the Commanders in Chief of the Services must propose the solution to all problems related to military strategy
and its development in wartime, and therefore
propose the establishment of joint combatant
commands when required by national security.
Thus, the creation of joint combatant commands
or joint task forces starts off at the Board of the
Commanders in Chief of the Services, according
to the strategic solution adopted in the light of
the elements described above.

###### 5. INTEROPERABILITY

Interoperability is the ability of systems, units or
forces to provide to or accept services from other systems, units or forces, and to use these exchanged services effectively. Interoperability
may be considered today as a basic requirement
for executing joint military operations or opera

tions of combined forces forming an international coalition.

Nationally, interoperability has an impact on the
operation and organization of the Armed Forces
and its resources. The challenge of Chile’s defense institutions is to improve the capacity to
operate among themselves, in other words, to incorporate interoperability into their modernization processes as an important factor in making
decisions, stressing the progress of command
and control structures and processes, as well as
data management. Chile has progressed in standardizing joint procedures, though from an operational point of view the doctrine, training
processes, and equipment and system standardization still need to be adapted. In the technical
use of the resources, it is necessary to standardize the procedures, the language and the classification of all the services.

Internationally, defining the requirements of interoperability, to eventually carry out activities
within a joint force under the mandate of the
United Nations, is the responsibility of the government, and especially of the ministries of Defense and of Foreign Affairs. The decisions made
in these fields will determine the standards of interoperability to be attained and will constitute
the framework in which the different participating states will strive for that goal.

## PART V
 The Means for Defense


###### The means for the National Defense con- sist of the human and material resources that a country has in order to reach the level of external security that will allow it to achieve its national goals, and guar- antee its sovereignty and territorial integrity, free from external interference. Among these means, the Army, the Navy and the Air Force are the basic elements, and they are fundamentally in charge of enforcing the State’s missions to defend the country.

 They must organize, equip and train for this purpose. This means that they must be always ready in peacetime to put into practice the dissuasive character of our Defense, and at the same time, perform international cooperation tasks in the areas of defense and security. Complementarily, they participate in the country's historical tradition and in the


###### transmission of our national identity traits, as well as contributing significant- ly to the nation’s economic and techno- logical development, and in support of the community.

 This part also mentions the main char- acteristics of each of the services and their modernization processes. These processes involve the evolution experi- enced in the last few years to maintain their readiness and preparation in accordance with the advances of mili- tary technology and science, and the changes undergone in our society. An example of the Armed Forces’ adapta- tion to the modern world is the increas- ing incorporation of women into the dif- ferent services of the Armed Forces, which has even given them access to the combat and combat support branches of some services.

## 1. The Chilean Army

###### The Chilean Army was born with and

 for the country. Its history summarizes

 not only its vocation of service in the

 defense of the Homeland, but also

 recalls its triumphant history in the

 battles fought for her in the past. It is

 also important to highlight its contribu
 tion to international peace, to the con
 solidation of the territory, and in gener
 al to the challenges of security and

 development that the country faces.


###### 1. MISSION OF THE ARMY

The mission of the Army is to help maintain the
nation’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.
Therefore, it has the responsibility of participating in the land defense of the country in the
event of any action coming from abroad, which
may threaten or attack them.

It fulfills its mission by means of effective preparation and proper use of its human and material
resources in the execution of the following activities:

**1.1. National**

It develops and maintains the combat readiness
of its forces by means of combat training and
military education.

**1.2. International**

It participates in State initiatives for safeguarding
international peace and security under the au

date of the Organization of American States
(OAS), it participates in the Inter-American
Board of Defense (JID), and is represented in the
Inter-American Defense College (CID).

As one of its founding members, the Army also
plays an active role in the American Armies
Conference (AAC), a multilateral military
agency with the objective of promoting close integration and cooperation between the American
armies to study issues of mutual interest in
terms of the continent’s security and defense.

###### 2. ORGANIZATION

The following chart summarizes the general structure of the Army: (See Figure 12)

**2.1. High Command**

The Command of the Army is exercised by the
Commander in Chief of the Army (CJE), as head
of the service. The different Operational Units


-----

training, support and other technical Commands
report directly to the Commander in Chief of the
Army.

Many advisory agencies, the Operational Units
and Commands are, thus, under the authority of
the Commander in Chief. The Army General
Staff is among the first group and is the main advisory body for the decision making and decision
taking processes. To perform its main functions
the Army General Staff has the following Directorates:

!Directorate of Army Personnel.
!Directorate of Army Intelligence.
!Directorate of Army Operations.
!Directorate of Army Logistics.
!Directorate of Army Education.
!Directorate of Rationalization and Development of the Army.
!Directorate of Army Finances.

The Office of the Secretary General, the Office of
the Judge Advocate General of the Army, the Office of the Inspector General, and the Center for
Military Studies and Research are all at the same
level.

**2.2. Operational Units**

The Army’s presence in the national territory is
visible by means of the different military garrisons, from those located in the Chilean high
plateau in the extreme north, to those in Chilean
Antarctica. Essentially, these means consist of
operational units called Divisions, under which
there are tactical units such as regiments and
battalions from the different branches and services of the Army. The peacetime deployment of
these Operational units, from north to south, is
as follows:


!Sixth Army Division: covers the jurisdiction of Region I, with headquarters in the
city of Iquique.
!First Army Division: covers the jurisdiction of Regions II and III, with headquarters
in the city of Antofagasta.
!Second Army Division: covers the jurisdiction of Regions IV, V, and VI, in addition to
the Metropolitan Region, with general quarters in the city of Santiago.
!Third Army Division: covers the jurisdiction of Regions VII and VIII, with headquarters in the city of Concepción.
!Fourth Army Division: covers the jurisdiction of Regions IX and X, with headquarters
in the city of Valdivia.
!Seventh Army Division: covers the jurisdiction of Region XI, with headquarters in
the city of Coyhaique.
!Fifth Army Division: covers the jurisdiction of Region XII, with headquarters in the
city of Punta Arenas. (See Figure 13)

**2.3. Means and Capabilities**

Overall, the Army is structured around the proper organization of command and combat and
combat support forces, within the operational
framework, constituting its peace and war potential. The Army’s major asset is its men and
women, whose training and professionalism
make them the main axis of the service’s capacities. Its operational systems are organized into
the following subsystems:

**_a) Information Subsystem_**
Meets the intelligence needs of the three
military operational levels (strategic, operational, and tactical) and makes use of different types of collection capabilities to provide
the necessary and timely information to the


**FIGURE 12**


-----

-----

authorities to facilitate the decision-making
process.

**_b) Command and Control Subsystem (C4I)_**
Coordinates and directs operations, fitting
into the command and control systems C4I
(Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence) at higher levels, facilitating the execution of data processing activities and the decision-making process, and
maintaining an up-to-date view of the situation, as well as providing with EW activities.
It also orders and controls all of these activities.

**_c) Maneuvering Subsystem_**
Performs various duties based on the Army’s
territorial deployment, the types of units,
the population density, and the capacity to
obtain resources for material and industrial
readiness, among others. The purpose of this
work is to help the Army achieve its strategic
objective by the use of force, through units of
different characteristics and capacities,
which interact in a coordinated fashion.

**_d) Logistical Support Subsystem_**
Optimizes the resources and the use of the
technological applications, centralizes the facilities to satisfy material, life, and combat
needs, and organizes logistical units according to operational needs. This subsystem is
sustainable provided it is developed in
peacetime, and the maintenance function
acquires vital importance as it increases the
useful life of the existing material.

**2.4. Military Institutes Command (CIM)**

As an executive agency of the service’s educational system, the CIM manages the education
and training of Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers, and Enlisted men. Its colleges, military
academies, branches and specialties schools are
centers for imparting the teaching-learning
process to all personnel, for the purpose of
achieving the professional and specialization levels required by the modern demands of authority, control and execution of the military profession.

**2.5. Administrative, Logistical and Technical**
**Support Organizations**

The commands are at the same level as the operational units and are in charge of providing
training, administrative, logistical and technical


commands perform both military-related duties
as well as those that collaborate with the different aspects of the country’s development. These
Commands are as follows:

**_a) Logistical Support Command (CALE)_**
Executes all logistical actions for the Service
meeting the living and combat needs of the
troops in all areas and services, such as
Quartermasters, Health, Transportation,
Ordnance and Veterinary. These duties are
performed through Maintenance, Service,
Supply and Repair.

**_b) Army Administrative Support Command_**
**_(CAAE)_**
Manages the staff support and welfare system of the Institution, through several facilities throughout the country. The administrative support services, such as Social Welfare,
State housing programs, Recreation centers,
Religious and Funeral services, and the Family information bureau for enlisted men, are
all under this command.

**_c) Military Industry and Engineering Com-_**
**_mand (CIMI)_**
Centralizes all military industrial activities
in the service, grouping the different industrial facilities of the Army under one command. Through the different CIMI agencies,
the Army’s Factories and Workshop
(FAMAE), the Military Geographic Institute
(IGM) and the Research and Control Institute (IDIC), the Army provides the most significant support to development and to the
national industry.

**_d) Army Engineers Command (CINGE)_**
Its mission is to advise the Commander in
Chief of the Army (CJE) in relation to military infrastructure, management of the institution’s real property, and execution of road
infrastructure projects and works by means
of the Military Works Corps (CMT).

**_e) Army Signals Command (CTE)_**
Its mission is to advise the Commander in
Chief of the Army (CJE) in matters related to
telecommunications, electronic warfare as
well as Information management and data
processing systems, and to manage the
Army’s telecommunications system, (C4I
System: Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence) implementing the authority and administration
system of the Commander in Chief of the


-----

**FIGURE 14**


-----

**_f) Army Health Command (COSALE)_**
Manages the Army’s health system and provides medical and health services through a
network of facilities. This capacity allows it to
provide special support in some services to
public and private health organizations. Its
main facility is the Santiago Military Hospital.

Lastly, at the same level as the Operational Units
and Commands, are the General Commander of
the Army Garrison, Metropolitan Region, in Santiago, and the Army Aviation Brigade with headquarters in the city of Rancagua, Region VI. (See
Figure 14)

**2.6. Branches and Services**

The Army is comprised of Branches and Services
of diverse characteristics and with different functions, both individually and jointly. The Branches are: Infantry, Artillery, Armored Cavalry, Engineers and Signals. Services include logistics
and administration. Logistical services are those
of Ordnance, Quartermaster, Transportation,
Health and Veterinary. Administrative Services,
in peacetime, correspond to General Adjutancy,
Military Justice, Military Police, Religious Service and Welfare; and in wartime, they include
Burial and Replacement services.


###### 3. STRATEGIC VISION

The Chilean Army is undergoing an “integral
strategic change.” This change consists of a modernization process based on the incorporation of
the concept of force projection and interoperability, and strengthening the vocational-professional model, the institutional integration of the
society and its commitment to the republican
spirit. (See Figure 15)

**3.1. Scopes of Action**

The Chilean Army plays a permanent part in national life. Generically, its actions take place in
four basic areas of activity, which comprise the
main tasks of its military function. On this basis,
given its territorial deployment, its strategic capacities, and its contribution to the politicalstrategic field, the Army works to enforce the objectives of the Defense Policy and contributes to
Foreign Policy. Similarly, as an integral part of
society, the Army collaborates with the nation’s
development through its technology and industry-related activities and through the effective
and rational use of its capabilities and potential.

Exercising effective deterrence is fundamental to
reducing threats, especially in a setting of uncer

tainty. The purpose is to preserve the peace and
reduce the possibility of any crisis or armed conflict in the international arena. With this purpose, the new design of the forces being implemented enhances their own strategic capabilities
and allows them to achieve greater interoperability with other institutions of the national defense.

In addition to the particular scope of the armed
forces, the Army focuses its efforts on a second
area of strategic action: cooperation, as an expression of the State's interest outside Chile. In
order to meet this objective, priority is given to
participation in peace missions under the UN supervision or mandate, an activity the Army has
been involved in since 1948. It also participates
in instances that contribute to strengthening the
bilateral and regional integration processes.

There are two other areas that are especially relevant, not because of the impact they have had
throughout history, but because they are within
the institutional scope and territorial deployment of the Army. These are related to the tasks
of development and contribution to the country’s
unity and cohesion, basic assumptions for an effective defense.

Thus, the Army’s collaboration in the country’s
development goes beyond its presence throughout territory, because it is also manifested in the
training young people receive through Military
Service; the provision –by the Military Geographic Institute– of conventional and digital
land cartography, as well as complementary educational texts. In turn, the Research and Control Institute is the official State agency in charge
of quality control in different areas, and the Directorate of Equine and Remount Development
collaborates to improving the country’s agricultural equine stock. Another aspect is the task of
physical integration of the national territory, by
means of the duties performed by the Military
Work Corps and its capacity to act in the event of
emergencies or natural disasters.

On the other hand, the Military Studies and Research Center (CESIM) encourages academic research in the areas of defense, and participates
in the area of science and technology through
different agreements with universities, and public and private institutions, to integrate this
field’s knowledge into issues of national interest.
Lastly, the Army contributes to unity and social
cohesion both as a result of its territorial deployment and by including in its ranks a diverse


ty. This reality gives it a character that few public institutions have, and its actions help transmit
the characteristics of Chilean society from one
generation to the next.

###### 4. THE MODERNIZATION PROCESS

The process of modernization involves transforming and improving the capacities, structures
and management that will allow the Army to
adapt to the demands imposed both by national
and international events, as well as by rapid
technological change.

The process is basically oriented to developing a
modern, highly specialized organization, with
units of high performance and efficiency. It also
seeks to increase the capacities of its personnel,
helping them to acquire the skills required for
using complex weapon systems. In this manner,
the Army helps the country exercise an appropriate level of deterrence and, in turn, acquires
the necessary skills to cooperate with UN missions.

This process sometimes involves tasks requiring
deep institutional changes at different levels, for
the purpose of incorporating that specialization
and attaining fluency and certainty in the decision-making process.

Therefore, the modernizing effort aims at gradually achieving a design of the forces that is realistic and based on the availability of economic resources. This means implementing periodic decisions that will allow the process to continue for
the immediate term, and later lead to the
changes foreseen for the year 2013. Thus, all activities that imply an organizational change, a
change of facilities or mobilization of personnel
will be founded on an integral feasibility study of
the proper dimension and coherent with the service’s capabilities.

**4.1. Bases for Strategic Changes**

The elements that strengthen the modernization
process –begun in 1992– are the following:

**_a) Projection of Force: this concept refers to_**
the purpose of achieving a usage capacity in
different scenarios, quickly and for deterrence and cooperation effects, both in the
national and international areas. Through
this effort, the Institution evolves towards a
more functional, flexible and modular struc

-----

**_b) Interoperability: aims at optimizing oper-_**
ational integration, both in the national field
and with the armies of other countries that
are part of peacekeeping forces, to operate
effectively in a multifunctional context.
**_c)_** Vocational-Professional Model: its members share spirit of service and professional
performance as core elements for effectively
executing their military function.
**_d)_** Army integrated into society: contributes
to the country in peacetime, in emergencies,
and in wartime, within the framework of an
institutional doctrine that confirms its vocation of service.
**_e) Army committed to constitutional princi-_**
ples: in other words, it is founded on the
principles of an institutional system that are
established by the Political Constitution and
express the republican tradition of independent Chile.

**4.2. Objectives of the Modernization Process**

The objectives that guide the modernization
process of the Army are:

**_a) Strengthen the units’ rationalization, com-_**
pletion, and training, and incorporate a modern concept of structure and management
into the organization.
**_b) Continue with the process of rationalizing_**
the management of the financial resources
allocated by the State.
**_c) Optimize the Institution’s human re-_**
sources management systems by introducing new technologies and administrative procedures.
**_d) Complete the weapons and technical re-_**
sources systems needed by the operational
units, through the incorporation, replacement or reinforcement of the existing elements.
**_e) Restructure the educational and training_**
system.
**_f) Improve the institutional infrastructure._**
**_g) Contribute to United Nations peacekeep-_**
ing operations in which the State decides to
participate.
**_h) Strengthen the science and technology_**
area.
**_i) Optimize the ways in which Military Ser-_**
vice can be performed, according to the
framework for the modernization of the
SMO.

**4.3. Stages of the Modernization Process**


the “Alcázar Plan,” the master document of the
modernization process. In general, the main objective of this Plan is to rationalize and optimize
the Institution’s human and material resources,
in harmony with the country’s political, cultural
and economic reality. Therefore, it includes the
modernization efforts undertaken by the Army,
and calls for the following development stages:

!Stage I: Begun in 1992 and completed in
1998.
!Stage II: Begun in 1998, and scheduled to
last until 2013.

To accomplish the modernization process described above, the Army is carrying out two
types of projects: global projects that benefit the
institution as a whole and specific projects that
directly support each of the High Agencies, Commands and Operational units.

In this context, the following activities are at the
following levels of progress:
**_a)_** Restructuring of the institutional educational and training system to increase the
training level of the personnel and improve
their professional efficiency in using new
weapons systems.
**_b) The Military Academy, the War College_**
and the Military Polytechnic College, under
a new educational concept, are executing
study programs and post-graduate and postdegree programs in the area of military sciences, some of which have the significant
participation of civil professionals.
**_c) Reorganization of units, including the in-_**
corporation, replacement and completion of
modern weapon systems and technical resources, under the concept of accomplishing
tasks in a comprehensive sense during times
of peace, crisis, war and natural disasters.
**_d) Optimization of technological research by_**
institutional agencies, with the capacity for
contributing to the nation’s development.
**_e) Development of logistical units and troop_**
support systems, in accordance with the
unit’s current and future capabilities.
**_f) Renewal and extension of the military, so-_**
cial and welfare infrastructure.

###### 1. THE NAVY’S MISSION

The Chilean Navy has the basic mission of participating in the country’s foreign security and
military defense on an ongoing basis, safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity. For
this purpose, it carries out actions both in peace
and in wartime

**1.1. In Peacetime**

Contribute to the development of Chilean maritime power, providing security for navigation,
encouraging sea activities and port development,
continuing the marine cartography and signaling, and performing inspections and supervisions that safeguard human life at sea.

Supervise the national maritime territory, comprised of the Inland Waters, Territorial Sea, Exclusive Economic Zone, and Presence Sea, protecting the national security and interests, as

Perform the tasks of maritime supervision,
search, rescue and security, in the maritime
zone for which the country is responsible, according to the international agreements regulating this matter.

**1.2. In Wartime**

Carry out operations that will allow Chile the free
use of the sea at all times, and the sea lines of
communications to sustain the war effort and protect international trade. Simultaneously, deny
this privilege to the enemy in order to strengthen
the nation’s war effort, on the one hand, while
weakening the corresponding effort of the enemy,
in the interest of a victorious outcome for the nation.

Help project the nation’s military power into enemy territory and in turn prevent the projection
from the sea of the adversary’s military power.

Support the war effort of other services of the
Armed Forces.

###### 2. ORGANIZATION

In line with the mission and context of a continuous search for more effective management, the
Navy has recently readapted its general organization, allocating more functional characteristics
to its senior staff.

In this way, the Navy’s current organizational
structure is made up of high level directing and
management entities, technical agencies, forces
and operational resources, and support establishments. This structure is detailed below.

**2.1. High Command**

The Office of the Commander in Chief of the
Navy is the leading entity of the Institution. The
Admiral who holds the position of Commander
in Chief operates with a group of direct consulting agencies, formed by the officers exercising
the institution’s higher command. These include
the Strategic Planning Council (for institutional
direction issues), the Economic Council (for
budgetary and financial control issues), and the
Navy’s Council (for handling institutional management issues).

The Commander in Chief constitutes its command authority with a General Staff, and the
support and advice of the Office of the Secretary


General, Comptroller’s Office, Office of the Inspector General, and a set of management control systems. (See Figure 17)

**2.2. High Level Organizations**

**_a) General Staff of the Navy_**
This agency provides advisory services and
work for the Commander in Chief of the
Navy with respect to all issues related to institutional planning, administration and upper-level direction, performing the duties of
upper-level planning and coordination with
the other navy directing agencies and authorities, in general.

**_b) General Directorate of Naval Personnel_**
This is the higher agency responsible for the
Navy’s human resources management. As
such it constitutes the highest echelon of the
institution in relation to personnel administration, assuming the corresponding functions of selection, incorporation, training,
promotion and retirement of the personnel.
For this effect, it has a group of specialized
technical agencies that take care of the educational, medical-health, welfare and religious assistance aspects.

**_c) General Directorate of Naval Services_**
This agency is in charge of the upper-level
management of the Navy’s material and
technological resources. As such, it constitutes the highest echelon of the institution in
terms of material logistics, in charge of cre

ating and supporting the resources with
which the Navy operates, and the rules to be
applied for effective and safe use of people
and environment. In order to perform its
functions, it has several technical and specialized logistical agencies under it, covering
regulations, research and development, procurement, project management and material
management.

**_d) General Directorate of Naval Finance_**
This agency is in charge of managing the financial resources of the institution. As such,
it is in charge of proposing and executing the
financial policy of the Navy, performing integral control of the financial-accounting
management and establishing the general
rules and procedures in budgetary, accounting, calculation, cost control and financial order matters. In the performance of their duties, both technical agencies specialized in
budgets and accounting are under this Office.

**_e) General Directorate of Maritime Territo-_**
**_ry and Merchant Marine_**
This is an agency of the Navy by which
Chile ensures the enforcement of laws and
international agreements to protect human
life on the sea, the marine environment,
and the natural sea resources, and to regulate the activities carried out in this field,
thereby contributing to the nation’s sea development.

In this context, this office coordinates its
leadership functions through the Offices of
“Maritime Security and Operations” and
“Maritime and Sea Environment Interests.”
Its operations are carried out in a decentralized manner, implemented through the four
Naval Zones that supervise a total of 16 Maritime Governorships that execute their tasks
through 61 Harbor Master’s Offices and 266
Sea Mayor’s Offices.

**_f) Naval Operations Command_**
This command is in charge of directing the
navy operations in order to achieve the
strategic objectives assigned to the Navy. It is
also in charge of training the Navy’s forces to
carry out the operations set forth in the corresponding plans and to direct the operations determined by the Commander in
Chief. The Naval Operations Command is in
charge of battleships, submarines, aircraft,
and amphibian and special forces.


**2.3. Combat Forces**

The naval forces are the elements that execute
the Navy’s strategy and consist of operational
forces and type forces, organized, equipped and
trained to achieve the objectives of naval warfare. Combat forces consist of units or groups organized to perform a specific mission.

The Type Forces are the Fleet, the Submarine
Force, Naval Aviation, the Marine Corps, the
Amphibian and Naval Transportation Command,
and the Tactical Divers Command. The main
function of the commanding officers of the Type
Forces is to keep the units available and trained
to be integrated into task forces and groups to be
created, according to operational tasks.

While performing their assigned missions, the
Navy forces also cooperate in activities that benefit the country in peacetime, under the regulations established by law.

The Naval Zones are operational and logistical
forces designed to contribute to maritime defense and to control and protection of maritime
traffic within their jurisdictions. They consist of
combat, sea and coastal patrolling and logistical
support resources. They perform their operational tasks through their subordinate or assigned combat means and they provide logistical
support to other forces through the naval and
navy air bases and stations in response to operational requirements and directives from the service’s technical agencies. (See Figure 18)

The naval and navy air facilities include all landbased facilities within a specific area, and they
have been established to provide, coordinate and
execute the services they are to provide to the
navy forces.

**2.4. Special Support Organizations**

In addition to the agencies already mentioned,
there are other specialized technical agencies
that report to the Navy due to their nature, technical relationship or purpose. Because of their
contribution to the nation’s interests, the more
important of these are:

**_a) Hydrographic and Oceanographic Ser-_**
**_vice of the Navy (SHOA)_**

that the Navy has carried out for almost two
hundred years, studying the geography of

-----

try, tides and currents, geographical features
and obstructions. The purpose is to develop
maps and install the maritime signals required to ensure safe navigation and expedite use of national marine routes. For a
country with a lengthy coastline and island
territory such as Chile’s this activity is essential to the country’s integration.

The Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Navy is also an official technical
and permanent State service in the areas of
hydrography, nautical cartography, oceanography, tides and seaquakes, nautical geography, nautical astronomy, time signal, and
navigation-oriented aerophotogrammetry.
Through scientific sea research, it also contributes to the development and promotion
of other related activities of interest for the
country, such as “red tide” control and follow-up and forecast of the El Niño weather
pattern.

**_b) Shipyards and Workshops of the Navy_**
**_(ASMAR)_**
This autonomous state-owned company was
created in 1960 to meet the needs of careening, maintenance, repair and construction of
vessels for the Chilean Navy. As a subsidiary
activity, it also serves the vessels of the Merchant Marine. It has three properly equipped
shipyards, located in Valparaiso, Talcahuano
and Magallanes, with up-to-date technical and
professional capacities to service the high
technology now used in battleships and with
ISO-9001 quality certification since 1997.

###### 3. STRATEGIC VISION

The Navy’s doctrine may be summarized in the
following basic premises:

!Chile is a country for which the sea has
special relevance, so the Navy plays an essential role in the country’s security.

!The concept of Sea Control, which is the
reason behind Chile’s naval and marine
tasks, is the cornerstone of the Three Vectors
principle of Naval strategy. The objective of
this strategy is to achieve a certain degree of
control over activities that take place in a specific marine area during a specific period of
time, with the purpose of enjoying its use or
to deny or obstruct its use to any adversary.
!Control of the sea takes place under two


conditions: either a conflict or a peacetime
environment. In the event of a conflict, control is oriented mainly to allowing Chile’s
forces to operate without any threats from
the sea. In peacetime, it focuses on carrying
out the marine activities without any interference or restriction that could affect the nation’s waterways. Under both circumstances,
the presence of the Naval Force is indispensable; only its mode of use may vary.

**3.1. Scopes of Action of the Navy**

The Chilean Navy’s contribution to national development is based on an articulating idea called
the “Three Vectors Naval Strategy”, which recognizes three particular scenarios:

!The sea space, which is related directly to
the security of inland areas of strategic interest.

!The sea space of specific interest for Chile
due to its intrinsic economic value or due to
the industrial or research activities performed in that space.

!The international sea space, which is of interest in terms of Chile’s political, economic
and security interaction with other countries.

When these scenarios are identified, the naval
strategy described above is applied, and each
vector is in charge of carrying out the Navy’s activities in each of the spaces described and listed
below:

The **Defense Vector** consists of the defense of
our national territory, its citizens, its assets and
its rights. In this field, related to national sovereignty, the Navy is part of a military system that
acts together with the Army and the Air Force to
deter or repel potential aggressors.

Regarding the actions of the Armed Forces, the
Navy promotes the development of skills and
joint activities to achieve the most effective and
efficient military strategy, in which, in wartime,
the Navy will be in charge of controlling the sea
in a specific area for as long as the operations so
require.

The **Maritime Vector consists of the supervi-**
sion and control of our extensive national sea
territory, in which the Navy must be continually
and integrally present. Its task is to protect the


-----

renewable living resources of the area and the
marine environment and enforce the laws of the
Republic. In addition, it must carry out tasks in
the Maritime Responsibility Zone, an area of
about 30,000,000 km2 granted to Chile by international agreements. Protection of human life in
the sea, search and rescue missions, and naval
control of maritime traffic are the main commitments assumed.

In short, the Navy must exercise a certain degree
of control to have clean and safe oceans, and to
facilitate the economic development of the country, promoting the rational use and exploitation
of our national territory.

The **International Vector, in support of the**
State's foreign policy, consists of the Navy’s participation in promoting and protecting a fundamental priority national interest that allows us to
preserve the international peace, security and
stability of the sea, which is just as significant as
our development and progress.

It should be noted that in the field of international security involves promoting, as well as defending, interests. This makes way for a concept
of security focused not only on threats, but also
on identification of opportunities that can in
turn generate new interests and instances of cooperation.

Within the region, the Navy will continue its
joint Antarctic patrols and bilateral exercises
with Peru and Argentina.
In the wider international field, to prepare for


potential participation in multinational peacekeeping operations and strengthening operational, technical and human ties, the Navy will
maintain and increase its presence in joint exercises. This will emphasize and consolidate the
institution’s reputation as an oceanic Navy, placing it in a better position with respect to the
navies of countries in the Pacific Basin and contributing more effectively to the State’s foreign
policy. (See Figure 19)

**3.2. Objectives of the Navy for the Bicentennial**

**_a) Mission for this Decade_**
As part of its permanent mission, in the regional and international political-strategic
context of the moment and the medium
term, the Navy has assumed the specific mission for 1999-2010 of contributing to the consolidation of Chile as a maritime nation with
a relevant role in the globalized world, with
a Naval Power capable of:

!Defending, together with the Army and
the Air Force, Chile’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

!Supervising and controlling the maritime zone for which the nation is responsible.

!Contributing, together with other
navies, to maintain international peace
and stability, in accordance with Chile’s
Foreign Policy and Defense.
!Participating in the protection of na

**FIGURE 19**


-----

tional interests abroad, according to State
policies and International Law.

**_b) Specific Objectives_**
To help achieve this mission, the Navy has
set itself the following goals:

**Objective 1:**
Increase the effectiveness and productivity of the Navy, in order to generate the
savings required to develop its strategic
capabilities, which involves: concentrated, connected and communicated ground
infrastructure, modern and standardized
material, and if possible, developing its
own technology in critical areas; and optimization and preservation of the institutional human resources.

**_Objective 2:_**
Publicize naval activities, so citizens know
the work and contribution of the Navy to
national development, implementing an
effective communications plan to inform
citizens of the service’s actions, and to
provide an efficient, quick service to the
community through state-of-the-art technology.

###### 4. PLANNING

Given the mission and forces available, the
Chilean Navy has structured and prepared the
planning of operational, development and sup

port activities in three different time periods:
(See Figure 20)

!The “Ocean” Directive, which defines the
institution’s objectives to be met within a period of twelve years, and provides a guideline of how it intends to meet them. This directive contains the Navy’s permanent mission, its vision, and the mission, strategy and
objectives to be reached within the time
frame, all considering the realistic possibility
and financial feasibility of implement it
within the established time period.

!The “Admiral” Directive guides the pursuit
of the objectives established in the Ocean Directive through partial objectives and policies for each area. This is a four-year schedule that runs from the Commander in Chief
of the Navy’s second year in office to his successor’s first year, thereby giving true continuity to the pursuit of the long-term objectives.

!The Annual Plan of Activities (PACA),
plans the specific tasks for each calendar
year and allocates resources to a group of
“administrative commands” in charge of performing those tasks and working towards the
objectives established in the Ocean and Admiral Directives.

###### 5. MANAGEMENT CONTROL

Each unit is required to maintain current infor

**FIGURE 20**


-----

mation on the ability to perform the assigned
roles, so its Command can have up-to-date information on this aspect and all changes that occur.

There is a cost accounting system that keeps
track of the resources allocated for tasks and how
they should be used, for each executing unit and
each type of activity performed.

A network system provides monthly reports on
the physical progress of the assigned tasks. It also provides six-month reports on problems encountered, experiences, levels of activity, development projects, etc.

The Navy is preparing the consolidated financial
statements to report on how its assets are managed and this information will contribute significantly to the decision-taking process.

###### 6. WOMEN IN THE NAVY

The role of women in the Navy is nothing new or
contrary to the work of the institution, as women
have been present in some specific areas for several decades.

Like all the services that have opened their doors
to women, the Navy needs to make some material and cultural changes to facilitate their performance, at both the officer and enlisted man
levels.

Beginning in 2003, the Navy will gradually in

corporate women into the Naval officer positions
of medical doctor, dentist, and attorney. It will do
the same for sea-going positions in the Naval
health specialties. Then, according to the
progress of the institution’s projects and
changes, women will be trained to enter the officer and seaman ranks in the areas of Provisioning and Coast Guard, providing services mainly
in land-based divisions.

Nevertheless, placing women in positions that
involve their presence onboard the combat units
and shipboard service in general is something to
be evaluated in the future, after the early stages
provide some experience, reduce cultural barriers and address other aspects inherent in Naval
operations, evaluate the greater experience of
other navies, and complete the physical adaptation of ship facilities.

The incorporation of women is advantageous for
the Institution as it provides an improved selection base and introduces abilities and skills that
are more frequent in women. Despite these benefits, this incorporation process requires work in
several areas, namely defining women’s professional careers, making the role of mother compatible with the long absences from home that
on-board sailors must face, and taking into account living in very confined spaces.

## 3. The Chilean Air Force

###### Since its beginning in the early 20th

 Century, Chilean aeronautics has been

 constantly evolving. This process has

 given the Chilean Air Force (FACH) its

 present significant strategic dimension.

 Thanks to decades of effort, the FACH

 has served as a basis for developing

 the different components of an authen
 tic Aerospace system.


###### 1. THE MISSION OF THE AIR FORCE

The Chilean Air Force’s mission is to defend the
country by controlling and exploiting air space,
participating in the surface battle and supporting
its own and friendly forces with a view to contributing to the strategic objectives set for the
Armed Forces by national policy.

In order to fulfill its mission, the Air Force carries out specific functions both in peacetime and
in wartime.

**1.1. In Peacetime**

In conjunction with the General Office of Civil
Aeronautics (DGAC), the Chilean Air Force controls air traffic so that the country’s air activity is
undertaken safely within international parameters and so that it can react in the event of an illegal incursion into Chilean air space.

It contributes to developing aerospace power.
This is a real, potential or limited ability to use


air space for one’s own benefit. Even if it does
not have any spacecraft, a country may be considered to have aerospace power when it has
policies or plans to use this capability in the future.

Since it works with the DGAC in controlling air
traffic for the safety of air activity, the Air Force
has the means to respond in the event catastrophes and disasters caused by aviation accidents.
This rescue capability is used frequently in
emergencies affecting the country as a result of
natural disasters.

Through the Aerophotogrammetric Service
(SAF), it performs its assigned duties within the
country in terms of aerophotogrammetry, cartography and other related fields. It has the ability to observe the earth from space, which offers
planners in all fields of the country’s endeavors
an overview that allows them to make optimum
use of their resources.

It promotes the development of aerospace inter

ests, the aeronautical and aerospace industry,
aeronautical infrastructure, scientific and technological development, civil, sporting and commercial aviation, aerospace policy, national and
institutional infrastructure and awareness of the
country’s air space.

**1.2. In wartime**

It undertakes operations aimed at destroying or
neutralizing enemy air, ground and sea forces.
Air Power offers the possibility of facing enemy
forces almost anywhere, reducing the impact of
such factors as distance or terrain features.

It directs and controls air defense based on controlling and watching over national air space. In
the event of unidentified, illegal or hostile incursions, it intercepts the aircraft, thereby being
able to provide a graduated response, including
the use of force if circumstances warrant.

It achieves a degree of control over air space that
allows Chile’s own and friendly forces to operate.
Air Control is the degree of freedom of action acquired in a given space and time as a result of
subjecting the enemy to air power, so as to be
able to use air space for one’s own benefit and
deny its use to the enemy.

It offers support to operations carried out by
ground and sea forces, so as to contribute to their
war efforts. This support takes different forms
and helps ground forces neutralize or destroy
enemy resources.

It undertakes strategic air reconnaissance and
surveillance, and military air transport. The re

sources at the Air Force’s disposal make it a useful instrument for efficiently observing enemy
actions, contributing valuable information to the
various levels of command conducting the war.
In the other hand, military air transport allows
forces to be quickly deployed over long distances, expediting any possible change of the
main effort of war operations.

###### 2. ORGANIZATION

In order to fulfill its mission, the various components of the Air Force are organized as shown in
the following table: (See Figure 21)

**2.1. High Command**

An Air Force General who holds the position of
Commander in Chief of the Air Force exercises
the Command of the Air Force, and is responsible for strategic leadership and administrative
management of the Institution.

The working group that helps him do this job is
the Air Force General Staff, which advises him in
planning, managing and controlling the Institution, so as to meet air activity requirements in
peacetime and their use in wartime.

The Air Force General Staff consists of the following Offices:

!Directorate of Air Force Personnel
!Directorate of Air Force Intelligence
!Directorate of Air Force Operations
!Directorate of Air Force Logistics
!Directorate of Air Force Anti-aircraft De

**FIGURE 21**

fense and Special Forces
!Directorate of Air Force Telecommunications, Information Management and data
processing.
!Directorate of Air Force Finance.

**2.2. Combat Command**

Combat Command is the Higher Operational
Unit that manages the Air Force’s operational
units with a view to keep them in the state of operational readiness that the service planning requires.

**2.3. Support Units**

**_a) Logistics Command_**
This executive unit’s mission is to obtain,
provide, maintain and develop the material,
technological and logistical information resources required to meet the needs arising
from war and development planning and
those generated by institutional activities.

**_b) Personnel Command_**
This executive unit’s mission is to manage
personnel system duties with a view to full
development of human resources in support
of the Air Force’s mission.

**2.4. Operational Units**

Represented by five Air Brigades, whose jurisdictions cover the country’s territory. (See Figure 22)

Air Brigades are operational units that exercise
command within a geographic area and whose
mission is to conduct air operations with the resources at their disposal in their areas of authority. A General Officer commands each of these
Brigades and reports directly to the Commander
in Chief of the Air Force. Each Air Brigade has
Air Groups equipped with different types of aircraft, which conduct combat and air support operations according to institutional planning and
instructions.

Air Brigade I, with its headquarters in Iquique,
covers Region I. The Air Brigade V, with headquarters in Antofagasta, covers Regions II and III.
Air Brigade II in Santiago covers Regions IV
through VIII, including the Metropolitan Region.
Air Brigade III, with headquarters in Puerto
Montt, covers the south, including Regions IX and
X and part of Region XI. Air Brigade IV, with headquarters in Punta Arenas, covers the far south, including part of Region XI and all of Region XII.


The Air Force implements its air power through
these units, developing their capabilities and
means.

**2.5. Means and Capabilities**

**_a) Capabilities_**
Air Power is the force component of Aerospace Power that is employed in the air
space in order to use it for one’s own benefit
and deny its use to the enemy. It is represented by the total of all the weapons systems used by the Air Force to combat the enemy and includes all necessary support activities to be able to use them, and trained
personnel to operate them.

Air Power is effective when it meets the following requirements:

!Highly trained, motivated and technically capable personnel
!Reliable, with timely intelligence that
supports decision-making processes
!Sustained logistical support in terms of
quantity, quality and timing
!Appropriate technology for the setting

The natural projection of air space is outer
space. Acquiring the capability to operate in
that sphere has a multiplying effect on Air
Power and national development, mainly
due to our country’s geographical configuration.

**_b) Means_**
Air Power requires striking a careful balance
between capabilities and resources, which
determine the effectiveness and efficiency
of the use of the air.

The total of offensive and defensive combat
aircraft, which is the main force at the service’s disposal, must be accompanied by
means of transport, command and control
that allow operations to be planned, coordinated and directed. These resources must resist attacks by the enemy and, in addition to
those indicated above, include anti-aircraft
detection and defense, and an infrastructure
that is capable of sustaining operations.

Air Force resources are capable of exploiting
the third, aboveground dimension. This capability contributes, on the one hand, to operational supremacy in a given theater of
operations, and, on the other, to an integrat

-----

**FIGURE 22**


-----

ed, joint and possibly combined use of the
resources available.

Thanks to their ability to gain height, and for
speed and range, the resources at the Air
Force’s disposal can counteract threats or
comprise a threat over a very extensive area
in a short period of time. These resources
may be deployed rapidly to far distant theaters to provide timely help for an ally, or to
act as a deterrent element in the event of aggression.

Within its organizational structure, the Air
Force balances all of these resources, distributing them to the Air Brigades throughout
the whole territory. This ensures efficient
performance of the mission with which it
has been entrusted.

The Air Force’s weapons systems are reinforced with in-flight refueling and airbone
early warning capabilities, which are considered force multipliers.

Heavy and light air transport are added to
these resources, consisting of aircraft capable of transporting cargo and passengers under peace, war and emergency conditions.
Transport and rescue capabilities are supplemented by helicopters suitable for operating
in different types of terrain.

For efficient use of its material resources, the
Air Force also has air bases, anti-aircraft defense units and detection units in its various
Brigades, all coordinated by means of an automated command and control system
which enables efficient handling of the flow
of information in order to carry out operations.

In addition to these operational resources
are the resources provided by commercial
aviation and by civil and sporting aviation,
which furnish new contingents of pilots each
year.

All of these human and material capabilities
make up a system called the Aerospace System. The Air Force is the main component of
this system.

**_c) The Attributes of the Air Power_**
Beyond its own specific mission, it cooperates in the success of the other services’ missions, contributing to land and sea battles by


means of combat operations against ground
and sea targets, and combat support (such as
aerospace surveillance, air reconnaissance
and air transport).

The Air Force’s speed of reaction is strengthened by an appropriate early warning system; in turn, the in-flight refueling capability makes it possible for aircrafts to increase
their operating range and results in a greater
capability to influence a geographical area.

The Air Force is also an efficient instrument
in times of crisis, because of its firepower, response capability, speed, mobility, flexibility, range and precision in attacking enemy
targets.

**_d) Deterrence Effect_**
The dissuasive capability of the air combat
arm is based on the following characteristics,
among others:

!Quick preventive or reaction deployment
!Ability to attack targets specified by the
Executive wherever they are located, with
precision, firepower, speed and timing.
!It may be used independently for strategic operations, but is tremendously adaptable for use in joint theaters of operations.

**2.6. Support Organizations**

**_a) General Office of Civil Aeronautics_**
**_(DGAC)_**
This is a State agency that reports directly to
the Commander in Chief of the Air Force.
According to national legislation and international law, its mission is to aid and protect
air navigation in an air space whose longitudinal axis runs down to the South Pole and
whose transverse axis runs more than 5000
kilometers into the Pacific Ocean from
Chile’s coastline, to Meridian 131 West.

If there are any illegal flights into sovereign
air space, the DGAC and Air Force act in coordination to identify and control the event.
For that, they adhere to the rules and regulations of the Air Regulations and the principles of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.[33] The same coordination applies to

###### ✪

**34 For further details, see Part III, Chapter IV.**


-----

search and rescue activities, an example of
which is the mutual use of the worldwide
COSPAS-SARSAT satellite network. With regard to these satellite technologies, the
DGAC has developed programs aimed at incorporating new concepts of navigation and
air-traffic control by means of satellites,
which will enable airplanes over-flying our
air space to do so quickly, efficiently and
safely.

**_b) Chilean Meteorological Service_**
This organization is responsible for directing, controlling and maintaining the country’s weather service so as to meet weather
forecasting and information needs. It is also
responsible for coordinating these aspects
with other national and international agencies.

**_c) Aerophotogrammetric Service (SAF)_**
This is an executive technical unit, whose
mission is to meet institutional needs in
terms of aerophotogrammetry and related
techniques, instruct and train personnel in
these techniques and undertake air exploration in search of natural resources within
the country’s territory, to the benefit of development projects implemented by other
public agencies or private parties who request the service.

**_d)_** **_National_** **_Aeronautical_** **_Enterprise_**
**_(ENAER)_**
The National Aeronautical Enterprise
(ENAER) is an autonomous State-owned
company whose board of directors is chaired
by the Commander in Chief of the Air Force.
It engages in building, repairing and modifying airplanes and aeronautical parts and
components.[34]

###### 3. STRATEGIC VISION

The Chilean Air Force exists to defend the country and is essential for the country’s national security.

In general terms, the Air Force aims to optimize
its capabilities during this ten-year period, to
successfully defend Chile’s sovereign air space,
operate in any scenario and operate in conjunc
###### ✪

**33 See Part III, Chapter II.**


tion with other air forces with a view to support.
Chile’s State policy of collaborating in building
world peace.

As part of the Air Force’s vision, the concept of
unity of war is central to the institution’s growth.
In this regard, the decision to equip the Air Force
with modern resources of combat presupposes
conceiving a strategic solution in a manner that
projects beyond the air sphere.

An evaluation of the institution’s capabilities and
limitations has led to an effort to rationalize the
common activities of the Armed Forces. In light
of this, the Air Force and other services have
steered execution of various activities towards
the particular service, which has developed
greater and better capabilities for carrying out a
particular task. For example, training of Rangers
and Special Forces has been assigned to the
Army and Navy, while missile maintenance has
been channeled to the Navy. Service’s aims are
also geared towards searching for different instances for joint action in operational and logistical areas and in others of mutual interest.

**3.1. Scopes of Action of the Air Force**

In fulfilling its mission, the Air Force acts in
three major scenarios – National, for preparing
and making ready its capabilities; Regional, for
coping with possible conflicts arising in the area;
and Worldwide, as part of multinational forces or
forming part of aeronautical technical plans and
cooperation between Air Forces. Likewise, it contributes significantly to the country’s development and cooperates with the activity of the
State in promoting national interests in international spheres.

**_a) Defense Sphere_**
The Air Force has planned building a modern, technologically advanced force capable
of credible deterrence that can be used either on its own in air battles or in conjunction with the Army and Navy in accomplishing a war’s strategic objective.

**_b) Development Sphere_**
The Air Force seeks to get close to the community of which it is a part. This effort is not
only related to defense of the population, but
also to putting its capabilities at the disposal
of the country’s development, since the
characteristics of the Air Force’s resources
means that they can play a dual role. The
work of agencies such as the Aeropho

-----

togrammetric Service, the Meteorological
Service and the Air Rescue Service are
prominent in this effort.

The resources at the Air Force’s disposal link
the furthest points of the country’s territory
(such as Easter Island and Chilean Antarctica) and its most isolated zones (such as Campo de Hielos Sur) with its central areas
quickly and efficiently.

**_c) International Sphere_**
The Air Force’s range, speed and flexibility
make it an ideal instrument for supporting
the country’s interests in international
spheres. The Institution is developing its resources to reinforce its ability to cooperate
with its neighbors, and at regional and world
levels, as part of multinational forces in
peacekeeping operations, undertaking actions of a humanitarian nature and forming
part of aeronautical technical plans and cooperation between Air Forces.

Currently, air combat resources on international missions resulting from resolutions
passed by the UN Security Council tend to be
used in conjunction or in combination with
friendly Air Forces. Hence the need to have
interoperable weapons systems.

Furthermore, in addition to their possibility
of rapid deployment in various scenarios,
the above capabilities make the Air Force a
valuable element available to the President
of the Republic for handling any crisis, allowing him to control its permanence and
operation and graduate its use.

###### 4. THE MODERNIZATION PROCESS

The institution’s modernization process seeks to
build a modern, powerful Air Force to meet the
demands that this concept and its specific strategy make upon the country. Two essential factors
need to be combined in order to keep the Air
Force’s strength current. These are technological
evolution and financial resources.

Technological innovation requires periodic modification and ultimately replacement of air materials. The financial resources required to do so
must be shared with the other needs of society,
so replacing combat aircraft is based on completion of its life cycle, staggering these replacements over the years. This procedure seeks to


prevent two or more weapons systems from becoming obsolete at the same time in a given period, a circumstance that, in addition to adversely affecting the Air Force’s combat capabilities,
would also place a heavy financial burden on the
country’s resources by having to cope with replacing two or more systems simultaneously
during the same period.

A modern platform has a high degree of availability because technology makes for lower operating costs, increases the length of time between breakdowns and has more efficient pieces
of equipment that range from large capacity engines to structures made of compound materials
that suffer less fatigue and deformations.

Together with the above, the Air Force’s modernization process must enable it to be prepared to
cope with conventional and non-conventional
threats in accordance with its assigned mission.

In order to fulfill its declared aims, the institution’s modernization process is geared towards
achieving the following objectives:

**_a) Structure a force that meets the require-_**
ments of modern warfare and efficiently
supports National Defense Policy.
**_b) Develop and consolidate capabilities to_**
achieve better integration with multinational
forces designed to make and keep the peace.
**_c) Modernize and adapt systems of adminis-_**
tration, logistics, personnel and finances, so
that they expedite management with a view
to achieving better training of the force.
**_d) Strengthen the institution’s organizational_**
culture, so as to give each of its members a
sense of belonging and of adhering to the Air
Force’s basic values.
**_e) Structure a system of full education,_**
which duly provides the institution with the
personnel that it needs, in terms of both
quality and quantity, and that is compatible
with the level of modernization of its operational systems.


###### 5. PLANNING

The Institution’s modernization plans are drawn
from the Chilean Air Force’s Objectives Plan for
this ten-year period, called “Bicentenary.” This
plan sets the objectives and capabilities that
must be achieved in each area in order to implement the institution’s strategic vision and be constantly prepared and ready to perform its perma

-----

nent mission and missions of international cooperation as determined by the State.

The Objectives Plan is based on the vision of the
Air Force as an expression of the State in the national air space. It stipulates that the Air Force,
as a permanent institution of the Republic, is
geared towards cooperating for the common
good. The level of operational capability that the
Air Force seeks to acquire through the “Bicentenary” plan helps strengthen the security that society needs for its development. This is because
that level of operational capability is a dissuasive
capability, which has a decisive influence on
maintaining the peace, which is the country’s ultimate aim.

###### 6. WOMEN IN THE AIR FORCE

In 2000, the Air Force provided for women to enter the “Capitán Manuel Ávalos Prado” Air Force
Academy as cadets and, therefore, with the possibility of graduating as officers in the Chilean
Air Force.

Women go through the same application and admission process for the Academy as the men,


and, once admitted, they may apply to the ranks
of War Pilot, Aeronautical Engineer, Air Defense
and Administration without any restrictions.

From the moment they begin their career in the
Air Force Academy, they are required to meet
the same level of demands as the men in air, military and academic spheres. The level of requirement in physical-sports spheres has been
made the same for both genders. In short,
women have been fully integrated into military
activities.

The Air Force considers that incorporating
women into the Institution strengthens its human resources in such a way that the whole of
the institution’s personnel contribute to the
country’s defense and development.

To the extent that women fulfill the same duties
as their male companions in general missions,
institutional plans consider their full incorporation into combat branches.

## 4. The Professional Education Process in the Armed Forces

###### Given the nature of the Armed Forces

 and their missions, which even put the

 lives of their members at risk if

 required, the military profession is

 essentially vocational in nature. This

 makes the education and training of

 the members of the Armed Forces

 unique and means that they can only

 enter the military profession via the

 Armed Forces’ Academies.


###### 1. TRAINING MILITARY PERSONNEL

The National Defense Institutions choose their
personnel from among the voluntary applications of thousands of young men and women
who apply each year to the various academies
for officers and non-commissioned officers to
start their professional careers at an early age.
This makes for a homogenous body of officers
and non-commissioned officers who have the
necessary virtues and character for the profession of arms that they have chosen.

The academies’ varied curriculum includes all
military subjects and special areas of expertise, as
well as subjects from other spheres, that are
needed to provide the necessary basis to form the
scientific, technical and humanities foundation
required by all military professionals. Thus, according to the Constitutional Organic Law on Education, the Armed Forces’ educational institutions are empowered by law to award diplomas
for special fields of study, diplomas in professional and technical fields and academic degrees.


sources and the particular capabilities of each institution, specialization courses common to the
Armed Forces have been taught jointly, according to each one’s particular area of expertise. For
example, Ranger and Parachutist courses for personnel from the three services are taught at the
Army’s Airborne and Special Forces School; instrument navigation courses and other aviationrelated courses are taught by the Air Force, while
those related to diving, rescue operations and
other specific activities on or under sea are
taught by the Navy.

###### 2. CHILEAN ARMY

**2.1. Officers**

Officer training is a constant, progressive process
that starts at the Military Academy and continues throughout the officer’s professional career
with academic and training requirements that
enable an officer to perform in different areas.
Officers must acquire their knowledge and prac

-----

stitutional centers and in other national and international centers, which may or may not be
military in nature.

The complete process involves a basic training
cycle, a specialist training cycle and an advanced
training cycle.

**_a) Basic Training_**
The Military Academy provides future officers
with military abilities associated with leadership, platoon level command abilities, use and
command of weapons systems and management. It also trains them in complementary
abilities based on arts, science and technology,
so that they can link it in relation to a branch,
service or special area of expertise.

Training future officers is basically geared towards strengthening their preparation in military spheres. This involves four years of professional training that, in addition to making
them army officers, means that they graduate
with a bachelor degree in Military Science.

**_b) Technical and Professional Training_**
In this field, officers are trained to exercise
command of Tactical Units from the different branches or support services, according
to the different degrees of specialization required for proper tactical and technical use
of the resources provided. This area includes
the basic and advance courses for junior officers. Similarly, officers are trained to perform in special areas of combat that cover institutional needs, such as special forces,
rangers, paratroopers, military pilots, mountain warfare instructors, divers, specialists in
electronic warfare, as well as other supplementary special areas of expertise such as
horseback riding instructors, college professors, language interpreters, physical education instructors, among others.

In order to complete this training, the Army
has academic and training infrastructure in
its own facilities and also takes advantage of
international agreements with Armies
around the world.

**_c) Advanced Training_**
This takes place in the War and Military Polytechnic Colleges. The former trains general
staff officers and the latter military polytechnic engineering officers. According to the Basic Law on Education, both are the primary
military education institutions that meet


education. Consequently, they undertake
teaching, research and extension tasks. According to annual planning, they program
under and post graduates courses and award
degrees in military science and build graduate programs in various military science disciplines designed to accomplish the institution’s educational goals. Civilian students,
and others from abroad, also participate. In
turn, the Academies are entrusted with training the professors required to cover the
teaching demands of each of the institutes.

Supplementary to the training described
above, officers take courses and specialize in
areas with a view to obtaining graduate degrees, such as an MA or a PhD in specific areas, from universities and higher education
centers in Chile and abroad.

**2.2. Enlisted Personnel**

As with the officers, training the NCOs is a continuous, progressive process that starts in the
Non-Commissioned Officers Academy and continues throughout the NCO’s professional career,
with academic requirements and specific training,
so that they can perform in the branches or support services to which they belong. As part of
their professional possibilities, the Institution also
gives them the chance to join the ranks of officer.

**_a) Basic Training_**
The Non-Commissioned Officers Academy
provides the basic training for future NCOs in
a two-year period of study. During that time,
future NCOs acquire the technical and professional knowledge required to perform in
the Army’s various units and organizations.

**_b) Technical and Professional Training_**
This process provides Enlisted men with the
technical and tactical training required to be
promoted to higher ranks as NCO’s according to institutional needs, until they reach
the rank of Sergeant Major.

They may also specialize in higher technical
fields, in either combat or teaching. These
include physical education instructors, intelligence specialists, mountaineering instructors, aircraft observers, electronic warfare,
rangers, paratroopers, Special Forces and
divers. They can also apply at the same time
for diplomas as gunsmiths, weapons systems
maintenance mechanics, engine mechanics,
electronic technicians, musicians, black

-----

###### 3. CHILEAN NAVY

**3.1. Officers**

Through the Navy’s Board of Education, the General Personnel Board is responsible for training
seamen. This process includes everything from
selecting applicants for a career in the Navy to
providing the fleet with men who are morally
and professionally suited for fighting at sea, and
able to operate high technology materials and
weapons.

**_a) Basic Training_**
The basic training process starts in the Naval
Academy, where, in addition to doctrinal,
naval and military teaching, officers are also
trained in engineering, which is then completed in the Naval Polytechnic College,.

The Naval Academy in Valparaíso trains future officers in a four-year program, from
which students graduate as midshipmen.

**_b) Advanced Training_**
After graduating from he Naval Academy, officers attend the Naval Polytechnic College,
from which they graduate with a degree in
Engineering after 6 years of higher education. The Naval Polytechnic College, teaches
the technological knowledge required for operating, maintaining and administrating the
Navy’s resources.

The Naval Polytechnic College, is made up of
the Schools of Engineering, Operations, Armaments, Supplies, Naval Aviation, Submarines, Marine Corps, Health and Coast
and Lighthouses.

**_c) Graduate Training_**
Prior to entering the Naval War College
(AGN), officers take correspondence courses
for two years and then attend the College in
person for one year. After studies at the
AGN, plus complementary graduate courses
for at least a semester, and submission of a
thesis, officers are awarded a Master’s degree
in Naval and Maritime Science, with different special fields of study.

This College’s activities focus on training
mid level officers to perform at higher command levels as well as prepare them as General Staff specialists.


**3.2. Enlisted Personnel**

Seamen enter basic training establishments,
which train them to perform the institution’s typical operational and administrative duties.

**_a) Basic Training_**
The Navy has two schools for training its seamen, depending on their future specialization. The Sailor School on Quiriquina Island
off the port of Talca-huano trains sailors and
marines; they graduate as seamen after two
years.

The School of Naval Craftsmen in Talcahuano
also trains naval technicians in a three-year
program that trains them to work in shipyards and land-based support facilities.

**_b) Technical and Professional Training_**
As with the officers, after a few years of practical application aboard or in one of the
Navy’s facilities, seamen enter the various
Specialization Schools under the Naval Polytechnic College, where they receive additional teaching regarding their special fields of expertise and various technological fields. This
broadens their range of knowledge and gives
them greater mastery in using and maintaining the resources under their care, whether
on board ship or in land-based naval facilities.

Similarly, they are given the necessary training to assume new responsibilities and continue to advance in their professional careers,
which culminate as Master Chief Petty Officers.

###### 4. CHILEAN AIR FORCE

**4.1. Officers**

Training officers is a constant, progressive
process that begins in the Air Force Academy
and continues throughout their professional careers, with academic and training requirements
that enable them to perform in various positions,
both as pilots and in ground support activities.
Officers must acquire knowledge and practical
experience in specific fields in both institutional
and other national or international educational
centers, which may or may not be military.

As with their fellow military, the process includes a basic training cycle, a specialist training
cycle and an advanced training cycle.


-----

**_a) Basic Training_**
Cadets enter the Air Force Academy after
completing higfh school. There, they begin a
full training program in the various fields, either in air or ground based branches of the
Air Force. The cadets graduate with a BA in
Social Sciences.

**_b) Technical and Professional Training_**
Upon graduating as second lieutenants, officers in the air branch continue their pilot
training in the Instrument Flying School in
Puerto Montt and the Tactical School headquartered in Iquique, where they fly combat
jets. Officers in ground-based branches continue their studies in the Aeronautical Polytechnic College and the Anti-aircraft Artillery Tactical School. Upon completion of
their studies, they receive a degree in Aeronautical Engineering, management, communications, electronics or anti-aircraft artillery, as applicable.

Once they complete this cycle, officers are assigned to Air Force units throughout the country.
Upon completing their course in the Tactical
School, air-branch officers are selected as fighter
pilots, transport pilots or helicopter pilots, and are
awarded the title of War Pilot. Officers in landbased branches are awarded a professional degree
depending on the specific course attended.

At various stages of their careers, officers must
take specialization courses within the Institution
or in establishments outside the Air Force.

**_c) Advanced Training_**
In addition to these courses, officers are
called to the Air Force War College, where
they take courses that are both a requirement and preparation for being initially command advisors and then tactical unit commanders. As part of this process, they participate in a joint course with students from the
Army’s and Navy’s War Colleges.

They then continue their advanced training
attending courses that train them to exercise
higher levels of leadership in the Institution,
as air force colonels. These courses are taken
both in the Institution and in national and foreign universities, and officers can apply for
graduate degrees, such as an MA or a PhD.

**4.2. Enlisted Personnel**

The Institution's Enlisted staff is divided into two


sonnel. Line personnel enter the Chilean Air
Force by applying and being selected by the Specialization School. Service personnel are those
who have completed the Basic Aero- military
Course in the Specialization School and have a
previously acquired special area of expertise.

**_a) Basic Training_**
People enter the Specialization School,
where Line personnel are trained, once they
have completed their high school education.
Studies comprise a two-year long full training program, from which they graduate as air
force corporals, and ready to begin practical
training in the Institution’s units in various
areas of specialization, depending on the Air
Force’s requirements.

In order to enter the Air Force Services’
branches, applicants have to pass the basic
Aero-military Course in the Specialization
School, from which they graduate as corporals. During their careers, these corporals are
put through the same on-the-job training
process as line personnel, in order to acquire
the various levels of efficiency required by
the Air Force.

**_b) Technical and Professional Training_**
During their careers, personnel must undergo various training processes in their special
area of expertise. After passing these, they
become senior grade technicians, which is
also required for future promotion.

Once they have been promoted to sergeant
second class, they must take a supervisor
course and/or an additional specialization
course in their particular area of expertise at
the Non-Commissioned Officer Advanced
Training School (E.P.S.), polytechnic colleges
or universities in the Metropolitan Region or
other regions of the country. Passing the
course means that they have achieved the
maximum level of technical and practical efficiency and that they are professionally
qualified to be promoted to Staff Sergeant.

Finally, they take the course for promotion
to Chief Master Sergeant, to allow them to
reach to the top rank in their career. Besides
to passing this course, the Special Board of
Selection must approve them for promotion.
They are now trained to manage military affairs at an intermediate level.

## PART VI
 Defense Resources


###### Defense is a public asset that must be financed by the State, first, because it performs a basic social function for the existence of society and, second, because it is an asset that cannot be supplied by the market. Market supply mechanisms do not have a practical application in the case of Defense, because, as opposed to what occurs with other goods, there is no competition in the demand for Defense services– everybody receives defense equally– and no one can acquire Defense services for themselves exclusively to the detriment of others.

 Defense resources come from the State, either through direct allocation from the public treasury or from funds generated by CODELCO through mechanisms established in what is known as the Copper’s Reserved Law.


###### The State obtains these resources from society’s economic capacity, in order to finance, not only the Defense function, but also all the activities entrusted to it. To ensure judicious management, the State has at its disposal a series of budget and evaluation systems to select the activities to be financed according to technical criteria that serve as the basis for political decisions and allow the max- imum social benefit.

 These characteristics make Defense a purely social asset, and it is the State that decides how and how much of this socially required public good to produce and, on that basis, allocates the resources using the mechanisms available.


-----

## 1. Analysis of Defense Spending

###### Knowing how much it costs the State

 to finance Defense and how the allo
 cated resources are used requires, first,

 a determination of what constitutes

 Defense, because the Armed Forces

 also contribute to development.

 Secondly, it means taking into account

 that military spending includes some

 expenditures that are social in nature,

 and, thirdly, it means considering that

 the Armed Forces perform some activi
 ties that provide a service for third

 parties and are financed by the fees

 charged.


###### 1. DEFENSE SPENDING AND ITS RELATION TO OTHER MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES

It is no easy task to determine how much Defense is necessary (the demand for Defense) in
either theoretical or practical terms, as the social
demand for Defense is determined by specific
factors such as the Gross Domestic Product and
appraisal of threats perceived by the country, independent from other considerations, such as
medium and long term Treasury policy.[35]

**1.1. The Incidence of the Gross Domestic**
**Product (GDP)**

The best way of measuring a country’s financial

###### ✪

**35 There are econometric formulae that could be used to calculate**
the demand for defense, but such an analysis goes beyond the aims
of this study.


effort to provide suitable Defense is through the
ratio of Defense spending to GDP. This ratio may
be high in countries fighting a foreign war or suffering from internal conflict, and practically nil
in countries that have handed over protection of
their sovereignty to foreign powers or international alliances. For a country such as Chile, this
ratio expresses the percentage of economic capacity allocated to give credibility to its defense
policy.

Figure 23 shows the evolution of Defense spending as a percentage of GDP since 1963, in which
several stages are evident.

The first stage consisted of a relative decline in
spending until 1969. The second was a rise between 1973 and 1976 as a result of external
crises. In the next few years it remained high, although declining slightly, as a result of the economic growth from 1977 to 1981 and because
spending was kept at the same or slightly declining levels. During the period from 1981 to 1983,
this ratio underwent an upturn due to the sharp


-----

**FIGURE 23**


drop in GDP during those years. Subsequently,
when Defense spending remained relatively
constant in an economy that was once again in
an upturn, there was a slow decline with ups and
downs caused by variations in the price of copper. The ratio has become increasingly lower until it has reached its current values, which are the
result of an economy that is growing faster than
Defense spending.

Figure 24 shows the evolution of fiscal resources
allocated to defense in the period from 1989 to


2001. The lower curve shows the evolution of the
respective annual budget allocations. Prices in
dollars are converted into pesos at the average
exchange rate for the year in question, and
prices in pesos are cumulative and then adjusted
by the rate of inflation in each year. This curve
shows a tendency to lower growth, almost stagnation, until 1995; then a significant increase between 1995 and 1997, due to a special salary adjustment for personnel –the health law in 1996
and the new Personnel Statute or DFL-1 (G) in
1997– followed by another increase as the result


**FIGURE 24**


-----

of a special allocation in 1999.

Treasury allocations were augmented by revenue from the Copper’s Reserved Law. The law
states that these funds must be allocated exclusively to purchasing military equipment and
weapons systems. The upper curve in Figure 24
shows the total of both allocations to Defense between 1989 and 2001. This curve shows a relatively downward trend in revenue from the Copper’s Reserved Law, due to the ups and downs
caused by the variable price of copper. It is also
evident that the level of total contributions to Defense dropped from 1989 to 1993, in real terms,
at which time it reached its lowest point. The
level of spending did not recover in real terms
until 2000, as a result of an increase in spending
on personnel.

**1.2. Level of Perceived Threats**

In financial terms, this variable is measured by
published information on Defense spending by
other States. This figure must be corrected to account for exchange rate differentials and differences in the internal prices of some critical factors such as personnel wages.[36]

When our Defense spending is analyzed in relation to the GDP, the resulting percentage should
show the impact of perceived threats. This is
shown in Figure 23, which shows this ratio over
the past 38 years. The graph shows that the ratio
has tended to remain at around 1.8% per year
over the last few years, which is closely related
to a diminished threat perception and to the fact
that an equivalent level of Defense must accompany growth in GDP.

Moreover, the absolute level of spending, which
is illustrated in Figure 24, has tended to increase
in spite of fluctuations in the price of copper reflected in variations in the revenue from the
Copper’s Reserved Law. This increase in the absolute level of spending is related both to the increase in GDP and to the effects of internal
prices of some production factors (wages) as a result of that same GDP growth.

###### ✪

**36 It must be noted that this factor must not be measured linearly,**
since it has significant gaps. In the short term, however, one can assume that its behavior is linear.


###### 2. DEFENSE AND FISCAL EXPENDITURES

An analysis of how much fiscal spending is allocated to Defense (Figure 25) yields a pattern similar to that for the Defense spending/GDP ratio
(Figure 23) between 1963 and 2001, except that
this ratio increases during that period, because of
a drop in fiscal spending between 1985 and 1990.
It turns down again in 1991 when GDP grows and
the share of fiscal spending in GDP rises.

Two high points can be observed in this distribution: the highest in 1975 (when it was almost one
quarter of fiscal spending) and 1989, when, in
addition to the effect mentioned above, when
there were very high revenues from the Copper’s
Reserved Law. The ration of Defense to Fiscal
spending has tended to stabilize at 8% or 9%
over the past decade, which is close to, but slightly lower than the ratio that existed until 1973,
when it fluctuated between 8.5% and 12%.

Figure 25 shows that the portion of Fiscal Spending allocated to Defense, including the yield
from the Copper’s Reserved Law, depends on
changes in Treasury policy. These changes modify total fiscal spending and therefore alter the
portion allocated to defense spending. Defense
spending also changes according to other variables, which add to or subtract from the effect of
fiscal policy. One of these variables is the strategic situation of the international arena, which
means that fiscal policy only has a relative importance in determining defense expenditures
over the long term.

The above can be clearly seen in the period from
1970 to 1976, in which the ratio of Defense
spending to GDP rose from 2.4% to 3.6% between 1970 and 1973, while, in the same period,
it dropped from 10.5% to 8.5% in relation to fiscal spending as a result of increased fiscal spending. Then, from 1973 to 1976, the two ratios increased, with the rise in the fiscal spending ratio
being much higher (since in the period in question fiscal spending remained the same, or
dropped, as a result of restrictive economic policies, while Defense spending rose in light of perceived foreign threats during that period).

###### 3. DEFENSE DEMAND, GDP AND PERCEIVED THREATS: THEIR EFFECTS

The ratio described above has two effects that
show the correspondence between its elements.
First of all, Defense spending resulting from a


-----

**FIGURE 25**


demand arising from a perceived threat may not
exceed a certain limit, which may be expressed
as a percentage of GDP. This limit may not be exceeded without adversely affecting the country’s
development capacity.

Secondly, an erroneous evaluation of a threat
could produce an increase in the demand for Defense and its associated increase in spending to
meet it beyond a given limit. In turn, if this increase is perceived as a threat by another country, it could lead to what is called an “arms race”,
where each country involved responds to threats
perceived as a result of increased spending on
Defense by its possible rivals with more increases.

The independence of the demand for Defense in
relation to fiscal spending does not mean that
–from the perspective of Defense production–
government policies geared towards modernizing public management, including budget practices, do not have an effect on Defense spending.
Government policies can have an effect by ensuring that public resources are used more efficiently and by meeting the demand for Defense
in the most economical way possible in absolute
terms and in relation to GDP.

###### 4. THE ARMED FORCES AS A PURCHASING POWER

The Armed Forces acquire most of what they
need to operate in the country, except for what is
not available on the domestic market or the procurement of which is not economically viable.
This policy is being reinforced by instructions
from the Commanders in Chief and changes in


the tax regulations governing the Armed Forces,
especially with regards to importing military
equipment. This will mean that procurements
will be geared even more to the domestic market.

From the point of view of the country’s economy
as a whole, the importance of Armed Forces procurement lies primarily in its contribution to certain local economies and some specific sectors of
production. Within the latter, the positive effect
is a result of introducing standards of quality that
guarantee suitable goods and services. This requires the incorporation of production and quality control technologies that will remain available for domestic production of goods and services not strictly designed for National Defense.
Weapons and systems maintenance contracts
may be even more important, as they will get domestic suppliers involved in learning about complex processes and techniques.

## 2. The Defense Budget

###### The budgetary system must consider

 the difficulties in the efficient use of

 the resources, such as the limited flexi
 bility of the human resources in the

 short term and the long period of evo
 lution necessary for the procurement

 and full operation capability of the

 means. In Defense, an adequate assess
 ment system and the budget have fea
 tures that require sophisticated and

 controlled methods that respond to the

 Defense Policy definitions.


###### 1. THE BUDGET STRUCTURE OF THE MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

The budget structure corresponding to the Ministry of National Defense is organized into chapters by undersecretaries, which include the
Armed Forces budget.[37] The Nation’s General
Budget provides in each of the above mentioned
chapters, for supplementary programs, such as
the healthcare budget and other supporting
agencies that administer separate budgets with
specific purposes and income from different
sources. There are also areas for the General Services and Directorates that, with regards to the
budget, are closely related to the Ministry.

Figure 26 describes the ministerial organization
for budgetary purposes and shows the reporting

###### ✪

**37 For defense budget purposes, the Offices of the Undersecretary**
of Police and Investigations are not considered.


relationship of the aforementioned agencies.
The first type of agency consists of the Offices of
the Undersecretaries and the Armed Forces’
services, which are solely financed by fiscal revenue and which transfer funds to finance other
programs of the defense function. The second
type of agency consists of entities reporting directly to the Offices of the Undersecretaries and
correspond to programs developed by Armed
Forces organizations that render services to third
parties and are financed by funds they collect
(their own income) and include the Armed
Forces' health services, or other services provided to civil society, such as DIRECTEMAR or
DGAC. Institutions in the defense sector that
represent separate budgetary areas and, for these
purposes, are coordinated with the Ministry
through the Offices of the Undersecretaries comprise the third type. These agencies are funded
with resources generated by the services they
provide, in some cases, supplemented by fiscal
contributions (IGM, SHOA and SAF).

From the budgetary viewpoint, it should be not

-----

**FIGURE 26**

ed that the National Defense’s Social Security
Funds (CAPREDENA) are not part of the Ministry of National Defense, but of the Ministry of
Labor and Social Security. Additionally, since the
Armed Forces get part of their financing directly
through the Copper’s Reserved Law,[38] it should
be mentioned that those resources are not included in the Ministry’s budget nor are they
recorded in the public accounting, and their
scheduling and control system is subject to a different regulation.

###### 2. BUDGET PROCEDURES AND THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES

The Nation’s General Budget is the State’s central
tool for allocating public resources. Its definition
takes into account all the policies that are technically and economically feasible, so that the set
of economic and financial capabilities established by the treasury policy can also fund those
given priority by the political authority. The
President of the Republic is the authority responsible for preparing the Budget, which must
be approved through legislation, enacted by the
National Congress and shall be in effect for an
annual budgetary period.


###### ✪

**38 For further information on this issue, refer to Part VI, Chapter 4.**


The Ministry of National Defense coordinates
and manages the fiscal and budgetary policy implementation within the defense sector, and is
responsible for submitting the budgets for the
required administrative and legislative processing. As regards each of the Armed Forces and
other entities reporting to them, the ministerial
agency responsible for submission of the budgets
is the Office of the respective Undersecretary,
where the Undersecretary must participate in
the budget preparation and report on the budgetary execution progress to the General Comptrollership of the Republic and the Budget Directorate of the Ministry of Finance.

Regarding the Armed Forces’ budgetary management, the Commanders in Chief are responsible
for the budgetary formulation and execution for
the different programs in accordance with their
Constitutional Organic Law. The organizational
structure of every service includes the agencies
in charge of preparing the corresponding budget
and ensuring its execution and control.

The Armed Forces are equipped with different
management planning, budget development, financial execution, and evaluation systems.
These systems fall under the general regulations
governing the financial management of the State
and subordinate agencies and, like all other public administration agencies, subject to administrative and accounting control by the General
Comptrollership of the Republic and budgetary


-----

control by the Office of the Budget.

The purpose of this resource allocation system is
to coordinate the different defense sector priorities and incorporate them into the nation’s General Budget. In this process, the defense priorities will be assessed based on their technical,
economic and political features, and reconciled
with the priorities of the other State sectors.
Within this general scheme, the Ministry of Finance has established a system of competitive
projects that provides resources apart from the
requirements established by the law. Since its
creation, this system has allocated a significant
percentage of its available resources to annual
projects that do not involve ongoing spending
over time.

###### 3. MODERNIZATION OF THE BUDGET SYSTEMS

Appropriate budget restructuring for each service of the Armed Forces or agency of the defense
sector is a fundamental part of a planning system providing for the allocation of resources to
the defined activities to achieve the institutional
goals, which, in turn, reflect the general goals of
National Defense.

Chile’s State administration is undergoing a modernization of its public administration that also
covers the budgetary and resources allocation
processes for the different activities involving
public policies. This modernization emphasizes
management control, transparency in the use of


public resources and improvement in the management of allocated resources. It has also meant
increased involvement of the National Congress
in both the allocation of resources in the budget
and in the control of the execution of specific
programs.

Within this general process, the Defense sector
and the Armed Forces have achieved important
progress in the context of their own restructuring processes int his area. The Armed Forces
have designed and implemented management
planning, budget and control systems in line
with the specific features of each service, which
are currently in different stages of development.

###### 4. THE BUDGETS OF THE ARMED FORCES: DISTRIBUTION AND COMPOSITION

The Constitutional Organic Law for the Armed
Forces establishes minimum values for the different allocations provided in each budgetary fiscal year. These minimum values were established based on the 1989 budget, which states
that the allocation for payroll in Chilean currency must be adjusted, as a minimum, in accordance with the general adjustments for the public sector and the allocation for the remaining national currency expenditures must be adjusted in
accordance with the change in the CPI between
1989 and the current year.

Figure 27 illustrates the evolution of these allocations between 1990 and 2002 separately and
shows that both experienced an increase of 28%


**FIGURE 27**


-----

**FIGURE 28**


for “other” and 40% for “personnel”.

By law, foreign currency allocations may not be
lower than the established in 1989 without establishing any adjustability mechanism.

The annual allocation in nominal dollars between 1990 and 2002, illustrated in Figure 28,
shows a 25% increase in that period.

Figure 29 displays the distribution of fiscal
spending on Defense, including the Copper Law,
for each service of the Armed Forces over the
four (4) years that mark the trend.


Until 1975, the Navy was the institution receiving the highest allocation, because its operating
and equipment costs were higher, followed by
the Army. During 1974 and 1975, this ratio
changed due to the expenses derived from the increase in the Army staffing, a process that made
it the institution with the highest use of resources by the end of 1976. Likewise, the amendment to the Copper’s Reserved Law, the revenue
from which had been distributed equally among
the three services since 1975, now gave the
Army a larger share in these funds. This distribution stabilized in the 80’s and continued without significant variation over the last decade, in


**FIGURE 29**


-----

the proportion of 42/34/24 for the Army, Navy,
and Air Force, respectively.

Defense spending is distributed over five (5) general areas: Personnel, Operations, Equipment,
Infrastructure, and Research and Development.
Although the budgetary expenditures may be divided into these categories, the expenditures financed with funds from the Copper’s Reserved
Law may not be separated in that way. They include operating, military infrastructure construction, and equipment and associated financial expenditures. Even so, given the fact that the most
important component of this spending has been
the procurement of military equipment, the total
funds from this source are classified as Ordnance. Research and Development is a special
case; it is not separated in the public accounts,
but is incorporated in the other expenses. Figure
30 shows the spending distribution based on
these criteria for the years 1994 and 2001.

Figure 30 illustrates the relative increase in the
Personnel heading and the relative decrease in
the Operation and Infrastructure headings,
which is explained by the real increases in payroll, which was proportionally greater than the
increases in the remaining operating expenses.
This increased spending on payroll must be understood in the context of the increase –up to
1999– in general income levels experienced
throughout the country.

In general, the Chilean Armed Forces are operating equipment that is in the final stages of their
useful life, so they have a comparatively high
maintenance cost. With the operating spending
showing a moderate increase, the emphasis has
been put on maintaining the operating capabilities of the forces. It should be considered that the
process of modernization and replacement of the
equipment acquired between 1970 and 1980,
most with a long operating life at the time of procurement, started in 1997 with the purchase of
new submarines and overhauled, second-hand
combat ships. This factor has been critical in the
planning of the modernization of the forces and
the renewal of the weapons systems of the three
services of the Armed Forces.
Spending on military infrastructure is low and
reflects that there have been no substantial
changes in the distribution and number of units
and that the military has been using and repairing its existing infrastructure. The Armed Forces
modernization projects, both through the replacement of the equipment at the end of its useful life and the restructuring of the forces will


**FIGURE 30**


lead to an increase in this item during the next
year. This effort will be largely funded by the
consolidation of the existing infrastructure.

**4.1. Allocations by Use**

The treasury allocation to the Defense is given
with specific purposes derived from the budget
methodology, which makes it possible to classify
it according to the kind of expenditures to be financed: “Personnel” and “Other” in Chilean currency. The first one corresponds to the contributions to fund the payroll and other personnel expenses; the second is designed to fund the operating and real investment expenditures (basically in infrastructure). The most important purpose of the foreign currency allocation is the financing of other operating expenses, in addition
to financing the military missions abroad, which
manage the procurement of equipment and the
expenditures of the military attaches’ offices.

In addition to the treasury allocations there are
the expenditures funded by the Copper’s Reserved Law, which are designed for the procurement of war material.

Figure 31 shows the evolution of these allocations, showing their distribution in 1990, 1994,
1997 and 2002. The figure also illustrates the


-----

**FIGURE 31** The coming years should see some movement
from “Personnel” to “Other” in Chilean currency
allocations, while the other components should
remain relatively stable.


strong variation on the breakdown of the allocation, in which the personnel heading has increased from 41% in 1990 to 55% in 1997. After
1997 it began to stabilize and then decreased
slightly beginning in 2001 as a result of the retirements aimed at readjusting the personnel organization. This downward trend should increase in the coming years.

The relative effect of the Copper’s Reserved Law
decreased in the same period from 35.5% in 1990
to around 21% in the rest of the period. This variation is consistent with the significant fluctuations in copper revenue, basically due to copper
prices. The other allocations have not changed
significantly and have maintained a relatively
stable share.


**4.2. The Trend in Personnel Expenditures**

Between 1974 and 1981, due to relations with
neighboring countries, the Armed Forces experienced a marked increase in personnel, a process
that had been taking place in the Army since
1972. During the 1980’s, personnel numbers
tended to remain the same, except in the case of
the Air Force, and the Navy in particular, which
shows a downward trend. Figure 32 illustrates
the evolution of the Armed Forces hired personnel.

In general, Armed Forces staffing have experienced two situations associated with and deriving from the number of personnel entering the
services during the 1970’s. The first situation was
the distortion in the personnel hierarchy, caused
by a lower number graduates from the military
academies in the 1980’s and 1990’s. The second
was the “aging of the staff,” a phenomenon that
occurs when the staff has a high average number
of years in service and associated expenses rise.
This situation became evident in 1994, when
personnel benefits for professional training increased.

Added to these two phenomena is the fact that in
the recent years have seen a general remuneration increase above the CPI in the public sector.
Likewise, the hired personnel have received special remuneration increases: during 1996, an adjustment was granted and the Armed Forces’
Health Law was enacted, which considered a rewarding bond for the increased health social security contributions; during 1997, an increase associated to the enactment of the new Armed
Forces’ Personnel Bylaws (War D.L.-1 of 1997)
and during 1999, a non-taxable bond was created,
which meant another remuneration increase.

The described situation shows the challenges
faced by the personnel policies of the sector. To
address them, both the Armed Forces’ modernization processes and the improvement of the resources allocation systems driven by the Ministry consider instruments and goals aimed at
streamlining and improving the human resources management.

## 3. The Defense Procurement System

###### The main component of the procure
 ment system is the Copper’s Reserved

 Law. This law

 was established in 1940 and is

 designed to carry out the process of

 financing, resource distribution, and

 approval, and procurement of the war

 material proposed by the Armed

 Forces. These resources may only be

 used for the procurement of weapons

 systems and their associated military

 equipment .


###### 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM

The allocation of public resources to Defense
takes place through various mechanisms aimed
at funding the different expenditures originated
by Defense. The National Budget is, by definition, the resource allocation mechanism for all
public activities funded with treasury resources,
which provides for the incorporation of all of society’s priorities and for distributing the resources to the activities legitimately established
by the society. Nevertheless, it is natural that the
national budget structuring is the response to political decisions expressed in the budgetary allocations.

Investment needs in the Defense sector have
their own features that differentiate them from
the investments required in other sectors of the
public business. This is the reason why, in general the different states design special systems to
carry out investments in Defense, that is, the
procurement of weapons systems, their associated equipment and the required infrastructure for


their implementation. In our country, this system has been built around the National Defense
Superior Council (CONSUDENA) and the mechanisms established in the “Copper’s Reserved
Law” (Law 13196) of 1958, and its subsequent
modifications.

The Copper’s Reserved Law establishes a 10% tax
on the export value of the copper and its by-products made by the Corporación del Cobre (Codelco). This law also establishes a minimum
amount equivalent to US$ 180,000,000 (one hundred and eighty million US Dollars), adjusted according to the U.S. Wholesale Price Index (WPI)
variation between 1987 and the year in question.
When the 10% tax on Codelco exports don’t cover this value for a specific year, the law states
that the General Treasury of the Republic shall
provide the difference in the corresponding accounts.

This tax is deposited by the Treasury, in equal
parts, into reserved accounts assigned to each of
the Armed Forces institutions. These, in turn,


-----

deposit about 5% into an account managed by
the National Defense Superior Council (CONSUDENA) for joint projects.[39]

###### 2. ECONOMIC ISSUES AND FINANCIAL EFFECTS

This system dates from the 1940’s and has been
modified over time to make it more automatic
and provide an increased flow of resources to Defense due to the progressive increase in the cost
of war material with the constant incorporation
of technology. These modifications have led to
various consequences for the allocation system.

For example, the mechanism helps prevent competition between the services of the Armed
Forces for the resource allocation. Nevertheless,
it does not provide an opportunity for the views
of each service on how to provide Defense –derived from their specific missions– to be combined into an integrated approach to war material and equipment requirements.

Initially, anticipating the need to harmonize
these different service visions, the Legislature
gave CONSUDENA a regulating and coordinating
function. However, subsequent legal modifications delegating powers to the different services
of the Armed Forces and established an automatic allocation and distribution in three equal
parts have weakened these functions.

In terms of economic analysis and management,
the system has also a positive aspect, as it grants
security to the provision of financial resources
for the services. As a result, when the pertinent
executive decrees are issued, the Armed Forces
can commit future resources to fund high-cost
equipment needs requiring multi-annual financial flows.

This provides an important advantage for the appropriate allocation of internal resources, because it enables the establishment of plans that
are funded over time according to minimum
known flows. As long as the financial flows are
secure, it is possible to undertake long-term,

###### ✪

**39 Given the confidential nature of the law, both the value of the**
funds provided to the armed forces and their use are confidential
and the figures shown in Figure 33 here are for reference purposes
only, since they come from Codelco’s balance sheets.


high-cost, evolving projects and define the priorities according to internal technical criteria. This
facilitates the proper equipping of the Armed
Forces without the need to allocate funds from
other sources.

Nevertheless, the system has other effects on the
allocation of resources in the public sector in
general and in the defense sector in particular. In
general, a certain flow of resources is deducted,
making it impossible to assess their allocation
based on the set of priorities that the State must
address. In other words, allocation of these resources according to a specific piece of legislation does not necessarily satisfy the search for
the optimum social or economic benefit. Within
the Defense sector, the fact that these resources
are allocated based on the particular service priorities diminishes the effect on the production of
a more comprehensive Defense.

Furthermore, allocation of the resources in equal
thirds limits the possibility of a financial management that channels the fund flows toward
higher cost projects, which leads to higher debt
levels and financial costs.

The annual fluctuations of the Copper’s Reserved Law revenues are seen in Figure 33,
which shows the transfers to the Armed Forces
from CODELCO. The transfers don’t reflect
spending exactly because there are balances between the different payment dates that can be
passed on from year to year, but these differences disappear over the medium term. (See Figure 33)

###### 3. THE MANAGEMENT CONTROL SYSTEM

A review of the military equipment procurement
process as a whole reveals that there are three
controlling agencies in the development of any
related project: the General Comptrollership of
the Republic and the CONSUDENA, on the one
hand, and the internal Comptrollership and Inspection Offices of the Armed Forces, on the
other.

Since the formulation of a procurement project
is part of an internal process, in this initial stage,
control is exercised by the agencies and offices of
each service. On the other hand, the external
agencies control the operation once the project
has been formulated and submitted for approval.

The CONSUDENA must record and control that


-----

**FIGURE 33**


each project and every action it involves are in
accordance with what has been established in
the original project, which eventually takes the
form of an executive decree signed by the Ministers of Finance and Defense.

For its part, the General Comptrollership of the
Republic, under the Political Constitution, oversees all the administrative acts performed by the
State agencies. Each project and its respective
payments, and all administrative acts in general
must be authorized by decree and be overseen
by the Comptrollership. This State agency not
only ensures that the services subject their resolutions for the record, but also performs reviews
at the offices of the public agencies that must issue them. These reviews also extent to the procurement of material for Defense, which includes a visit to CONSUDENA to review the account reporting and verification of movements
at the different military missions located abroad.

It should be noted that the legislation governing
the Copper’s Reserved Law does not empower
the Commanders in Chief of the armed services
to make direct purchases. Although each purchase is the initiative of the Armed Forces and,
until the project is submitted, each Commander
in Chief is responsible for how the process is carried out, the finalization of each purchase requires the respective contracts issued by executive decree. This means that the President of the
Republic, the Minister of Defense and the Minister of Finance are eventually responsible for
each project. Even so, it is important to stress
that, before a project can be implemented, it
must be previously approved by the Executive,
which informs the ministerial authorities of the
intended objectives and the procedures adopted


to define it and select the best alternatives for its
realization.

The good operation of a democratic state entails
the need for public transparency and responsibility for the decisions and policies to be adopted, without compromising the necessary confidentiality required by the nature of the equipment being purchased. In fact, during the last
decade the most important procurement projects
have had a high level of dissemination and exhibition and were generally of public knowledge
throughout their entire development process.
Undoubtedly, this practice represents progress
toward a system that is more open to all branches of government and the citizens and which ultimately contributes to the country’s defense financing.

###### 4. OFFSETS

The weapons system procurement processes
have given rise in Chile to the initiative to associate these purchases to industrial offset projects,
i.e., commercial agreements required by a buyer
that force the seller to carry out actions to offset
the money flow required by the sales agreement.

The offsets arose as a mechanism to supplement
the defense system purchases with commercial
and technological initiatives generating socioeconomic benefits for the buying country, and
specifically, technological developments for local industry. These initiatives are made possible
through the capabilities of the industrial conglomerates producing the weapons systems,
which, with a relatively small effort, may transfer technology, orient investments, contract pro

-----

ductive processes or open markets for the benefit of the buying country’s industry.

The Chilean Government decision states that industrial offsets do not determine or affect the selection of the defense material, since the technical decision on the material to be selected corresponds to the respective service of the Armed
Forces and the Ministry of Defense.

This policy allows a defense investment to always provide an opportunity for technological,
industrial and commercial development for the
country.

The National Committee of Supplementary Industrial Programs under the Corporación de Fomento (CORFO) is the Chilean State agency in
charge of the negotiation, evaluation and followup of the industrial offset bids.

## 4. The Social Security System of the Armed Forces

###### Social security for Armed Forces per
 sonnel is part of the set of legislation

 and resources that the State uses to

 meet the social security needs of the

 men and women who serve in the

 Defense services. Therefore, given the

 special characteristics of a military

 career, a special system was developed

 to guarantee proper, life-long protec
 tion to the Armed Forces personnel.


###### 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM

Chile’s social security system has two groups of
people, deriving from the social security reform
of 1981. One group consists of all the people who
joined the new individual capitalization system
and make payments into personal accounts managed by private sector Pension Fund Administrators (AFPs). After Law Decree 3500 was passed,
everyone entering the labor market must join
the new system.

The other group remained in the old “distribution” system that was structured on the basis of a
central administration: the Social Security Standardization Institute. This system, governed by
Law Decree 3501, includes the civil pension
funds existing in 1981 and standardizes its benefits in a single system and maintains the portfolio of retirees that existed at the time the new
system was established.

Nevertheless, the change in the Chilean social
security system did not extend to the personnel
of the Armed Forces or those of the Forces of Or

der and Security, which kept their respective
systems with some small differences.

The Armed Forces system is generally based on
distributions, with contributions from the active,
retired and State personnel. Active personnel
contribute 6% of their salary or pension, thereby
financing a common pool of benefits. This common fund also finances other social services and
the administration of CAPREDENA.

###### 2. COMPOSITION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM ADMINISTERED BY CAPREDENA

CAPREDENA provides social security benefits
through four funds. The following are the most
relevant features.

**2.1. The Common Benefits Fund**

The main mission of this fund is to pay social security benefits, pay the transfers required by law,
and finance the administration of the social se

-----

curity institute. These benefits included the payment of retirement and widow’s pensions, whose
financing is governed by the Fund’s implementing act, DFL 31 of 1953, ratified by Law 18948,
the implementing act of the Armed Forces, according to the following formula:

**_a) The Fund pays for 25% of the initial val-_**
ue of the pensions. To meet this legal obligation, the Fund uses the 6% social security tax
on the active and retired personnel of the
Armed Forces (before 1979 the tax was 8%).

**_b) The State directly pays 75% of the initial_**
value, plus all adjustments or increases required by law.

Though a deficit is not feasible in this Fund because the State must cover the portion not financed through social security taxes, a review of
the figures for the last few years reveals the need
for a higher direct contribution from the State,
which has doubled in the period. Figure 34
shows the direct contribution of the State to
CAPREDENA from 1990 to 2002.

Today, CAPREDENA maintains 92,547 retirees
and widows.[40]

**2.2. The Severance Fund**

Created by Law 8895 of October 4, 1947, its main
objective is to make the severance payments according to the provisions established in DFL 1

###### ✪

**40 Figure updated as of July 2002. Source: Report to the Board of**
CAPREDENA.

**FIGURE 34**


(G) of 1968, and in Law 18948, the implementing
act of the Armed Forces, of 1990. Until 1989, it
showed balanced financial statements in terms
of its income and expenses, but this situation began to change in 1990 as a result of the legal
modifications made between 1988 and February
1990.

These changes led to a structure in which costs
were higher than income and the difference was
financed, for a time, by the Fund’s equity, until
1995. Since then successive direct fiscal allocations have been needed.

**2.3. The Curative Medicine Fund**

Regulated by law 19465 and financed with the
6% tax on retirement and widow’s pensions paid
by CAPREDENA, minus the 17.5% that must be
left available for the corresponding Commanders
in Chief of the services, and with a state contribution of 1% of the retirement and widow’s pensions paid by the Fund. In practice, this means
that this fund is financed with 5.95% of the contributions paid by its affiliates.

The fund finances the health benefits of 42,000
retired affiliates, who constitute 45% of the total
retired individuals. The rest have remained with
or rejoined the Armed Forces health systems.
This fund is complemented with a voluntary mutual fund.

**2.4. The Social Help Fund**

This was created Law 16285 of 1965, for the purpose of granting housing and assistance loans to
the contributing affiliates of CAPREDENA, with
initial capital from the outstanding balance of
the loans granted by the institution.


-----

According to current regulations, the annual
budget is distributed among the affiliates in active service and those retired, proportional to the
contributions paid by each group to the Common
Benefits Fund.

###### 3. BENEFICIARIES AND BASIS OF THE SYSTEM

**3.1. Beneficiaries**

All permanent staff serving in the Armed Forces
in the different ranks of officers, enlisted personnel, and permanent civil employees participate in the Armed Forces social security system.
The retired personnel and their direct surviving
family members, retirement and widow’s pensions of the system also participate.

The system covers risks during the professional
career of the military personnel protecting the
member of the system and their family, until the
death of the last family member with rights in
the system. If the beneficiary is on active duty, it
includes accidents, disabling illnesses, death
while in service, and after twenty years of service, the possibility of retiring with a percentage
of their salary proportional to the years of service.

**3.2. The Bases for the Social Security**
**Framework**

One of the essential duties of the State is the nation’s defense, which requires dedicated citizens
engaged in this task and sometimes putting their
own lives on the line. For this reason, the State
gives these citizens a fair reward during their
service, and after they complete their service,
the State offers a proper social security and retirement plan.

The risk and the effort involved in the military
profession are not compatible with a social security system based on normal mortality and disability rates.

The design of a hierarchical and pyramid-type
career is not compatible with a system that is
based on an age to ensure certain profitability of
the funds in an individual capitalization account.
In addition, the highly specialized and specific
professional education of the Armed Forces personnel does not welcome everyone to the labor
market after retiring.


###### 4. MODERNIZATION CRITERIA

**4.1. The Ongoing Situation**

The social security framework defined in the
notes above shows a situation that is characterized by increasing costs, which arises from the
need to finance the social security of the numerous personnel that belong to the large graduating
classes of the 1970’s and are now retiring after
completing their careers, and in agreement with
the benefits introduced with the amendments of
the laws that regulate the military social security
paid in the 1980’s.

Furthermore, maintaining certain benefits for
which the basic rules have not changed for a long
time has become an excessive burden for a system founded on historical circumstances and criteria that have increased the cost of those benefits and the number of beneficiaries. On the other hand, these benefits have differ significantly
from those of the civilian system that protects
those who could not choose the new individual
capitalization system enforced in the country, or
who preferred to stay in the distribution system
managed by the State. There are even differences in benefits of the same type.

**4.2. The Modernization Process**

Studies were stated some time ago to analyze the
possible solutions to this situation and they explore the characteristics and costs of a military
social security system that includes criteria related to the current social security system. Based
on the results of these studies and the criteria defined by the Ministry, much work was done to
prepare a project that made the social security
system shared by the Armed Forces and the Order and Security Forces economically and socially feasible.

The criteria considered are related to the need to
maintain a specific system for the Armed Forces
and the policies based on the current distribution
system, given the characteristics of the professional career in these institutions. This framework will cover the reform of the different subsystems separately, as each of the funds managed
by CAPREDENA (or DIPRECA) face specific problems that require specific solutions. A detailed
study of the current laws and their regulations, as
well as of each benefit granted with the pensions,
will allow the system to update the rights of the
military personnel, the retired members and their
families, and their access requirements.


-----

Ultimately, the application of a gradual modernization criteria presupposes that no member in
active duty will see his rights affected and no retired member will see his pension modified due
to the implementation of changes proposed.

The working plan considers the participation of
the governmental agencies related to the subject
and of the military and police services, and considers the creation of technical groups in charge
of studying the specific processes. These groups
will have the task of submitting a modernization
proposal that includes the necessary economic,
legal and social security aspects.

## 5. Standardized Measurement of Defense Spending

###### Since the end of the 20th Century,

 Chile and Argentina have promoted a

 cooperation and integration process. In

 this framework, the agreement on a

 common standardized methodology for

 measuring the corresponding Defense

 spending, with the collaboration of the

 Economic Commission for Latin

 America and the Caribbean (ECLAC)

 has been a very important progress in

 this issue. This method has helped to

 overcome some suspicions caused by

 the disparity between the figures sub
 mitted by governments, international

 agencies and independent institutions.


By approving, together with Argentina, the
method developed by ECLAC for measuring defense spending, Chile has responded to the possibility, put forward in the Book of the National
Defense of 1997, of improving its budget and
evaluation systems used in defense to provided
internationally accepted data

Indeed, in the 1997 book, Chile defined the categories included in defense spending, but indicated that it was not considering the expense of
military social security as part of its defense
spending. It actually stated: “For the effects of
this Book of the Defense, it [social security
spending] will be considered separately, because
it is not a cost covered by the Ministry of National Defense and therefore is not included in
its budget, nor discussed in the National Congress within the items of this ministerial portfo

lio. The consideration of this item as part of defense spending is debatable because it is a social
expense oriented to protecting the personnel
serving the defense institutions, and their families, when they are no longer in service.” The
1997 book added that “whoever analyzes the information on defense spending shall choose the
criteria, which implies fully or partially including or excluding from their analysis the tax-related cost of the social security system of the defense institutions.”

Nevertheless, in order to strengthen mutual
transparency and trust, the Chilean government
agreed with the government of Argentina to ask
the Economic Commission for Latin America
and the Caribbean (ECLAC) to study a methodology for measuring and comparing their defense
spending.[41]


-----

Both countries agreed to not restrict access to the
information, and committed to open figures that
reflect complex realities, so it could be properly
analyzed by the ECLAC experts in charge of the
study. They had to work with the budgetary and
financial management methods in force in each
country, which differ significantly. Due to these
differences and the need to find a standardization formula, the study was defined as a “homologation” process for calculating defense
spending.

###### 1. PROBLEMS OF COMPARATIVE ESTIMATES OF DEFENSE SPENDING

There are several sources that provide comparison studies on defense expenses. The main ones
are the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
through its annual book “Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook” (GFSY); the United Nations,
by publication of the report, Reduction of Military Budgets: Military Expenditures in Standardized Form Report by States; the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), of London,
that publishes the Military Balance; the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
(SIPRI) and, before that, the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency (ACDA), which has been
part of the Department of State of the United
States since 1999. The Congressional Research
Service (CRS) and the United Nations, through
the United Nations Register of Arms Transfer, also gathers information on military purchases.

Most of the reports published use common
benchmarks based on the Classification of the
Functions of Government (COFOG), a system
developed by the United Nations, and from NATO methodologies. However, these measurement systems are normally fed by the data submitted by the countries analyzed or by the public-domain information available.[42] This is a large
disadvantage: the information is not standardized. Moreover, the COFOG and NATO methodological frameworks have some differences with

###### ✪

**41 The work was requested to the Economic Commission of Latin**
America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) as it is a supranational institution of the United Nation that enjoys a broad recognition in the economic area, and offers guarantees of seriousness and impartiality to
all the countries of the region.

**42 Excluding only NATO member countries.**


respect to the activities considered as part of the
defense function and thus, of the spending involved.

There are various examples of this. NATO considers military pensions as part of defense
spending, while the IMF includes them under
“Social Security and Welfare” spending. The former considers transactions within the State, an
aspect omitted by the IMF, as part of defense
spending. Another relevant aspect are the Police
Force and Frontier Control, Auxiliary or Paramilitary, which are included as defense expenses by
the Atlantic Alliance, but excluded by the IMF.
On the other hand, the Civil Defense is part of
the GFSY defense concept, but not according to
NATO.

There are also differences between each institution’s measurements. The ACDA excludes the
civilian expenditures of the Ministry of Defense,
and foreign military aid, and includes military
acquisitions at the time the debt contract is
signed, not when the payment is made. In turn,
the IMF does not include expenses for non-military purposes, regardless of whether they are
made by the Ministries of Defense (Education,
Health, Research and Development, interests
over military debts and pensions). Also, the
SIPRI does not include purchases made with donations within the calculation.

Lastly, while collecting the data there is a persistent danger: many countries argue that they
do not have information available, a situation
that is particularly frequent in the calculation
mechanisms used by the UN.

###### 2. ECLAC METHODOLOGY

Before starting the methodological design, Chile
and Argentina submitted to ECLAC a basic document with the work specifications, the basic definitions of the calculation, and in general terms,
all data and procedures required to obtain them.

The “Common Standardized Methodology for
Measuring Defense Spending” prepared by the
ECLAC understands “defense spending” as the
expenses incurred to implement activities the direct effect of which is to protect the national sovereignty. In brief, its objective is to reach a condition of external security.

Based on this definition, the study chooses three
basic directing principles:


-----

**_a) National Defense is related to the protec-_**
tion of the geographical boundaries in the
event of foreign threats and therefore excludes the expenses of the domestic security
function.

**_b) The expenses are “measured” in terms of_**
the annual cash flows and not of physical or
monetary assets accrued over time. This
does not prevent other measures of transparency from reporting that information.

**_c) The governments of Chile and Argentina_**
established that the central goal of their proposal was to have a “standardized methodology” that would permit a rational comparison of the spending and contribute to transparency and trust between the two countries.

In short, the expense to be measured is the expense the countries incur in performing the defense function, restrictively defined in relation
to external security and the care of the national
sovereignty. This means the analysis does not include the functions of domestic security and other duties performed by agencies under the ministries of Defense, but whose tasks are not directly related to the stated purpose.

The methodology required “operationalizing” the
aforementioned criteria. It was also to assume
some problems related to the valuation of certain
expenses, and clarify any tax-related and fee-related effects that could eventually distort the values. Therefore, some common criteria and “facilitating” procedures were used to calculate the defense spending in Chile and Argentina, thereby
enabling their proper comparison.

Standardization was performed based on the
budgetary and accounting procedures in force in
Chile and Argentina, which are not entirely similar and that the project entrusted to ECLAC did
not really intend to modify it, thus assigning
more relevance to the data selection criteria.

Though the main objective of the study was to
measure defense spending, it seemed appropriate to complement the available information
with certain quantitative and qualitative data on
the revenues that finance this spending. In this
manner, as far as possible, the reliability of the
defense spending estimates was strengthened.
A better understanding of the budgetary and government revenue and spending control systems
that exist in Argentina and Chile, which consti

tuted the basis for preparing a common standardized methodology for measuring defense
spending, led to the conclusion that the essential
data should come from government cash-basis
accounting (“paid” and “banked” in Argentina
and “cash” in Chile), eliminating some specifically budgetary terms such as (“commitments” or
“accrued”). The figures were obtained from the
General Comptrollership of the Republic and the
Office of the Budget, in Chile, and the Integrated
Financial Data System of the National Treasury,
in Argentina.

The cash-basis accounting criteria is used by the
International Monetary Fund in its statistics,
which are widely known, accepted and used
worldwide.

In addition, as a trial period for analyzing and
verifying the strengths and possible weaknesses
of the standardized methodology, it was applied
in 1996, 1997 and 1998; in other words, in a reasonable and relatively recent period of time,
with much data available and stable criteria and
procedures in both countries.[43]

Lastly, to prepare the common standardized
methodology, the decision was made to submit
an option of successive approaches that would
allow for definition of different concepts of what
defense spending is in the two countries, depending on the coverage of the concept used,
from the smallest to the greatest, in order to provide a more complete view that could include
different criteria for what comprises the spending.

Thus the Office of the Executive Secretary of the
ECLAC proposed that defense spending be calculated for three different aggregates –G1, G2,
and G3–, which progressively broaden its scope.
In this manner, the methodology proposed can
respond better to the aspirations and needs of
the countries involved, and allows more valid
and pertinent international comparisons, depending on the level used.

**_a) Aggregate Level G1_**
The Function of Defense, Central or Basic

###### ✪

**43 In the 12th Meeting of the Permanent Security Committee**
(COMPERSEG: Buenos Ai-res, December 2002), Chile and Argentina
agreed to update the application of the ECLAC methodology in both
countries, and they analyzed different alternatives to implement this
decision.


-----

Defense Spending for Level G1 corresponds
—according to the definitions of the IMF in
its public statistics manual— to government
spending on the management and administration of the military defense, especially the
administration, supervision and management of military defense matters and forces,
understood as ground, air, or sea defense
forces; engineering, transportation, communications, information, materials, personnel
and other forces and non-combatant commands; reserve forces and auxiliaries linked
to the defense system, equipment and military structures. Issues related to the Civil Defense; applied research and experimental development related to defense, and the management, administration and support of defense matters that cannot be assigned to any
of the previous expense categories, for example, those related to civil or academic agencies of the Ministries of Defense.

The calculation procedure starts with the reports that the countries submit to the IMF
every year, in which they officially report
the defense expenditures made by their respective ministries of Defense, according to
a functional ranking of government spending generally used by agencies under the
Ministry of Finance. It includes both the disbursements made in local currency and the
equivalents in local currency for those made
directly in foreign currency. It must be noted that in official publications of Argentina
and Chile, and in those of the IMF, only total
values are reported in local currency and in
current values for each year.

This initial data is corrected because it does
not reflect the same concepts, in other
words, it includes other expenses associated
with different functions of Defense and exclude others that fit the definition of Defense
adopted for ECLAC’s work.

In the case of Argentina, some items are
added such as education, training and health
expenses, paid by the Ministry of Defense,
excluding the aeronautical police force and
other minor items. In the case of Chile, this
data also includes the revenue from the Copper’s Law. (Information is only available on
the revenue from this source, but not the use
of these funds, which include all acquisition
expenses charged to these funds, including
interest and commissions.) In the case of
Chile, the expenses that do not correspond to


the military function as it was defined or that
constitute services supplied to the community by Ministry of Defense agencies and paid
by the users must be deducted.

The result of these operations constitutes the
first or basic level of Defense Spending or
G1, defined as the Central Defense Spending.

**_b) Aggregate Level G2_**
Aggregate Level G2 or Extended Defense
Spending is obtained by adding the associated expense to Level G1, the net social security expenses executed in each country for
paying the pensions of retired military personnel and to their heirs (widow’s pension).
In the case of Chile, they originate in the expenses associated with the provision and administration of the National Defense Fund,
CAPREDENA. In the case of Argentina, they
originate in the institute of Financial Assistance or IAF for the same concepts.

Regarding to this Level G2, it is important to
note that some methodologies do not include
social security expenses deriving from the
social security system of retired military personnel, as part of defense spending, as is the
case of the United States and in the international agencies. In turn, other methodologies, basically European, do include them.
Since this topic is open to discussion and
there is no consensus, as indicated in the
ECLAC study itself, this Level G2 expresses
another concept of defense that differs from
and complements Level G1.

The statistics in Chile’s 1997 Book of the National Defense do not directly include these
figures as defense spending, though some
statistics of the social security spending are
presented separately.

**_c) Aggregate Level G3_**
Aggregate Level G3 or Total, includes several
concepts that are related to industrial and defense development activities, as well as to
concepts related to the defense spending of
other public agencies and military aid.
Though in the cases studied in Chile and Argentina some of these items do not have any
relevance, they are essential to a more global analysis and sustained effectiveness over
time.

The methodology designed by the ECLAC,


-----

that yielded the common standardized
methodology described above, was developed to measure defense spending in Chile
and Argentina. However, it is possible to apply it in other countries of the region. In fact,
during the year 2002 a joint effort was started between Chile and Peru to apply it between both countries[44].

In summary, the policies promoted by the
Chilean State in terms of the transparency of
defense spending have led to several
achievements. On the one hand, while their
purpose is to increase mutual confidence between Chile and other countries, they have
contributed to improving our external security. From a strictly economic point of view,
there is now a nationally and internationally
accepted methodology to measure defense
spending. Within Chile, this leads to the possibility of a better allotment of the resources,
and in internationally it enables a better appraisal of the economic management of the
public sector.

**44 The 5th Conference of Defense Ministers of the Americas (Santiago, November 2002) recognized the work done by Chile and Argentina, with**
the contribution of the ECLAC, agreeing to a common standardized methodology for measuring defense spending as a mutual confidence measure
and proposed it as an incentive for doing similar efforts in the region. The Conference understood that developing this methodology among other
American countries requires establishing the common factors and elements, and considering its particular issues (Conclusions of Point 2 of the Second Labor Commission). In turn, in the 12th Meeting of the Permanent Security Committee (COMPERSEG: Buenos Aires, December 2002), Chile
and Argentina agreed on the need to increase the efforts to develop the proposed methodology with other countries of the region and decided to
seek ways to disseminate it in order to achieve its best acceptance.
