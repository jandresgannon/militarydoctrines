Respected reader, The Republic of Croatia has endured some very dramatic events since its independence, including aggression and occupation of a portion of its national territory. It was then forced to liberate its occupied areas and rebuild the country in a demanding post-war recovery effort. Now, it faces dynamic reforms and meeting the necessary adjustments for its further balanced development.

During the entire time of its independence, Croatia's defence system and Armed Forces have played a central role, either by ensuring national independence and the liberation of its occupied territory or by acting as a key factor of reforms and meeting the conditions for membership in NATO and the European Union.

The document before you - while reflecting a thorough study of global security developments in the world and in Croatia's immediate environment - is primarily a response to the fundamental needs and potential of our nation. At the same time, it also represents a significant step towards the practical realisation of Croatia's National Security Strategy and Defence Strategy.

In this regard, the Strategic Defence Review is a public document providing direction for developing the defence system and the Croatian Armed Forces, ensuring that in the future they continue to protect the vital interests of the Republic of Croatia and its citizens.

This Review addresses the most fundamental issues regarding the development of Croatia's defence.

The tangible measures stemming from this effort will be reflected in the plans and documents designed to elaborate defence issues in greater detail. Primarily, this implies the adoption of the *Republic of* Croatian Armed Forces Long Term Development Plan, expected to establish reform priorities and timelines. It is well known that the pace of defence transformation and modernization, for the most part, depends on a nation's economic potential. However, by planning appropriately and carefully managing the available resources, we can achieve our intended results.

The Strategic Defence Review is subject to further development and modification as it is affected by events in the international environment as well as domestic changes. The security changes and risks that marked the beginning of the 21st Century have introduced a new set of rules for all of us. Therefore, it is necessary for us to change and adapt our defence capabilities, as well as the way we think and behave in order to meet the new requirements. Fully committed to promoting peace and security, we will develop a defence system and Armed Forces that meet modern requirements and are based on the realistic capacities at our disposal. This very document perhaps best demonstrates the course Croatia will embark on in contributing to developing good neighbourly relations, peace and stability in the region.

The Croatian military is a victorious military that, under the most difficult conditions, including fighting a war, demonstrated an exceptional ability to transform and adapt to new situations. For various reasons, the transformation dynamics in the last ten years have not been able to fully sustain the demands of a new strategic security environment. Today, it is perfectly clear that those military organisations which do not change in response to the new tasks and requirements will quickly become obsolete and inept to face the new challenges. The Republic of Croatia cannot allow its armed forces to suffer such a fate.

The Republic of Croatia fully secured freedom for all its citizens with victory in the Homeland War. Defence reforms began immediately thereafter and lasted several years. In the last three years, the results of defence reforms are evident primarily through the downsizing of personnel and the reduction of the defence budget. Is the defence reform thereby completed? The answer to this question is not simple.

In seeking the proper answer to this question and following the experiences of other countries, we decided to conduct a Strategic Defence Review. While conducting the Strategic Defence Review it was necessary to include various government bodies, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration, the Ministry of the Interior and the intelligence community.

The advice of NATO experts was exceptionally useful and their arrival in the Republic of Croatia always had an additional positive affect on the quality of the document itself.

We analysed the global security situation, especially in the surrounding environment, determined the required capabilities of our defence system and, having considered our national needs and priorities, came to clear conclusions.

The world increasingly faces new forms of threats. International terrorism, smuggling of narcotics, weapons and human beings and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction create enormous challenges for most states, thus becoming global concerns.

We acknowledged the need to improve the defence management system in order to realize our national interests.

We paid special attention to defining future armed forces missions and tasks.

In order to achieve a full operational capability of the defence system, it is necessary to begin training and equipping our units for the entire spectrum of operations. We will be able to achieve this through a modern and flexibly organized defence system that will primarily be founded on well-trained, equipped and mobile armed force.

We also found it necessary to establish a better system of human, material and financial resource management. The availability of defence resources will determine the dynamics of Croatian defence system transformation. I can already say at this point that we will have adequate budgetary means for financing key armed forces equipping programs. We will also use the special military property conversion program as a source of funds for improving the overall defence infrastructure.

I would especially like to point out the direct influence of the Strategic Defence Review on the strengthening of our team approach and better mutual understanding between all those responsible for leading our defence and security policy.

In conclusion, I would like to say that the Strategic Defence Review is a good basis for further reform of the defence system. It is the beginning of a story that will continue with the adoption of the Armed Forces Long Term Development Plan and will constitute a comprehensive framework necessary for building the Croatian defence system of the 21st century.

The Croatian Ministry of Defence initiated a Strategic Defence Review (SDR) in autumn 2003, intended to guide the continued reforms of the Croatian Armed Forces (CAF) and its defence system as a whole. The SDR's inter-agency approach is testimony of the Government's determination to undertake comprehensive reforms that will enable Croatia's national defence efforts to meet new challenges. A changing security environment, augmented role for the armed forces, new capability requirements, limited resources and Croatia's future Euro-Atlantic obligations are just some of the important issues that compel a strong commitment to assess and reform its defence.

A threat and risk assessment indicates that a direct military threat to Croatia is highly unlikely, while non-traditional challenges—such as international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), organised crime, illegal trafficking, disasters and environmental degradation—represent significantly growing security concerns.

Significant defence changes are expected. Both military and civil defence components will continue to be further developed. The armed forces will become fully professionalized and consist of a newly styled 'contract' reserve. Military capabilities that enable Croatia to participate in international operations will be particularly stressed. Changes will also consist of developing other capabilities that focus on the spectrum of CAF missions and tasks, including the capacity to undertake non-combat operations.

The CAF will see significant changes, while retaining its services based structure. Overall force downsizing will also include cutting the number of units and command headquarters. Capabilities necessary for conducting CAF missions and tasks will continue to be developed. The target size of the CAF is a fully professionalized 16,000 strong force with 2,000

![5_image_2.png](5_image_2.png) civilian personnel and 8,000 'contract' reserves. Gradually, obligatory conscription will be suspended. Key doctrines, consistent with those of NATO, will be adopted by the end of 2007.

Interoperability with Allied forces will be realized gradually. Nevertheless, CAF units and capabilities designated for international operations in the near future are a priority. Ready forces will also be given priority over the remaining elements of the defence system.

Human resource management plans will determine the dynamics of achieving the targeted personnel structure and size. Recruiting, particularly in an effort to tackle problems of an aging personnel structure, will be intensified, and separation programs will continue as planned. Personnel management will be reorganised in order to meet the many defence reform demands by ensuring an effective personnel support process.

Specialized military education and training will be integrated with national education programs and the national classification of professions system so that separated military personnel would have recognized qualifications that enable them to be more competitive on the job market.

Limited defence funding requires that efforts to equip and modernize the armed forces be carefully prioritized. Precedence will be given to meeting the interoperability requirements of contingents to be deployed in multinational operations (primarily communications systems and force protection equipment). Importance will be attached to achieving Croatia's Partnership Goals, the modernisation of communications and information systems at all levels, simulation training systems and modern combat systems that need to replace existing obsolete systems.

Defence acquisition will, whenever

7
possible and economically feasible, rely

![6_image_2.png](6_image_2.png) on domestic development and production capacities. International procurement and arms acquisition will be based on joint ventures and offset programs with partner countries or foreign companies. A
procurement and modernisation plan will be developed and will determine the concrete steps necessary to gradually meet Croatia's military capability requirements by 2015. This should include a factor of flexibility given the difficulty in predicting future budget allocations and potential change in priorities.

Certain military facilities will not be retained, allowing for valuable resources to be reallocated to modernisation efforts. The remaining military sites will be consolidated whenever feasible and called for.

The Ministry of Defence will also be reorganised. The organisational structure will continue to be rationalized and activities that are not narrowly related to defence management will be separated. A
relatively modest organisational structure will be adopted and will enable Croatia to manage its national defence in an effective and affordable manner.

The General Staff will remain an integral part of the Ministry of Defence. Functional areas, structural relationships, differentiation of responsibilities and standard procedures will be defined by 2006.

Defence policy is based on Croatia's foreign and security policy and will continue to direct defence efforts. Croatia's foreign policy will guide a robust program of international defence co-operation. The defence planning process will be simplified, centralized and consistent with that of NATO. Decision making on key defence issues will be transparent and based on a comprehensive set of predetermined procedures.

National legislation will be subject to changes that enable Croatia to be an effective international ally and partner in

![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)

![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png)

![6_image_3.png](6_image_3.png) future co-operative security efforts.

The Ministry of Defence will fully support strong inter-agency co-operation and strive to stress those activities that promote Croatia's national security and strengthen its defence capabilities. This includes emergency and civil-military crisis planning, coast guard responsibilities, host nation support and other multifaceted security-related issues.

Croatia will ensure that classified information is protected and safely exchanged. A Ministry of Defence intelligence and security system will harmonize Croatia's national and international requirements.

An integrated information system -
aimed at increasing administrative effectiveness, improving communications and promoting transparency within the defence organisation - will be established.

Significant changes in the European security environment, especially in wake of the enlargement of the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) in 2004, have resulted in strengthening the linkage and interweaving of security and defence. European countries are faced with the challenge of directing and adjusting their defence efforts to new circumstances, especially in meeting the demands of rationalizing their military potentials. Many NATO member countries make use of a strategic review as an instrument for promoting and overseeing defence reforms.

The Republic of Croatia is determined to respond to the changed conditions in its security environment. The Croatian Ministry of Defence (MoD) has initiated a Strategic Defence Review
(SDR) aimed at establishing the necessary guidance in the further development of its defence potential. The SDR process represents an in-depth, thorough inventory of the defence system, detecting its strengths as well as its weaknesses. The SDR also proposes conceptual and organisational changes in developing the military capabilities needed to meet Croatia's security requirements. As Croatia is focused on its accession to the EU and NATO, the SDR also takes into account existing resource constraints.

The desire to undertake a strategic review has been around for quite some time, being mentioned in several key defence documents. While working on Croatia's Membership Action Plan
(MAP) and producing Defence Policy 2003/04 and Defence Policy 2004/05, the MoD repeatedly indicated its intention of developing a strategic review. The intent was to conceptualize and direct defence reform efforts, thereby establishing a basic framework for the development of the Croatian Armed Forces Long Term Development Plan (CAF LTDP).

The SDR process began in October

![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png)

2003 with the establishment of a Steering Committee, including an expert working group responsible for drafting the final document. The key civilian and military leadership was involved from the outset, including representatives from the Office of the President, the Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and other government bodies. Since this was the first time that Croatia undertook such an effort, regular consultations were held with NATO.

Several important decisions resulted from the SDR process as consensus was achieved at the highest political level. For example, the President, the Prime Minister and the President of the Parliament agreed on the need to further downsize Croatia's armed forces, abanoning a previously planned 76,000 strong
"B" reserve force. Initial SDR findings also revoked support for several defence projects that did not seem to contribute to the development of required military capabilities. Likewise, the SDR enabled defence officials to accelerate efforts to abandon obsolete weapons and military equipment.

The SDR process also introduced a sustained participation of key defence decision makers in the discussion of those issues that will significantly affect the development and future posture of the defence system. This was absolutely crucial to the success of the review. The SDR was also subjected to comprehensive expert and public debates. After some minor adjustments were made, the SDR document was presented to the state's highest authorities.

The SDR was faced with some complex, multidisciplinary issues. While some issues required reports and analysis from the various MoD departments and bodies, working groups that included other governmental agencies were estab-

lished to deal with the analysis of specific defence-related issues that required interagency cooperation. Their findings and recommendations were discussed within the framework of the SDR expert group and the Steering Committee, as well as with NATO representatives. Issues deemed crucial for the success of the review were sent to the government for verification.

The initial phase of the SDR was characterized by in-depth analyses and studies of the existing tasks and capabilities of the CAF. The results provided a conceptual basis for redefining CAF tasks and missions, which eventually led to the identification of fundamental requirements in force capabilities and structure.

The new tasks and missions are now clearly and more closely linked to Croatia's future security concerns and its international obligations. These include Croatia's contribution to international peace and collective security within the framework of the United Nations (UN)
and its strategic imperative to join the EU and NATO, as well as its commitment to regional co-operation. In contemplating future force options, several significant risk and threat scenarios were

![9_image_1.png](9_image_1.png) taken into account and an affordability check of the force structure was conducted.

One of the most important outcomes of the SDR process is the establishment of guidance and a basic framework for the long-term development of the CAF. Once adopted by the Croatian Parliament, the CAF LTDP will formally determine the direction of CAF development and the corresponding responsibilities of individual elements of the defence system. Adoption of the CAF LTDP will enable for a carefully planned and accountable approach to the management of defence resources. In a wider sense, it should also ensure a somewhat more stable mid-term and short-term planning process.

This document is the final product of the SDR process and it provides the fundamental guidance for future development plans, as well as for any necessary changes to Croatia's strategic documents. It is also intended to further guide defence developments during and after Croatia's accession to Euro-Atlantic structures.

The global security dynamics at the end of the 20th and early 21st century caused major changes in the existing security paradigms. Instead of the familiar, relatively simple bipolar relationships and predictable responses to possible security challenges, the world is now facing a complex security situation in which changes occur more quickly and threats, gaining new asymmetric and transnational proportions, appear to be more unpredictable and shrouded in evergreater uncertainty. Instability stemming from certain countries and regions, terrorism, organised crime, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), illegal migration, as well as the problems of information security, represent threats that no country can respond to properly on an individual basis. Correspondingly, the security and defence architecture is adapting to these new challenges at both the national and global levels. In order to respond effectively, national security and defence efforts clearly need to be more integrated.

Global and certain regional organisations are consistently attempting to develop adequate responses to the new, changing circumstances. These international organisations are often subject to various constraints that limit their capacity to act decisively and respond timely and effectively. Likewise, the instruments and resources available to deal with these complex situations and crisis are greatly limited. Under these circumstances, regional organisations such as NATO and the EU are playing an increasingly greater role in dealing with crises situations. By strengthening their respective roles globally, NATO and the EU are also willingly accepting greater responsibilities in international security. This is particularly evident in the case of NATO,
whose military engagements outside the territory of its member countries have made it one of the most important factors of international security.

![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)

![10_image_1.png](10_image_1.png)

![10_image_2.png](10_image_2.png)

![10_image_4.png](10_image_4.png) Consequently, and in order to be more effective, NATO is transforming its structures and capabilities. The new command structure and formation of rapid response forces most evidently illustrate this transformation and adjustment.

The EU is set to play an increasingly greater role in the whole spectrum of crisis management operations, though it is perhaps currently most noticeable in post-conflict situations of crisis relief and recovery of affected areas. The European continent is experiencing a uniquely remarkable process of unification and security stabilization. Within the framework of these efforts, an EU common foreign and security policy (CFSP) is emerging and gaining in significance, as well as a European security and defence policy (ESDP). In this respect, the EU is aiming to develop the necessary defence capabilities that will enable it to respond more effectively to regional and global challenges. The EU has made significant headway in its ESDP efforts. It has established a Capability Development Mechanism (CDM) and the European Defence Agency (EDA), adopted a series of Headline Goals enshrined within the European Capability Action Plan (ECAP), and is committed to organising elements of its rapid response forces in terms of EU Battlegroups.

The full stabilization of Southeast Europe remains an important EU objective. The EU has assumed responsibility for consolidating the stabilization of Southeast Europe by replacing NATO forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina with its own forces. Democratic processes in the countries of Southeast Europe have been strengthened, reducing the potential outbreak of hostilities to a minimum. Most countries in the region are either in the process of joining Euro-Atlantic structures or are already members. Even those countries excluded until now have

indicated their intentions of achieving

![11_image_4.png](11_image_4.png) Euro-Atlantic integration, primarily by requesting membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) program and by signing a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU. As a result, the regional environment is becoming more stable and secure.

A growingly more stable environment has enabled Croatia to increase its international participation and contribute more to international security. Through multilateral efforts and regional co-operation, Croatia is becoming more recognized as a "security exporter" rather than a "security consumer". Croatia has strong Euro-Atlantic aspirations and intends to make even greater contributions to regional and global security. This will require changes in its security and defence systems, to include the development of required capabilities that will enable Croatia to meet the challenges of effectively contributing to cooperative security and collective defence.

## National Interests And Objectives

Croatia's national interests are based on the fundamental values embodied in the Republic of Croatia Constitution. These translate into security interests and national objectives outlined in the Republic of Croatia National Security Strategy, adopted by the Parliament in 2002.

Vital national security interests are the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia, along with its national identity and fundamental values intact, and the protection and safety of its citizens and their property. Croatia's important national interests include the preservation and development of democracy and democratic institutions, the rule of law, economic prosperity and social justice, a peaceful and secure international environment, international order based on the principles of justice, adherence to

![11_image_1.png](11_image_1.png) international law, political and economic equality, as well as the preservation and protection of the natural environment.

The most broad national objective is to create the proper conditions for a free, just and stable political, economic and social development of Croatian society, in cooperation and a spirit of solidarity with other democratic states. Specific security objectives include:
the development and implementation of the proper policies, measures, activities and institutions effective enough to meet Croatia's current and future security concerns; the building of favourable regional and global security surroundings through international security organisations and in co-operation with other democratic states; the establishment of an economically well-off, stable society that will in the long-term be able to build and sustain effective security mechanisms and assure for the necessary resources, and respond to all its security challenges, risks and threats.

A consistent national and strategic objective has been to join NATO and the EU. The Programme of the Government of the Republic of Croatia for the 20032007 Mandate re-emphasizes Croatia's national objective to achieve full NATO and EU membership. It also outlines a series of objectives which include:
improving Croatia's international standing and security situation; developing peace and stability in the region; and continuing with social, economic and defence reforms. Particular emphasis is placed on increasing the effectiveness of security and defence mechanisms, including the armed forces. Croatia's multiregional territorial configuration consequently produces a variety of geographic challenges, such as safeguarding its interests in the Adriatic Sea.

# Strategic Context Threats And Risks

![12_Image_2.Png](12_Image_2.Png)

13

![12_image_3.png](12_image_3.png)

Croatia's national interests and objectives provide the basis for establishing the tasks and missions of its armed forces. An assessment of Croatia's security threats and risks and its international commitments also contribute to shaping the CAF missions, as well as the obligations stemming from Croatia's expectation to join NATO and the EU in the near future. It is likely that on its way to full Euro-Atlantic integration, Croatia may be required to review its current decisions and priorities, and thereby consider other available options, necessary to enable it to join the EuroAtlantic community.

## Threats And Risks

A threat and risk assessment of Croatia's national security represents a key factor in determining the direction of developments in Croatia's conceptual and structural defence posture. The current assessment of its security environment indicates that at the moment and in the foreseeable longer term—a direct, conventional military threat to Croatia is not likely—although it cannot be completely ruled out. The likelihood of a conventional conflict—in which Croatia's territory would be part of a larger battlefield or area of hostilities in the coming years—is very low. A likely aggressor that could potentially threaten Croatia's security would do so with conventional means and is not expected to possess highly sophisticated military capabilities. Croatia is located in a region that has experienced armed conflict and political difficulties in the postcold war period. Despite a trend of gradual stabilization and the presence of international forces in the area, the emergence and spread of instability in the region is quite possible.

Threats are assuming a new character.

In the future, it will be even more difficult to distinguish between military and non-military components of threats.

![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)

![12_image_1.png](12_image_1.png) Croatia may be indirectly affected by crises in its immediate environment, as well as by destabilizing consequences of asymmetric and trans-national threats.

International terrorism is a growing, complex global security challenge. Terrorism has become a distinct security concern, which can provide new dimensions to other trans-national threats and can even lead to conventional conflicts. In a very short time and with an undoubtedly profound effect, it has been able to compromise the security of developed democratic societies. And by creating a sense of insecurity within a targeted population, terrorism has thus achieved one of its primary objectives.

The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is a major global security concern. If unchecked, the spread of WMD could lead to the emergence of new military and terrorist threats. The availability of these weapons to technologically inferior armed forces of aggressive non-democratic regimes, and, even more worrisome, to terrorist organisations and other groups, and the possibility of their use, represents a very dangerous scenario. The spread of WMD is a global threat that requires a co-ordinated response not only from the law enforcement authorities and/or armed forces of individual countries, but also calls for the concerted use of an assortment of national and international instruments.

Organised criminal activity has had a noticeably destabilizing effect on states and is also recognized as a significant trans-national security concern. Moreover, illegal trafficking of drugs, weapons and human beings and other criminal activities are becoming a key source for financing terrorist groups.

The growing reliance on developing communications and computer technologies also produces new vulnerabilities, which eventually reflect upon the general

# Strategic Context International Obligations

![13_Image_0.Png](13_Image_0.Png)

![13_Image_1.Png](13_Image_1.Png)

![13_Image_3.Png](13_Image_3.Png)

14

![13_image_4.png](13_image_4.png)

stability and security of entire societies. Thus, the development of capabilities designed to respond to these challenges represents an imperative at both the national and international levels.

Croatia, like all other countries, is also exposed to risks associated with natural and man-made disasters. The serious consequences of potential disasters, primarily in terms of human casualties, material damage and the disruption of normal commerce, transportation, communication and other activities in the country, call for the use of defence capabilities to support civil authorities in the more serious national crisis situations.

The emergence of new threats and risks correspondingly call for military reforms and the development of new capabilities. The fact that a direct military threat to Croatia is highly unlikely allows for a comprehensive reform of its armed forces. The perception of a very high probability of facing asymmetric, trans-national threats and having to deal with complex security issues justify the need to develop new, specific and adequate responses. In particular, Croatia opts to pool its efforts through the collective and cooperative security framework of Euro-Atlantic structures. It thus has a unique opportunity to gradually reform its defence by developing the necessary capabilities and structuring its forces to meet future demands and effectively confront the new threats in a common effort.

## International Obligations

Croatia has accepted greater responsibilities in contributing to international security and is keen on achieving full Euro-Atlantic integration by joining NATO and the EU. In that sense, it has taken on many obligations. As a result, it will directly affect how future CAF missions and tasks are defined. It also includes commitments to assure that proper resources are allocated to defence.

The challenge is to plan a well-balanced

![13_image_2.png](13_image_2.png)

national budget where defence expenditures do not threaten Croatia's overall economic and social development. Internationally, Croatia's role has been steadily growing, as it has willingly decided to contribute to several United Nations operations and has taken part in many regional security initiatives.

Croatia is an active member of the UN and a contributor to many of its international efforts to maintain peace and security. Croatia has outlined its intent to continue participating in UN peace-support operations byway of the UN Stand-by Arrangement, which includes commitments to provide military observers, staff officers and military experts on the UN On-Call List, while maintaining an observer status in the UN SHIRBRIG (Stand-by Arrangement High Readiness Brigade).

Since joining the Partnership for Peace in May 2000, Croatia's relationship with NATO has resulted in a substantial effort to improve its defence capabilities and achieve the high standards of the Alliance. In the process of joining NATO through the Membership Action Plan and by taking part in many PfP activities, Croatia has willingly accepted 49 Partnership Goals (a list of Partnership Goals is provided as an annexe). Croatia is thus set on developing its defence capabilities to be compatible and its forces to be interoperable with those of the Alliance, especially with regard to the deployment of the CAF
in NATO-led operations.

Croatia also expects to join the EU.

Membership in the EU will enable Croatia to play an active role within the ESDP framework. Concretely, it will result in contributing forces and capabilities to EU crisis management efforts.

While currently outside the EU defence processes, Croatia will closely follow developments and stand ready to participate when asked to join. Given its

# Defence System Adjustments

![14_Image_2.Png](14_Image_2.Png)

T
limited resources and taking into account the solidarity of the transatlantic relationship, Croatia will most likely plan that the forces and capabilities committed to the EU be the same ones designated for NATO-led operations.

The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is an important forum for promoting transparency, trust and friendly relations among its great many member countries. The OSCE provides a unique regional framework of confidence and security building measures (CSBM). It enables Croatia, as a signatory of the many resolutions, declarations and agreements, to actively participate in its many diverse activities, initiatives and organisational bodies.

Croatia's multi-regional characteristic provides many valuable opportunities for co-operation with other countries. Croatia is involved in regional initiatives in Central and Southeast Europe and the Adriatic Sea area. This includes Central European Nations Co-operation (CENCOOP),
the Quadrilateral co-operation initiative, US-Adriatic Charter, the Adriatic-Ionian Initiative, the Southeast Europe Defence

![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png) Ministerial (SEDM), and the South-East European Co-operation Process (SEECP).

Regional co-operation also provides a proper setting for nations to pool their capabilities and resources in tackling common challenges. Within the framework of the Quadrilateral Co-operation, Croatia will join Hungary, Italy and Slovenia in developing a brigade-sized unit—the Multinational Land Force (MLF)—designed for international peace-support operations.

A growingly more stable security environment, without the likelihood of a traditional armed conflict, an intensified Euro-Atlantic integration process, and a wide range of international commitments, clearly signal a new set of strategic circumstances that call for a reassessment of Croatia's defence efforts.

Moreover, when the new global security trends are taken into account, it is safe to assume that the existing defence system will need to transform and undertake a series of reforms and adjustments in order to be more effective in meeting future challenges.

The existing defence system is for the most part a product of Croatia's effort to defend its democracy and sovereignty in the Homeland War (1991-1995). Defence is a national responsibility and consists of military and civil components.

Croatia's defence has been based on the concept of individual self-defence and primarily focused on the protection of national territory. This approach is seriously brought into question by changes in Croatia's security environment and the Euro-Atlantic integration process, which should soon result in Croatia's full membership in NATO and the EU. Likewise, it is difficult for any country to ignore the benefits of emerging technologies and conceptual innovations stemming from what has been called the revolution in military

![14_image_3.png](14_image_3.png) affairs. A reduced budget has seriously challenged the effectiveness of the current approach to defence and questioned the very need to maintain such a defence at all in wake of Croatia's NATO and EU aspirations.

The existing CAF structure has been oriented towards developing and maintaining territorially-based self-defence capabilities. A limited budget, inadequately filled CAF units, high operating costs, and poorly maintained weapon systems and equipment have resulted in weakening Croatia's defence potential. Furthermore, overall defence capabilities simply do not meet the demands of future tasks and missions.

THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA ARMED FORCES (CAF)
Evolving changes in the security environment and future collective defence obligations imply a need to conceptually re-assess defence, make the necessary readjustments and, over the long term, develop a defence system that is more responsive to the new challenges.

The strategic objective of Croatia's defence transformation is to improve its capacity to protect national interests and enable for its full Euro-Atlantic integration. The transition from an individual, territorially-based self-defence concept to one based on a collective notion will require structural and procedural changes, most likely including legislative adjustments. A new type of military structure will have to be adopted. Civil defence will have to be re-examined and its role and function will be subject to indepth analysis. Military doctrines and standards, compatible with those of NATO, will be developed, as well as a required level of interoperability.

The success of defence transformation will greatly depend on achieving broad public support, particularly in securing adequate resource allocations for defence efforts.

## The Republic Of Croatia Armed

![15_Image_4.Png](15_Image_4.Png) Forces (Caf)

The role of the CAF is to provide for national defence, support Croatia's foreign and security policy, and assist civil authorities in emergency and crisis situations. The CAF missions and tasks are shaped to meet future national defence requirements as well as its commitments stemming from NATO membership. Developing the right force structure and corresponding military capabilities will be based on existing and future threats, and will be subject to the constraints of available resources.

Mission and task analysis leads to recognizing the kind of capabilities the CAF ought to possess and the enabling force elements needed. The future force

![15_image_1.png](15_image_1.png) elements most necessary are already imbedded in the existing CAF structure. The coming transformation will simply be focused on striking the right balance between the remaining necessary elements with the available resources and capability requirements.

The currently professional and conscript mix of the CAF will gradually lead to the development of a professional force. Compulsory military service is expected to be provisionally suspended in the near-term (most likely by the next 5 years). Voluntary military service will be introduced as a basic source of new recruits for active and 'contract' reserve units. Voluntary military service shall not exceed 2,000 personnel per year and will also be open to women.

Future CAF Missions And Tasks The role of the CAF is based on Constitutional provisions and defence legislation, and is further elaborated in formal strategic documents. The CAF missions and tasks (See Annexe for detailed list) are derived from Croatia's threat and risk assessment, growing international obligations and future commitments stemming from NATO and EU
accession. These missions and tasks, listed below, will direct the further development of Croatia's force structure and military capabilities.

non-military tasks.

![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png)

These future missions and tasks have already been adopted by the Republic of Croatia Government and represent a key starting point for defining military capabilities that still need to be developed.

Croatia's risk and threat assessment outlines four key scenarios for which effective response capabilities must be developed.

The perception that a direct, conventional military threat to Croatia is highly

![16_image_4.png](16_image_4.png)

unlikely has important implications for existing military capabilities. At the same time, a new spectrum of asymmetric threats is emerging to which Croatia has yet to respond by developing adequate capabilities.

New military capabilities that anable the CAF to effectively prepare for and successfully take part in a variety of crisis response operations are called for. The CAF are more likely expected to take part in operations abroad rather than at home. In that sense, the necessary support infrastructure will either be strictly limited or non existent at all.

THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA ARMED FORCES (CAF)
Likewise, Croatia will most likely participate in operations as part of a larger UN, NATO or EU force, or some other ad hoc coalition of forces. This assumption rules out the need to develop or maintain an extensive set of capabilities designed for a broad spectrum of scenarios. Instead, Croatia needs to develop well-balanced, coherent and flexible forces, capable of effective action in concert with other partner countries and allies. CAF units must be trained and equipped to respond to these requirements.

Membership in the PfP program, and especially byway of the MAP process, augments Croatia's capacity to take part in international peace-support operations. Croatia is preparing a selective set of forces designed to take part in NATO/PfP-led operations. These forces also represent the foundation on which future force contributions will be made once Croatia accedes to NATO.

Future military capabilities will be carefully planned and gradually developed. Important factors to be taken into account include: limited capacity to train sufficient number of personnel and units; constrained equipment and weapon modernisation potential; and issues of the affordability of certain capabilities. In developing the necessary capabilities, Croatia expects to consult key Partners and the North Atlantic Alliance on a regular basis.

The ultimate objective is to achieve, maintain and consistently improve military capabilities that enable the CAF to execute their missions effectively and efficiently. The new capabilities must fully satisfy national defence requirements and enable the CAF to perform other tasks prescribed by the Constitution and set out in the law. Following NATO accession, the CAF must have the capacity to take part in the Alliance's collective defence framework.

In defining the necessary military

![17_image_1.png](17_image_1.png)

capabilities, several basic scenario-related assumptions had to be made. CAF capabilities were assumed prior to and after full NATO integration.

Pending NATO accession, the CAF
must have the capacity to:
conduct a joint operation in defence of national territory; conduct an operation in response to a national crisis with forces equivalent to a task-tailored battalion; take part in international crises response operations with forces equivalent to a company (not including individual personnel contributions to ongoing international missions).

After NATO accession, the CAF must have the capacity to:
conduct a joint operation in defence of national territory, invoking Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty; take part in a collective defence operation with pre-designated forces (a reinforced company until 2009, a battalion after 2009);
conduct an operation in response to a national crisis with forces equivalent to a task-tailored battalion; take part in an international crises response operation with forces equivalent to a company Military capabilities must ensure the timely deployment of CAF units in the above mentioned operations. As a result, and depending upon the task at hand, CAF units will have different levels of readiness.

High readiness forces must be ready for deployment within 24 hours in various types of national operations, and within 5 days in various types of international operations if part of NATO
Response Force (NRF) or EU Battlegroups.

Ready forces should reach full combat readiness in 30 days, and are assigned with the task to protect national Defence System Adjustments THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA ARMED FORCES (CAF)

![18_image_2.png](18_image_2.png)

19
interests and for tasks within the scope of the Alliance. Ready forces (except for air space surveillance) will be fully deployable, equipped and trained for activities on the entire territory of the Republic of Croatia. About 40% of the overall land forces will be equipped and trained for deployment outside national borders. Ready forces will fully consist of professional, active-duty personnel.

Forces with a low level of readiness can reach their full combat readiness within a period of 30 to 90 days. They are intended for support, engagement and replacement of ready forces, and consist of 'contract' reserves and professional, active duty personnel.

Forces that require a longer period to mobilize can reach full combat readiness within a period of 120 to 180 days. These forces are primarily intended for national defence and act as force supplements, and are filled with unassigned reservists.

The Strategic Defence Review does not provide a comprehensive list of all military capabilities, but rather highlights military capabilities which are crucial for CAF structuring and development. These include:
joint capability and actions with Partners and Allies; deployability and mobility; integrated command and control system; land force capabilities; naval capabilities; air force capabilities; training and education system; logistics system.

## Joint Capability And Actions With Partners And Allies

Most of the operations the CAF are expected to take part in the future will be conducted as joint operations. Thus, the further transformation of the CAF will be based on the development of joint capabilities. This includes:

a single, inter-service command and control system; the sufficient interoperability of equipment; the co-ordination of service and branch doctrines with a joint doctrine; the establishment of a single communications information system, designed to integrate service radar systems for air space and sea surveillance, as well as other communications systems; the intensification of English and other foreign language training in order to increase the CAF ability to act with Partners and Allies; the development of integrated capabilities for providing close air support for ground and naval operations.

## Deployability And Mobility

![18_Image_3.Png](18_Image_3.Png)

NATO and the EU have established a framework for developing capabilities its current and future member states seek to realize, aiming to create combined forces. This framework has determined a basic requirement—member countries need to develop modern, deployable and mobile forces able to function effectively within a multinational effort and achieve common objectives.

The CAF will be developed as an integrated force able to provide for national defence and meet the requirements of Euro-Atlantic integration. The CAF will look to maintain 40% of its land component structured, trained and equipped for deployment (consistent with the Istanbul conclusions). Up to 8% of its land forces may be assigned to a particular operation or be designated for future NATO operations (one reinforced company with rotation or 700-800-size contingent without rotation). If called upon, the entire professional, active duty component of the CAF will be obligated

to participate in international operations.

Deployability and mobility of the armed forces will be achieved by:
increasing CAF tactical/strategic air transport capabilities, as existing aircraft will be modernised and two new middle and long-distance transport aircrafts will be procured; preparing the necessary infrastructure and means necessary for effectively deploying forces in an operation; the procurement of combat and other armoured and transport vehicles; retaining and developing tactical air transport.

Mobility will be ensured for all deployable forces immediately after they have been declared ready and for the rest of the forces by a predefined date.

The mobility and sustainability of CAF deployment will be provided for independently or in co-operation with other NATO member countries. 

## Integrated Command And Control

![19_Image_4.Png](19_Image_4.Png) System

An integrated CAF command and control system must ensure for the continued command and control of all CAF
elements at home and abroad. It must ensure continuity under normal peacetime and wartime circumstances, as well as during crises, disasters and other emergency situations.

A new Operations Command Centre within the Joint Staff will facilitate the command and control of all CAF unit activities at home and abroad.

A CAF communications and information system (CIS) will support command and control, and should consist of the following key capabilities:
CAF system integration; compatibility with the corresponding systems of NATO member countries; exchange of information with NATO
member countries; provide support to forces deployed in international crisis response operations;

![19_image_1.png](19_image_1.png)

provide host nation support to forces of NATO member countries; gather, process and distribute information on conditions at sea and in the air to would-be users. 

## Land Force Capabilities

The Land Forces will represent the backbone across the four CAF missions. It will be necessary to develop a range of combat capabilities, including the capability to deploy and take part in mobile, offensive operations. Heavy armour is unlikely to be deployed. The emphasis for deployment will be on light mobile forces that are sustainable and able to protect themselves. As a result, new acquisitions, such as highly mobile combat vehicles (on wheels), will be required.

Commitments to deploy forces abroad will also require the intensification of adequate training. Along with combat capabilities, Land Forces will develop capabilities deemed necessary in order to take part in humanitarian operations and provide support and assistance to national services. When a crisis or emergency situation exceeds the capacity of respective national services to act effectively, the Land Forces may be expected to protect and rescue people and property and to provide other assistance to civil authorities.

The capabilities and forces designated for NATO operations upon Croatia's accession to the Alliance (along with those declared well before accession) will be based on the units already outlined in the Partnership Goals. By 2009, these forces will represent a foundation for developing task-tailored forces intended for NATO or EU-led operations.

Combat units will exclusively consist of professionals and 'contract' reserves. Reserve units will have an active duty core element responsible for training military personnel and organic units in Defence System Adjustments THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA ARMED FORCES (CAF)

![20_image_2.png](20_image_2.png)

accordance with the required tasks.

Organisation on a corps basis will be abolished and brigades will represent the largest operational units of Land Forces.

The Land Forces will consist of two main units, a motorized brigade and an armoured-mechanized brigade, both fully professionalized. Battalions within these brigades will represent the basic module for the formation of task-tailored forces.

These battalions will be mobile, deployable, equipped and trained as rapid reaction forces. Tank battalions will not develop capabilities for deployment outside the national territory.

The brigades will also include all the necessary combat support units and services. This will ensure the required capabilities of fire power, anti-armoured combat, low altitude anti-aircraft defence, NBC defence and protection, providing mobility and counter-mobility, as well as self-sufficient logistic support for the conduct of operations.

A professionalized (guards) motorized brigade will include four motorized infantry battalions. In an effort to increase their overall combat power, the brigades will be gradually equipped with combat vehicles on wheels. In addition to national defence tasks, the brigade is expected to take part in NATO and EUled operations.

A professionalized (guards)
armoured-mechanized brigade will include two tank and two mechanized battalions with combat support units and services. While the brigade as a whole is not intended for NATO operations, its training and standards will be adjusted in accordance with NATO doctrine so as to be interoperable with Allied forces.

Combat support will be organised as an integral element of professional brigades, as well as independent combat support units. While certain units will be entirely professionalized, others will be made up of reserve components. Reserve units will consist of an active duty core

![20_image_0.png](20_image_0.png)

![20_image_1.png](20_image_1.png)

![20_image_3.png](20_image_3.png)

element, responsible for assigning personnel and unit training. Artillery units will provide manoeuvrable and mid-range fire support under all weather and combat conditions
(including NBC). Existing artillery, rocket launchers and other weapon systems will be used. In addition to these basic capabilities, artillery units will gradually further improve their mobility and sustainability.

Signal units provide basic and specialized communication capabilities by establishing and maintaining stationary and mobile signal components. Thus, signal units may also provide communication and information support to forces deployed abroad (whether in crisis response operations or for collective defence purposes) and, as host nation support, to forces of NATO member countries while on Croatian territory.

They are also expected to provide support to civil institutions in national emergency and crisis situations. The equipment and standard operative procedures of signal units will become compatible with those of the Alliance.

Achieving interoperability in this area will represent one of the highest priorities of CAF acquisition and modernisation efforts through 2015.

Anti-aircraft units of the Land Forces are intended to provide anti-aircraft combat capability at low altitudes and will be equipped with existing weapon systems. These units will participate in protecting vital CAF elements and critical infrastructure within an integrated air defence system.

Engineering units are intended to support sustainability, mobility and counter-mobility requirements. Limited de-mining capabilities will be retained and further developed since a significant portion of Croatia's territory has yet to be cleared of left-over mines from the

recent Homeland War. Likewise, this capability could be useful in international operations. The CAF will continue to develop military capabilities that can also support designated civil services in search and rescue efforts in a disaster situation where lives and material values are at risk.

NBC units maintain capabilities for NBC protection of CAF units through the organisation and conduct of decontamination, as well as gathering, processing and distributing data on possible contaminants. NBC unit organisation and equipment will enable for its use in international operations and activities that call for such capabilities.

Considering the growing danger of terrorist attacks, capabilities designed to detect NBC contaminants and WMD material must be fully developed, as well as the capacity to rapidly and safely neutralize such threats. In the event of a terrorist attack, it may be necessary to contain and remove the consequences of NBC related hazards. These capabilities may also be used to assist civil institutions in dealing with the dangerous aftereffects stemming from industrial accidents and technological disasters.

A special operations unit will develop capabilities for executing specific military and other important tasks.

A military intelligence unit is intended to provide intelligence support to the CAF and will develop the necessary capabilities for the gathering, analysis and distribution of intelligence information, particularly important for planning and executing military operations. In addition, the unit will also provide assistance to civil institutions whenever it relates to issues of national importance.

Military Police units continue to develop, in accordance with legal provisions, their existing capabilities for conducting fundamental military police tasks in Croatia. These units will be organised under a single command and will provide

![21_image_1.png](21_image_1.png) military police support to all segments of the CAF. The equipment, training and standard procedures to be adopted will allow the Military Police to participate in international crisis response operations.

Reserve units will be used for national defence purposes, but it will also be possible to use certain reserve components in augmenting CAF efforts in international operations. The current size of the reserve will be further reduced. On the other hand, reserve training will be intensified in order to increase their effectiveness. The concept of contract reserves will be gradually introduced. The contract reserves are expected to make up some 50% of the active duty component by 2010. After the expiration of their contracts, both active duty personnel and contract reserve will be placed on a non-assigned reserve list. The current obligatory reserve personnel will be gradually placed on the non-assigned reserve list. 

## Naval Capabilities

Given Croatia's geographic maritime characteristics of an extensive coastline and numerous islands, the Croatian Navy is faced with numerous challenges. The Navy must look to protect Croatia's national interests in the Adriatic by developing a balanced set of forces and the necessary capabilities. These would be aimed at protecting Croatia's territorial waters and ecological and fishing zones of interest. The Navy will also be expected to meet asymmetric threats and assure for free navigation in the Adriatic Sea. Likewise, it will undertake search and rescue tasks, contribute to defence diplomacy efforts, provide host nation support to Croatia's allies and assist civil institutions. A separate study to be conducted during 2005 will examine the potential of developing future naval capabilities that could contribute to Defence System Adjustments THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA ARMED FORCES (CAF)

![22_image_1.png](22_image_1.png)

![22_image_2.png](22_image_2.png)

23

![22_image_4.png](22_image_4.png)

NATO or EU-led maritime operations.

In the short term, naval forces will be consolidated into two main functional groupings.

The first naval grouping will consist of interdiction forces (primarily based on three fast missile crafts), mobile landbased missile batteries, and mine countermeasure forces. An anti submarine capability will also be retained in this functional grouping. The introduction of inshore and port mine hunters currently being developed and the establishment of port mine clearance diving teams will be a priority. This should assure for secure and free navigation channels and augment the CAF's overall anti-terrorist capabilities.

The second naval grouping will be responsible for Coast Guard tasks and will work closely with other national agencies and institutions in safeguarding Croatia's sovereignty and assuring for law enforcement in the Adriatic under Croatian jurisdiction. The Coast Guard will also conduct appropriate patrols and monitoring of the fisheryecological zone, develop capabilities for the conduct of anti-terrorist activities, counter-smuggling of human beings, goods and WMDs, monitor and control state borders at sea, conduct search and rescue, prevent ecological catastrophes and ensure free navigation at sea and prevent illegal fishing and other unlawful activities. When deemed necessary, naval interception forces may assist the Coast Guard in executing their tasks.

Over time, coastguard functions are expected to dominate naval activities in the Adriatic Sea. Therefore, defence efforts will focus on allocating adequate investment funds in modernizing and equipping the Croatian Navy to achieve the necessary capabilities.

The CIS unit will integrate the various elements of sea and air space surveillance, as well as elements for securing of

![22_image_0.png](22_image_0.png)

![22_image_3.png](22_image_3.png)

the communication system. The Peregrine radar system will be integrated into the FPS 117 radars. This should ensure that comprehensive radar data be available to various national agencies and other non-military users.

The Navy's logistics support efforts will retain a technical supply capacity, the ability to conduct second level maintenance, the capacity to service its vessels and host nation support capabilities.

## Air Force Capabilities

Given the threat assessment set out earlier, Croatia does not need to develop large-scale air defence capabilities. However, given the increased likelihood of terrorist activity, particularly involving aircraft, air policing remains a key CAF national defence obligation. The Air Force will be required to support the operational needs of Land Forces to deploy and sustain. It is also expected to provide the necessary infrastructure that can be available to NATO partners. The Air Force will also contribute to the other military missions by conducting search and rescue operations, as well as providing assistance to civil authorities in the event of natural disasters and emergencies.

Twelve MIG-21 aircraft were recently upgraded for air policing tasks and are expected to provide the necessary air capability until 2010 at maximum. In the short term, operating capabilities will be enhanced by the purchase of aids to improve reduced visibility in difficult conditions and at night. A replacement weapons platform will be needed in the medium term to assure the continuation of meeting this task. Any replacement aircraft would be obtained only after a full combined operational evaluation and investment appraisal (COIA), which would include all related activity including maintenance of combat readiness, the ability to sustain fast jet

24

![23_image_4.png](23_image_4.png)

training and the need for appropriate modern weapons systems. Given the long lead in times associated with aircraft introduction and the anticipated degradation of the MIG 21 fleet, a full feasibility study (inclusive of the COIA) is being commissioned to report by the end of 2006.

Special emphasis will be placed on the development of capabilities for the tactical transport of company-level forces within Croatia for anti terrorist operations. This capability will also be available to allow the CAF to participate in various humanitarian and other operations and tasks in support of civil institutions within Croatia and in its immediate surrounding areas. This task can be met with existing fixed wing aircraft and transport helicopters. It is increasingly important that Croatia is capable of deploying on operations outside of national boundaries as part of wider NATO and EU operations. Air transport will therefore be augmented by the acquisition of two additional transport aircraft with medium and long range capability.

The Air Force will retain its national commitment to operate fire fighting aircraft and in that regard support civil authorities. This role is backed by separate funding provisions. Similarly the Air Force will also maintain a limited capability (2 helicopters) to provide civil medical evacuation from remote areas.

A new role for the Air Force will be to provide maritime patrol capabilities over designated areas of the Adriatic Sea and in support of coastguard operations directed at illegal activities in the Adriatic. This will be provided from the existing fixed-wing fleet or by helicopter as dictated by operational needs.

Fundamental to air operations is adequate radar coverage which is now provided by the recently installed modern FPS 117 radars. The picture from these

radars will shortly be ready for contributing to the NATO system (ASDE).

![23_image_1.png](23_image_1.png)

Similarly the intention remains to integrate the FPS 117 with the Peregrine Naval radar to improve low level radar cover in support of coastguard, naval and civil usage. 

## Training And Education

Service training and doctrine development will be the responsibility of the service commands, while the Croatian Military Academy will focus on military and civilian educational and the CAF's scientific research and development efforts.

Service commands will provide systematic, high-quality individual and unit training, consistent with NATO standards, at various CAF training centres and in the units.

The Land Forces Combat Training Centre will provide a battalion-level command and unit training capacity, as well as the capability for command training up to the brigade-level at the Simulation Centre.

The training system will be capable of efficiently and fully satisfying CAF
needs for branch, service and joint training. Apart from the development of training programs, the branch commands will ensure and co-ordinate the use of all resources necessary for training, taking into account adjustments to meet unit requirements and tasks.

For the purpose of training logistic specialities, a logistics training centre is being established within the Support Command.

Specific military police training will be conducted within the framework the Military Police. The Croatian Military Academy, as a central body responsible for the development and conduct of military and civilian education in the defence and security area, as well as for the development of Defence System Adjustments THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA ARMED FORCES (CAF)

![24_image_1.png](24_image_1.png)

![24_image_2.png](24_image_2.png)

25

![24_image_3.png](24_image_3.png)

scientific work to meet CAF needs, will provide:
the education of officers in co-operation with civil institutions; the military and functional education for officers and NCOs; the education for military and civilian personnel designated to work in multinational headquarters; the integration and development of a civil-military educational system; the scientific research work requirements in support of Croatia's national security and defence; the development of a distance learning system for defence requirements; a publishing capacity and classic and electronic libraries.

The Croatian Military Academy will be primarily organised as an educational institution rather than as a military unit.

## Logistics Capabilities

The logistics system will maintain and develop capabilities for providing integrated and continuous logistic support to CAF elements at home and abroad.

Daily logistics and functioning support capabilities will be centralized in all CAF elements, relying as much as possible on the services of civilian organisations in those activities that have no direct influence on the combat readiness of CAF units and commands.

Capabilities for material resource maintenance will be developed within the CAF in a part that is of vital importance for performing operational tasks of commands and units. Technical equipment maintenance will be conducted within the CAF to an extent that will enable reaching a required level of combat readiness of CAF units. Maintenance will be, to the greatest extent possible, conducted within a domestic commercial capacity.

The CAF logistics units will develop capabilities for the conduct of logistic support within the framework of national and collective defence, as well as in crisis situations, by ensuring the conduct of

![24_image_0.png](24_image_0.png)

all peacetime and wartime operations, including possible assistance to civilian institutions.

Development will continue to focus on achieving capabilities that are interoperable with the logistics systems of NATO member countries. For this purpose, adequate changes will be made in logistics training and education. The CAF are developing, adopting and applying military processes to meet NATO STANAG norms.

The logistics system will maintain existing capabilities and continue to develop new capabilities for ensuring logistics support to CAF units deployed in international peace operations (up to a battalion-level unit) and for enabling effective CAF logistics unit support in NATO-led operations.

Logistics support will also continue to develop capabilities necessary for Croatia to contribute host nation support to NATO and EU forces. Croatia expects to fully develop its host nation support capacity by 2009.

In accordance with its defined missions and tasks, the CAF will develop and maintain capabilities for providing support to civil institutions, in case of natural disasters and technical accidents.

Theses include providing accommodation, supplying food and water, providing water purification, and offering transport capabilities.

The CAF health care system will maintain and develop the existing capabilities of preventive, primary and dental health care of CAF members. In addition, the health care system will develop specialist and advisory care for CAF members at military medical centres, but will also assure specialist care for its personnel at civilian hospitals. A sub-specialized field will be developed to meet the needs

THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA ARMED FORCES (CAF)
of aviation and naval medicine.

The CAF will also develop the medical support for individuals and units deployed in international operations. This includes medical preparation and immunization of military personnel that find themselves in difficult climates and complex health conditions, as well as the preparation of ROLE-1 modules and ROLE-2 level of health care outlined in the Partnership Goals. Furthermore, the CAF will develop capabilities for the conduct of veterinary care, medical supplies, medical training and medical care.

The entire spectrum of CAF medical support will be augmented by Croatia's national health care system and by allied medical capacities when deployed in operations abroad.

## Force Structure

The CAF structure is derived from the force elements given in Appendix 7.4. The basic modules consist of a battalion for combat branches, a battalion/company for combat support branches, and a squadron for the air forces and a division for the navy. Each basic module has been assigned one primary and one or more secondary tasks. The number of necessary elements for the fulfilment of tasks is one of the factors that define future capability requirements.

The future force structure comes from the defined elements of combat forces, in compliance with the basic principles of effectiveness, modularity and concentration of available resources. Other force elements (command and control, oversight, education, training, and logistics) supplement the structure in compliance with the same principles.

The new force structure enables a balanced development of necessary capabilities given existing budget constraints.

Therefore, in creating the structure, overlapping responsibilities are avoided, while the administrative segment is

![25_image_0.png](25_image_0.png)

![25_image_2.png](25_image_2.png) reduced to a minimum. The number of command levels is rationalized, with an aim to provide the effectiveness of a single command and control system, as well as a clear division of responsibilities and areas of competence.

The size of the future CAF will not exceed 16,000 active duty military personnel, while the number of civilians in CAF structures will not exceed 2,000. The CAF reserve component will number up to 8,000 strong and consist of contract reserves. These figures result from seeking the right balance between budgetdriven affordability limitations and the need to develop effective capabilities designed to respond to existing and future risks and threats.

The target goal of the future size of the CAF will be realized by downsizing the current force through a carefully planned approach, the dynamics of reorganisation and a transformation to the new structure.

The main characteristics of the proposed CAF structure are:
reduction of the number of units; reduction of the number of command levels; filling ready forces with professionals; filling reserve units with active core; the reorganisation of the reserve component on the basis of a contract reserve; a single CAF education system and service training system; reduced size of command components at all levels; single stationary logistics system based on outsourcing; joint action capability of CAF units and modularly organised operation commands.

The CAF Long Term Development Plan will determine the dynamics, ways and framework for gradual, phased Defence System Adjustments THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA ARMED FORCES (CAF) 

![26_image_2.png](26_image_2.png)

27

![26_image_4.png](26_image_4.png)

defence reform efforts. In the first phase, emphasis will be placed on the reorganisation, replenishment, equipping and achieving readiness of the units declared for participation in NATO/PfP-led operations, as well as on the reduction of organisational units and command structures. In the later phases, other CAF elements and units will also be reorganised.

The CAF General Staff (CAF GS) is a joint armed forces body within the lish task-force commands responsible for

![26_image_0.png](26_image_0.png)

![26_image_1.png](26_image_1.png) directing the efforts of forces assigned to operations.

The present CAF GS departments will be reorganised in a manner that better clarifies the distinction between the many responsibilities of operational planning and managing military operations from that of other CAF tasks and activities. In that sense, certain management functions will be reorganised, while

![26_image_3.png](26_image_3.png)

Ministry of Defence. The General Staff is responsible for command, preparation and use of the CAF, exercising its authority in accordance with decisions made by the commander-in-chief and the minister of defence, as outlined in Article 100 of the Defence Law. The General Staff is responsible for CAF activities and force deployments, and performs other expert tasks requested by the commander-inchief and the minister of defence.

Operations Command Centre will be organised within the General Staff, with the responsibility of facilitating daily command and control of operations at home and abroad. For the purpose of planning and conducting large-scale operations, the General Staff will estabother new functions will be introduced, such as the establishment of two deputy chiefs of the General Staff.

Staff units are subordinate to the General Staff and support the integrated functioning of the CAF. The CAF Military Police will be reorganised and integrated into a single unit under one command.

Signals Unit will be organised as a staff unit and will provide for a fully functional stationary, network-information and encryption signal system, as well as functional radio system. This should secure continuity, rapidity and encryption within the command and reporting system, as well as the strategic transmission of information.

THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA ARMED FORCES (CAF)
The Honorary Protocol Unit will also include a CAF orchestra and will perform protocol tasks.

The Electronic Surveillance Service will conduct electronic activities at the strategic level.

The International Military Operations Training Centre will be organised at the strategic level, with the task of training individuals and units for participation in international operations.

The three CAF branch commands will be responsible for organising, replenishing, developing, equipping and training of command and unit components for performing specially-tailored tasks. Units under their command will be at the necessary level of readiness. The service commands will also be responsible for professional development of personnel, development of service and branch doctrine, as well as for the training of active and reserve personnel. They will also participate in other tasks as required, such as contributing to the development of joint doctrine.

Professionalized active duty and reserve forces (with an active core element) will be organised under a Land Forces Command. A motorized guard brigade and an armoured-mechanized brigade, as well as special operations unit will be fully professionalized and will form a major CAF combat element. One reserve infantry brigade will be organised from the other combat forces under the Land Forces Command. Combat support will comprise of a fully professionalized military intelligence unit, an NBC
unit and a signal unit, as well as reserve units (artillery-rocket unit, anti-aircraft unit and engineering unit). Logistic support for combat units and combat support units will be ensured through the organisation of organic logistic units and through the organisation of a logistics brigade, consisting mainly of reservists.

Training of Land Force personnel and units will be the responsibility of the

![27_image_0.png](27_image_0.png)

![27_image_1.png](27_image_1.png)

![27_image_3.png](27_image_3.png) active core component, organised within the reserve branch units. Command training will be conducted at the Simulation Centre, while the Combat Training Centre will facilitate combat training.

All Air Force and Air Defence units will be fully professionalized and organised into two air force brigades and one CIS unit (air monitoring and guidance and signals). Air force brigades include squadrons of planes and helicopters, as well as logistics units for servicing and maintenance of aircraft technical equipment.

The air monitoring and guidance unit is responsible for the continuous surveillance of Croatia's air space, with the aim of contributing to protecting the sovereignty of its air space.

The Air Force and Air Defence Command is responsible for integrating the overall defence and protection of Croatia's air space. It will also assure that its forces work with and support coastguard efforts in Croatia's part of the Adriatic.

Individual training for particular service requirements will be facilitated by the service training centres.

The Croatian Navy will be a fully professionalized force. Apart from its traditional tasks of safeguarding Croatia's national interests in the Adriatic, the Navy Command will also prepare units for undertaking coast guard tasks. Establishing the coastguard within the Croatian naval forces is a rational solution and most appropriate approach in consolidating inter-agency efforts in this field. The Navy's existing capacities
(radars, ships, and trained personnel) provide the most comprehensive framework for fully developing an effective National coastguard capability, particularly for tasks and missions on the open sea. The Navy already maintains fully trained

professionals and has the training capabilities for these tasks. In that sense, naval forces will be organised into two flotillas. Support to the naval forces will be provided by littoral forces and a CIS unit (coastal surveillance and signals unit). Other service elements will be embedded within these littoral forces and will be able to provide special support to naval forces.

Individual training needs of the service will be conducted at the naval training centre. In an effort to ensure an economization during peace-time and more effective support to CAF operations, a system of logistic and medical support will be integrated within the Support Command.

Apart from facilitating logistics support and health care, the Support Command will also be responsible for training of logistics and medical personnel. Maintenance and improving the quality of life at military facilities will be outsourced and will be to the greatest extent possible based on commercial assets. Storage facilities will be integrated and rationally consolidated around a smaller number of locations.

Logistics units and elements will be organised in a manner that assures effective logistics support to forces involved in an operation. This will be done by enabling individuals, unit elements or specialized logistic units to be assigned to an operation command.

In transforming the logistics system, new functional components will be organised within the Support Command. These will include a Centre for Movement Co-ordination and a Centre for Munitions Control and Maintenance.

Logistics and medical units, intended as operations support elements, will consist of military personnel, while the stationary logistic system will primarily be made up of civilian personnel.

The Croatian Military Academy is an organisation responsible to meet the education requirements of CAF personnel.

Military education will be conducted in an integrated manner and within the CAF system, through a system of military education and in cooperation with civilian education institutions. The Academy will have organisational elements for the education of officers, NCOs and civilians. The Academy will also facilitate research activities and publish materials of interest to the armed forces.

## The Role Of Civil Defence

Civil defence is an integral part of

![28_image_2.png](28_image_2.png)

Croatia's overall defence efforts. A civil component along with its military counterpart make-up the fundamental basis of Croatia's defence and will continue to augment a holistic approach to ensure that adequate capabilities be developed in response to a full spectrum of new risks and threats. As new CAF capabilities are being shaped to meet non-traditional tasks, so too, the efforts of civil organisations and institutions must be adapted to the new realities and be able to provide protection and rescue capabilities and must be able to respond effectively in a national emergency or crisis situation.

The primary role of civil defence is to prepare the nation for defence and provide for the non-military defence of the country. This role is achieved through a system of institutions and activities, which include planning, integrating, directing and co-ordinating civilian assets and efforts deemed important for national defence. Civil defence encompasses national, local and regional government bodies; legal persons responsible for defence preparations; and protection and rescue agencies and other organisations responsible for safeguarding lives and material values.

The non-military efforts of civil defence ensure the functioning of gov-

ernment bodies, businesses and public services in a crisis. In that sense, civil defence is responsible for the protection of the population and assuring access to vital supplies, and for supporting military defence efforts.

The changes to Croatia's overall defence system, based on the new strategic realities and evolving security circumstances, will be reflected in its civil defence component. Civil defence must adapt to the changing circumstances and be able to effectively respond to the new threats and risks, but it must also evolve into a modern system supporting Croatia's NATO and EU integration, where challenges are dealt with in common and collective efforts. The strong national dimension of civil defence requires that reforms in this area call for close co-operation among government ministries and agencies.

Civil defence reforms have already been initiated. A special inter-governmental group has been established and is assessing the present role of civil defence, with the intent to examine its potential future development. Given the complex nature of civil defence, any significant reforms will surely require strategic considerations and will affect existing legal norms. The role and key functions of civil defence will be subject to review, which could impact on day-to-day activities, planning and organisational structures. In any event, the future of civil defence needs to be in conformity with such efforts in NATO and EU countries.

Considering the nature of modern risks and threats, crisis management warrants special attention. Croatia must have the capacity and be fully able to deal with a crisis situation and it must effectively respond, both at the national and international level. Croatia will develop a host nation support capability to deal with national, neighbouring or regional crisis which call for international assistance. Support will be available for forces

![29_image_0.png](29_image_0.png)

![29_image_2.png](29_image_2.png) stationed on Croatia's territory or in transit to a crisis, and will be based on planned CAF capabilities and civil capacities and assets. Croatia is committed to contribute to international peace-support operations abroad, especially in the reconstruction of crisis-afflicted areas. In order to develop the necessary capabilities to undertake these highly complex tasks, a systematic approach and close civil-military co-operation will be required.

Croatia's civil defence system must be able to effectively respond to the new threats and risks and adapt to the requirements of collective defence. In order to do that, the following needs to be accomplished.

Civil defence will be reassessed and redefined based on new national security and defence requirements; existing civil defence legislation will be amended (expanded to encompass emergency and crisis situations); the civil defence system will be reorganised at the national level; civil defence capabilities designed to support Croatia's international obligations should be strengthened, Organisational adjustments need to reflect any conceptual changes.

An appropriate information system that facilitates comprehensive logistics support will be developed. This should help Croatia to consolidate its overall capacity to deal with national emergencies and to effectively manage crisis. The intention is also to strengthen Croatia's collective defence potential, crisis response efforts and other international activities.

Croatia plans to establish a fullyintegrated, national system of civil and civil-military crisis management by the end of 2009.

Once the new conceptual framework of civil defence has been adopted, the corresponding human, financial and

other resources will be addressed through separately adopted plans.

## The Key Enablers Of Defence Changes

Professionalization The growing trend of potential conscripts that are increasingly opting to exercise their national defence obligation through civil rather than military service is a new source of concern. Furthermore, the length of military service for conscripts is not long enough to meet the necessary training requirements to handle a growingly complex array of military technical equipment. Future CAF missions and tasks will be increasingly more demanding and modernisation efforts will call for more technically capable personnel. These and other reasons point to new organisational requirements, namely, filling the CAF ranks with volunteers.

Considering these requirements and taking into account the findings of a national study to professionalize the armed forces, the Strategic Defence Review proposes a gradual transition to a fully professional CAF and the introduction of a reserve component based on a
'contract' (paid) reserve.

A decision to suspend obligatory military conscription has strong political, social and economic implications. Important issues of military organisation and other aspects of the defence system will have to be addressed, as well as the various social concerns that may emerge. A gradual move towards professional armed forces will be realized through carefully prepared and thoughtful defence development plans. In accordance with a decision to professionalize its forces, Croatia's legal provisions dealing with military obligation will be correspondingly adjusted. The recruitment of new personnel and reserve readiness will also be defined.

Doctrine

![30_image_0.png](30_image_0.png)

![30_image_1.png](30_image_1.png)

One of the basic characteristics of a good organisation is the establishment of rules and principles governing behaviour. In a military organisation, the adopted of a doctrine which enables the co-ordinated use of its capabilities in executing its missions and tasks is of key importance. Key doctrine documents are expected to be developed and adopted by the end of 2007. Future CAF doctrines will be in accordance with NATO doctrines and will incorporate the experiences and valuable lessons from the recent Homeland War.

Future doctrines will enable full CAF
interoperability with forces of NATO member countries in terms of tactics, technical equipment and standard procedures. Regarding independent CAF
efforts, the adopted doctrines will enable for service capability integration and joint action.

The types of doctrines include joint doctrine, service and specialization doctrine, and functional area doctrines.

Doctrine will also direct education and training efforts towards creating plans and programs that will be focused on the CAF missions and tasks.

Along with a full series of doctrinal documents, this effort will lead to encompassing a singular list of all activities derived from the basic missions and tasks, as well as a singular glossary of military terms. In this manner, key defence terminology will be uniquely defined and will thus provide the basis for clearer national and international communication.

## Interoperability And Standards

![30_Image_3.Png](30_Image_3.Png)

The ability to work effectively with its allies is one of the key preconditions for the CAF to be able to take part in a collective defence system. Various elements of Croatia's defence system, including structures, procedures and technical means, need to be interoperable with those of NATO and the EU.

# Defence System Adjustments The Key Enablers Of Defence Changes

![31_Image_0.Png](31_Image_0.Png)

![31_Image_2.Png](31_Image_2.Png)

![31_Image_3.Png](31_Image_3.Png)

32
Interoperability requires adopting and applying standards compatible with those of NATO and the EU.

The current level of CAF interoperability with its partners and future allies needs to be improved. In that sense, challenges include outdated weapons and military equipment, doctrinal shortfalls and lack of proper standards that are in accordance with NATO
STANAGs. In order to increase its interoperability level, Croatia is committed to intensify the planned realization of its Partnership Goals, as outlined in the PARP and MAP process. Fulfilling the Partnership Goals requires the adoption and implementation of extensive NATO norms by the Ministry of Defence and the CAF, as well as by various other bodies at the national level. A systematic process of standardization in the ministry and armed forces was defined and organised in 2003, and is fully focused on NATO norms. This created the necessary framework for the systematic adoption and implementation of norms that Croatia's defence system will be

## Based Upon.

![31_Image_1.Png](31_Image_1.Png)

Budget constraints and a time factor that limits the adoption and implementation of key NATO norms directly affect the progress of Croatia's overall interoperability. Due to budget constraints, collective defence interoperability requirements will be prioritized and realized in the shortest possible time.

The interoperability of defence elements that plan to be engaged in international operations in the near future is a key priority. After that, the interoperability of ready forces is the next priority issue, as well as the eventual interoperability of the entire defence system. In this context, operational norms that define tactics, techniques and procedures have the highest priority, while material and administrative norms have a lower degree of priority at this time. The implementation of all norms called for in the Partnership Goals is based on a carefully planned approach. The required level of force interoperability within the framework of the first priority will be achieved by the end of 2009.

T
The current personnel structure primarily resulted from the establishment of the CAF during a wartime situation and the lack of a systematic approach to personnel management. Today, the personnel structure is characterized by a series of shortfalls that bring into question the effectiveness of the entire defence system. These include an "aging force", where the average age of personnel is inadequate, a relatively excess number of management personnel, lack of qualified personnel and inadequate personnel placement. The lack of a consistent human resource management
(HRM) policy is one of the main reasons for not fully exploiting the human resource potential and for experiencing difficulties in meeting the demands of defence tasks.

A more favourable personnel structure will be achieved through planned recruiting and separation of personnel, within a consistent career management framework. Effective personnel management implies that functions are performed by the correspondingly most competent individuals. In order to achieve this, a clear and fully defined HRM policy will provide the proper guidance for all personnel related issues in an effective and economic manner.

The proper implementation of an HRM policy will ensure the following:
effective recruiting and selection of personnel; effective personnel turnover through planned hiring and separation; transparency and equal opportunity in professional development; objective evaluations and rewards that are also a motivating factor, as well as the stimulation of 'on the job' success; rotations and career advancement; a proper quality of life and family care; a personnel age structure consistent with professional development standards;

![32_image_0.png](32_image_0.png)

![32_image_1.png](32_image_1.png)

an effective personnel structure corresponding to the demands of CAF missions and tasks, as well as budget constraints; a degree of flexibility based on service requirements; effective preparation of personnel for separation.

The efforts that stem from the HRM
policy will be carefully planned and will address four main HRM functions: recruitment and selection, professional development, personnel support and a separation process.

The recruitment of individuals from the job market will focus on obtaining quality personnel that will be able to meet the selective qualifications and demanding requirements of a career in the defence establishment.

A professional development process based on prudent management and career development will ensure that personnel with the proper experience, knowledge and skills are retained. Promotions will be based on principles of equal opportunity and open competition. Career development will be planned in accordance with organisational requirements and budget constraints. The career management approach will also include civilian personnel.

The personnel evaluation procedure will be further developed based on national experiences and the standards of NATO member countries. It will represent an official basis for indicating individual progress in their professional development. The necessary changes in the evaluation process of civilians will result in adopting new regulations at the national level.

The use of Croatia's existing civilian educational institutions will enable for an integrated civil-military education and allow CAF members to gain formal degrees, certificates and licenses.

34
Qualifications gained through a program of military education, at home or abroad within the framework of international military co-operation, will be duly recognized. Given the growing requirements for participation in multinational staffs and other international settings, special attention will be paid to evaluating foreign language capabilities.

The education of civilian personnel will be based on guidance outlined in a national strategy for the professional development of civil servants. In addition, Croatia's international defence partners provide various education opportunities to civilian as well as military personnel, which will be used to the greatest extent possible.

The personnel support program is primarily focused on the needs of individuals. Personnel support foremost includes health care and the quality of life. However, it also represents the recognition that individual efforts eventually contribute to the success of an organisation. Addressing quality of life issues also includes family support programs and housing. Specific and transparent plans designed to deal with housing issues, a central feature of personnel support, will represent a key factor for motivating defence personnel.

The planned separation of personnel is an important prerequisite and turnover factor for getting the right personnel structure and enabling for the normal professional development of younger personnel. A well co-ordinated recruiting and separation process will ensure that the defence system is consistently rejuvenated with new personnel and will be in a position to continually raise the quality of its human resources. The proper separation of personnel will directly affect the success of the recruitment process, creating a recognizable image of the military as a good employer and one that cares for its people.

Human resource management will be

![33_image_1.png](33_image_1.png)

an integrated function. Organisational roles and responsibilities on individual aspects of military and civilian personnel management will be clearly defined. It will also include a unique information support capacity and a system of reporting on personnel readiness, consistent with NATO standards.

The classification of military specialities will be consistent with NATO standards, while at the same time striving to maintain compatibility with national trade and vocation classifications.

Annual recruiting, professional development, posting and separation plans will be adopted on the basis of a Long-Range Human Resource Management Plan. This plan will provide the key numerical indicators necessary to define the target personnel structure, which needs to be achieved and sustained through the end of the planning period.

## Material Resources

Weapons and Military Equipment Developing the necessary military capabilities outlined in the defence review will greatly depend on Croatia's capacity to supply its forces with the proper technical means, especially with modern weapon systems and military equipment. The effort to procure and maintain these technical means will be a most challenging task for the material resources management system, which will be based on principles of efficiency and affordability.

CAF weapons and military equipment consists of an assortment of combat systems, mainly from Eastern Europe, the former Yugoslavia and some Western countries. A small, limited amount has been produced in Croatia. The variety of different types and models of a particular class of weapon is a characteristic of much of the current weapons and equipment.

A significant portion of the 

# Defence Resources

![34_Image_2.Png](34_Image_2.Png) Material Resources

35
equipment has become technologically outdated and is at the end of its life cycle. As a result, the use and maintenance of such weapons and equipment is very demanding, and further complicates efforts to achieve interoperability and compatibility with NATO.

The process of discarding obsolete weapons and military equipment has been going on for several years and has significantly eased the burden of the CAF logistics system, particularly in terms of operational costs. With the adoption of the future force structure, this process will enter its final phase, and will result in freeing valuable financial resources which can be used to enhance CAF material maintenance to higher levels, in accordance with the minimal standards for maintenance. The associated removal and disposal costs will be taken into account. The removal and disposal of ammunition poses particular difficulties and requires a systematic, planned approach. An acceptable, effective and affordable solution could be the establishment of an ammunition disposal site in Croatia, which would be economically justified and represent a quick, logical long-term solution to this problem.

In order to achieve the previously outlined capabilities, significant resources will be allocated to the acquisition of new weapons systems and military equipment, as well as to the modernisation of existing ones. The following priorities will guide these efforts:
meeting the interoperability requirements of those units that are engaged or plan to be engaged in international operations, primarily communications equipment and mobile communication systems, as well as the means to protect the force; command, control and communications systems at all levels, as well as simulation training and education systems; replacement of obsolete combat systems with modern ones based on the priorities of the development of future CAF

![34_image_0.png](34_image_0.png)

![34_image_1.png](34_image_1.png)

![34_image_3.png](34_image_3.png)

![34_image_4.png](34_image_4.png)

capabilities.

While programs to equip and modernize the CAF need to meet stringent quality criteria, an effort will be made to use domestic development and production potentials whenever possible and economically feasible. When weapons and equipment requirements call for international acquisitions, priority will be given to those foreign contractors that provide joint venture opportunities and offset programs. Effectiveness and affordability represent the principle criteria guiding acquisition and modernisation decisions. The process of an acquisition will be fully evaluated along with its accompanying elements and during its entire life span. Where appropriate and in an attempt to rationalize expenditures, readily available commercial options will be used.

Developing interoperable forces is a particularly demanding process. It requires the CAF to adopt and put into practice a series of NATO standards
(STANAGs). For this purpose, an allencompassing, comprehensive system for developing and adopting these standards has been established, consistent with NATO standardization principles.

Croatia has begun to establish the NATO codification system, aiming to ensure a logistics interoperability with NATO forces. Given the extent and complexity of this challenge, and based on the experiences of the new NATO members, Croatia expects to complete the codification process in the next seven to ten years.

The material resource management system will consist of three main organisational structures: an organisation responsible for establishing the business policy, defining the procedural and organisational frameworks in the material resource

# Defence Resources

management system, developing plans and exercising oversight; an organisation responsible for the operational tasks in equipping, acquisition, construction and high level maintenance; a CAF logistics system responsible for the operational support tasks aimed at maintaining existing armed forces capabilities.

During work on the CAF Long Term Development Plan, an Equipping and Modernisation Plan will be developed. Its aim will be to outline the major equipping and modernisation projects necessary to achieve the CAF capability requirements by the year 2015. This includes the possibility of redefining certain capability objectives in accordance with budgetary constraints and the realistic priorities of the entire defence system.

## Facilities And Infrastructure

The CAF make use of and maintain a large number of military buildings, bases, infrastructure and other installations. The maintenance costs of these sites alone represent a significant burden on the available military resources. Whether in use or not, military installations usually need to be guarded and the utilities and other maintenance bills have to be paid.

Defence reforms are also directed at this complex of military infrastructure. The intent is to reduce the number of sites, rationalize their use, and integrate and modernize the remaining elements.

A distinction will be made between military sites that are considered prospective pieces of CAF real estate in the longterm and those sites that the CAF plans to abandon during the relocation of its units. Those military sites to be retained will also be modernised in an attempt to improve the quality of life and working conditions of CAF units.

The release of military installations

![35_image_1.png](35_image_1.png)

will free critical human and financial resources. In turn, these resources will, wherever possible, be used to modernize retained installations and support personnel discharge programs. This has already been foreseen in a program of base conversions and adaptations of nonprospective military installations, which, after government approval, is expected to result in the possible sale, leasing or renting of certain military installations.

The CAF Long Term Development Plan will define the objectives and dynamics of the future development of military installations and infrastructure, where the following key criteria will be respected.

Prospective principle - the identification of bases deemed prospective, in which buildings and infrastructure will be further developed to satisfy highly-set living and working standards of military personnel and units, and the abandonment of military sites that are in an unsatisfactory condition and deemed old and obsolete regardless of the type of installation.

A planned approach - the development of existing buildings and infrastructure in accordance with the operational requirements of CAF relocation efforts.

Consolidation - the grouping of storage facilities by augmenting existing capacities at retained locations (strategic reserves at a several locations, operational and tactical reserves in accordance with the future operative placement of ready forces), consolidation of military sites of all types and for all purposes.

Rationalization - standardization and classification of all military sites, the construction and maintenance of military installations in a simple and affordable manner, the rationalization of energy consumption.

Mobility - the ability to move

![36_Image_2.Png](36_Image_2.Png) Financing

37

![36_image_3.png](36_image_3.png)

buildings and other portable military installations.

Flexibility - the ability to make adaptations to buildings and installations, the capacity to possibly expand and modernize sites in accordance with future requirements and NATO standards (host nation support, training camps),
Economic, demographic and ecological factors and the interests of society as a whole.

## Financing

One of the starting points of this strategic review was to create a force structure that will not only meet the capability requirements, but would also result in a well-balanced budget structure. The intent was to allocate 50% of the budget for personnel expenses, 30% for operational costs, and 20% for equipping, modernisation and other expenses.

Calculations based on reasonable projections of future defence expenditures indicate that the proposed force structure will be able to maintain the necessary capabilities within the relative bounds of this preferred budget structure.

However, the dynamics of achieving the required capabilities will depend on Croatia's ability to fund its defence reforms in a manner which exceeds the projected 1.84% to 1.87% of the GDP. This is particularly important in the coming mid-term period, when most of the proposed reform efforts are expected

![36_image_0.png](36_image_0.png)

![36_image_1.png](36_image_1.png) to take place. Such calculations result from the need to achieve an acceptable level of interoperability and to replace obsolete, outdated combat systems and other equipment necessary for developing the required capabilities, based on the threat and risk assessment, as well as on Croatia's future obligations as a member of NATO.

Given Croatia's economic and political circumstances, it is difficult and perhaps unrealistic to suggest that defence budget allocations would exceed 2% of the GDP. In fact, the necessary equipping and modernisation target period of the CAF can be extended beyond 2015. Furthermore, significant resources for modernisation can come from the sale of military real estate and from other agencies that may have a special interest in the development of CAF capabilities (such as users of radar surveillance data over Croatia).

There are many fiscal options available to support effective defence reforms and the Croatian Government is not limited to simply increasing defence budget expenditures. A decision to undertake defence reforms implies commitments of support from other national institutions and agencies. The success of Croatia's defence reform efforts directly depends on strong political support from the national leadership and its corresponding commitment to provide adequate resources.

Management is an organisational function encompassing planning, organising, directing and control of the defence system. At the highest level of management, the Croatian Constitution and the Defence Law provide the legal framework of responsibilities and relationships of executive and legislative authorities with regard to defence matters. This framework also provides the basic mechanisms for assuring democratic control over the armed forces. The parliamentary Committee on Domestic Policy and National Security is a good example. The Ministry of Defence, which also includes the CAF General Staff, is the key executive body which integrates and manages Croatia's national defence efforts.

## Ministry Of Defence

The role of the Ministry of Defence is to ensure a co-ordinated development of the defence system and use of defence resources, as well as the realization of defence objectives. In addition, the establishment and strengthening of a positive esprit de corps is of utmost importance, as is the development of an organisational culture based on a built-set of values with the following main characteristics:
professionalism, responsibility, accountability, loyalty, ownership, initiative, expertise and contribution. The Ministry of Defence consists of an oversized administration where the responsibilities are often divided and not clearly visible.

This has a negative impact on the effectiveness of the entire organisation and poses serious challenges for the efficient use of human and other available resources.

The Ministry of Defence needs to be reorganised. Reform efforts should look to facilitate more effective defence management (planning, organising, directing and control) in the following core functional areas:
international defence co-operation, interagency co-operation and civilmilitary crisis planning,

![37_image_1.png](37_image_1.png)

human resource management, material resource management (equipping, modernisation and acquisition),
financial resource management (central financing),
intelligence-security activities. In addition, the Ministry of Defence also consists of an administrative capacity and carries out protocol and public relations activities.

The Defence Ministry will focus much of its future reform efforts on downsizing the CAF and increasing its organisation effectiveness. Modern management methods and high standards will be adopted and should characterize future processes in the key functional areas.

With an aim to achieve effectiveness in management, components of the management function will have an organisational body responsible for its co-ordinated functioning through all functional areas of the Ministry of Defence and the CAF (planning, organising and control).

Defence Policy will be formulated on the basis of Croatia's foreign and security policy, and will lead result in explicit guidance for the defence planning process. The Defence Policy and Planning Department will be responsible for this process and will ensure an integrated approach that includes the participation of all the relevant organisational bodies tasked with executing policies and formally adopted defence plans. The defence planning process needs to be more simplified and centralized, yet compatible with NATO planning procedures. Defence planning will be re-evaluated by the middle of 2006.

Organising involves the normative set up of an institution, designing its structure, improving its processes and coordinating its activities. The Ministry of Defence Secretariat is responsible for this

# Defence Management Ministry Of Defence

![38_Image_4.Png](38_Image_4.Png)

![38_image_6.png](38_image_6.png)

function. When considering new structures and processes, modern management methods and techniques that look to improve organisational effectiveness will be taken into account. Along with the above mentioned tasks, the Secretariat will also be responsible for interdepartmental processes, particularly integrative tasks, and administrative activities.

Directing encompasses organisational guidance and decision making, being naturally the respective responsibility of organisational authorities at all levels. Making decisions on key defence issues will be based on a precise set of procedures, in order to ensure the prudent use of resources, transparency and clear responsibilities in the various functional areas.

Control must ensure for the oversight and evaluation of the implementation of adopted policies and plans, as well as the legality, effectiveness and rationalization of Ministry of Defence and CAF
activities. The Ministry of Defence will provide for organisational oversight and an inspectorate function. Organisational control is the responsibility of authorized leaders at all levels. Inspections are the responsibility of the Defence Inspectorate, which will assure for the comprehensive control of the defence system. The Ministry of Defence also plans to establish an internal auditor.

International defence co-operation is a growingly important factor in promoting defence objectives and Croatia's foreign and security policy. International activities have significantly intensified and gradually increased in magnitude, resulting in the need to correspondingly allocate adequate resources. In order to use these resources efficiently, international efforts need to be clearly linked to particular objectives and priorities. Thus, international defence co-operation must be and an integral part of the defence policy and planning process. Management responsibilities and relationships need to be clear among the

![38_image_0.png](38_image_0.png)

![38_image_1.png](38_image_1.png)

![38_image_3.png](38_image_3.png)

![38_image_5.png](38_image_5.png) many organisational elements in the Ministry of Defence and the CAF. Any organisational changes will need to focus on the following international efforts:
co-operation with NATO and its member countries, Croatia's participation in the European Security and Defence Policy, defence and security co-operation within the United Nations framework, regional defence co-operation and participation regional security initiatives, security co-operation within the OSCE framework, defence and security co-operation with other countries.

Modern security challenges require an effects-based approach, implying an all-inclusive, integrated effort to utilize all the available national means and instruments to achieve a desired endstate. In any given operation, it implies the proper definition of concrete objectives and unequivocally calls for stronger inter-agency co-operation. The Ministry of Defence takes part in numerous intergovernmental efforts, working closely with other agencies and ministries directly and within the framework of formal and ad hoc inter-agency working groups. Current inter-agency co-operation needs to be raised to a higher level, which should assure that all efforts and resource allocations are streamlined to meet a commonly desired outcome. Such efforts are absolutely crucial in dealing with complex security issues such as international terrorism. The Ministry of Defence will particularly support such inter-agency initiatives in meeting Croatia's Partnership Goals (outlined in the PARP and MAP), matters dealing with the coast guard and the establishment of an emergency and crisis management system.

The Ministry of Defence intelligence and security efforts, an integral part of

40

![39_image_4.png](39_image_4.png)

the national security and intelligence system, will continue to support Croatia's national and international needs and be further developed in harmony to meet NATO requirements.

An effective intelligence process will enable for the proper distribution of intelligence products to key decision making authorities, which should facilitate timely policy formulation and a subsequent response to dynamic changes in Croatia's security environment and developing threats.

Croatia's relationship with NATO
(and the EU) will be enhanced by reinforcing its intelligence and security dimension. This will result in strengthening Croatia's capacity to provide Allied force protection and intelligence support, as well as to CAF elements taking part in international operations.

The Ministry of Defence information system will ensure a proper and secure environment for normal communications, transactions and information exchange. It should also provide for integrated interactions with strong organisational and administrative support. Once a new system has been adopted it will require some adjustments to existing regulations and perhaps even the adoption of new procedures.

A more proactive approach to public relations on defence matters is an important factor in gaining support for reform efforts and improving the image of the CAF. Elected officials, government executives, and the general population, as well as Croatia's international partners, need to be well informed on defence efforts and key military issues. In that sense, the media plays a particularly important role, as do non-governmental organisations and academic experts. Well informed decision makers and defence officials and employees at all levels that understand the need to make necessary changes can contribute even more to assuring defence reform success.

![39_image_1.png](39_image_1.png)

The Ministry of Defence organisational structure is expected to change in 2006.

The organisational structure will reflect downsizing and other changes in the armed forces, as a relatively smaller, more modestly sized mix of civil servants and military personnel will manage Croatia's defence system in a cost-effective manner.

The future structure should be more simplified, differentiate between policy formulation and execution, avoid redundancy and duplication of efforts, and decrease the number of organisational linkages within the Ministry and on an inter-agency basis.

## Legal Framework

Defence is based on a national framework of jurisprudence and is consistent with Croatia's obligations under international law. The Croatian Constitution and a set of defence laws provide a functional basis for the defence system, including the Defence Law, the Law on Service in the CAF, the Law on Participation in International Peace-Support Operations and several other legal acts that deal with various defence issues.

As Croatia looks to transition from a purely territorial, individually-based selfdefence concept and move towards a collective defence effort, certain national legal constraints may need to be amended. This includes legal provisions that refer to:
legal authority in the defence system, the national military obligation, personnel management, the role of Croatia's armed forces abroad, allied forces deployed on or transiting Croatia's territory.

The legal framework of the defence system will be adjusted to comply with any future conceptual defence changes, which will continue to respect principles of transparency and the democratic control of the armed forces.

Croatia is conducting a strategic defence review for the first time. The SDR represents a fundamental instrument of current defence reform efforts and mechanism to meet the requirements of NATO membership. It was not the intention of the SDR to tackle all defence-related and armed forces reform issues, but rather to attempt to address the most crucial questions where some answers could be provided.

The objective of the SDR was to direct reform efforts by focusing on key aspects of the defence system and the CAF. Croatia feels that the most effective way to deal with modern security challenges is through the collective efforts and co-operative security framework of Euro-Atlantic solidarity. The ongoing transformation of NATO and the EU, as well as any potential strategic changes in the environment, will require Croatia to further reassess its reforms and make other necessary adjustments in the future.

The SDR has emphasized the need to conceptually adapt to the requirements of collective defence, inherent in Croatia's bid to join NATO. Guidance provided in this document will be incorporated in Ministry of Defence and CAF
development plans and will directly affect key reform decisions that still need to be made in the future.

Croatia's SDR is much more than a formal document. It was also a critical and necessary process that involved the close co-operation of several key national institutions, including the President, the Prime Minister and the Government, the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance. Thus, consensus on much needed defence reforms was achieved at the highest political level. Furthermore, the media, academic experts, opposition parties and the general public were provided with an opportunity to contribute any comments and

![40_image_1.png](40_image_1.png) suggestions. An open public debate was also organised.

A risk and threat assessment indicated that changes be considered in two areas—armed forces reform and development of new capabilities. The unlikelihood that Croatia will face a conventional military threat opens the possibility for conducting comprehensive armed forces reforms. However, chances are that Croatia will probably face complex, asymmetric challenges and would thus need to respond adequately. The co-operative security framework of EuroAtlantic solidarity provides the most effective collective capacity to respond properly to these threats.

Croatia's strategic national objective is to join NATO and the EU. In approaching Euro-Atlantic integrations, Croatia has inherited numerous commitments and obligations, which significantly affect the future CAF missions and tasks, overall defence concepts, structures and processes, and the resources allocated to defence. At the same time, Croatia has to balance its economic, social and other national efforts to promote the wellbeing of the country and its citizens.

Along with the many benefits of Euro-Atlantic integration, primarily NATO's collective defence capacity, Croatia must also be ready to accept the responsibilities of membership. A balance will have to be struck where capabilities that satisfy both national defence requirements and alliance commitments will be developed.

NATO accession provides an unparalleled opportunity to deal with Croatia's security vulnerabilities and risks through common efforts. The alternative to joining NATO would require accepting a greater degree of risk and call for developing a wider spectrum of capabilities, implying correspondingly a need to increase defence spending in the future.
