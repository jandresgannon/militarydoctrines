#### Minister’s foreword


Ensuring Australians are secure online is a shared responsibility – everyone has a role to play.
This Strategy sets out our plan to protect Australians online.

The world has never been more interconnected; our reliance on the internet for our prosperity and
way of life never greater. Australia’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance
of secure online connectivity. It has also shown Australians’ resilience and resolve to work together for
a common goal. That same whole-of-nation partnership between government, businesses and the
community must also be applied to ensuring Australia is cyber secure.

Australians are rightfully seizing the opportunities of our digital world. However, as the opportunities
have increased, so too have cyber threats. Well-equipped and persistent state-sponsored actors are
targeting critical infrastructure and stealing our intellectual property.

Cyber criminals are also doing great harm, infiltrating systems from anywhere in the world, stealing
money, identities and data from unsuspecting Australians. They are taking advantage of COVID-19
to target families and businesses, including health and medical research facilities. And they are hiding
on the dark web to traffic drugs and other illicit goods, and share abhorrent images of child abuse.
Our response must be bold to meet this threat head on.

This Strategy positions us to meet these evolving threats. Our vision is a more secure online world
for Australians, their businesses and the essential services upon which we all depend. We will deliver
this vision together, through complementary action by governments, businesses and the community.
Through this Strategy the Coalition Government will invest $1.67 billion over ten years in cyber
security – the largest ever financial commitment to cyber security. We will develop new Government
capabilities, incentivise industry to protect themselves and their customers, build trust in the digital
economy, and support the community to be secure online.


-----

This Strategy will benefit all Australians. Families and businesses
will have increased access to reliable cyber security advice
and assistance. The Coalition Government will boost law
enforcement’s capacity to combat cyber criminals, improve
threat information sharing with industry and support initiatives
to grow a skilled cyber workforce. Working in partnership with
owners of critical infrastructure, the Government will bolster
protecting the critical systems on which all Australians depend.

Our work on ensuring Australia is cyber secure does not end
here. This Strategy takes into account that effective cyber
security will require an ongoing effort by all of us. The Coalition
Government will continue to engage industry, state and
territory governments and the public to ensure that initiatives
under this Strategy support economic recovery through strong
cyber resilience.

This Strategy was developed with the assistance and input of
the many Australians who participated in the public consultation. I would like to thank them and the
Industry Advisory Panel chaired by Telstra Chief Executive Officer Andy Penn for their commitment,
enthusiasm and sound advice, which has been fundamental to developing this Strategy.

#### AUSTRALIA’S CYBER
 SECURITY STRATEGY 2020
 AT A GLANCE


###### Vision

A more secure online world for Australians, their
businesses and the essential services upon
which we all depend.

###### Approach

This vision will be delivered through
complementary actions by governments,
businesses and the community.

###### Cyber threats continue to evolve rapidly

**—** Cyber security threats are increasing.
Nation states and state-sponsored actors
and criminals are exploiting Australians
by accessing sensitive information and for
financial gain.

**—** Criminals are using the dark web to buy
and sell stolen identities, illicit commodities,
and child exploitation material, as well as
to commit other crimes.

**—** Encryption and anonymising technologies
allow criminals, terrorists and others to
hide their identities and activities from law
enforcement agencies.

**—** Cyber criminals want to take advantage
of the fact that Australians are more
connected than ever before.

###### Strong foundations

This Strategy builds on the 2016 Cyber Security
_Strategy, which invested $230 million to_
advance and protect Australia’s interests online.


###### Highlights

This Strategy will invest $1.67 billion over
10 years to achieve our vision. This includes:

**—** Protecting and actively defending the
critical infrastructure that all Australians
rely on, including cyber security obligations
for owners and operators.

**—** New ways to investigate and shut down
cyber crime, including on the dark web.

**—** Stronger defences for Government
networks and data.

**—** Greater collaboration to build Australia’s
cyber skills pipeline.

**—** Increased situational awareness and
improved sharing of threat information.

**—** Stronger partnerships with industry through
the Joint Cyber Security Centre program.

**—** Advice for small and medium enterprises to
increase their cyber resilience.

**—** Clear guidance for businesses and
consumers about securing Internet of
Things devices.

**—** 24/7 cyber security advice hotline for SMEs
and families.

**—** Improved community awareness of cyber
security threats.


-----

#### Overview


**1** The Australian Government’s vision is
to create a more secure online world
for Australians, their businesses and
the essential services upon which we
all depend.

**2** The scale and sophistication of cyber
threats continue to increase. Australians
are increasingly reliant on the internet
and the internet-connected devices
we use daily. The digital economy is
the future of Australia’s economy.
Our experience with the COVID-19
pandemic demonstrated this by
highlighting how much Australians
interact and work online, trusting the
internet for healthcare, working from
home, education, entertainment and
online shopping. It is more important than
ever to protect Australians online from
those who would do us harm.

**3** Australia’s experience of COVID-19
has other lessons too. Just as we –
governments, businesses, and the
community – have relied on each
other to fight the pandemic, cyber
security relies on us all playing our part.
Everyone – governments, businesses and
the community – has a role to play in
creating a more cyber secure Australia.


**4** Cyber security allows families and
businesses to prosper from the digital
economy, just as pool fences provide
peace of mind for households. Cyber
security needs to be a fundamental and
integrated part of everyday life, enabling
Australians to reap the benefits of the
internet safely and with confidence.

**5** Through this Strategy, the Australian
Government will build trust in the online
world by supporting businesses’ cyber
resilience, including by sharing threat
information, setting clear expectations of
roles and strengthening partnerships.

**6** The Australian Government will work
with industry to protect our most critical
systems from sophisticated threats.
Law enforcement agencies will be given
greater ability to protect Australians
online, just as they do in the physical
world, and will target criminal activity on
the dark web. The Australian Government
will confront illegal activity, including by
using our offensive cyber capabilities
against offshore criminals, consistent
with international law. The Australian
Government will continue to strengthen
the defences of its networks, including
against threats from sophisticated nation
states and state-sponsored actors.


-----

**7** Businesses should produce secure
products and services wherever possible
as part of a strong and prosperous
digital economy. A voluntary Code
of Practice will set out the Australian
Government’s security expectations for
the internet-connected consumer devices
Australians use every day. The Australian
Government will work with industry to
consider and clarify the cyber security
obligations of industry in the future,
including through regulatory reforms.

**8** Government and large businesses will
assist small and medium enterprises
(SMEs) to grow and increase their cyber
security awareness and capability.
The Australian Government will work
with large businesses and service
providers to provide SMEs with cyber
security information and tools as part
of ‘bundles’ of secure services (such as
threat blocking, antivirus, and cyber
security awareness training). Integrating
cyber security products into other service
offerings will help protect SMEs at scale
and recognises that many businesses
cannot employ dedicated cyber security
staff. Governments will work hand in
glove with critical infrastructure owners
to identify and resolve immediate
vulnerabilities. A Cyber Security National
Workforce Growth Program will develop a
skilled cyber workforce that can address
emerging threats and new challenges,
and maximise the benefits of the global
economy’s shift online.


**9** Not all cyber security risks can be
addressed by governments and
industry – individuals should also
take steps to protect themselves.
The Australian Government will expand
efforts to raise awareness of cyber
security threats and empower the
community to practise secure online
behaviours. The Australian Government
will offer a dedicated online cyber
security training program, expanding our
24/7 cyber security advice hotline for
SMEs and families, and increase funding
for victim support services.

**10** These measures will have the combined
effect of making the internet more
secure for all Australians. By ensuring the
Australian Government can counter the
most sophisticated threats and confront
illegal behaviour, businesses and the
community will be exposed to fewer risks
and will suffer less harm. Australians will
have greater confidence that essential
systems are protected. Equipping small
business owners and the community with
the information and tools they need to
protect themselves will encourage greater
adoption of cyber secure products and
cyber smart decision-making.

###### Strong foundations


_The 2016 Cyber Security Strategy set out the Australian Government’s plan to meet the dual_
challenges of the digital age – advancing and protecting Australia’s interests online. The
Australian Government backed the 2016 Strategy with a $230 million investment.


Feedback from businesses and the community showed that the 2016 Strategy strengthened
Australia’s cyber security foundations, stimulated private sector investment in the domestic
cyber security industry, and positioned Australia as a regional cyber security leader. Key
achievements include:


**—** Opening the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)


**—** Establishing Joint Cyber Security Centres (JCSCs) to engage state and territory governments
and industry


**—** Increasing cyber skills and education investments


**—** Establishing the 24/7 Global Watch


**—** Appointing the Ambassador for Cyber Affairs


**—** Establishing AustCyber, the Australian Cyber Security Growth Network, and the Cyber Security
Cooperative Research Centre.


This Strategy will build on initiatives that began in 2016, including the ACSC and JCSCs.


###### “Australia’s landmark 2016 Cyber Security Strategy has been a catalyst for change, launching a series of government and private sector activities and responses to cyber security and cyber crime challenges.”

#### The threat environment


###### “The consequence of attacks are increasing in severity, as information systems become more central to business and society.”

**Sapien Cyber**
Public submission to the Cyber Security Strategy 2020


**11** Cyber security is at the heart of the
transition to a digital society. Cyber
security is a key pillar in ensuring a
trusted and secure digital economy,
giving confidence to all participants
and allowing businesses to prosper and
thrive. The rapid and widespread uptake
of digital technology by households
and businesses following the COVID-19
pandemic underscores the importance
of digital technology as an economic
enabler. Millions of Australians are working
from home, staying connected through
apps and using essential digital services
such as telehealth. Many bricks and
mortar businesses are moving online for
the first time – exemplified by revenue
for the online shopping industry surging
by 21.8% in March 2020 when viewed in
year-on-year terms.[1]


**12** To maximise the benefits of digital
transformation, Australians must understand
and address the threats that it can bring.
Malicious cyber activity is one of the most
significant threats impacting Australians.
Between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020, the
ACSC responded to 2,266 cyber security
incidents at a rate of almost six per day.
This does not include other incidents referred
to the police and support organisations. The
true volume of malicious activity in Australia
is likely to be much higher. According to one
expert analysis, cyber incidents targeting
small, medium and large Australian
businesses can cost the economy up to
$29 billion per year, or 1.9% of Australia’s
gross domestic product (GDP).[2] Further, it
is estimated that a four week interruption
to digital infrastructures resulting from a
significant cyber incident would cost the
economy $30 billion (1.5% of Australia’s Gross
Domestic Product) and around 163,000 jobs.[3]

-----

**13** The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted
the evolving nature of cyber threats.
Opportunistic cyber criminals quickly
adapted their methods to take
advantage of more Australians working,
studying and connecting online.
Between 10 and 26 March 2020, the
ACSC received over 45 pandemic
themed cybercrime and cyber security
incident reports, with the Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission’s
(ACCC) Scamwatch receiving over 100
reports of COVID-19 themed scams.
Campaigns were designed to distribute
malicious software (malware) or harvest
personal and financial information from
unsuspecting Australians.


###### Cyber incident


A single event or a series of events that
threatens the integrity, availability or
confidentiality of digital information.


###### “Affordable and low-tech attacks such as ransomware, phishing and malware will continue to rise and a great emphasis from Government on supporting small to medium businesses and corporate Australia from cyber criminals is required.”

**AUCloud**
Public Submission to the Cyber Security Strategy 2020


-----

**Figure 1: Cyber security incidents, by sector (1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020)**


###### Malicious cyber actors

**14** Australians are being targeted by a range
of different groups, varying in their intent
and the sophistication of their tradecraft.

**—** **Nation states and state-sponsored**
**actors seek to compromise networks**
to obtain economic, policy, legal,
defence and security information
for their advantage. Nation states
and state-sponsored actors may
also seek to achieve disruptive or
destructive effects against their
targets during peacetime or in a
conflict setting. These actors tend to
be sophisticated, well-resourced and
patient adversaries, whose actions
could impact Australia’s national
security and economic prosperity.


**—** **Financially motivated criminals**
exploit and access systems for
financial gain, posing a substantial
threat to the economic interests of
Australia and the region. Of particular
concern are transnational cyber
crime syndicates, which develop,
share, sell and use sophisticated
cyber tools and techniques.
Criminals are also using the dark
web to buy and sell stolen identities,
illicit commodities and child
exploitation material, as well as to
commit other crimes.


-----

**—** **Issue-motivated groups and**
**individuals are primarily concerned**
with drawing attention to their
causes. They are generally less
capable and less sophisticated,
but still able to cause
significant disruption to industry
and governments.

**—** **Terrorist groups and extremists**
are effective at using the internet
to communicate and generate
attention, but generally employ
very basic cyber techniques and
capabilities such as distributed
denial of service (DDoS) activities,
hijacking social media accounts and
defacing websites. These groups
currently pose a relatively low
cyber threat.

**15** Highly sophisticated nation states
and state-sponsored actors continue
to target governments and critical
infrastructure providers. Australian
Government or state and territory
government entities were targeted
in 35.4% of the incidents the ACSC
responded to in the year to 30 June 2020
(see Figure 1). Around 35% of incidents
impacted critical infrastructure providers
that deliver essential services including
healthcare, education, banking, water,
communications, transport and energy.
A successful cyber attack against one
of these services could have significant
ramifications for the broader economy
and Australian way of life. This is occurring
overseas, as seen in the 2015 disruptions
of power facilities in Ukraine, the 2017
Triton attacks on Saudi petrochemical
facilities, and the NotPetya and
WannaCry attacks in 2017 that impacted
financial, transport and healthcare
services across the globe.


**16** In 2019, one in three Australian adults were
impacted by cyber crime.[4] On average,
the ACSC’s ReportCyber tool receives
a cyber crime report every 10 minutes.
The barrier for entry into cyber criminal
activity is very low. Underground online
marketplaces offer cyber crime-as-aservice or access to high-end hacking
tools that were once only available
to nation states. Malicious actors with
minimal technical expertise can purchase
illicit tools and services to generate
alternative income streams, launder
the proceeds of traditional crimes or
intrude into networks on behalf of more
sophisticated adversaries.

###### Malicious activity against Australian networks in 2020


On 19 June 2020, the Prime Minister announced that Australian organisations were being
targeted by a sophisticated state-based cyber actor. This activity targeted Australian
organisations across a range of sectors, including all levels of government; industry; political
organisations; education, healthcare and essential service providers; and operators of other
critical infrastructure.


The Australian Government knows it was a sophisticated state-based cyber actor because of
the scale and nature of the targeting and the tradecraft used. The ACSC and the Department
of Home Affairs have published a more detailed technical advisory with advice for Australian
businesses and organisations to protect themselves. This advisory is available at cyber.gov.au.

Cyber criminals are taking advantage of the COVID-19 crisis to conduct widespread COVID19-themed email and SMS phishing campaigns. These campaigns aim to distribute malware or
harvest personal information from unsuspecting Australians.


To protect Australians, the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) used its offensive cyber
capabilities to disrupt foreign cyber criminals targeting Australian households and businesses.
These offensive cyber operations struck back at the foreign criminals behind these COVID-19
themed phishing campaigns, successfully disabling their infrastructure and blocking their
access to stolen information.


The ACSC also worked closely with Australia’s major telecommunications providers and
web-browser companies Google and Microsoft to disrupt these foreign criminals. These actions
include flagging websites as malicious at the web-browser level and blocking them from phone
users. This response showed how close partnerships between government and industry can
protect Australians from malicious cyber activity.


###### Malicious cyber activity on the dark web


The dark web is the part of the internet that allows its users to remain anonymous. It is not easily
accessible. The dark web facilitates illegal activity such as child sexual abuse, identity theft,
drug and firearm trafficking and the planning of terror attacks.

The use of anonymising technologies has made it easier to commit serious crimes at volume
and across jurisdictions. It allows criminals and other malicious actors to operate outside the
visibility of law enforcement. If our law enforcement agencies are to remain effective in reducing
cyber crime, their ability to tackle the volume and anonymity enabled by the dark web and
encryption technologies must be enhanced. As part of this Strategy, the Australian Government
will work to ensure law enforcement has the powers and capabilities to investigate and disrupt
cyber crime, including on the dark web.


-----

#### Consultation


**17** On 6 September 2019 the Australian
Government released a public discussion
paper, ‘A call for views’, to give every
Australian a say in the development of
this Strategy.

**18** The Australian Government received
215 submissions from individuals and
organisations, 156 of which are available
[at homeaffairs.gov.au/cybersecurity.](http://homeaffairs.gov.au/cybersecurity)

**19** The Australian Government also met with
more than 1,400 people from across the
country in face-to-face consultations,
including workshops, roundtables
and bilateral meetings. There were
also dedicated forums attended by
representatives from large technology
companies, academia, state and territory
agencies, local governments and defence
industry.


**20** The following key themes were raised

during the consultation process:

**—** The threat environment is worsening.

**—** Roles and responsibilities
need clarification.

**—** Government and industry
partnerships should be strengthened.

**—** Improved two-way information
sharing is essential.

**—** Standards and regulation are
necessary to get the basics right.

**—** Growth of cyber crime is outstripping
our ability to respond.

**—** Many threats can be addressed
at scale.

**—** Human behaviour is almost always
part of the problem.

**—** Australia needs more trusted and
skilled cyber security professionals.

**—** Small businesses are
particularly vulnerable.

**—** Australia needs to be better
prepared, especially for a
national-scale incident.

**—** There are economic opportunities
for Australia.

###### Our Industry
 Advisory Panel

**21** The Minister for Home Affairs (the Minister)
also established an Industry Advisory
Panel (the Panel) to provide strategic
advice to support the development of
_Australia’s Cyber Security Strategy 2020._
The members of the Panel were:

**—** Mr Andrew Penn, CEO and Managing
Director, Telstra (Chair)

**—** Ms Kirstjen Nielsen, former United
States Secretary of Homeland Security

**—** Mr Robert Mansfield AO, Chair, Vocus
Group

**—** Ms Robyn Denholm, Chair, Tesla

**—** Mr Chris Deeble AO CSC, Chief
Executive, Northrop Grumman Australia

**—** Mr Darren Kane, Chief Security
Officer, NBN Co.


**22** The Panel met 13 times between
November 2019 and July 2020, which
included meetings with the Minister. The
Panel structured its deliberations around
12 problem statements based on the key
themes of feedback raised during the
public consultation process. The Panel’s
final report provided recommendations
covering seven key areas and is available
[at homeaffairs.gov.au/cybersecurity.](http://homeaffairs.gov.au/cybersecurity)

**23** In line with the Panel’s advice, this
Strategy seeks to clearly set out the
cyber security roles and responsibilities
across government, businesses and the
community as outlined in the next section.

**24** Building on the success of the Panel, a
standing Industry Advisory Committee will
be established to ensure industry plays a
continuing role in shaping the delivery of
short and longer-term actions set out in
this Strategy.


-----

###### “Australia will prosper as a digital economy if we continue to invest in cyber defences. If we move to comprehensively protect ourselves from cyber-crime our businesses will remain competitive, our national infrastructure will be protected, the security of our institutions – including our democratic electoral processes, which have been the subject of malicious cyber-attack in other parts of the world – protected and the well-being of Australians improved. Acting quickly and decisively will also ensure the benefits outweigh the cost of remediation.”

**Andrew Penn**
Chair of the Industry Advisory Panel and CEO of Telstra, August 2020

#### Our strategy


**25** The Australian Government’s Strategy
is illustrated in Figure 2. The Australian
Government’s vision is for a more
secure online world for Australians, their
businesses and the essential services
upon which we all depend.

**Figure 2: Our Strategy Illustrated**


###### Vision
 A more secure online world for Australians, their businesses and the

 essential services upon which we all depend.


**Actions by governments**

**Key themes:**

**—** Protect critical

infrastructure, essential
services and households

**—** Combat cyber crime,

including on the dark web

**—** Protect Australian

Government data and
networks

**—** Share threat information

**—** Strengthen cyber security

partnerships

**—** Support business to meet

cyber security standards

**—** Enhance cyber security

capabilities


**Actions by businesses**

**Key themes:**

**—** Improve baseline security

for critical infrastructure

**—** Uplift the cyber security

of SMEs

**—** Provide secure products

and services

**—** Grow a skilled workforce

**—** Take steps to block

malicious activity at scale


**Actions by the community**

**Key themes:**

**—** Access and apply

guidance and
information on cyber
security

**—** Make informed

purchasing decisions

**—** Report cyber crime

**—** Access help and support

when needed


-----

**26** This vision will be delivered through action
by governments, businesses and the
community, as illustrated in Figure 3.

**—** The Australian Government will
strengthen the protection of Australians,
businesses and critical infrastructure
from the most sophisticated threats.
State and territory and local
governments have a role in protecting
their systems from cyber attacks.

**Figure 3: Roles and responsibilities in cyber security**


**—** Businesses should take responsibility
for securing their products and services
and protecting their customers from
known cyber vulnerabilities.

**—** The community should take
responsibility for practising secure
online behaviours and making informed
purchasing decisions.


-----

**27** This approach will enable Australia to
make best use of its finite resources.
The Australian Government will focus
on critical threats and the most
sophisticated actors, while ensuring
a baseline level of cyber resilience
across the economy. The Australian
Government is best placed to deter
and respond to sophisticated actors,
including through defensive and offensive
cyber capabilities. State and territory
governments also have a role to play in
ensuring their networks are not vulnerable
to cyber intrusions.

**28** Businesses should take responsibility for
enhancing their cyber security, just as
they are responsible for the safety and
quality of their products. The Australian
Government expects all businesses to
play this role, and in the first instance will
introduce legislation in relation to critical
infrastructure and systems of national
significance. Many of the initiatives in this
Strategy aim to help businesses to take
advantage of the digital economy by
providing advice, practical tools and joint
investment in a skilled workforce.


**29** The community will always have a role to
play in cyber security. Even with the best
efforts of governments and businesses,
Australians will need to know how to
safeguard themselves against cyber
security threats. This Strategy puts a
greater focus on raising awareness of
secure online behaviours, increasing
access to victim support services and
giving all Australians the information
they need to make cyber secure
purchasing decisions.

**30** Every part of government, business

and the community has a role to
play in implementing this Strategy.
Although this Strategy is an Australian
Government initiative, the Australian
Government recognises the essential
role of state and territory governments,
businesses, academia, international
partners and the broader community
in realising our vision: to create a more
secure online world for Australians, their
businesses and the essential services
upon which we all depend. Successful
implementation of this Strategy relies on
individual and collaborative effort and
actions by governments, businesses and
the community.

#### Our response


###### Actions by governments

 “Government has an important leadership role to play, which includes assisting organisations and the community to be fully cyber aware.”

**Ai Group**
Public submission to the Cyber Security Strategy 2020


**31** The Australian Government is investing in
its capabilities to respond to the growing
cyber security threat. On 30 June 2020,
the Australian Government announced
the $1.35 billion Cyber Enhanced
Situational Awareness and Response
(CESAR) package. CESAR will ensure
that ASD, as Australia’s lead operational
cyber security agency, can identify more
cyber threats, disrupt more foreign cyber
criminals, build more partnerships with
industry and government, and protect
more Australians. This section explains in
detail the full suite of tools the Australian
Government will use to address cyber
security threats – from voluntary action
and collaboration to legislation and
classified capabilities.


###### Working in partnership with businesses

**32** The Australian Government has a very
important part to play in cyber security.
It cannot protect all of cyberspace,
but it will create an environment where
everyone knows what role they play
and what the ‘rules of the road’ are
– including through legislation where
necessary. This will allow businesses
and the community to achieve greater
national cyber security resilience
so Australia can take advantage of
the opportunities of an increasingly
digital economy.


-----

**33** In addition to shaping policies to make
Australia more secure online, the Australian
Government has an important role to
play in actively defending Australia from
sophisticated malicious cyber actors. To
achieve this, the Australian Government
will target its cyber security efforts on
the areas where it will make the most
impact. In the shorter term, the initial
focus is on setting expectations for critical
infrastructure and systems of national
significance (set out in further detail under
‘Actions by businesses’). This will involve
ensuring Australia has the right policies
and capabilities in place to manage the
highest consequence threats to Australia
to protect the essential services on which
all Australians depend for our way of life.

**34** Although Australia has been lucky to avoid
a catastrophic cyber security incident,
we are vulnerable to the cyber attacks
experienced elsewhere in the world.
Supporting the continuity of essential
services in the face of disruptive or
sophisticated attacks is a fundamental
obligation for government. The loss of
an essential service like electricity, water
or transport could have devastating
impacts across Australia far beyond the
targeted business. Although more can be
done to raise the overall security posture
of critical infrastructure (see ‘Securing
essential services’ section), some nation
states or state-sponsored actors are so
sophisticated that an attack may be
beyond the capability of a single network
owner to handle alone, irrespective of its
size, expertise and best efforts.


**35** The Australian Government must be
ready to act in the national interest
when its unique capabilities are needed,
especially in emergency situations.
In consultation with critical infrastructure
owners and operators, the Australian
Government will develop new powers
proportionate to the consequences of
a sophisticated and catastrophic cyber
attack, accompanied by appropriate
safeguards and oversight mechanisms.
These powers will ensure the Australian
Government can actively defend
networks and help the private sector
recover in the event of a cyber attack.
The nature of this assistance will depend
on the circumstances, but could include
expert advice, direct assistance or the
use of classified tools. This will reduce the
potential down-time of essential services
and the impact of cyber attacks on
Australians.

**36** The Australian Government will also work
with businesses to consider legislative
changes that set a minimum cyber
security baseline across the economy.
This consultation will consider multiple
reform options, including:

**—** the role of privacy, consumer and
data protection laws

**—** duties for company directors and
other business entities

**—** obligations on manufacturers of
internet connected devices.

This consultation will examine ways to
simplify and reduce the cost of meeting
any future minimum baseline.


-----

**37** The Australian Government will strengthen
its capacity to prevent or respond to
malicious cyber activity, including in
response to sophisticated actors. Through
this Strategy, the Australian Government
will invest $62.3 million in a classified
national situational awareness capability
to better enable government to understand
and respond to cyber threats to critical
infrastructure and other high priority
networks. This will be complemented
by increased incident reporting and
near-real-time threat information from
the most essential pieces of infrastructure
as part of future regulatory requirements.
To make use of all sources of threat
information, the Australian Government
will deliver an enhanced threat-sharing
platform, enabling critical infrastructure
operators to share intelligence about
malicious cyber activity with government
and other providers at machine speed,
and block emerging threats as they occur.
This Strategy will invest $118 million to
expand ASD’s data science capabilities.
The Australian Government will invest
$66.5 million to assist Australia’s major
critical infrastructure providers to assess
vulnerabilities to enhance their cyber
security posture. An additional
$20.2 million will go to cutting-edge
research laboratories so we can better
understand threats to technologies that
underpin Australia’s critical infrastructure
systems on which businesses and home
users increasingly rely.

**38** This requires strong partnerships between
businesses and governments. To support
the partnership, the Australian Government
will increase its investment in the JCSCs
in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth,
and Adelaide, and expand the number
of services available to our partners.
Continuing and expanding the JCSCs
was strongly supported during public
consultation. Strengthened JCSCs will
accommodate an increased number of
cyber outreach officers, including from
the Department of Home Affairs. These
outreach officers will be a crucial link in
developing strong partnerships and sharing
actionable cyber security advice.


**39** All JCSCs will include multi-classification
facilities to accommodate a broader
range of ACSC capabilities and classified
engagement with law enforcement and
trusted partners. The number of technical
staff will also be increased, creating
multi-disciplinary teams of experts who
can provide additional operational and
technical expertise across the nation.
The work of the enhanced JCSCs will
complement that of growing and vital
private cyber security businesses.

**40** Although the cyber security of the tertiary

education sector is primarily the tertiary
education sector’s responsibility, the
Australian Government is also investing
$1.6 million to enhance the cyber security of
Australian universities. This will fund a threat
intelligence-sharing network, sector-wide
threat modelling and a national cyber
security forum that will meet three times
a year. Strengthening the collective
defences of universities against future
threats will support our cyber skills agenda.
The Australian Government welcomes
the work that Australia’s Academic
Research Network (AARNet) is doing to
share threat intelligence within the tertiary
education sector.

**41** The Australian Government will also work
closely with businesses to prepare for
cyber incidents by practising our incident
response procedures. An expanded cyber
security incident exercise program, led
by the ACSC, will ensure that Australian
businesses and governments have
practised their incident responses ahead
of time and are always strengthening
their readiness and resilience. The
Australian Government will work with state
and territory governments on formally
recognising businesses in governments’
incident response playbook, known
as the Cyber Incident Management
Arrangements. This will ensure that all parts
of Australia’s society have clearly defined
roles and responsibilities and know what to
do in the case of a national cyber incident
or emergency.

###### Holding cyber criminals to account

**42** Tackling crime is just as important in the
online world as it is in the physical world.
Criminals from anywhere across the globe
can use the internet to harm Australians
with ease and at scale. To hold cyber
criminals to account and prevent cyber
crime, law enforcement agencies across
Australia will need to work together.
Building on the success of approaches to
counter terrorism and child exploitation,
this Strategy will encourage even greater
cooperation across Australia and with
international partners. The Australian
Government will work with state and
territory governments to prioritise our
efforts and equip agencies with the
capabilities to make a difference. The
Australian Government will also bolster the
Australian Federal Police’s (AFP) ability to
investigate and prosecute cyber criminals,
investing $89.9 million. This investment
will enable the AFP to establish target
development teams with partners, build
technical cyber capabilities and enhance
operational capacity. The Australian
Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre’s
financial intelligence expertise will be
harnessed to target the profits of cyber
criminals. Building on the establishment
of a countering foreign cyber criminals
capability in 2019, the Australian
Government will also further expand the
ACSC’s ability to counter cyber crime
actors offshore.

**43** Encryption is an important way of
protecting consumer and business data,
but the increasing use of the dark web and
encryption technologies that allow people
to remain anonymous online is challenging
law enforcement agencies’ ability to
protect our community. The dark web
enables cyber criminals to broadcast child
sexual exploitation and abuse, trade in
stolen identities, traffic drugs and firearms,
and plan terror attacks. These platforms
make committing serious crimes at volume,
and across borders, easier than ever before.


The Telecommunications and Other
_Legislation Amendment (Assistance and_
_Access) Act introduced in 2018 has helped_
Australia’s law enforcement and security
agencies, working with industry, tackle
online criminal and terrorist threats. Through
this Strategy, the Australian Government
will ensure law enforcement agencies
have appropriate legislative powers and
technical capabilities to deter, disrupt
and defeat the criminal exploitation of
anonymising technology and the dark web.

###### Identifying threats

**44** Australia’s law enforcement agencies

face a continuous challenge to identify
new threats before these threats
harm Australians, and to respond to
technological developments.
The Australian Signals Directorate will
recruit 500 additional intelligence and
cyber security personnel at a cost of
$469.7 million over 10 years. The Australian
Government will invest $385.4 million in
enabling and enhancing intelligence
capabilities. In addition to holding cyber
criminals and malicious actors to account,
these steps will ensure that Australia
remains a world leader in developing new
and innovative approaches that enable
all Australians to securely adopt new
technology and access the benefits of
the digital economy.

###### Government systems

**45** Governments also have a responsibility to
lead by example. Shifting more government
services online is making the lives of
Australians easier. However, citizens need
to have confidence that their data is safe,
underscoring the need for government
systems and data to be secure. This
Strategy will drive long-term work by the
Australian Government to strengthen the
defences of Commonwealth public sector
networks. The first priority is to centralise
the management and operations of


-----

the large number of networks run by
Australian Government agencies, including
considering secure hubs. Centralisation
could reduce the number of targets
available to hostile actors such as nation
states or state-sponsored adversaries,
and allow the Australian Government to
focus its cyber security investment on a
smaller number of more secure networks.
A centralised model will be designed to
promote innovation and agility while still
achieving economies of scale.

**46** The centralisation of cyber security systems
across government will be complemented
by the work of Australian Government
agencies to strengthen their cyber security
and implement the ACSC’s Essential Eight
mitigation strategies. This work will be
informed and supported by the ACSC’s
ongoing technical cyber security advice
and guidance. This approach to the uplift
of government systems will be designed to
reduce the risk of compromise, and help
to prevent the most common techniques
used by malicious cyber actors. Australian
government agencies will also put a
renewed focus on policies and procedures
to manage cyber security risks. Standard
cyber security clauses will be included in
Australian Government IT contracts.

###### The connection between cyber crime and identity theft

Many cyber threats are enabled by
malicious actors concealing their
identities using fake or stolen identity
information. Personal information stolen
from innocent Australians is widely
available in thriving dark web markets,
where it is bought and sold on an
industrial scale by criminals looking to
commit fraud or facilitate other illegal
activities. For example, criminals use
stolen identities to withdraw money from
bank accounts, take out loans, apply
for credit cards, or claim government
benefits in another person’s name.


###### Trusted digital identities promote cyber security

**47** To help protect Australians against
identity crime, the Australian
Government’s Digital Identity program
gives people the choice to use a trusted
digital identity credential, such as a
myGovID, to access online services from
participating government and private
sector organisations. This will make
accessing online services easier and safer
for Australians, while giving organisations
greater confidence in who they are
dealing with online.

**48** By using trusted digital identity

credentials to access multiple online
services, people will not need to
repeatedly re-verify their identities
or maintain multiple passwords.
This reduces the amount of personal
information that needs to be shared
with online service providers, helping to
prevent identity theft and other forms of
cyber crime.

**49** Trusted digital identities need to be
verified against government identity
records such as passports, driver licences
and birth certificates – documents
Australians rely on every day to help
prove their identities. The Australian
Government will work with states and
territories to update the National
Identity Security Strategy to strengthen
arrangements for issuing and managing
these documents, maintain strong
privacy safeguards, and further bolster
our defences against identity and
cyber crime.


-----

###### International engagement

**50** Finally, governments have a responsibility

to uphold existing international law and
norms of responsible state behaviour in
cyberspace. Australia will continue to
encourage the international community
to act responsibly online, including by
complying with existing international law,
domestic law and norms of responsible
state behaviour. The Australian
Government will ensure that Australia
is not seen as a soft target and will
continue to publicly call out countries
when it is in our interests to do so. The
Australian Government will match its
public statements with action through a
range of targeted and decisive responses
against unacceptable intrusions or
activity in line with Australia’s statement
of principles on cyber deterrence:

**We work to actively prevent cyber attacks,**
**minimise damage, and respond to**
**malicious cyber activity directed against**
**our national interests. We deny and deter,**
**while balancing the risk of escalation.**
**Our actions are lawful and aligned with**
**the values we seek to uphold, and will**
**therefore be proportionate, always**
**contextual, and collaborative. We can**
**choose not to respond.**

**51** The Australian Government’s actions
will strengthen the nation’s cyber
security. Stronger obligations and
partnerships will give us the best chance
of disrupting or minimising sophisticated
attacks. Bolstered law enforcement
and intelligence capabilities will create
a stronger deterrence against cyber
criminals. Government systems on which
all Australians rely will be hardened. The
actions required of businesses will build
on these initiatives.


###### Australia’s Cyber and Critical Technology International Engagement Strategy


The Australian Government will place
an increased focus on engaging
internationally on the security of critical
technologies. The nature of global supply
chains means that Australia needs to take
joint action with likeminded countries to
ensure these critical technologies are not
manipulated for malicious purposes.


The Australian Government defines
critical technology as current and
emerging technologies that have the
capacity to significantly enhance or
pose a risk to our national interest
(prosperity, social cohesion or national
security). Critical technology and
cyberspace are becoming increasingly
important aspects of international
relations. They are intrinsically linked to
our national prosperity and security;
the protection and promotion of human
rights and democracy; international
stability; global economic prosperity;
and sustainable development.


The Australian Government is developing
a Cyber and Critical Technology
International Engagement Strategy.
Building on the 2017 International Cyber
_Engagement Strategy, the next Cyber_
and Critical Technology International
Engagement Strategy will provide
a framework to guide Australia’s
international engagement, to ensure
cyberspace and critical technology
support our goal of a safe, secure and
prosperous Australia, Indo-Pacific and
world. This includes partnerships to
support the achievement of our cyber
security goals by building international
capacity and resilience to cyber security
threats, cyber crime, online harms and
disinformation.


-----

###### Working with international partners


The security and resilience of our allies, regional partners and the broader international
community is vital to ensuring Australia’s own national security and prosperity.


Australia is committed to supporting and sustaining international mechanisms that promote
stability, and to working with partners on a voluntary basis to deter and respond to
unacceptable behaviour in cyberspace.

Australia contributes to forums such as the International Organization for Standardization
and the International Telecommunication Union which develop international standards that
contribute to a more secure cyberspace for all countries.


Awareness raising and capacity building helps ensure the peaceful use of technology, and will
ultimately enhance our collective cyber resilience and thus deliver direct benefits for Australia.
Some countries may require assistance in their efforts to:


**—** improve the security of critical information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure


**—** develop technical skills and appropriate legislation, regulatory frameworks and strategies to
fulfil their responsibilities


**—** bridge the divide between the security of ICT and its use.


###### Building the capacity of our neighbours


The Australian Government has already committed $60 million to support cyber capacity
building in the Indo-Pacific region to champion an open, free and secure cyberspace. This
includes a seven-year, $34 million Cyber Cooperation Program, working with government,
industry, civil society and academia to enhance cyber resilience across the full spectrum of
cyber affairs. The Cyber Cooperation Program is now also working to mitigate the impact of
malicious cyber activity during COVID-19.


Australia has also committed to a four-year, $14 million Australia-Papua New Guinea
(PNG) Cyber Security Cooperation initiative to enhance PNG’s cyber security frameworks
and technical capability, and a four-year $12.7 million Australia-India Cyber and Critical
Technology Partnership.


-----

###### Actions by businesses

 “In our connected economy, an attack on one organisation can have impacts across customers and supply chains.”

**Commonwealth Bank of Australia**
Public submission to the Cyber Security Strategy 2020


**52** Cyber security is important to all
businesses. It provides access to the digital
economy and protects hard-earned
profits, valuable intellectual property and
sensitive customer data. Some businesses
take cyber security more seriously than
others. Given the private sector owns most
of Australia’s data and networks, Australia
will not be secure until all businesses take
steps to protect themselves, their supply
chains and their customers.

###### Securing essential services

**53** The best way to protect Australians
at scale is to secure our critical
infrastructure. Through this Strategy, the
Australian Government will work with
owners and operators to uplift their cyber
security and to actively defend networks,
using both defensive and offensive tools.
This is consistent with feedback from
consultation on this Strategy about
working together to better defend critical
infrastructure.

**54** The Australian Government takes
seriously the need to protect our
critical infrastructure and has already
taken action to do so. The Australian
Government introduced reforms
in 2018 to manage threats to the
telecommunications sector and certain
electricity, water, gas and port assets.
However, the threat environment is
worsening. In response to this, the
Australian Government is developing
an enhanced regulatory framework for
critical infrastructure and systems of
national significance.


**55** The enhanced framework will uplift
security and resilience in critical
infrastructure sectors, combined with
better identification and sharing of
information about threats in order to
make Australia’s critical infrastructure –
whether owned or operated by industry
or government – more resilient and
secure. This approach will prioritise acting
ahead of an incident wherever possible.

**56** One size does not fit all. The framework
will balance objectives for cyber, physical,
personnel and supply chain protections
across all sectors, while recognising
sector-specific differences. This is why
the framework will be built around
principles-based outcomes, underpinned
by guidance and advice proportionate
to the risks and circumstances in each
sector. Due to the interconnected nature
of critical infrastructure sectors, even
mature sectors will benefit from these
changes and they should see an uplift in
their supply chain as well as the networks
and systems that they depend on.

**57** This framework will apply to owners
and operators of relevant critical
infrastructure regardless of ownership
arrangements. This creates an even
playing field for owners and operators
and maintains Australia’s existing open
investment settings, ensuring businesses
that take security seriously are not at a
commercial disadvantage.


-----

**58** Australia’s enhanced critical infrastructure
security regulatory framework will clarify
what infrastructure owners need to do to
meet our minimum expectations of cyber
security. It will include:

**—** an enforceable positive security
obligation for designated critical
infrastructure entities;

**—** enhanced cyber security obligations
for those entities most important to
the nation


**—** Australian Government assistance
for businesses in response to the
most significant cyber attacks to
Australian systems

**—** voluntary measures to strengthen
engagement with businesses in
relation to risk, and support an
entity’s security uplift.

**59** This enhanced regulatory framework will
be delivered through amendments to the
_Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018._


-----

**60** At the other end of the scale, SMEs are

especially vulnerable to cyber security
threats. Feedback from consultation
shows SMEs often lack the resources or
expertise to defend themselves and that
there can be a large impact on regional
communities when cyber criminals
target SMEs. This Strategy includes an
$8.3 million Cyber Security Connect and
Protect Program, which will assist SMEs
through tailored advice and assistance
from trusted sources.


**61** The Australian Government will also provide
online training and a 24/7 helpdesk for
SMEs that needs cyber security advice
or assistance. Government and large
businesses will assist small businesses to
upgrade their cyber security and grow
their cyber security awareness. The
Australian Government will encourage
large businesses and services providers to
provide small businesses with cyber security
information and tools as part
of ‘bundles’ of secure services, such as
threat-blocking, antivirus and cyber
security awareness training. Integrating
cyber security products into other service
offerings will help protect SMEs at scale and
recognises that many businesses cannot
employ dedicated cyber security staff. All of
these programs will continue to be brought
[together on cyber.gov.au, so that SMEs](http://cyber.gov.au)
can quickly find the Australian Government
assistance that best meets their needs.


###### Supporting SMEs


The Australian Government will prioritise support for SMEs through a number of key initiatives:


**—** A $12.3 million expansion to the ACSC’s 24/7 cyber security hotline will enhance the provision of
cyber security advice and technical assistance.


**—** The $8.3 million Cyber Security Connect and Protect Program will equip trusted organisations
to raise the cyber security of SMEs in their local area.


**—** The placement of outreach officers in Joint Cyber Security Centres will support SMEs.


**—** Supporting the roll-out of threat-blocking technology will prevent known malicious cyber
threats from reaching Australian consumers and businesses.


**—** The ACSC Small Business Cyber Security Guide provides tailored advice to protect against the
most common cyber security incidents.


**—** ACSC-produced Step-by-Step and Quick Wins Guides provide practical instructions with
visual aids outlining actions SMEs can take to protect themselves.


**—** The ACSC Stay Smart Online Program promotes best practice cyber security advice and
encourages businesses to protect themselves online.


**—** [Toolkits published on cyber.gov.au will help SMEs raise cyber security awareness among their](http://cyber.gov.au)
staff members.


**—** [A dedicated online cyber security training program hosted on cyber.gov.au will help upskill](http://cyber.gov.au)
SMEs and their staff members.


**—** Law enforcement will have strengthened capabilities to identify and disrupt cyber criminals
targeting Australian businesses.

###### “Today, cyberattacks from increasingly sophisticated actors threaten organisations across every sector, and whether a large ASX 100 company or a local bakery, organisations of all sizes need to take steps to limit the dangers posed by these threats.”

**Microsoft**
Public submission to the Cyber Security Strategy 2020


**62** Certain businesses can reduce the
number of threats entering Australia by
automatically blocking known malicious
content. This solution that will protect
Australians and Australian businesses
at speed and scale. Over the life of this
Strategy, the Australian Government
will support businesses to implement
threat-blocking technology that can
automatically protect citizens and
businesses from known malware and
trojans. The Australian Government
will also consider how it can provide
legislative and any other assistance
to telecommunications providers
implementing this technology.
As part of this initiative, the Australian
Government will invest $12.5 million for
the ACSC to provide Australia’s major
telecommunications providers with
information about known malicious
websites, malware, phishing campaigns
and online scams to boost providers’
ability to block threats at scale.
This funding will support industry
partnership, research and development
of new capabilities to detect and block
threats at scale, reducing the volume of
cyber threats impacting Australians so
they can focus on running their
businesses and building the economy.


###### Securing products and services

**63** Australians are connecting to the internet
in more ways than ever before. By 2030,
it is estimated that there will be more
than 21 billion Internet of Things devices
connected to the internet globally, with
the highest estimations predicting over
64 billion devices.[5] This includes personal
devices like smartwatches, fridges and
baby monitors; health devices such as
pacemakers and blood-glucose monitors;
and industrial devices that can drive
business efficiencies.


###### Cleaner Pipes initiative


In May 2020, Telstra announced its Cleaner
Pipes initiative, which upscales Telstra’s
Domain Name System (DNS) filtering, to
automatically block millions of malware
communications as they try to cross
Telstra’s infrastructure every week.
Telstra has been trialling this initiative for
12 months, including blocking the command
and control communications of botnets
and malware and stopping downloads
of remote access trojans, backdoors
and banking trojans. Cleaner Pipes
complements similar initiatives focused on
reducing malicious SMS and scam calls;
Telstra currently blocks more than half a
million scam calls per month from reaching
customers. The Australian Government is
working with businesses to support the
roll-out of this solution to more Australians.

-----

**64** To support businesses in taking action
to protect themselves and their
customers, the Australian Government
will release the voluntary Code of
Practice: Securing the Internet of Things
for Consumers, to inform businesses
about the cyber security features
expected of internet-connected devices
available in Australia. The 13 principles
in the voluntary Code of Practice will
signal to manufacturers the importance
of protecting consumers. Adoption of
the Code of Practice, together with
associated guidance material produced
by the ACSC, will benefit Australians
and SMEs by increasing the number of
secure products available for purchase.
The Australian Government will provide
consumers with information about
what to take into consideration when
purchasing Internet of Things devices.

**65** Similar to steps taken in the United
Kingdom, the Australian Government
will co-design supply chain principles
for decision makers and suppliers,
to encourage security-by-design;
transparency; and autonomy and
integrity in investment, procurement
and security. The Australian Government
will build these principles into
decision-making practices, supporting
competition and diversity in the
market. To keep guidance up to date
as technology and threats continue to
evolve, the Australian Government will
continue to monitor and build on existing
government initiatives that promote
innovation in sovereign cyber security
research and development. AustCyber
is well placed to assure continued
commercialisation and scaling of cyber
security capabilities that support our
nation’s needs.


**66** In making decisions about what products
and services they purchase, consumers
play an important role in encouraging
businesses to build cyber security into their
offerings. The Australian Government will
continue to assess whether consumers
have the information they need to make
informed cyber security choices when
purchasing products and services.
If voluntary advice and guidance like
the Code of Practice is not enough to
drive change, then additional steps may
need to be considered. The Australian
Government will establish a Cyber Security
Best Practice Regulation Task Force to
work with businesses and international
partners to consider options for better
protecting customers by ensuring cyber
security is built into digital products,
services and supply chains. This reflects
community expectations of product safety,
and the risk of vulnerabilities spreading
due to the increasing interconnection
between devices.

###### Growing a cyber skilled workforce

**67** A strong workforce of skilled cyber
security professionals is a key enabler of
Australia’s digital economy and security.
To support businesses in undertaking
these actions, this Strategy includes
a Cyber Security National Workforce
Growth Program that will assist businesses
and academia to grow the cyber skilled
workforce of the future. Growing the cyber
security skills pipeline will ensure all critical
infrastructure owners and operators and
businesses have greater access to skilled
cyber security professionals with the right
skills to meet demand. This complements
the steps the Australian Government has
already taken to invest in the growth of
the Defence cyber workforce.


-----

**68** Greater opportunities will be provided
to Australians seeking to train for a
world-class career in cyber security.
The Cyber Security National Workforce
Growth Program will be underpinned by
a $26.5 million Cyber Skills Partnerships
Innovation Fund, which will encourage
businesses and academia to partner
together to find innovative new ways
to improve cyber security skills.
Activities that will be eligible under
the Fund include:

**—** scholarships

**—** apprenticeships, or
apprenticeship-style courses in
higher education

**—** development and delivery of
specialist cyber security courses
for professionals

**—** retraining initiatives, to help existing
professionals in other disciplines
transition to cyber security roles

**—** training or professional
development for teachers and
board executives, including through
practical partnerships or exchanges
with industry

**—** internships, cadetships, work
experience and staff exchanges

**—** digital training platforms and student
delivered cyber security services

**—** any other innovative idea to meet
the needs of businesses.

**69** The Cyber Security National Workforce
Growth Program seeks to grow cyber
security skills at all stages of education,
including primary, secondary and tertiary.
It will inspire the next generation of cyber
security experts and equip teachers to
include cyber security in their classroom
lessons. The ACSC will grow its education,


skills, training, mentoring and coaching
programs, including specialised programs
for women who are still underrepresented
in the sector. The Australian Government
also intends to work with businesses and
academia on the best way to ensure
university courses meet employer needs,
building on international examples. This
includes considering how cyber security
can be more consistently embedded in
other disciplines, such as engineering
and data science. Strengthening the links
between government, businesses and the
education sector is particularly important
because of the speed of change in cyber
security. Cyber security evolves much
faster than other sectors, as technology
changes and malicious actors adapt their
tactics accordingly.

**70** Businesses and the community need to have
confidence in the cyber security industry.
The Australian Government will continue
to work with businesses on the best way
to promote the cyber security profession
and ensure there are clear professional
standards for practitioners, and more
consistency in the market for consumers. In
the medium to longer term, this could involve
exploring whether there is a need for cyber
security accreditation frameworks, including
how these would map against other existing
licensing and professional accreditation
frameworks. To provide consistency across
the cyber security sector, this could be
accompanied by professional competency
requirements for maintaining accreditation.
The Australian Government will work with
businesses and international partners to
understand if this would be valuable, and
the best way for the cyber security sector
to deliver and maintain these frameworks,
including through close engagement with
international partners.

###### Actions by the community

 “An informed and educated consumer about the cyber threat landscape could be the most efficacious program that government could initiate.”

**Cisco**
Public submission to the Cyber Security Strategy 2020


**71** Most cyber security incidents have an
element of human error. This means it is
critical that all Australians know how to
stay secure online, especially as using
new technology does not come naturally
to everyone. This Strategy will empower
Australians by providing the tools to do so
in a secure way.

**72** There are several things that Australians
can, and should, do to be secure online.
The ACSC will continue to provide best
practice cyber security advice and
assistance through the one-stop-shop
[cyber.gov.au. Cyber.gov.au provides all](http://cyber.gov.au)
the information individuals need to know
about being cyber secure and serves as an
excellent foundation for further initiatives
to build cyber security resilience within the
community. Accessing and implementing
this information are actions the community
can take to increase their cyber security.
In addition, there is growing private sector
cyber security expertise that can assist
in staying secure online across a range of
services, such as the provision of anti-virus
software to in-depth cyber security advice
and response.

**73** Through this Strategy, the Australian
Government will build on existing advice
to make sure messages about cyber
security reach more Australians more often.
The Australian Government will invest in a
new public awareness raising campaign,
delivered in coordination with campaigns
about online safety (see the case study
below). The Australian Government will
also provide a comprehensive online
cyber security training program for small
businesses, older Australians and Australian
[families, delivered through cyber.gov.au.](http://cyber.gov.au)


###### What’s the difference between online safety and cyber security?


As Australians spend more time online,
they need to protect themselves from
cyber threats and illegal and harmful content
and behaviour.

Cyber security includes helping Australians
to be secure online by protecting data,
information, devices and networks from
[malicious actors. The ACSC, via cyber.gov.au,](http://cyber.gov.au)
is the main point of contact for the public on
cyber security.

Online safety includes protecting individuals,
families, and communities from harmful
content and behaviours such as cyber
bulling, image-based abuse and illegal
and harmful online content. The eSafety
[Commissioner, via esafety.gov.au, is the main](http://esafety.gov.au)
point of contact for the public on online
safety. With more Australians online as a
result of COVID-19, the Australian Government
has invested an additional $10 million to
boost eSafety’s investigations and support
teams so help is available to Australians
when they encounter harmful content and
behaviours online.


The Australian Government recognises
the need to provide clear and simple
advice about how to be secure and safe
online. Through this Strategy, Australian
Government departments will work closely
together to provide clear advice on both
online safety and cyber security.
The Australian Government will also make
it easier for businesses interested in both
online safety and cyber security to engage
with government.


-----

**74** Any Australian that needs cyber security
advice or support should reach out to the
experts as soon as they can. One of the
main ways to get cyber security help is by
contacting the ACSC’s 24/7 hotline. Early
action can prevent an incident, or reduce
the harm if it has already occurred. The
ACSC will receive more funding so this
hotline can provide a greater number of
services and increase its capacity.

**75** Through this Strategy, the Australian
Government will prioritise support to
victims of cyber crime. Reporting cyber
crime incidents through the ReportCyber
website is an important way for the
community to help us know the full
extent to which cyber criminals are
harming Australians. Being a victim of a
cyber crime can be traumatic, but the
impact can be reduced with the right
help. Another way to get help is through
the free specialist identity and cyber
crime support service IDCARE. IDCARE
is able to provide tailored, hands-on
support to victims when they need it
most. This Strategy will provide more
funding to victim support services to
help a growing number of people who
need their assistance. By taking the
above actions, government, businesses
and the community will create a more
secure online world for Australians, their
businesses and the essential services
upon which we all depend.


**—** Are unnecessary device features
turned off?


###### Tips to secure your Internet of Things device


The Australian community can take
action to make informed purchasing
decisions. Consumers should ask the
following questions when purchasing
internet-connected devices to reduce
the risk of purchasing an insecure device.


###### Before purchasing an Internet of Things device

**—** Is the device made by a well-known
reputable company and sold by a
well-known reputable store?


**—** Is it possible to change the password?


**—** Does the manufacturer provide
software updates?


**—** What data will the device collect and
who will the data be shared with?


**—** Does the device do only what you
want it to do?

###### Setting up an Internet of Things device


**—** Does the device need to be
connected to the internet?


**—** Is the device in a secure location?


**—** Do I change the default username
and password?


**—** Is my Wi-Fi network set up securely,
and does it have a secure password?

###### This Strategy’s work does not end here


Both government and businesses have finite resources. The actions outlined in this Strategy
address the most urgent issues. Technology is constantly changing; measures designed to
improve security in today’s online world can be quickly overtaken by new technologies, systems,
software and applications.


Australia cannot therefore set and forget, especially as technology and threats continue to
evolve. The Australian Government will continue to work with businesses and the community
to ensure that all continue to take actions to create a more secure online world for Australians,
their businesses and the essential services upon which we all depend.


The standing Industry Advisory Committee (see ‘Implementation and measuring progress’) will
play a key role in advising the Minister what specific actions to take as part of this Strategy in
the longer-term.

The Minister will periodically update this Strategy’s Action Plan (on the following pages) and
report to the Australian Government and the community on measures to continually enhance
Australia’s cyber security.
