###### THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT

#### Each of India’s neighbours is undergoing a
###### transition, giving rise to varied political experiences and experiments. The menace of terrorism and the proliferation of arms, drugs and nuclear technology pose dangers that merit constant attention


1.1 The first decade of the 21st century

has made it increasingly evident that security
threats are unconstrained by borders. India
lives in a difficult neighbourhood. Each of
India’s neighbours is undergoing a transition,
giving rise to varied political experiences
and experiments. Most of these transitions
are proceeding smoothly and have led to the
spread of democracy. However, the menace
of terrorism and proliferation of arms, drugs
and nuclear technology pose dangers that
merit constant attention. In the midst of this
region, India continues to be a centre of
economic activity, a beacon of democracy,
a bastion of stability and a champion of
peaceful coexistence and non-violence.

###### THE GLOBAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT

1.2 The developments in 2008, particularly

the challenges confronting the global

financial system, created unprecedented
strains in the global security environment.
The global financial crisis led to the onset of
economic recession. The instability in the US
financial system, largely due to the failure
of a regulatory system, spread to the world
economy with economic growth slowing
down in several countries.

1.3 After a new Administration assumed

charge in the USA, US foreign and security


policies are being watched as they are
expected to have a significant impact on
global and regional issues, as well as on
the security environment. The US-led global
war on terrorism has shown mixed results.
The security situation in Iraq improved
considerably. The security situation in
Afghanistan deteriorated with the resurgence
of the Taliban. In March 2009, after a policy
review, the US announced a comprehensive,
new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan,
emphasizing a regional approach. In the
aftermath of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai,
the US goal is to disrupt, dismantle and defeat
Al Qaeda and its safe havens in Pakistan
and to prevent their return to Pakistan or
Afghanistan.

1.4 The strategic partnership between

India and Russia was further strengthened in
2008. Cooperation in strategic areas such as
defence, space and nuclear energy received
further impetus in 2008. During the State
Visit of the President of Russian Federation,
Mr. Dmitry Medvedev to India on December
4-5, 2008, an agreement for construction of
additional nuclear units at Kudankulam and
at other sites and an agreement on IndiaRussia joint human space flight programme
were signed.


-----

1.5 India and EU are strategic partners.

Europe is a major trade and economic
partner of India and the strengthening

of our economic and political ties is an
important policy imperative. The annual
India-EU Summit was held in Marseilles in
September 2008 at which the Joint Action
Plan was reviewed. New India-EU activities
were identified for promoting peace and
comprehensive security. India has an annual
security dialogue with the EU.

1.6 India and Japan have established

a strategic and global partnership, based
on shared interests and values and on
advancing bilateral, regional and multilateral
cooperation in the interests of promoting
peace, stability and development in Asia and
beyond. The two countries share a common
interest in the safety and security of the sea
lanes of communication, as well as in other
areas, including the fight against terrorism,
peace-keeping and disaster management. This
vision is reflected in the Joint Declaration on
Security Cooperation that was signed during
the Prime Minister’s visit to Japan on October
22, 2008. Both countries have agreed to
develop a specific Action Plan on the basis of
the Joint Declaration.


1.7 The international

community remains

concerned about the Iranian
nuclear programme. The UN
Security Council Resolution
1835 adopted in September
2008 urged the Iranian

government to suspend


all uranium enrichment related and other
proliferation sensitive nuclear activities. The
situation in West Asia took a turn for the

worse with tensions increasing sharply as
the Israeli Defence Forces launched massive
military strikes in the Gaza Strip. India has
had historical links with West Asia and has
vital interests in the region, including in
the energy and food security areas. India
therefore, seeks promotion of stability in
the region. The Central Asian Region is also
endowed with energy resources. India has
historical and civilizational links with the
countries of Central Asia and pursues a nonintrusive and collaborative approach to
promote stability in the region.

1.8 India’s ‘Look East’ policy envisages

progressive and multifaceted integration
with South East Asia to create conditions
for long-term economic growth,

interdependence and prosperity in Asia.
India’s role in the ASEAN Regional Forum
and the East Asia Summit is aimed at
building a new architecture of stability and
peace in the region.

and a large number of Afghan nationals

were killed, demonstrated that India’s

efforts at reconstruction and development

were implacably opposed by these groups.

Security in southern and eastern Afghanistan

is closely related to developments in

the bordering regions of Pakistan where

sanctuaries provide the bases from which

these terrorist groups operated. The

convergence of extremist and terrorist

groups in Afghanistan with those operating

out of Pakistan, often with the patronage

of its State agencies, has consequently

contributed immensely to the deterioration

of India's external security environment.

1.12 Security related developments in

Pakistan also continued to impact on our

regional security environment. Although as

in previous years the FATA areas and the

NWFP as a whole remained the principal

areas of extremist activity and violence, the

year also witnessed a marked rise in terrorist

incidents all over Pakistan, including in the

capital, Islamabad. The unimpeded growth

of extremist and terrorist organisations in

Pakistan was marked by an increase in

ceasefire violations, continued infiltrations

across the LoC, as also major terrorist

attacks. All this placed an immense strain

on the India-Pakistan Composite Dialogue

process. The terrorist attack on Mumbai in

November 2008 and the clear evidence that

the attack was planned and launched by

Pakistan have thereafter led to a pause in the

process.


1.13 The expanding footprint of extremist
and terrorist organisations in Pakistan and
the fact that many of them have a known
record of terrorist attacks against India
amounts to a security challenge with serious
implications for us. The continuing links
of these organisations with organs of the
Pakistan State adds greater complexities and
dangers to the evolving situation confronting
us. Strengthening of our security apparatus
both internally and on our frontiers is,
therefore, a national priority of the highest
order. Pakistan’s history of military and
quasi-military adventurism underscores the
seriousness of the threat we face.

1.14 India has a strategic and cooperative
partnership with the People’s Republic of
China, which has been further progressed
during high level visits in 2008-09. The two
countries are seeking to build a relationship
of friendship and trust, based on equality,
in which each is sensitive to the concerns
and aspirations of the other. The armed
forces of the two countries are engaged in
building greater understanding through joint
military exercises, through a regular defence
dialogue since 2007 and through exchanges
of military delegations. India and China are
also engaged in negotiations on the Boundary
Question and have agreed to maintain peace
and tranquility in the border areas through
the implementation of mutually agreed
confidence building measures, pending the
final settlement of the boundary issue.

1.15 India has taken note of China’s
statement in the White Paper on China’s


-----

National Defence in 2008 that it will never
seek hegemony or engage in military
expansion now or in the future, no matter

how developed it becomes. India has
also taken note of the double digit growth
in Chinese defence expenditures over
the previous 20 years, which has led to
significant modernization of its defence
forces, both in terms of quality and quantity.
China’s stated objectives, in their White
Paper, of developing strategic missile and
space-based assets and of rapidly enhancing
its blue-water navy to conduct operations
in distant waters, as well as the systematic
upgrading of infrastructure, reconnaissance
and surveillance, quick response and

operational capabilities in the border areas,
will have an effect on the overall military


environment in the neighbourhood of
India. Consequently, China’s defence
modernization needs to be monitored
carefully in the foreseeable future for the
implications that it can have on the security
and defence of India. Similarly, its military
assistance and cooperation with Pakistan
and other countries in our neighbourhood,
as well as the possibility of enhancing
connectivity with Pakistan through the
territory of Jammu & Kashmir, illegally
occupied by China and Pakistan and with
other countries will also have direct military
implications for India. India will engage
China to seek greater transparency and
openness in its defence policy and posture,
while taking all necessary measures to
protect the national security, territorial
integrity and sovereignty of India.

1.16 Nepal witnessed a major political

transition from monarchy to a republican

form of government during the year. The

Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) formed

a coalition government, with Mr. Pushpa

Kamal Dhal ‘Prachanda’ as the Prime Minister.

Bilateral high level visits since the formation of

the new government include those of the new

Prime Minister of Nepal to India in September

and November 2008 and of the External

Affairs Minister to Nepal in November 2008,

during which both sides agreed to work

together to further the bilateral relationship.

Existing bilateral mechanisms have since been

reactivated. Considerable challenges remain

to Nepal’s peace process. A fragile situation

in Nepal poses challenges to India’s security,

especially in view of the open border between

the two countries. A stable and prosperous

Nepal is in India’s interest.

1.17 India has close ties with Bhutan.

Elections were held in March 2008 within

the framework of the new Constitution. India

and Bhutan have also signed a new Treaty of

Friendship, consistent with the contemporary

circumstances. India continued with the

policy of deepening its political, economic,

cultural and social ties with Bhutan by

extending help in the implementation of

the latter’s 9th Five Year Plan. India has

committed to continue to extend its support

to the regime in Bhutan. In the recent past,
the Bhutanese government has outlined its
plans to democratize the nation. India has
conveyed willingness to extend all possible
support to Bhutan for accomplishing this


transition. Bhutan displayed courage and
good neighbourliness in acting against
military camps and bases or operations of

Indian insurgent groups, in the interest of
mutual security.

1.18 Developments in Bangladesh have an
influence on India’s security as India shares
long land borders with Bangladesh. India
has sought to engage Bangladesh in a wideranging dialogue, including on developmental
and security issues. The restoration of
democracy in Bangladesh, after two years of
rule by a caretaker government was a positive
development for the region and for IndiaBangladesh relations. The Awami League led
Grand Alliance won more than a three fourth
majority in the Jatiya Sansad in the elections
held in December 2008. Under the new
government, Bangladesh is expected to focus
on social and economic development. India
looks forward to a further intensification of
bilateral ties, especially in relation to India’s
security concerns regarding Indian insurgent
groups from the North East and other forces
inimical to India operating from its territory.

1.19 The security situation in Sri Lanka

underwent a major change in the year under
review. The Sri Lankan Army has succeeded
in taking control of areas held by LTTE since
the internal strife began. India has been
concerned about the humanitarian cost of the
conflict and has actively worked to ensure
the safety and welfare of the affected civilian
population. India has advocated a political
solution of the conflict and is committed to
a peaceful resolution of the conflict, taking

###### INTERNAL SECURITY CHALLENGES

1.28 The internal security scenario in the

country can be broadly seen in terms of
various specific theatres which have been
witnessing a mixed hue of separatist, ethnic
and other forms of violence, subversive/
terrorist/ extremist activity in Jammu &
Kashmir and some insurgency in some North
Eastern States, particularly, Assam, Manipur
and Nagaland; Naxalite violence in some
areas of certain States, particularly in Andhra
Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and
Orissa; periodic incidents of terrorist attacks
and bomb blasts etc., in various parts of the
hinterland; communal tensions and violence;
and sporadic incidents and episodes which
may affect public order through large scale
agitations, street violence etc.

1.29 While the overall situation in the

country, seen in the light of the above,
remained largely under control during 2008,
the occurrence of a number of major terrorist
incidents and bomb blasts etc., in different
parts of the country, including the terrorist
attack in Mumbai in November 2008, raised
serious concerns about the internal security
scenario. On the communal front also, while
the situation, in macro terms, has remained,
by and large, under control, there were
disturbing incidents in some parts of the
country, particularly in Orissa where there


was communal violence which also led to
communal tension and confrontation in certain
other States of the country. There were some
instances of major and prolonged agitations
during the year, which led to disturbance of
public order and disruption of normal life in
the affected areas such as, the agitation by
the Gujjars in Rajasthan in pursuance of their
demands for being given Scheduled Tribe
Status, the agitation in Jammu & Kashmir in the
wake of the controversy relating to the transfer
of land to the Shri Amarnath Yatra Shrine
Board, and in West Bengal, in the context of
the demand for a separate Gorkhaland State.

1.30 Following the Mumbai terror attack,
the Government has taken a number of steps
to further strengthen the internal security
apparatus, including the establishment of
National Investigation Agency, enactment of
Unlawful Activities Prevention Amendment
Act, 2008 to deal with various facets of
terrorism and making the Multi Agency
Centre (MAC) in the Intelligence Bureau
functional on 24x7 basis to share intelligence
with all other Central and State agencies.
The strengthening of security forces, law
enforcement machinery, intelligence and
coordination amongst diverse agencies and
with the States, is also being attended to on
priority.

1.31 India faced daunting security

challenges which are spread along the entire
spectrum of conflict. These challenges are
interrelated and they span the political,
economic, military and technological

dimensions; consequently, the responses
to these also have to be inclusive of these
dimensions, for which the country and its
defence forces are fully geared.

##### The principal task of the Ministry is to frame
###### policy directions on defence and security related matters and communicate them for implementation to the Services Headquarters, ISOs, Production Establishments and Research & Development Organisations


###### ORGANISATIONAL SET-UP AND FUNCTIONS

2.1 After independence Ministry of
Defence was created under the charge of
a Cabinet Minister, and, each Service was
placed under its own Commander-in-Chief.
In 1955, the Commanders-in-Chief were
renamed as the Chief of the Army Staff, the
Chief of the Naval Staff and the Chief of the
Air Staff. In November 1962, a Department of
Defence Production was set up to deal with
research, development and production of
defence equipment. In November 1965, the
Department of Defence Supplies was created
for planning and execution of schemes for
import substitution of defence requirements.
These two Departments were later merged
to form the Department of Defence
Production and Supplies. In 2004, the name
of Department of Defence Production and
Supplies was changed to Department of
Defence Production. In 1980, the Department
of Defence Research and Development was
created. In 2004, the Department of ExServicemen Welfare was created.

2.2  The Defence Secretary functions as
head of the Department of Defence and is
additionally responsible for co-ordinating


the activities of the four Departments in the
Ministry.

###### DEPARTMENTS

2.3 The principal task of the Ministry is

HQ IDS.  The exercise was a first of its kind
endeavour by India in which 35 officers from
the Armed Forces of 13 countries of Indian
Ocean Region besides 45 officers from India
were given an exposure to the nuances of
complex UN Peace Support Operations.

2.11 **Defence** **Information** **Technology**
**Consultative** **Committee** **(DITCC):** This
Committee has been constituted for joint
interaction between the MoD, Armed Forces,
Academia and Industry to synergise and steer


directions towards a fully integrated approach

various organisations under MoD. The CISC
is the Chairman of this committee which has
members from MoD, three Services, Ministry
of Communications & IT and DRDO, and coopted Members from Academia, Industry and
other Government organisations.

2.12 **Centre of Excellence:** In order to
develop and customize indigenous products
available in the realms of Information
Security and Information Assurance, a Centre


-----

of Excellence on Information Assurance
(COEIA) has been set up at IIT Kharagpur
for information technology related activities

with the initial funding from MoD. This
centre will be the umbrella organisation
for provisioning of information assurance
related R & D projects for MoD and the three
Services.

2.13 **Centre for Joint Warfare Studies**
**(CENJOWS): The nascent think tank**
organisation, Centre for Joint Warfare Studies
under the stewardship of Patron-in-Chief, the
Raksha Mantri carried out a host of activities
towards furtherance of intellectual thinking
in the field of Defence Strategy and Regional
Security. Prominent among these were
Seminars on ‘Indian Way of War Fighting’
and ‘Indian Experience in Force Projection’
and round table discussions on ‘India China
Security Dynamics’ and ‘Perspective on
Central Asia and Implications for India’.
Seminal work has been carried out in a study
on Evolution of Joint Framework for National
Security Decision Making.

2.14 **Seminar on Amphibious Warfare:** A
Tri Services seminar on Amphibious Warfare
was conducted at Pune from January 19 to
20, 2009. Leading strategic analysts of the
Nation presented papers at the Seminar
which was attended by Service Chiefs and
senior serving and retired officers.

2.15 **Diamond Jubilee Re-Union: The**
premier tri service military training institution
of the country National Defence Academy
at Pune celebrated its Diamond Jubilee Re

union from December 6-8, 2008. President
of India was the Chief Guest for the
occasion. In addition to the Governors of

Punjab and Arunachal Pradesh and Chiefs
of three Services, alumni both serving and
retired, attended a wide variety of events to
commemorate the historic occasion.

###### SERVICES HEADQUARTERS

2.16 The three Services Headquarters,
viz., the Army Headquarters, the Naval
Headquarters and the Air Headquarters
function under the Chief of the Army
Staff (COAS), the Chief of the Naval Staff
(CNS) and the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS)
respectively. They are assisted by their
Principal Staff Officers (PSOs). The InterService Organisations, under the Department
of Defence are responsible for carrying
out tasks related to common needs of the
three Services such as medical care, public
relations and personnel management of
civilian staff in the Defence Headquarters.

2.17 A number of Committees dealing with
defence related activities assist the Raksha
Mantri. The Chiefs of Staff Committee is
a forum for the Service Chiefs to discuss
matters having a bearing on the activities of
the Services and also to advise the Ministry.
The position of Chairman of the Chiefs of
Staff Committee devolves on the longest
serving Chief of Staff, and consequently
rotates amongst the three Services.

#### The Indian Army stands vigil along the border ###### watchful, prepared for any sacrifice - so that  the people of the country may live in peace and  with honour


3.1 The infusion of high technology
based precision weaponry has enhanced
the lethality of future warfare manifold. The
spectrum of threat ranges from the nuclear
to the conventional and the asymmetric,
with terrorism emerging like a hydra-headed
monster. The rigours of climate i.e., the glacial
heights and extreme cold, dense mountainous
jungles and the heat and simoom of the
deserts also need to be factored. The ethos of
the Army is ingrained in all soldiers with an
unwavering will to succeed, accepting their
grave responsibility and an unbridled ability to
give their lives for others.

3.2   The Indian Army has time and again
lived up to its tradition of valour, heroism,
sacrifice and fortitude. It stands vigil along
the border - watchful, prepared for any
sacrifice - so that the people of the country
may live in peace and with honour.

procurement. Additional BFSR (MR) mounted
on HMV TATRA is also being procured.

3.5 **Artillery:** The artillery is acquiring an
array of guns, missiles and rocket systems with
long ranges and superior firepower as also
state-of-the-art surveillance systems. This will
enhance the range, accuracy and lethal power
of the artillery and make it a more potent force
in the future besides extending its reach to the
operational and strategic depth.


-----

3.6 **Weapon System:**

(a) **BrahMos Weapon System:**
BrahMos Supersonic Cruise Missile
is an all weather, fire-and-forget
missile capable of being launched
from land, sea, sub-sea and air
with a range of approximately 290
Kilometers.

Russian versatile and devastating
MLRS is already in service.


-----

3.7 **Upgradation of Vehicle Platform: The**
existing Vehicle Platform of GRAD BM-21
is of 1980 vintage and requires upgradation.
Consequently, upgraded vehicle platforms
are under procurement.

3.8 **Development** **of** **Indigenous** **130**
**mm Cargo Ammunition:** Ordnance Factory
Board (OFB) successfully demonstrated
the indigenous 130mm Cargo ammunition
produced by them in technical collaboration
with IMI, Israel.

point detonation, VT and carrier shells were
introduced into service after the due process
of trial evaluation.

3.10 **Upgraded** **Indigenous** **Forward**
**Observation Simulator (UI FOS):** Bharat
Electronics Limited (BEL), Bangalore has
successfully developed an Indigenous
Forward Observation Simulator.

3.11 **Joint** **Training:** A long term
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) has
been signed between India and Singapore for
training of SAF Artillery personnel at the School
of Artillery, Devlali. A bilateral training exercise
between Indian Army and Singapore Armed
Forces (named **‘Exercise Agni Warrior’) was**
conducted in November 2008.

###### Army Air Defence

3.12 The major focus is to acquire and
replace vintage missile systems and acquire
a common successor for AD Gun Systems.
To enhance the surveillance and fire control
capabilities, it is planned to procure **3D**
**Tactical Control Radars and successor of**
existing Fire Control Radars.


###### Army Aviation

3.13 The procedure to strengthen Army
Aviation by replacing the existing helicopter
fleet with Reconnaissance and Surveillance
Helicopters having better capabilities and
capacity is being pursued. Army is also in the
process of acquiring weaponised platforms
based on the indigenously manufactured
**Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH).**

###### Engineers

3.14 The capability of Corps of Engineers is
being strengthened by replacing existing bridge
systems with state of the art indigenous bridges,
which will enhance tactical mobility of our
field formations. Procurement of new earth
moving plants and material handling cranes is
also being done to reduce the fatigue factor for
troops.

###### Signals

3.15 The Corps of Signals has taken a
number of major strides in consolidating the
various networks of Indian Army. ASCON
and Command Integrated Network links
have been consolidated into one Army
network. Defence Communication Network,
a prestigious tri-service project, will provide
connectivity to strategic elements of Army,
Navy, Air Force and IDS. Upgradation of
ASCON, which will incorporate concept
of integrated surveillance system and
ASCON Hotspots, has been planned. New
indigenous Radio Sets with Frequency
Hopping capability and Data transfer facility
have been issued to the field formations to
improve the capability of Network Centricity
in the Army.


-----

###### Infantry

3.16 The present situation in the region
warrants state-of-the-art systems for the
Infantry. The focus is to enhance the fire
power and personal protection. This is
being achieved through endeavour for
better quality personal weapons, thermal
imaging devices, mine protected vehicles
and improved radio communication
systems. A contract has been signed for
supply of Boot Anti Mines for use by
Infantry.  Bullet proof vehicles and shot
guns are being procured for counter
insurgency operations. Incidents like
26/11 have underlined the need to equip
all infantry battalions suitably for rapid
reaction. This is being achieved by


procuring specialised items for the Ghatak
Platoons of Infantry Battalions.

3.17 Containerised vehicles for
communication systems and light specialist
vehicles (multipurpose) are under trial
evaluation and are likely to be procured in
the next financial year.

###### Territorial Army

3.18 The Territorial Army (TA) is a
voluntary, part time Army consisting of
otherwise gainfully employed Indian citizens,
eager to perform their role in the country’s
defence in the event of national emergency
by relieving the Regular Army of their static
duties and by aid to civil authorities in dealing
with natural calamities and maintenance of
essential services.

Inf Bn TA (Eco) and 130 Inf Bn TA (Eco)

have been raised in March 2008. These are
being funded by the State Government of
Uttarakhand.

3.20 **Raising of TA Gp HQ at Northern**
**Command:** The proposal to raise the TA
Gp HQ at Northern Command has been
approved.

###### Rashtriya Rifles (RR)

3.21 RR remains the Counter Insurgency/

Counter Terrorist Arm of the Indian

Army. The kind of surgical operations

being carried out now-a-days has resulted

in drastic reduction in own casualties.

Operational performance of Rashtriya

Rifles has been exemplary. This has been

possible due to high motivation level of

troops, a good intelligence network and

an excellent rapport with local population

and civil administration. However, success

in proxy war has not been without a cost.

Many gallant officers and men of Rashtriya

Rifles have made the supreme sacrifice in

the relentless pursuit of our objective.

###### COUNTER INSURGENCY OPERATIONS & INTERNAL SECURITY SITUATIONS

3.24 The security challenges that face
the nation today are varied, sophisticated
and complex. From growing threats in the
domain of conventional/ nuclear conflicts,
to maintenance of vigil on our unsettled
borders, to combating a proxy war in Jammu
& Kashmir and numerous insurgencies
in the North East, the Indian Army faces
multidimensional challenges. Additionally,
the Army faces threats to Internal Security
from the naxal menace and terrorism.

###### Jammu & Kashmir


by terrorists have declined significantly in
comparison to the preceding year. The secure
environment thus created, enabled a high
voter turnout in the recent assembly elections
in the State, thereby contributing towards the
strengthening of the democratic process.

###### Situation on the Borders 

3.26 (a) **Line of Control/ International**
**Border (LC/ IB):** The year 2008 saw a spurt
in firing incidents along the LC/ IB. Between
January 2008 to March 2009, a total of
87 firing incidents took place, of which
51 were ceasefire violations by Pakistan,
wherein Pakistani posts resorted to targeting
our counter infiltration deployment and
surveillance grid; possibly to disrupt the same
and abet infiltration. The violations were
repeatedly brought to the notice of Pakistani
authorities through established mechanisms.

(b) Infiltration:  The counter infiltration posture
was strengthened, especially during the summer
to prevent infiltration. The effort met with
success. The assessed successful infiltration for
the period from January 2008 to March 2009 is
57, compared to 311 during the corresponding
period in year 2007. Infiltration attempts by
terrorists, however continue.  During the period,
44 infiltration bids were foiled, with 61 terrorists
being killed in action.


3.25 The security situation
in the State is firmly under
the control of the Security
Forces (SF). Due to a strong
counter infiltration posture and
relentless counter terrorism
operations conducted by
the Army, violent incidents

-----

fatal casualties in the process. The terrorist
leadership has been successfully targeted
with a total of 66 middle level leaders being
eliminated during the period.

###### North East

3.28 The security situation in the North
Eastern States has shown significant
improvement. The Army continues to
spearhead the Counter Insurgency (CI) and
Counter Terrorist (CT) operations supported
by other Central/ State Forces. Sustained
operational pressure from the Security Forces
has forced many Under Ground (UG) groups
to seek ceasefires or initiate dialogue with
the Government.

3.29 **Assam: In Assam, relentless operations**
by the Army against the United Liberation
Front of Assam (ULFA), resulted in the killing/
apprehending of over 476 ULFA cadres.
Demoralisation in the ranks has triggered
a spate of surrenders with over 382 ULFA
cadres surrendering between January 2008
to March 2009. Similar pressure led to a


critical split in the ranks of the 28 Battalion,
with a large number of cadres approaching
the Government for a ceasefire. There is
overwhelming popular support for the peace
process and pressure is mounting on senior
ULFA leaders to come to the negotiating
table.

3.30 ‘Suspension of Operations’
Agreements with other smaller UG Groups
in Assam like the National Democratic
Front of Bodoland (NDFB), Dimasa
Halam Doagah (DHD) and the United
Peoples Democratic Solidarity (UPDS)
are holding. In South Assam, however,
the breakaway faction of the DHD - the
DHD (J) - indulged in rampant killings and
extortion earlier in the year, adversely
affecting work on critical infrastructural
(road and rail) projects. Resultantly,
the Army stepped up operations in the
area, consequent to which the situation
improved considerably.

3.31 **Nagaland: In Nagaland, Inter Factional**
Clashes (IFCs) between the NSCN (IM) and


Raksha Mantri, Chief of Army Staff, Defence Secretary and other Senior officials at the War
Memorial at Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh


-----

NSCN (K) continue unabated. Army and
Assam Rifles (AR) units, operating within the
framework of the CFGRs, have succeeded
in minimising violence between the NSCN
factions and ensuring the security of civilians.

3.32 **Manipur: In Manipur, operations by**
the Army and Assam Rifles are continuing.
During the period from January 2008
to March 2009, 279 cadres of various
outfits were killed while over 1076 were
apprehended.

3.33 The ‘Suspension of Operations
Agreement’ with the Kuki and Zomi UG
Groups (initiated by the Army in 2005)
was formalised into a Tripartite Agreement
involving the Centre and the State in August
2008. This ushered peace in the Kuki and
Zomi inhabited areas in Manipur, though
the Meitei UG Groups continue to remain
hostile. However, after the Agreement with
the Kuki Groups, pressure is mounting on
the Meitis to join the peace process.

3.34 **Tripura: In Tripura, the situation in the**
State improved significantly, although sporadic
incidents of violence by UG groups continue.
Due to sustained operational pressure and
a ‘Surrender cum Rehabilitation’ policy
announced by the State Government, over
441 cadres of various UG Groups surrendered
during the period.

###### Naxal Violence

3.35 The Indian Army’s role continues to
be one of offering advice and assistance in
training to strengthen police mechanisms in
the affected states. At the request of Ministry
of Home Affairs(MHA), Indian Army Teams
visited the States of Chhattisgarh, Bihar and


Jharkhand to review the situation first hand.
The reports filed have been well received
by MHA with a number of positive spin
offs. Counter terrorism schools have been
sanctioned for Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and
Chhattisgarh.

###### Situation along the LAC

3.36 As China seeks to assert its centrality in
the Asian Security Order, the qualitative and
quantitative quotients of its military profile
are bound to grow. While this is obviously
a cause for concern, there is no reason for
undue alarm.

3.37 The situation along the LAC remains
peaceful. The mechanisms of Confidence
Building Measures are under implementation.
Indian Army’s response, however, continues
to be watchful, firm and precise.

###### INDIAN ARMY’S CONTRIBUTION TO UNITED NATIONS PEACE KEEPING OPERATIONS

3.38 India continues to be the third largest
contributor to United Nations Peace Keeping
Operations. The Indian Army is presently
taking part in five on-going peace missions.
These are UNIFIL (Lebanon), MONUC
(Congo), UNMIS (Sudan), UNDOF (Golan
Heights) and ONUCI (Ivory Coast).

3.39 India has so far provided two
Military Advisors, 12 Force Commanders
and one Division Commander in various
United Nation Missions. Towards the
fulfilment of India’s commitment to
the UN and peace, 124 Indian soldiers
have, so far, made the supreme sacrifice.
In recognition of their gallant and


-----

distinguished service while serving the
noble cause of world peace, Indian Army
personnel have been honoured with 1
Param Vir Chakra, 5 Maha Vir Chakras,
1 Kirti Chakra, 19 Vir Chakras, 3 Shaurya
Chakras, 4 Yudh Seva Medals, 10 Sena
Medals and 2 Vishisht Seva Medals.

3.40 **Centre For United Nations Peace**
**Keeping (CUNPK):** A Centre For United
Nations Peace Keeping (CUNPK) was
established in September 2000 in New Delhi
to train Indian and foreign officers deputed
for UN Peacekeeping Mission. The CUNPK
has conducted six International Seminars, five
National Seminars, 22 International Training
Capsules for Contingent Officers, Military
Observers, Civilian Police, Staff & Logistics
Officers, one Multinational Peace Keeping
Operation Exercise (PKO), one Annual
Conference of International Association of
Peace Keeping Training Centres (IAPTC)
and six Bilateral Seminars. 351 foreign
participants from 71 countries have been
trained till date.

3.41 The CUNPK was the Secretariat for
the 14th Annual Conference of International
Association of Peacekeeping Training Centres
(IAPTC) from October 5 to 11, 2008 at the
National Defence College, Abjua, Nigeria.
The event was attended by 144 participants
from 30 countries.

###### ARMY SPORTS

3.42 Mission Olympics Wing of Army
continued to achieve greater sporting glory,


winning numerous international medals. For
the first time, the Indian Contingent included
as many as six sportsmen participating in the
Beijing Olympics.

3.43 Three rowers of Army Rowing
Node (ARN) represented the Nation in
Beijing Olympics.  As part of the process of
creating world class sporting infrastructure,
an international level 2.2 Km long rowing
channel is nearing completion at ARN, Pune.

3.44 Naib Subedar Surendra Singh of Army

being carried out.


of Information and Technology (DIT)
has created a programme for this. It is
under trial at three flying stations of the

IAF and once proven, it is proposed to
be implemented at all other bases.

(c) **Vermiculture: In order to scientifically**
dispose off the garbage at Air Force
stations and thus manage bird activity,
IAF has launched a “Zero Garbage”
scheme for IAF bases. This scheme
has made the environment cleaner,
reduced bird activity and contributed
towards increase in air safety. The
scheme has been implemented at all
major Air Force Stations.

###### SUMMARY OF LATEST COMPTROLLER & AUDITOR GENERAL (C&AG) REPORT ON THE WORKING OF MINISTRY OF DEFENCE

**Report No. CA 4 of 2008:** **Union Government (Defence Services) Army and Ordnance**
**Factories.**


###### II Ministry of Defence

**Para 2.1** **Irregularities in procurement of**
**Bullet Proof Vehicles**

The Ministry of Defence procured 200 Bullet
Proof Vehicles (BPV) worth Rs. 31.64 crore in
July 2005 from a private firm. These vehicles
were reported defective by the users. Besides
compromising safety Army HQ, citing urgency
of requirement favoured the procurement
of vehicle manufactured by a particular firm.
In addition Director General of Ordnance
Services purchased nine BPVs of different type
from the same firm in February 2007 at the
cost of Rs. 4.12 crore. Extra expenditure of Rs.
68 lakh was also incurred by not considering
the offer of an Ordnance Factory to supply
similar vehicles at lower rate.

###### III Army

**Para 3.1** **Procurement of special clothing**
**and Mountaineering Equipment**

Army HQ has been procuring special
clothing for troops deployed in extreme cold
climate conditions such as Siachen glacier
for over two decades without any technical
specifications and in violation of basic norms
of procurement. This resulted in rejection
of special clothing items worth Rs. 28.81


crore either in inspection or by end users in
respect of ten contracts valuing Rs. 48.88
crore concluded for the years 2002-06. Items
worth Rs. 9.98 crore were accepted after reinspection or by levying small penalty.

**Para 3.2** **Avoidable extra expenditure in**
**procurement of blankets.**

Director General of Ordnance Services
(DGOS) initially did not plan properly the
procurement of blankets for troops despite the
requirement being projected in October 2001
and later projecting emergent requirements
procured Rs. 3.5 lakh blankets from private
firms at a rate two times higher than the rate
offered by the handloom sector. On one hand,
DGOS incurred extra expenditure of Rs. 9.17
crore on procurement from private firms at
higher rate, on the other hand, it could not
ensure that the blankets reached the troops
on time for winter 2005-06. Thus inefficient
planning and poor procurement management
by DGOS led to avoidable expenditure and
inconvenience to troops.

**Para 3.4** **Avoidable loss due to acceptance**
**of defective ammunition.**

Instead of replacing the entire lot of 10,000
rounds of ammunition supplied by a foreign
firm which was found defective in receipt


-----

inspection, DGOS got only 1071 rounds
replaced. Later due to an accident in firing,
the whole lot was discarded resulting in loss

of Rs. 13.65 crore. Another lot of 10,000
rounds, which was also found defective in
inspection was yet to be discarded, posing a
risk to the safety of troops.

###### IV Works and Military Engineer Services

**Para 4.1** **Misutilisation** **of** **Project**
**Contingencies**

Chief Engineer Bhopal misused project
contingencies of Rupees one crore of ten
different projects executed at different stations
for constructing office accommodation
without obtaining sanction of competent
financial authority.

**Para 4.2** **Excess payment due to defective**
**water meter**

Due to delay in replacement of defective
water meter, MES, Jodhpur had to make
excess payment of Rs. 76.24 lakh on account
of water charges for the period from July 2004
to March 2007 to Public Health Engineer
Department (PHED) Rajasthan.

###### V Border Roads Organisation

**Para 5.1** **Avoidable extra expenditure due**
**to ambiguities in the contract**

Ambiguities in the contracts regarding
specification of steel for use in superstructure
of two bridges resulted in extra expenditure
of Rs. 64.51 lakh besides delay in execution
of projects, as the work had to be retendered.


###### VI Ordnance Factory Organisation

**Para 6.1** **Performance of Ordnance Factory**
**Organisation**

The Ordnance Factory Organization comprising
39 Ordnance Factories with manpower of
1.12 lakh is engaged in production of arms,
ammunition, equipment, clothing etc. primarily
for the Armed Forces of the country. The value
of production aggregated to Rs. 7957.53 crore
in 2006-07, which was 09.69 per cent lower
than the value of production of Rs. 8811.59
crore in 2005-06.

The total expenditure of Ordnance Factory
Organisation has decreased from Rs.6847.13
crore to Rs.6191.89 crore during 2005-06 to
2006-07.

During 2006-07, production of 117 items
(out of 438 items for which demands existed
and targets were fixed) was behind schedule.

During 2006-07, Export target has increased
by 66.67 per cent as compared to 2005-06.

**Para 6.3 Abnormal delay in execution**
**of Ordnance Factory Project**
**Nalanda**

Inadequacies in planning for setting up an
Ordnance Factory at Nalanda for production
of bi-modular charge system of ammunition
leading to repeated revisions in the project cost
estimates coupled with failure of the Ministry
of Defence in firming up their decision
regarding enhanced outlay for the project has
seriously jeopardized the project. As a result,
no value for money had been derived from
the huge investment of Rs. 376.93 crore made


-----

as of July 2007. Besides, estimated cost of the
project has shot up from Rs. 941.13 crore to
Rs. 1570 crore.

**Para 6.5** **Extra expenditure due to failure**
**to exercise option clause**

Failure of Ordnance Factory Board to direct
the Ordnance Factory Ambernath to exercise
option clause in procurement of additional
quantity of copper cathode against its existing
order on M/s Minerals and Metal Trading
Corporation to meet the requirement of
Ordnance Factory Katni, despite having an
opportunity to do so, resulted in procurement
of copper cathode by the latter at an
additional expenditure of Rs. 7.71 crore.

**Para 6.10 Idle investment on leasing of**
**unsuitable land**

Land acquired on lease by Ordnance Factory
Board in May 2001 at a cost of Rs. 1.05 crore
from Kolkata Metropolitan Development
Authority for construction of a Guest House,
seminar-cum-conference room and Exhibitioncum-Display room at Kolkata yielded no value
for money, as it could not achieve the intended
objectives on account of its unsuitability for
constructing buildings. Further, the possibility
of alternate use is also uncertain in view of
Ordnance Factory Board acquiring another
five acres of land at a different locality in
Kolkata to meet the intended objective.

###### Performance Audit

**Supply Chain Management of General Stores**
**and Clothing in the Army**

Clothing and General Stores are important
requirements for the Army. The Army


procures and maintains inventory of over
20,000 items of Clothing and General Stores
(GS&C) required for operationalisation

of units and upkeep of troops, including
special items of clothing and mountaineering
equipment for troops in glacier region.
There are approximately 20400 GS&C
items, which include paint, detergents,
cooking utensils, tentage items, parachute
and personal clothings, special clothing and
mountaineering items for troops operating in
Glacier region.

A performance audit of the total Supply
Chain Management of these GS&C items
was conducted, covering the entire gamut
of provisioning, procurement, stocking,
issue, utilisation and user satisfaction. The
performance audit revealed that the Supply
Chain Management of General Stores and
Clothing (GS&C) in the Army suffered
from several systemic deficiencies. There
was no effective coordination between
Central Procurement Cell (CPC) of the
Army HQ and lower echelons resulting in
local purchases valuing Rs. 169.37 crore
remaining unreported. This deficiency in
the provisioning process entails the risk of
substantial overprovisioning of items by
CPC. Director General Ordnance Services
at Army HQ inducted new products such
as Prefabricated Huts, Superior Blankets
Barrack, Detergents, Superior Paints, and
Modular Gloves at a total cost of Rs. 89
crore, without need analysis, trial evaluation
and revision of scales. The present system of
GS&C procurements being highly centralised,


-----

is unable to process procurements within the
prescribed lead time. Hence, 67 per cent of
the orders could not be placed within the

given lead time, thus delaying procurement
of stores and their supply to troops. GOCin-C, Northern Command procured 25,754
Bullet Proof Jackets valuing Rs. 58.92 crore
from a private firm at higher rates without
giving details of the actual specifications and
by waiving the requirement of inspection by
Director General Quality Assurance resulting
in extra expenditure of about Rs. 13 crore
apart from lack of quality assurance of the
critical items supplied to the troops for use in
operational area.

Army HQ failed to ensure timely procurement
of Special Clothing and Mountaineering
items used in operational areas like Siachen
resulting in stock out levels of these critical
items being as high as 44 to 70 per cent. To
meet shortage of these items, Army resorted
to the unauthorised practice of issuing partly
worn stores (PWS) to the troops in the glacier
region. Such practice of recycling of special
clothing items is not desirable on grounds of
hygiene, operational suitability and overall
morale of the troops. User survey conducted
by Audit showed that 50 per cent of divisions/
regiments were not satisfied with the quality
and fitting of the clothing supplied.

Army placed orders on trade in preference
to Ordnance Factory leading to loss of
productive capacity of Ordnance Factories
which have been set up as dedicated source
for manufacture and supply to Army and other
Services. DGOS and Army Commanders


procured 20,741 Tents from trade at the cost
of Rs. 54.48 crore during 2006-07 denying
orders to Ordnance Factories. Army HQ also

ignored request of DGOF for placement of
orders, and procured 4,750 Cover Water

Proof valuing Rs. 2.65 crore from trade.

Computerisation and modernisation of the

ordnance supplies have been undertaken

without developing an appropriate and robust

transportation model and a comprehensive

business process reengineering for non-war

like GS&C items. Several attempts of Army

HQ over the last 40 years to modernise have

been ad-hoc, directionless and fraught with

time and cost overrun. In addition to diverting

432 personnel and after spending Rs. 243

crore, no measurable benefits were visible as

of January 2008.

Basic objectives of operating a multi-echelon

stocking and distribution system with

predetermined levels of maintenance stock

holding to ensure ready availability of the

right material at the right place and at the

right time to the troops were not achieved

fully as there were persistent shortages of

stores in the depots and 30 per cent of the

user demands remained unmet, troops in

the glacier region had to manage with old

worn out clothing and there was high level of

dissatisfaction amongst the troops about the

quality of clothing supplied.

**Life Sciences Laboratories of DRDO**

Life Sciences Group (LSG) laboratories under
Defence Research Development Organisation
(DRDO) are engaged in research and
development work in the field of agriculture,
food, life support systems, nuclear medicine,
psychology and physiology of troops in
diverse climatic conditions including high
altitudes. Two categories of projects viz. Staff
Projects and R&D Projects are undertaken
by these labs. Staff Projects are invariably
taken up at the instance of Services against
existing or futuristic needs and are expected
to achieve qualitative requirements projected
by them.

A performance audit, focusing on relevance
of R & D activities of the LSG labs to the
Armed Forces, indicated the following:

The project planning in LSG labs lacked user
focus as an overwhelming number of projects
taken up were not based on requirements
given by the users and were focused on pure
research and development. Adherence to
Plan was poor as 30 per cent of the planned
projects were not taken up for implementation
and, more than 50 per cent of the projects
undertaken by labs were unplanned and
adhoc. Proper linkages between Plan and
Budget were not established as budgetary
allocations to the labs were made on lump
sum basis instead of adopting a system of
project-wise allocations as planned. Most
of the products developed by the Life
Sciences Labs of DRDO were not exclusively
applicable to Armed Forces in that only 29


per cent of the products developed during
the last 17 years were in use by the Armed
Forces. The Integrated Research Council,

meant for co-ordination between the users,
viz. three Services and DRDO had not met
regularly as prescribed showing lack of user
participation. Transfer of technology could be
achieved only for 50 per cent of the products
developed by the labs. Adequate attention
has not been paid to patenting of the products
developed. Similarly, insufficient attention
was paid to filing and securing patents for the
products/technologies developed by DRDO.

**_[Chapter-II of Report No. PA 4 of 2008_**
**_Army and Ordnance Factories (Performance_**
**_Audit)]_**

**Manufacture and issue of 23mm and 30mm**
**Ammunition in ordnance factories**

Ordnance Factories manufacture 23 mm and
30 mm ammunition for the Armed Forces.
23 mm ammunition is fired from Schilka
four barreled gun to protect armoured troops
against enemy air attacks by destroying
low flying air targets and ground targets.
30 mm ammunition is used in Automatic
Gun mounted on Infantry Combat Vehicle
against light armoured targets, soft skinned
targets, personnel at certain range and low
flying aircraft at single shot firing as well as
automatic firing.

Performance audit of the manufacture and
issue of 23 mm and 30 mm ammunition by
the ordnance factories covering the period
2002-07 disclosed the following:


-----

Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) failed to
redeploy resources for production of demand
intensive 23 mm ammunition from the

surplus resources available for production of
30 mm ammunition, though there has been
declining trend in demand for the latter. Even
the committed quantity for production and
supply of 23 mm ammunition to the Army
could not be supplied by OFB, resulting in
avoidable import of ammunition worth Rs.
44.72 crore.

There was mismatch in the production of
components in the component manufacturing
factories and ammunition in the filling
factories. This weakness in production
planning led to the idling of production
capacity in the first two quarters of each
production year besides uneven production
in both component and filling factories.

OFB allotted production target to component
manufacturing factory without assessing
actual requirement and the available stock
in filling factories. This resulted in avoidable
production and stock holdings in different
stages. These coupled with inefficient and
uneconomic production led to avoidable
production/extra expenditure of Rs. 12.91
crore.

Three factories (Metal & Steel Factory,
Ordnance Factory Khamaria and Gun & Shell
Factory) issued warrants to production shops
without extract from OFB or Inter Factory
Demand (IFD) from sister factories, resulting
in un-necessary production of components
worth Rs. 12.09 crore.


Metal & Steel Factory and Ordnance
Factory Badmal circumvented the laid
down procedure and suppressed the excess

consumption of materials/ components
valuing Rs. 6.84 crore in production.

Due to excessive rejection rate, OFB suffered
loss of Rs. 99.11 crore in the production and
issue of 23 mm and 30 mm ammunition
during 2002-07.

There was abnormal variation in cost of
production of the same item in different
factories, under-recovery of cost of Rs.
23.24 crore due to fixation of lower issue
price by OFB and high cost of production
of ammunition/components in ordnance
factories compared to trade.

**Summary of Important Audit Observations**
**by C&AG of India**

Audit Report containing results of audit of
Ministry of Defence in so far as they relate
to Air Force, Navy and associated DRDOs
for the year ended March 2007 (Report No.
CA 5 of 2008) was presented in both houses
of Parliament on 14 March 2008. Some of
the important audit findings included in the
Report are indicated below:

**I.** **Upgradation of an Aircraft**

IAF’s Aircraft ‘A’ upgrade programme
approved in August 1999 at a cost of Rs.
430 crore will have limited viability as


-----

inherent problems being faced by the Aircraft
and engines have not been resolved. The
feasibility of the project was doubtful ab-initio

and considerable time overruns would further
dilute benefits of the project as the upgraded
aircraft would have a very short residual life.
Reductions in scope of the upgrade with the
intent to contain costs have also truncated
the envisaged role of the aircraft projected
to the sanctioning authority. Besides, even
the limited number of aircraft modified were
accepted by IAF with restrictions. Project
costs were severely understated and would
actually be over Rs. 900 crore i.e. more than
two times the approved cost while various
unamortised and hidden cost remained out
of the ambit of the project. Advance payment
of Rs. 156 crore to HAL even before approval
by the sanctioning authority was in violation
of budgetary and financial controls. Failure
to conclude a contract with HAL even after
eight years of approval of the Project vitiated
the control framework of the project.

**_(Paragraph 2.6)_**

**II.** **Acquisition of VIP Boeing Business Jets**

Ministry concluded a contract with M/s.
Boeing Company of USA for acquisition of
three Boeing Business Jets at an aggregated
cost of Rs. 936.93 crore for VIP use to replace
two existing Boeings of the Communication
Squadron of IAF. The acquisition process
for the VIP aircraft deviated from laid down
procedures and well-recognized norms of
propriety. Supplies valuing USD 50 million
were contracted without the benefit of
competition. Besides, the acquisition of both


the aircraft and Self Protection Suite was
inordinately delayed leading to a total cost
escalation of USD 19.70 million. In addition,
even after four years of the existing VIP
aircraft becoming unsuitable for VIP flights,
replacement aircraft are yet to be inducted.
Procurement of a third additional aircraft as
stand by arrangement costing Rs. 312.44
crore was avoidable. Despite spending Rs.
936.93 crore, newly acquired VIP aircraft
will not be used for international travel
necessitating continued use of Air India
aircraft with all its adverse consequences.

**_(Paragraph 2.1)_**

**III.** **Acquisition of Landing Platform Dock**

Navy acquired an ageing 36 years old
foreign ship from a foreign Government after
refurbishment at a cost of USD 50.63 million
without physical assessment of the ship. Poor
condition of the ship entailed significant
changes in the scope of the refurbishment
work with cost of refurbishment, repairs,
etc going up from USD 15 million to USD
36.94 million. Navy did not bring all costs

for consideration of the Competent Authority
while seeking approval.

**_(Paragraph 2.3)_**

**IV.** **Delay in replacement of obsolete and**
**decommissioned radars in IAF.**

Ministry concluded a contract with Hindustan
Aeronautics Limited in March 2002 for
procurement of 17 Precision Approach
Radars at an aggregated cost of Rs.193.10
crore. Acquisition of these critical Radars to
replace obsolete/ decommissioned radars was


-----

considerably delayed and Air Force bases are
operating flights with old radars, identified as
obsolete sixteen years ago, with operational
limitations. The acquisition process also
deviated from the prescribed procedure.
Further, of the ten radars delivered by HAL
only one could be made functional, that too,
with intermittent failure and remaining nine
radars costing  Rs. 100.52 crore are yet to be
commissioned.

**_(Paragraph 2.2)_**

**V.** **Lack of transparency in awarding a**
**Contract**

Ministry concluded a contract with M/s ABG
Shipyard Ltd., a private shipyard in March
2004 for acquisition of three pollution
control vessels for the Coast Guard. The
acquisition process followed by Coast Guard
HQ lacked transparency and deviated from
prescribed purchase procedures, which also
contributed to delay. Flaws and distortions in
the procedures adopted by the Coast Guard
and the Ministry yielded no assurance that
the decision taken to award a contract worth
Rs. 368 crore for building specialized vessels
to a private shipyard was technically sound
and financially prudent. This is corroborated
by the unsatisfactory progress of the project
leading to revision in delivery schedule of the
vessels. Payment of Rs. 221 crore released to
the shipyard is not commensurate with the
milestones specified.

**_(Paragraph 5.1)_**

**VI.** **Sub-optimal performance of Pilotless**
**Target Aircraft**

Pilotless Target Aircraft (PTA) are required by
Indian Air Force (IAF) for providing realistic


airborne targets for training of aircrew and
ground crew in air-to-air and surface-to-air
weaponry. Although design and development

of PTA commenced in 1980, DRDO and
HAL failed to provide an indigenous PTA
to meet the training needs of IAF even after
a lapse of 27 years and after an expenditure
of Rs. 165 crore. Despite the fact that initial
development of a prototype failed to fully
meet the Qualitative Requirements of IAF,
DRDO went ahead with limited series
production of PTAs. Further, clearance by
the Ministry for bulk production without
evaluating the performance of limited
series production of PTA indicated serious
flaws in development of technology and
the production programme. Sub-optimal
performance of three delivered PTAs led
to IAF putting on hold its acceptance of
the balance 12 PTAs ordered on HAL. IAF
also withdrew its commitment to the PTA-II
programme in favour of imports. The basic
objective of providing IAF with realistic
airborne target for weapon training hence
remained unfulfilled seriously affecting
training efforts.

**_(Paragraph 2.5)_**

**VII. Delay in Procurement, Installation and**
**Commissioning of a Training Simulator**

Ministry concluded a contract in March
2004 with M/s. TSL Technologies Ltd, New
Delhi to upgrade, at a cost of Rs 31 crore,
an existing simulator installed in a Naval
Training Establishment. Simulator, considered
vital for the training of pilots and observers of
Seaking helicopter, could not be upgraded


-----

and inducted into the Indian Navy even
after a lapse of a decade and expenditure
of Rs. 18.52 crores affecting the quality of

training. Associated costs of over Rs. 3 crores
due to usage of helicopters could have been
avoided had the project been completed on
time. Related developments may lead to
cancelling of the contract with extra financial
implication of Rs. 18.50 crores, without
ultimately achieving the objective.

**_(Paragraph 2.8)_**

**VIII. Delay in setting up of Overhaul**
**facilities**

A project conceived in 1986 for the
augmentation of repair and overhaul of Gas
Turbine (GTs) for a class of ships in the Navy
awaits completion even after two decades. As
a result of lack of synchronization of various
project activities, equipment and spares
procured at a cost of Rs. 21.16 crore have
remained unutilised for eight years since the
date of purchase. Even after the completion of
the project, its utility to the Navy will remain
limited as the GTs have already received
their scheduled overhaul from the OEM and
benefits accrued from the project will be
marginal as more than half of the service life
of the ships, for which the facility is being
created, would be over.

**_(Paragraph 2.7)_**

**IX.** **Procurement of unsuitable Guns for**
**Navy and Coast Guard Organization**

Navy as well as Coast Guard placed orders
on an Ordnance Factory, for manufacture


of a type of gun without proper clearance
of its prototype. Acceptance of guns costing
Rs. 28.44 crore by Directorate of Naval

Armament Inspection from the Ordnance
Factory, for issue to Navy and Coast Guard
was improper as the weapon platform is
incomplete without an accompanying
stabilized optronic pedestal compromising
operational effectiveness, thus defeating the
purpose of procuring these guns.

**_(Paragraph 2.4)_**

**X.** **Upgradation of an Airport of Indian**
**Navy**

Government sanctioned up-gradation of an
existing Naval Airport jointly used by Airport
Authority of India in October 2002 at an
estimated cost of Rs. 191.52 crore. Lack of
integrated approach, synchronization and
deficiency in planning on the part of Navy
led to delay in construction of magazines and
relocation of a Naval Armament Depot. As
the risk factors for both aircrafts and explosive
stores still exist, the upgraded airport is
not usable for operation by the Long Range
Maritime Reconnaissance aircraft of the Navy
as well as bigger aircrafts of the civil airlines.
As such, value for money for the investment
of Rs. 145.16 crore remains unrealised.

**_(Paragraph 4.4)_**

**XI.** **Non-crediting of Cash Flow Benefit to**
**IAF**

Ministry paid Rs. 370 crore as an advance to
Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) in 1998-99
against a missile project for IAF. BDL passed


-----

on cash flow benefit of Rs. 52.19 crore to IAF
till March 2003. After 2002-03, BDL did not
pass on the cash flow benefit to IAF against

the advance held by them. As a result, IAF
was deprived of revenue to the extent of Rs.
91.33 crore which could have been ploughed
back into the project with diminishing
financial liability to IAF.

**(Paragraph 3.7)**

**XII. Non-recovery of interest due on ad-hoc**
**advance**

Under a sanction accorded by the Ministry,
the Controller of Defence Accounts released
an interest bearing ad-hoc advance of Rs.
113.40 crore in March 2002 to Bharat
Electronics Limited against a project. Despite
clear provision in the contract, Controller of
Defence Accounts failed to recover interest
of Rs. 46.70 crore from BEL on the adhoc
advance provided to the company.

**(Paragraph 3.6)**

**XIII. Procurement** **of** **sub** **standard**
**components for a helicopter**

Ministry concluded a contract in October
2003 with Indo Russian Aviation Limited,
a joint venture company for procurement
of rotables for helicopter ‘D’ at a cost of Rs.
12.43 crore. Fuel Control Units were supplied
by IRAL from an unreliable source and were
found to be substandard exposing helicopter
‘D’ to flight safety hazard and the helicopters
had to be grounded for want of FCUs. Five
Auxiliary Power Units costing Rs. 1.06
crore also failed and are yet to be replaced.


While punitive action taken by Air HQ was
ineffective being tentative and inadequate,
the company was awarded further contracts
for supply of equipment and spares for IAF by
the Ministry and Air HQ. The firm also failed
to supply 12 out of 82 lines of spares and
equipment contracted for.

**_(Paragraph 3.2)_**

**XIV. Unauthorised erection of Antenna on a**
**defence building**

An Air Force station violated canons of
financial propriety and disregarded security
safeguards by allowing a private company
to erect an antenna on a defence building
located in a sensitive security zone. Even
though the company is exploiting facilities
of public property, payments made by the
company are regularly being deposited in the
non-public account of the Air Force station.
Air Force Officers have also been provided
mobile phones free of cost by the company.
The case needs detailed probe to fix
responsibility for the violation and omission.

**_(Paragraph 3.9)_**

**XV. Excess procurement of imported spares**

Material Organisation, Kochi and Naval HQ
worked out requirement for nine items of
spares even though there was no demand
outstanding for those spares revealing
deficiency in provisioning. Failure to correctly
assess the requirement of spares resulted in
excess procurement, costing Rs. 6.20 crore.
The spares have remained unutilized since
their procurement in 2004-2006.

**_(Paragraph 4.3)_**


-----

**XVI. Non-realisation** **of** **revenue** **from**
**disposal of felled trees**

To establish a Naval Academy at Ezhimala,

project authorities had cut large number
of trees for site clearance. Failure of DEO
Chennai to fix the minimum reserve price
and consequential delay in disposal of
25,605 felled trees led to non-realisation of
revenue to the extent of Rs. 1.87 crore by
the Navy. Naval authorities also failed to
make compensatory afforestation equal to ten
times the number of trees cut, thus defying
the above requirement of the Ministry of
Environment subject to which the project was
cleared.

**_(Paragraph 4. 7)_**

**XVII. Express procurement of gear boxes for**
**an Aircraft**

Ministry placed an order in June 2005 on
a foreign firm for procurement of 44 gear
boxes for an aircraft of the IAF. Audit scrutiny
revealed that failure of IAF to ensure timely
repair and inadequate planning for technical
life extension of gear boxes already held by
IAF led to avoidable procurement of 44 gear
boxes at a cost of Rs. 164.78 crore.

**_(Paragraph 3.1)_**

**XVIII. Avoidable expenditure on import of**
**Nikel Cadmium Cells**

Despite instances of procurement of Nickel
Cadmium Cells from the indigenous sources,
Directorate of Naval Air Material overlooked
the existence of the approved indigenous
firms whose rates were much lower than the


foreign supplier. As a result, the Directorate
imported 1470 Nickel Cadmium Cells at a
price nearly three times higher than the rates

of approved indigenous cells, entailing an
extra avoidable expenditure of Rs. 1.31 crore.

**_(Paragraph 4.2)_**

**XIX. Procurement of spares for Off-shore**
**Patrol Vessels**

Three Off-shore Patrol Vessels of the Coast
Guard became due for their 24000 hourly
routine between April 2006 and January
2007. Owing to faulty maintenance planning
and delays in taking up the scheduled
maintenance routine of engines of the
vessels, spares worth Rs. 7.90 crore remain
unutilized. Further, over provisioning of
spares led to avoidable expenditure of Rs. 57
lakh.

**_(Paragraph 5.2)_**

**XX. Management of Transport in Air HQ**
**and other IAF Units located in New**
**Delhi**

Air Force Station possesses a large
fleet of passenger vehicles and huge
establishment of MT drivers above the
sanctioned establishment in violation of
rules thereby flouting economy measures
of the Government. Indiscriminate use of
service vehicles resulted in unauthorised
exploitation entailing an extra expenditure
of Rs. 5.60 crore during the last three years
which was unauthorisedly regularised by Air
HQ.

**_(Paragraph 3.10)_**

###### Audit Report No. CA 12 of 2008 (Regularity Audit)

**Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers**
**Limited**

**Material management in ERP system**

Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers
Limited incurred Rs.3.76 crore upto June
2007 for the implementation of Phase-I of
ERP system covering the operationalisation
of Material Management Module. IT audit of
the application revealed deficiencies in the
customisation of the system and there were
instances of inadequate input and validation
controls which inhibited accurate and timely
capture of data. There were deficiencies in
security settings which exposed the system
to the risk of unauthorized access and
manipulation. The system could not carry
out the function of inventory valuation in
accordance with the accounting policy of the
Company. Thus the system was not being
utilized to its fullest extent.

**Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, Bangalore**

**Financial module under ERP package**

Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (Company)
implemented Industrial Finance System
(IFS) an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
package in three pilot sites (i.e.) Corporate
Office, Aircraft Division and Helicopter
Division between July 2004 and January 2006
with the objective of implementing uniform
procedure and practices, on-line information
for decision making and elimination of


isolated islands of automation. Acquisition
and implementation of ERP package and
utilisation of financial module of IFS at three

pilot sites was reviewed and following were
observed:

- Selection process of ERP software was
not transparent as the implementing
partner was also involved as consultant
in assessment and finalisation of
software. The Company did not obtain
the System Design documentation and
was wholly dependent on the vendor
resulting in additional burden of
recurring expenditure.

- IT policy including IT security policy
was not formulated.

- Physical and logical controls were
weak and the data had not been
properly classified for its criticality and
sensitivity.

- System design deficiencies led to
manual interventions to reconcile the
system balances and accounts balances.

###### Audit Report No. CA 11 of 2008 (Regularity Audit)

**Bharat Earth Movers Limited**

Acceptance of advance without confirmation
of rate of interest resulted in unnecessary
interest payment of Rs.7.54 crore.

(Para 8.1.1)

Delay in initiating action to amend liquidated
damages clause as sought for by the propriety
item supplier resulted in delayed receipt of
CKD components and foregoing of Rs.4.44
crore.

**_(Para 8.1.2)_**


-----

**Hindustan Aeronautics Limited**

The Company incurred avoidable expenditure
of Rs.5.99 crore due to lapse in evaluation of
tender and awarding the contract to SVEC
Construction Limited.

**_(Para 8.2.1)_**

The Company repaired 11 engines on free
of cost basis though the defects were not
precisely established on its part. This resulted


in forfeiture of revenue of Rs.5.53 crore to the
Company.

**_(Para 8.2.2)_**

The Company instead of restricting the
procurement of SNFA bearings for service
evaluation test alone went ahead and
procured bulk quantity without clearance of
AHQ resulting in unproductive inventory of
Rs.5.08 crore.

**_(Para 8.2.3)_**
