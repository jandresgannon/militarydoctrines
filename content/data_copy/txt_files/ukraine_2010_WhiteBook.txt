###### OPENING ADDRESS

 OF THE MINISTER

 OF DEFENCE OF UKRAINE

Lack of sufficient resources to fulfil military reform and ineffective resource control
system in previous years have unbalanced implementation of devised programmes
and plans. They adversely influenced the readiness level of the Armed Forces to fulfil
assigned tasks.

That is why the issue of bringing Armed Forces to combat readiness level required

immediate practical solutions. The set of measures was developed to stabilize the
situation in the Armed Forces.

Measures aimed at the renewal of Armed Forces combat capability were agreed by

the President and were actively supported by the Cabinet of the Ministers. Financing
of the Armed Forces was conducted regularly and without delays for the first time in
many years.

Measures initiated by the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff have delivered

good results. In 2010 disintegration of the Armed Forces has been stopped and a certain
stabilization has been achieved. Intensifying unit combat training has been maintained.
Individual training has been improved in cases were there was insufficient resources.
Units and Service personnel systematically upgraded their skills during international
training and international peacekeeping operations. Modern armoured vehicles and
modernized aircraft were put into service.

During the year conditions have been systematically created to stem the flow

of qualified Service personnel from military service. Financial support for Service
personnel has been increased. Free catering of contract Service personnel was initiated
during service duties. Construction of Service housing for personnel and family
members has re-commenced.

Today, we have set a challenging goal to create modern, mobile, well-equipped

Armed Forces that will be a reliable guarantor of sovereignty and inviolability of our
State.

It is envisaged to renew the complete package of documents that define defence

policy, first of all, the strategies of National Defence and Military Doctrine, finalize the
Strategic Defence Review and develop the State Comprehensive Programme of Reform
and Development of the Armed Forces 2011-2015.


-----

We continue to work diligently to enhance combat capabilities, to improve

the command and control system, to ensure the quality of military education and
professional level of Service personnel, to provide radical changes in resource, material
and technical support and the technical re-equipment of units.

An important milestone on the road to build new Armed Forces should be the

achievement of an adequate level of social standards for Service personnel, their
families and military pensioners.

I am convinced that Ukrainian Service personnel will continue to thoroughly fulfil

their constitutional duty, always maintaining a high level of combat readiness and with
dignity and honour carry the name of Defenders of the Fatherland.

Minister of Defence of Ukraine

MIKHAILO YEZHEL

###### OPENING ADDRESS

 OF THE CHIEF

 OF THE GENERAL STAFF –
 COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE
 ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE

The annual publication of the White Book traditionally highlights the current state of
the Armed Forces and the main directions of further military development.

For the Armed Forces 2010 is recognized as a transition to a qualitativity new

system of training units to fulfil their tasks. The state of the Armed Forces has been
stabilized, the adverse trend of reducing combat capability was stopped, and conditions
of systematic and deep renewal were created thanks to the measures implemented and
systematic work by command and control bodies at all levels.

Pressing measures aimed at improving social protection of Service personnel has

been adopted.

We managed to solve the problems of financial support and meals accumulated over

many years, increase the amount of housing compared to previous years and improve
recreational treatment of the personnel.

During the year international military cooperation and active participation of the

Armed Forces in peacekeeping promoted an increase of prestige of our State on the
world arena, development of cooperation with international security structures and
formation of a positive image of the Armed Forces.

The President, Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, set a goal to

conduct radical reforms in the Armed Forces, reaching the European level of social
standards for Service personnel and their families.

The real state of units, military command and control elements preparation and

their capabilities was evaluated when strategic programme documents on reforming the
Armed Forces were developed and a number of training and exercises “Cooperation2010” were conducted. We are convinced that Service personnel are ready to accomplish
assigned missions.

Almost all Service personnel are experienced professionals, courageous and strong
willed people who honestly and diligently carry out their constitutional duty.

At the same time implementing tasks set by the State leadership and aimed at solving

defence problems under Non-Bloc status requires inceasing effectiveness of command
and control, the level of the personnel training should be upgraded, and resources and
logistical support should be considerably improved.


-----

Modern realities require well-thought, effective solutions and practical decisive

actions. Taking this into consideration, we develop plans for the future and set up new
goals regarding perspective profile of the Armed Forces. Responsible work directed at
accomplishment of tasks related to reform the Armed Forces in the period to 2015 is
ahead of us. The training year 2011 is defined as the Year of Technical Readiness and
Non-Commissioned Officers Training.

The task of sustaining unit operational capabilities, preventing a decrease in

combat readiness, maintaining their capabilities to fulfill assigned tasks is among our
priorities.

Every commander should create the necessary conditions for Service personnel to

master armament and materiel, to improve morale among the military team, maintain
military order, a high level of discipline, and law and order among Service personnel.

2011 is the 20th anniversary of Ukraine’s independence and the Armed Forces. It

should become a starting point for implementing effective reform measures and creating
conditions for further development of modern Armed Forces.

I am confident that the Service personnel realize the importance of tasks with all

their responsibility and will do all that they can to successfully accomplish them!

Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,

In 2010 the activity of the Armed Forces was aimed at preventing decreasing units’ combat readiness

and stabilizing the situation by means of upgrading training, accelerating the technical readiness and
repairing armament and military equipment, and increasing the level of social support for Service
personnel and their dependents.


HIGH PRIORITY
MEASURES
OF STATE
OFFICIALS


The main event of 2010 that had a decisive impact on the security situation was
the announcement of Non-Bloc status by Ukraine[1] that foresaw, in particular, full
participation of Ukraine in common European and regional collective security
systems, membership in the European Union while maintaining good neighbourly
relations and strategic partnership with the Russian Federation, other CIS and world
countries (Note 1.1).


**Note 1.1. Principles of foreign policy**


…non-participation of Ukraine in military and political alliances,

priority of participation in the improvement and development of the
European collective security system, continuation of constructive
partnership with the North-Atlantic Treaty Organization and other
military and political blocs concerning all matters of mutual
interest.


**Note 1.2. Main principles of national policy in the sphere of national**
security and defence


The Law of Ukraine “On Principles of National

and Foreign Policy” clarifies the order of the Armed
Forces engagement, particularly: only in cases of armed
aggression against Ukraine, other armed attacks on its
territorial integrity and inviolability of state borders;
combating international terrorism and piracy; other
cases stipulated by international treaties of Ukraine and
ratified by the Verkhovna Rada.

The principles of national policy were defined

in the sphere of national security and defence, on
implementation of which major efforts of the MOD and
the GS were focused in 2010 (Note 1.2).

Challenges and threats to Ukraine’s national security

in the military sphere[2] were determined on the basis
of comprehensive analysis of national and foreign
situations conducted during the year.

The State Officials paid particular attention to issues

concerning preventing the decrease in the Armed Forces
combat readiness level, provision of their daily activities
and social protection of Service personnel, namely:

- for 2010 the task to stabilize the situation in the

Armed Forces and to ensure financing of high priority
activities was defined for the MOD[3];



- strengthening national defence capability, increasing
responsibility of State Power Agencies at all levels for the
proper training and maintenance of state security;

- reforming the Armed Forces to ensure their maximum
effectiveness and the ability to respond immediately to
potential threats to Ukraine;

- gradual transition to the manning of contracted-personnel,
primarily in specialties that define units’ combat
effectiveness;

- equipping the Armed Forces with the newest items of
military equipment and weapons;

- providing social support for Service personnel and their
dependents

SUMMARY OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE IN 2010

              - first stage of initiating administrative reform in MOD Head Office and the

Command and Control Bodies of the Armed Forces was conducted[4];

                - legislation to increase the penalty to citizens who breach their active duty com­

mitment[5] (Note 1.3.);


**Note 1.3. Liability for Breaching Active**
Duty Commitment


The fine was increased from three to five times for breaching

military registration rules by persons subject to draft or conscript
personnel, non-appearance in the military commissariat without
reasonable excuse or late submission to the military registration
authority of information concerning change of residence,
education, place of work, position, and interruption of training
classes in institutions of the Defence Assistance Association of
Ukraine and vocational schools.



- patronage over military units, military education

institutions and organizations of the Armed Forces was
reconstituted in order to assist in resolving issues of
enhancing the prestige of military service, social and
cultural needs of Service personnel[6];

- pensions of persons retired from military service

were increased at the expense of allowances for special
conditions of service related to the maintenance of
nuclear weapons[7];

- functions and tasks of the Inspection on Control

over the Functioning of Military Formations of the Main


IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE STATE
PROGRAMME OF
ARMED FORCES’
DEVELOPMENT


Defence Policy Directorate and Law Enforcement Bodies of the Presidential
Administration were specified[8];

  - “Ukroboronprom” State Economic Association was established to increase

efficiency of the administrative activity in the sphere of development, production,
implementation, maintenance, modernization and disposal of weapons, military
and special equipment and ammunition[9].

The allowance was increased in order to encourage Service personnel to military

service. In 2010 the amount of monthly allowance to contracted Non-Commissioned
Officers (NCOs) was raised, that increased their allowance by 29% to 35% compared to
2009. An additional monthly allowance to aircraft and shipboard Service personnel was
determined and the average size of the monthly allowance was raised in December, that
enabled an increase on average of 20% to 23% in the allowance of Service personnel
(see Chapter 5).

Timely decisions and measures of State Officials in 2010 made everything possible to

stabilize the situation in the Armed Forces and further reform. However, implementation
of tasks to improve the Armed Forces’ combat readiness requires significant resources
and full consolidation of State Power Agencies and society.

The State Programme of Armed Forces’ Development 2006-2011 (The State
Programme) foresaw to increase the portion of combat units by 8%, to bring the
number of renewed and modernized weapons and equipment to 22%, completely
switch to digital communication equipment and automated Command and Control
System of the Armed Forces, double the main combat training indicators, transit to
100% manning of contracted-personnel, release personnel from functions of guarding
military installations and food supply, and dispose of surplus military property.

In general, this would enable increasing the Armed Forces’ combat potential while
reducing their number by more than 40%.

However, the limited resources provided considerably decreased the pace of

implementing the State Programme, this broke the sequence of events and led to the
increase in the cost of these activities.

Over the 5 years the underfunding of the State Programme was UAH 15.2 billion

14.1


(which is a quarter of the amount provided by the State
Programme (Figure 1.1)).

This, in turn, led to the following:

- optimization of the Armed Forces’ Command and

Control System and creation of the Unified Automated
Command and Control System were not implemented.
The communications system of the Armed Forces was
not transited to the new technological base;

- implementation of the established indicators of

weapons and military equipment renewal was not
achieved. Over the years of the State Programme only
8 (14.4%) combat aircraft of the planned 55 were
modernized, renewal measures of 21 and purchase of 1
anti-aircraft missile system S-300, 2 AN-70 aircraft and

14 radar stations “Pelikan” were not implemented. The level of operability of
most aircraft (24%), helicopters (36%), ships and support vessels (7%) is still
low;

  - comprehensive disposal plans were not implemented. The amount of surplus,

unserviceable missiles, ammunition and their components, liquid rocket
propellants, which were disposed of, constitute a quarter of the total amount;

  - Service personnel were not provided with the necessary amount of housing. The

financial support provided from 2006 to 2010 delivered 10,900 apartments (25%
of the planned number);

  - The planned indicators of combat training were not achieved. At the end of 2010

the main indicators of Forces’ combat training were three to four times lower
than 2006 indicators;

  - The plans for Reservists’ training were not executed. 6,300 Reservists were

planned in 2010. At the end of the year the number was 1,681 (27% of the
plan);

  - Transition of the Armed Forces to manning of contracted-personnel was not

completed. At the end of 2010 manning of the contracted-personnel reached
50%.

At the same time adopting a number of State

decisions in the sphere of defence, implementation of
priorities in the military sphere enabled the situation
concerning retaining Forces’ operational capabilities and
the integrity of the Air Defence System at the required
level.

For more information concerning the implementation

of the State Programme see the “The White Book:
Defence Policy of Ukraine” for 2006-2008 and “The
White Book 2009: The Armed Forces of Ukraine”.

Thus, from 2006 to 2010 the measures of the State

Programme were not fully implemented. The allocated
amounts were sufficient mainly for the maintenance of
the Armed Forces, which did not enable the training

of troops at the proper level and to maintain operational conditions of weapons and
military equipment. Implementation of activities of the Armed Forces’ development
was provided only 39%.

THE YEAR OF
STABILIZATION IN THE
ARMED FORCES


The critical situation in the Armed Forces resulting from the disruption to the
implementation of the State Programme stipulated the necessity not only to increase
funding but to take additional measures at the levels of the President and Cabinet of
Ministers.

2010 was defined as the Year of Stabilization in the Armed Forces of Ukraine in

order to create preconditions for the further development of the Armed Forces in the


**Note 1.4. The content of the Main Stabilization efforts in the Armed**

- preventing the decrease in combat readiness level of the

Armed Forces;

- maintaining the human potential of the Armed Forces,

increasing motivation to military service;

- optimizing functional and organizational structures and

- ensuring proper maintenance of the Armed Forces and

debt repayment of previous years;

- enhancing international military cooperation, peace­

keeping and verification activity of the Armed Forces;

- improving the Strategic and Defence Planning System.


medium and long term.

According to the Law of Ukraine “On State

Budget of Ukraine for 2010” and the State Programme
on Economic and Social Development of Ukraine
for 2010[10] the range of measures to stabilize the
situation in the Armed Forces in 2010 was developed[11]
(Note 1.4).

Providing Armed Forces’
Combat Readiness

In order to implement new approaches to the Command
**and Control Bodies, units’** **training, ensuring their**
readiness to perform assigned missions, the content of
legal documents that ensure balancing of the Training
Planning System with defence and budget planning
was improved (see Chapter 3).


The new units’ cohesiveness system was introduced, that considered the levels of

personnel support, including manning on the contract basis, determined specific training
tasks and time indicators of their achievement.

The special feature of **Armed Forces training in 2010 was the conduct of all**

activities on a single operational and strategic background, this enabled the training of
command and control bodies and units according to the general concept and specific
tasks.


**Table 1.1. Dynamics of the Major Indicators of JRRF Combat**
Training


From the second half of 2010 the Armed Forces

implemented the planned activities of combat training
to time. According to the training year’s results this
enabled a twofold increase in flying hours of army
aviation and 2.5 times for ships’ crew at sea compared
with the previous year (Table 1.1).

The main efforts of Forces’ training were focused on

JRRF defined units and those involved in participation
in the set of exercises with the Command and Control
Bodies and Forces “Cooperation – 2010” (6[th] September –
4[th] October 2010) that became a logical continuation of
the Strategic Command Post Exercises (May, 2010).

Exercises were carried out in 5 military Training

SUMMARY OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE IN 2010

In total, 6 battalion and tactical exercises,

23 tactical, 17 tactical special and 1 tactical flight
training, 6 mobilization calls with about 600 persons
subject to draft have been conducted.

During the year effective steps towards technical

**re-equipment and modernization of weapons and**
**military equipment of the Armed Forces were made.**

The priority of modernization and renewal of

weapons and equipment was aviation materiel and air
defence facilities, which are used to protect the airspace
of the State and cover vital installations in peacetime.
One of the main directions was also the renewal of
combat ships operational status due to their critical
condition. Modernization and procurement of armoured
vehicles was carried out according to the plan.

The result of the year’s work was the renewal of

about 3,000 items of weapon and equipment that affect

the combat readiness of Forces, including:

                - 26 different types of aircraft, 11 helicopters;

               - 12 ships, boats and support vessels;

               - 120 rocket and artillery weapons;

              - 41 armoured vehicles and equipment;

              - 298 vehicles;

               - 2 air defence systems S-300PS had their service life extended.

Maintaining personnel potential of the Armed Forces, increasing the
motivation for military service, implementing military patriotic education

In 2010 the main priority of commanders at all levels was maintaining personnel
potential and reducing the outflow of officers and creating appropriate social
conditions for Service personnel.

The main reasons for the decrease in manning of junior officers are the discrepancy

between Armed Forces requirements for officers’ training to changing strength figures
and poor social protection of Service personnel.

In 2008-2009 the reduction of the Armed Forces’ strength slowed. In 2010 this has

led to the imbalance of indicators of Forces requirements for people and the number of
cadets in Military Education Institutions (MEI). As a result, only a quarter of vacant
positions of junior officers was filled by MEI graduates in 2010.

The following measures were taken to overcome this problem, including:

                - the number of Reserve Officers recruited to military service was increased to 404

(in 2009 – 154);

               - personal interviews by commanders at Army Corps level and their equivalents,

with junior officers who wish to resign from military service;

               - officers who have reached retirement age for military service and meet certain

requirements were given an opportunity to remain in the military beyond
retirement age;

                - the assignment of officers into other military formations was limited. Permission

for transfer was given in case of contract expiry being within 6 months;

               - mandatory approval of discharge from military service by Board of Officers was

introduced to ensure objectivity in personnel decisions.

helped to increase the motivation for military
service. During the year the main focus was
on completing partly-constructed buildings,

funding was reallocated) on the initiative of the MOD and supported by the Cabinet
of Ministers.

Permission for the use of defence lands for construction of housing for Service

personnel and their dependents as well as social and affordable housing was legislated[12].
Overall, this year Service personnel received more than 2,000 apartments.

New **relationships with NGOs which were developed on the principles of**


partnership and mutual responsibility and focused on objective public information
concerning the activity of the Armed Forces were important for the Armed
Forces.

Consolidation of efforts and capacity of NGOs, introduction of new ideas and


proposals were provided by the MOD Public Board. In 2010 the Public Board accepted
5 new NGOs. At the end of the year the number of non-governmental, trade union
organizations and media on the Public Board was 90.

During the year **implementation of military patriotic education in the daily**


activities of units was continued, coordination of efforts and unity of views of Command
and Control Bodies was ensured, including:



                - awareness of the Service personnel ritual of the national flag reveille in the

Armed Forces[13] was established, that encouraged the raising of national activation
of military patriotic education of personnel, increasing the prestige of military
service (Note 1.5);

A SUMMARY OF THE
STRATEGIC DEFENCE
REVIEW TASKS


Comprehensive implementation of measures aimed at the individual work with

Service personnel, increasing the motivation for military service, providing military
patriotic education, all facilitated the retention of military personnel.

Disposal of rockets, ammunition and propellants

In 2010 disposal of unserviceable and unsuitable for storage rockets and ammunition
was increased. However, the performance of the planned indicators specified by
the State Defence Programme of Disposal of Conventional Ammunition Unsuitable
for further Usage and Storage for 2008-2017[16] (State Disposal Programme) was not
met.

The Law of Ukraine “On the State Budget of Ukraine for 2010” stipulated UAH

113.1 million, (General Fund – UAH 20.8 million, Special Fund – UAH 92.3 million).
That is 42% of the amount defined in the State Disposal Programme (UAH 269.7
million).

The actual allocation was UAH 27.2 million (24% of the amount to be provided by

the State Budget) including General Fund – UAH 20.8 million and Special Fund – UAH
6.4 million). Of which UAH 24.1 million was for the disposal of ammunition (General
Fund – UAH 20.8 million, Special Fund – UAH 3.3 million) and UAH 3.1 million for
the disposal of rocket propellants from the Special Fund.

During the year the total amount of weapons, rockets and ammunition withdrawn by

the MOD from bases and storage for the purpose of further disposal was 29.5 thousand
tons, with 2.4 thousand tons being transferred to the Ministry of Industrial Policy: 23.7
thousand tons of ammunition were disposed of (Table 1.2.).

2,698 tons of **mélange were withdrawn from rocket fuel storage to disposal areas**
(Table 1.3).

3,168 tons of mélange were disposed of in 2009-2010 in the Russian Federation

according to the international contract.

Strategic Defence Review tasks were completed in 2010. Based on the results a draft
Strategic Defence Bulletin to 2025 was developed and then discussed with national
and foreign specialists and NGOs. The interdepartmental coordination of the legal act
on approving the Strategic Defence Bulletin was completed.

New model of Security and Defence Sector

Internal and external challenges and threats, with high level of probability and

impact on Ukraine to 2025 were defined within the framework of the Strategic Defence
Review and an analysis of the security environment. (Diagram 1.5).

chapter 1


Transformation of the State Military Organization into the Security and Defence

Sector and legislative consolidation of this term will enable the adjustment of the
priorities of the State Security and Defence Policy more effectively and timely,
optimally merging military and civil opportunities of all components of the system of
national security for preventing and neutralizing existing and potential military threats,
and supporting the defensive potential of the State at the level that ensures the military
security of Ukraine.

The wide range of possible situations, which may involve security and defence

forces in the long term, based on the analysis of challenges and threats to national
security, and government priorities in defence and security policy, was analysed. These
situations are combined by scenarios that are key to determining the place, role and
tasks of each component of the Security and Defence Sector to guarantee security and
to defend the State (Table 1.4).

the needs of security and defence on the principle of defence sufficiency and balanced
with resources, using resource capabilities of the State to protect Ukraine’s national
interests from existing and potential internal and external threats and to function
effectively in a democratic society.

SUMMARY OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE IN 2010

chapter 1

The implementation of the long-term outline of the Armed Forces will be carried

out in three stages:

                    - First Stage (2011-2015) – to stabilize the situation in the Forces, maintain

opportunities to renovate the combat effectiveness of the Armed Forces, support
the minimum required capabilities to prevent, localize and neutralize armed
conflict, contribute to disaster-relief assistance and participate in peacekeeping
operations. The first stage measures are elaborated in the Concept of Further
Reform of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for 2011-2015[18];

                   - Second Stage (2016-2020) – to renew operational capabilities of the Armed

Forces and start their sustained development. The units of the Armed Forces in
cooperation with other components of the Security and Defence Forces should
be ready to carry out specific tasks at the end of this stage;

                    - Third Stage (2021-2025) – to achieve the main quality standards of the new

structure of the Armed Forces, provide them with modern weapons and
equipment, increase the level of units’ training, and create material stocks.

Financial support of the Armed Forces reform to 2025

Supporting the Armed Forces with financial resources is based on indexes of needs,
necessary to achieve appropriate capabilities of the Armed Forces, and the State’s
ability to meet the needs.

The Government has defined tentative indexes of allocations from the General Fund

for defence purposes for the future that have been specified by the Concept of the

chapter 1


FUNDING
OF THE ARMED
FORCES NEEDS


There has been a trend in recent years of not considering within the State Budget
all the needs of the Armed Forces. Unrealistic expectations of income to the Special
Fund continued, the inability to meet those expectations is caused by the lack of
proper legislative regulation concerning sales income from MOD surplus property
and facilities.

The standard financial support required for the Armed Forces in 2010 was at the

level of UAH 30,938.1 million. (Armed Forces Development Needs).

Taking into account the economic condition of the State, the MOD has defined a

minimal necessary amount – UAH 19,853.4 million.

The State Budget allocated the following funding for the MOD for 2010:

**UAH 12,477.1 million. (1.15% of GDP), to include UAH 9,052.8 million (73% of**
the total budget) – for the General Fund, Special Fund – UAH 2,664 million (21%),
Stabilization Fund – UAH 760.3 million (6 %).

Actual financial support received was **UAH 10,533.6 million** (0.97% GDP) or

84.4% of the year’s allocation, which was only 53% of the minimal need, to include:
General Fund – UAH 9,052.8 million. (100% funding), Special Fund – UAH 819,6
**million (30.8%), Stabilization Fund– UAH 661,2 million. (87%) (Appendix 1).**

The total shortfall in funding was UAH 1,943.5 million (15.6%).

2006-2010, billion UAH

25,2%

15,9%

12,8%

9,1%

9,1%


Thus, financial support of the Armed Forces in 2010

corresponded to the minimal-critical support level for
maintenance and training of the Forces (Figure 1.8).

Experience of leading nations shows that allocations

for maintaining proper Forces’ readiness level in order
to be able to fulfill their primary tasks, development of
armament and materiel, training and other operational
needs should be no less than 50% of available financial
resources.

At the same time, during 2006-2008 allocations for

maintenance of the Armed Forces have been gradually
increasing from 68% to 77%. During the financial crisis
in 2009 this reached 84%, and in 2010 the index reached
**87.9% (Figure 1.9), which was related to the necessity**
to fulfil urgent activities in terms of provision of social
guarantees for Service personnel and their families.

SUMMARY OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE IN 2010

Under such conditions all allocations for development of armament and materiel,

training and other operational requirements of the Armed Forces have been planned
according to the “Residual Principle” and at the expense of unsecured financial
resources (Special and Stabilization Funds). As a result, Defence Budgets from 2006 to
2010 could not be objectively referred to as ”Development Budgets”.


**In 2010 due to decisive actions of the State leadership as a whole, we managed**

**to create a background for stopping destructive processes in the Armed Forces,**
**favorable conditions for renewal of Forces’ combat readiness, gradually increases**
**in both training level and equipping forces with materiel.**

uring 2010 effective mechanisms continued to be develop for the Armed Forces’ Command and

#### DControl System and its integration in the renewed State Command and Control System. The MOD and

the Armed Forces are implementing the government’s Administrative Reforms. The priority was given to
optimizing the military Command and Control Elements’ organization and strength, removing overlapping
functions and tasks, and reducing running costs.


IMPROVEMENT
OF COMMAND AND
CONTROL SYSTEM
OF THE ARMED

Improving the Command and Control System of the Armed Forces was accomplished
by developing its key features: Command and Control Elements; Command Posts, the
Armed Forces Single Automated Command and Control System (SAC[2]S) elements
and replacing the communications systems with digital communications.

The development of the single automated Command and Control System continued

fiber optic communication lines.

The prearranged measures of Air and Naval Forces

Automated Command and Control System development
continued. For the first time the video transmission of
practical units’ actions was forwarded to the Air Forces
Command Centre during the Exercise “Cooperation –
2010”. The control of air situation was carried out by
the on-line automated radar data collection, analysis and
display systems.

Strategic Level of Command

In 2010, the Administrative Reform activities were initiated gradually in the MOD to
increase the effectiveness of defence in the framework of the State policy of public
administration.

_MOD implemented the following:_

               - re-structuring organizational elements according to functions and tasks. The

Department of Transformation and Information Technologies was re-organized to
the Department of Strategy Development of Command and Control of the Armed
Forces; the Department of Humanitarian Policy – to the Department of Social
and Humanitarian Policy; the Press Service Directorate – to the Department of
Press and Mass Media Relations; the Legal Department – to the Department of
Legal Support; the Department of Construction – to the Department of Capital
Construction; the Directorate of Military-Technical Cooperation – to the Section
of Military-Technical Cooperation and Expert Control respectively;

               - optimizing material resources command and control system. The Department

of Economic and Administrative Activity was formed from the Department of

      - Implementing MOD responsibilities in mobilization, civil defence and anti
corruption. The Mobilization Section, the Directorate of Civil Defence and
Ecological Security, and the Prevention and Countering Corruption unit were
established;

      - Optimizing the MOD Head Office, the total strength was downsized by 10%.
Generally, the structure of the General Staff met requirements of strategic planning

and afforded an opportunity to fulfill functions and tasks in 2010.

However, to exclude overlapping functions between MOD and GS in control of

expenditures and tangible assets, the GS Auditing Directorate was disbanded.

The Support Forces Command was re-organized to the Department of Logistics; the

Department of Armament; and the Main Directorate of Operational Support to increase
the flexibility and conformity of the logistics system according to the current stage
of reforming the Armed Forces. The strategic level military Command and Control
Elements have been established to plan and provide units with weapons and equipment,
material resources and emergency supplies.

MOD and GS structures at the end of 2010 are shown at Appendix 2.

Operational Level of Command

The main efforts were directed to improving Command and Control Elements’
organization, optimizing their strength and increasing of operability and quality of
their activity. The overall strength of Command and Control Elements was downsized
up to 11% in 2010.

Optimizing the MOD Head Office will be continued according to the requirements

of Presidential Acts[3], which envisage the revision of functions and tasks, further orga­
nizational improvement, the reduction of running costs and enhancing effectiveness of
the Command and Control System.


ORGANIZATION OF
THE ARMED FORCES

SUPPLY
OF MATERIEL


In 2010 the organization and strength of the Armed Forces was not changed
significantly (Annex 2).

The planned optimization of the ratio between combat and support units, as well as

matching the Armed Forces strength to requirements specified in the Strategic Plan of
the Armed Forces Deployment were carried out.

The overall strength of the Armed Forces was 200,000 – of which 150,000 were

Service personnel at the end of 2010 (Annex 2).

The quantity of obsolete arms and equipment continued to increase within the Armed
Forces, but the limited financial resources to developing arms and equipment did
not provide the proper pace for their modernization and procurement. Under such
conditions, the priority in the Armed Forces was to renew the serviceability of arms
and equipment.

The significant improvement of unit equipment level was achieved through additional

budget allocations, including the Stabilization Fund, and professional management.

In particular, in order to increase the resource capabilities of the Armed Forces the

mechanism of mutual payments “in kind” for repair and modernization works, proved
to be successful in repairing aviation equipment in 2009, was extended to the whole
list of military equipments[4].

Throughout the year 17 new pieces of weapons and equipment were adopted by

the Armed Forces. The most significant among them were the SU-25V1 updated

combat aircraft, SU-25UBM1 training-combat aircraft,
P-423-1MU troposphere communication radio,
“Skif –KAZ” complex communication equipment room,
Z-501M data transmitting equipment. According to the
results of national testing the other 7 pieces of weapons
and equipment were recommended to be brought into
service.

Throughout the year, 10 “Bulat” battle tanks were

procured and assigned to the separate tank brigade in
Chernigiv region; 18 Kraz-6322 off-highway vehicles
and parachute systems were obtained; and 37 Fire motor
tank trucks were procured and adopted, to provide the
fire and explosion safety at the ammunition, weapons and
equipment storage sites.

The P-18 radar serviceability renovation programme transitioning them to a modern

platform continued. The production of complex pilot simulator of the MIG-29 KTS-21
aircraft was completed. The National testing of AN-70 test model was continued. The
serviceability of the “Hetman Sagaidachnyi” frigate, “Ternopil’” and “Khmelnytskyi”
corvettes was renewed. The repair of “Donbas” command ship and “Zaporizhia”
submarine is about to be completed. The start of submarine seagoing tests and
commissioning into the Naval Forces line are envisaged in May 2011.

The successes in 2010 are the renewal of cooperation with civil and military aviation

and tank manufacturers, namely:

               - coproduction and manufacture of AN-148 civil plane airframes and APC hulls;

               - Mi-8MTB helicopter, equipped with new engines of the “Motor-Sich” open joint

stock company was tested on the basis of the “Aviakon” Konotop Aircraft Repair
Plant” – a State MOD enterprise. The new world record for helicopter speed of
ascent was achieved during the test.

The main measures of the Armed Forces’ weapons and equipment supply in 2010

are represented in Annex 2.

he resources for training were balanced to resources available from the State, with training directed to

#### TArmed Force’s readiness to accomplish assigned missions.

Intensifying training was the main direction for MOD and GS, the results at the end of the training year

became the qualitative indicators of the effectiveness of activities implemented to stabilize the situation
in the Armed Forces.


FORCE’S TRAINING
SUPPORT


The assigned missions were achieved by increasing the amount of resources and
improving training.

In 2010, UAH 394.5 million was planned for training, the equivalent of 32% of the

baseline requirement. In fact, the provision of funding amounted to UAH 96.4 million,
which is double the previous year (Table 3.1).

To provide effective Force’s training, the exercises with personnel were conducted

through low-cost forms and methods of training with the maximum use of simulators,
field and barracks’ training infrastructure.

In 2010, the fundamentals for training were changed for the first time over the years

of the Armed Force’s development. The general principles, procedure of arrangement
and provision of the Armed Forces’ training and directions of its improvement were
stipulated in the Concept of Training of the Armed Forces[1]. The improvement of the
training system will be based on: adapting the curricula and organization to Armed
Forces’ functions and tasks; the modernization of training methodology; the training
procedure in light of the achieved skills level and ways of manning; as well as
harmonizing the responsibilities, functions and tasks of the Training Force’s Command
and Control Elements.

The main directions to improve and increase the effectiveness of Force training

were determined:

                 - Comprehensiveness of activities, in particular joint training of all Armed Services

and Branches, reconnaissance assets, combat and all-combat support systems;

                 - consideration of skills level available during units’ planned training;

              - following the principles of “quality and quantity interdependence” and

“symmetry” in planning and implementing training events and meeting available
material resources;

                - practical engagement of units during the military HQ training events;

                 - deployment, development and active use of the training infrastructure, simulators

and modeling systems;

RESULTS OF FORCE’S
TRAINING PLANS
IMPLEMENTATION


The following activities were implemented to improve training indexes with the

lessons learned from previous years’ experience:

  - focusing material and financial resources’ on priority directions;

  - adapting Forces’ training plans to actual funding;

  - setting the achievement of high level results’ as the main criteria for every

exercise;

  - enhancing the amount and intensification of training to individual Service

personnel;

  - prioritizing exercises that had relatively low-cost and did not require the

significant consumption of the capacity of combat vehicles;

  - maximizing the capabilities of installations, firing ranges, simulators, barrack

training infrastructures to train HQs and units.

The previous training level was not only maintained but also significantly increased
due to activities implemented in 2010.

The provision of the necessary combat readiness level of authorized units to

accomplish missions, the restoration of a positive trend in combat training and the
improvement of Service personnel individual training became the main result of the
year.

The conduct of the set of exercises “Cooperation – 2010” with Command and

Control Elements and units was the most important phase of the training annual cycle.
This set of exercises comprised the most effective elements of operational and combat
training and enabled the joint operating proficiency of all levels of Command and
Control Elements, as well as conducting the exercise of tactical level units’ combat
joint working.

The 92 operational training exercises were predominantly conducted against a

common scenario throughout the year. The intensification of Command and Control
Elements’ exercise was increased nearly twofold compared to the 2009 training year.
By the end of year the professional training to officers at all levels had reached the
standard that enabled them to perform their functional duties in Command and Control
Elements.

In total, 6 battalion, 13 company tactical exercises, 28 platoon, over 120 squad field
firings were conducted and nearly 17,000 parachute jumps were completed.

Nearly 380 live-firing at ground targets, over 20 missiles firing, almost 70

bombardments were conducted and over 210 parachute drops by aviation units.
The combat vessels and craft accomplished over 200 gun fires, 6 anti-submarine
bombardments, 12 demolishing, and 10 sweeping exercises  (Appendix 3).

In 2010 the training plans and curricula were completed 65% in Land Forces,  in

the Air Forces (84.5%) and in the Naval Forces (86%).

_In the Land Force, the field-firing tactical exercises with companies (3) and_

battalions (4) and the aviation units’ terrestrial target practices (240) was re-convened.
The standard weapons-firing plans and curricula were completed in full and intensified
twofold. The airmobile force’s training augmentation was almost increased by 10%.
The average number of flying hours of army aviation crews was increased twofold
compared to 2009.

However, the indexes of drivers training plans were fulfilled on average just 10%

through the problems in resource provision.

_In the Air Force, the intensification of terrestrial target practices were increased_

sevenfold and tactical bombardments – almost by 10%. The average number of flying
hours by crew (15 hours 56 minutes) were augmented half as much again. The aviation
missile firings were re-convened. The live-firing were re-convened by JRRF units in
the anti-aircraft missile troops.

_In the Naval Force, the average time at sea of ships and craft increased almost_

2.5 times. The company tactical exercises were conducted twofold compared to 2009,

the practice of tank driving, squads and platoons’ field-firings were re-convened in
the Coast Guard Troops. The live-firing from tanks were augmented fourfold, ICV’s
weapons (APC) – in 3.6 times. The parachute jump plans and curricula were completed
in full. The Naval aviation re-convened the tactical flight training with squadrons.

In 2010, 21 multinational exercises[2] were planned (9 in Ukraine and 12 abroad)
(Diagram 3.1). Throughout the year, the Armed Forces participated in 16 large-scale
international military exercises: 7 of which were in Ukraine and 9 abroad (Annex 4).

The feature of 2010 was the co-ordination of the decision of all Central Executive

agencies concerning conducting international military exercises, the determination
of their necessity for training of the Armed Forces, as well as public support of the
exercise plans and programmes both in Ukraine and abroad. Throughout the year
Ukraine fulfilled all obligatory activities within the framework of peacekeeping and
security international projects.

The combined exercises and training with the Russian Federation and Belarus were

conducted after a long break.

In general, international exercises, which included over 3,000 Service personnel

and nearly 200 vehicles, significantly increased the operating proficiency of the Armed
Forces. The indexes of combat skills were improved during these exercises: the crewflying hours increased by 66 hours 13 minutes, vessels time at sea – by 11,000 miles,
parachute jumps – by 423, and naval diving – by 234 hours.

In 2010, participation in the Partnership for Peace (PfP) Programme, Planning and

Review Process (PARP) and implementation of NATO Operational Capabilities Concept
continued in the Armed Forces. The cycle of Second Level Assessment according
to PARP was started to ensure JRRF’s interoperability with foreign Armed Forces.
Throughout 2010, 3 units of the Armed Forces successfully acquired Second Level
Cycle Certification (Table 3.2).

The positive dynamics of the Armed Forces participation in the Operational


**Table 3.2. Results of Second Level Self-Certification of Armed**
Forces’ units in 2010


Capabilities Concept enabled expanding Service
personnel participation in combined international peace
support exercises.

The NBC protection unit was assigned to the 15[th]

Rotation NATO Responce Forces[3] and was on operational
duty (within Ukraine) during 6 months after successful
certification in Germany.

Two following Second Level Self-Certifications were

not implemented and transferred to 2011:

 - “Ternopil’” corvette of the Naval Forces;

 - AN-26 “Vita” air medical evacuation hospital

aircraft.

|Assets|Results of Self- Certification|Exercises, under which the assessment was executed|
|---|---|---|


**Due to the actions taken during the year it became possible not only to stabilize**

**the situation in the Armed Forces but also increase the level of combat training and**
**eliminate threatening trends. In 2010, the results of unit Force’s training proved**
**that the Command and Control Elements were capable to direct formations,**
**military units had sufficient levels of personnel training and units’ cohesiveness**
**that allowed them to carry out assigned missions.**

he updated principles of personnel policy as implemented in the course of 2010 were systematic in

#### Tnature and covered a wide range of issues aimed at creating a balance between the requirements of the

State in maintaining the appropriate level of combat readiness and manning of the Armed Forces and the
provision of adequate living standards and working conditions.


IMPLEMENTATION OF
THE PRINCIPLES OF
PERSONNEL POLICY:
SUMMARY


The new Centralized Personnel Management System as implemented in 2010 in
accordance with the Personnel Policy Concept[1] of the Armed Forces has enabled the
Armed Forces to ensure:

  - qualitative and timely manning of Service positions;

  - transparent and open career management of Service personnel;

  - implement conclusions and proposals of commanders at all levels on the basis

of comprehensive and impartial evaluation of the performance of Service
personnel;

  - equal opportunities for Service personnel to fulfil their potential.
The Armed Forces implemented the following activities in the course of the year in

order to increase the efficiency of personnel structures:

  - distributed the objectives, functions, authorities, and responsibilities of

Armed Forces Personnel structures so as to ensure the stable functioning of
the system under conditions of reduced motivation for further Armed Forces
service;

  - approved the candidate pool for promotion and the rotation plan for military

personnel in accordance with position Passports[2] and career algorithms[3] to
provide for well-balanced decision-making in the sphere of manning and
promotion;

  - carried out objective performance evaluation of military personnel on the basis

of the reporting year with direct influence on their career development and
professional growth;

  - managed the activity of personnel officers towards ensuring career management

of every officer in the Armed Forces taking into account the recommendations
of the annual performance evaluation.

In 2010 a new algorithm for the promotion of military personnel in the promotion

pool was introduced: “Extract from the promotion pool + consent of the military
personnel = changes in position”. As a result, the time required to implement changes
in positions has decreased from 1 or 2 months to 2 days.

The same approach is being applied to the Personnel Management System of Enlisted

and Non-Commissioned Service personnel serving on a contract basis.

At the same time the Regulation on Position Passports for Enlisted Personnel and

Non-Commissioned Officers was introduced to develop common approaches to the
training and decision-making procedures related to the appointment of Enlisted and
Non-Commissioned personnel and the management of their careers.[4]

Personnel Management System, in thousands of persons


The main result of the introduction of a new Personnel

Management System has been the establishment of
a Centralized Personnel Management System in the
Personnel Centres of the Armed Forces.

The total number of personnel encompassed by the

centralized personnel management system as at the end
of 2010 is more than 77,500 people[5] (Diagram 4.1).

Positive dynamics were also achieved in 2010 in

the appointment of graduates of tactical, operationaltactical and operational-strategic level education with
regards to their area of expertise and level of education.
The manning rate of senior officers’ positions is more
than 80%.

However, problems remain with the manning rate of company-level officers, which

is currently equal to 77% (compared to 86.5% last year).

Therefore work will continue on creating the conditions for guaranteed and

qualitative manning with personnel capable of performing tasks as well as their effective
use and retention.

Development of the Military
Education System

The development of the Military Education System in 2010 was aimed at integration
within the national system of education and the concentration of logistical, financial,
personnel, and information resources in order to achieve a high level of training of
military experts.

The system of Higher Military Education Institutions (HMEI) and Military Training

Units of the Higher Education Institutions (HEI) has not been changed in 2010.

Implementing the main directions in the training of military experts was driven by the

requirements of the Armed Forces for highly professional experts and the interoperable
functioning of all structural components in the Military Education System. In particular,
the Armed Forces:

               - renewed the training of cadets at the Military Institute of Odessa National

Polytechnic University, using the facilities of the university;

                - optimized the State Request on the training of military experts for the Armed

Forces and other military formations regarding the requirements of the Armed
Forces. The fulfillment status of the State Request is provided in Figure 4.1;

                - continued to ensure the right to higher military education for contracted Service

personnel. More than 2.5 thousand candidates applied for studies at the HMEI
in 2010, which made it possible to have entrance competition for the first time
in recent years.

5 Reducing of the number of personnel, encompassed by the centralized personnel management system in 2010, caused by decreasing of the number of
personnel in the Armed Forces.

professional development under the approved list of profiles and MOS as revised by the
Cabinet of Ministers.[6] At the end of 2010, it included 151 courses, running between 1
week to 4 months (Figure 4.2).

The total number of graduates from in-service training is about 4,000 Service

The foreign language training of military personnel and civil servants in accordance

with the Position Passport is a prerequisite of career progression. The procedure of
training (education) and career development (professional development) in language
courses[7] was regulated and the length of training set from 1 to 3 academic semesters
(depending on the purpose of training and complexity of language) each lasting 90
days.

Cooperation in the framework of the NATO-Ukraine Programme for Professional

Development of Civilian Personnel Employed in Ukraine’s Security Sector has
continued throughout 2010. Training and professional development of the foreign
languages academic and teaching staff has been conducted with the support of Hungary,
Greece, France, Spain and the British Council in Ukraine.

Language seminars in English, German and French have been provided in 9 HMEI

to 725 persons, including 640 Service personnel and 85 civil servants from MOD and
other central executive authorities in the sphere of national defence.


ENLISTMENT OF
MILITARY PERSONNEL
ON THE CONTRACT
BASIS


The limited provision of finance and resources has slowed the planned establishment
of appropriate conditions of Armed Forces service and social guarantees for Service
personnel and their families.

The new Force Manning System introduced in July 2009 –Territorial Centre for

Contract Personnel Manning - Training Centre - Military unit – improved the enlistment
quality in 2010 and released the unit military command from non-core functions related
to the organization of identifying, attracting, registrating, and preparing citizens for
Armed Forces service on a contract basis. In particular this has allowed the Armed
Forces to:


**Figure 4.3. Distribution of Candidates Selected by Territorial Centre**
for Contract Personnel Manning According to the MOS 2010

Combat Signals



- ensure priority manning of positions linked to combat

readiness. More than 95% of almost 5,000 recruits
sent by the Territorial Centre directly to the Training
Centre were trained according to the major Military
Occupational Specialties (MOS) (Figure 4.3.), which is
twice the number in 2009;

- reduce the registration period of recruits selected for

service on a contract basis;

- ensure targeted enlistment of Service personnel on

the contract basis those already trained for specific MOS


and avoid the long-term posting (for more than 6 months) of untrained personnel
to Armed Forces’ positions.

As a result of implementing the planned activities the Armed Forces were able to:

               - introduce the career management system for Enlisted personnel and NCOs on a

contract basis by encompassing more than 40,400 military of this category within
the centralized personnel management system;

               - initiate the annual performance evaluation of Enlisted personnel and NCOs on

a contract basis and subsequently create a pool of promotion to NCO positions;
more than 83% of Service personnel were evaluated;

               - introduce the Position Passport for Enlisted personnel and NCOs and started

work on the development of the career progression algorithm[8] (Appendix 5).

Establishment of the Professional
NCO Corps

The establishment of a professional NCO Corps in the Armed Forces has continued.
Three military colleges for NCOs were introduced in 2010 – at the Ivan Kozhedub
Air Force University in Kharkiv, the Ivan Ogienko National University in KamyanetsPodilskyi and the Military Institute of Telecommunications and Informatization of
the National Technical University “Kyiv Polytechnical Institute” (Poltava), thus
completing the establishment of a multilevel system of NCO training.

With the approval of provisional regulations on training centres (and joint training

centres) and guidelines for the training of Service personnel in Training Centres
of the Armed Forces[9] the activity of these training centres has also been defined
(Appendix 6).

In developing the system of NCO training the Armed Forces conducted the following

major activities:

               - introduced courses for Staff Sergeants at the Military College for NCOs at

the National Technical University “Kharkiv Polytechnical Institute”, which is
training Sergeants for command positions to be established at the battalion level
and higher and Sergeant Instructors for the training centres;

               - introduced new technical MOS at the Military College for NCOs to meet the

requirements of the Armed Forces;

               - organized NCO training in accordance with the State standard for vocational

training at the training centres of the Armed Forces;

                - introduced all MOS which are used in the Armed Forces at the Training Centres

for NCOs, providing the level of education of a Junior specialist[10].

Six-monthly training courses for contract NCOs with higher education were initiated

in the military colleges on 27 September 2010. The training is oriented on command
and technical positions and should allow the appointment of graduates to the positions
of Company Sergeant-Major, Battalion Sergeant-Major, Chief of Signal unit, Chief of
the Operator’s Room, etc.

The total number of graduates break down as follows: 1,353 NCOs received basic

level of training in the Training Centres of the Armed Forces; 51 NCOs received
the average level of training and the level of education of a junior specialist in
the military colleges for NCOs; and 5 NCOs received the higher level of training.
72 military units were transferred into the new organization and establishment system
during 2009-2010, thus providing more than 1,150 new positions for the abovementioned graduates.

All these measures taken in 2010 notwithstanding, the Armed Forces were unable to

improve the level of manning with contract personnel (Figure 4.5).

Contract military personnel is still the least socially

protected with a level of salary considerably lower than
the average wage in all the regions of Ukraine.

Therefore, the number of contract Service personnel

has continued to decline for the second year in a row
(down to 1,006 personnel) with a total manning rate of
49.9% for Enlisted and Non-Commissioned positions as
of the end of 2010.

On the other hand, the number of Service personnel

dismissed due to serious violation of the terms of their
contract has decreased by 5.9% compared to 2009 and
by 12.4% compared to 2008. This demonstates the
improved quality of selected personnel and the conscious
decision of citizens to sign a contract for Armed Forces
service.

he provision of social guarantees to Service personnel and their families remains a major issue during

taking account of the stabilizing in the Ukrainian economy, discrepancy of budget expenses and Armed
Forces requirements, current Servicemen social support, and rapid amendments to legislation.


SALARY AND
PENSION


To increase recruitment and improve incentives to extend Service contracts, the MOD
and GS (supported by the President and Cabinet of Ministers) launched the initiative
to increase gradually the salary[1] of all the categories of Service personnel in the
course of the year.

Thus, since 1 May 2010 monthy salaries of contract soldiers and NCOs have been

increased by 10% to 35%.

However, the minimum salary for first year contract

Service personnel (UAH 870 to 1 May 2010, UAH 998
from 1 May 2010 and UAH 1,180 from 1 December
2010) less than half the average salary in Ukraine
(which according to data from the State Statistics
Committee comprises UAH 2,322 in October 2010),
and is the lowest in comparison with other low-paid
branches of the national economy (e.g. average salaries
in agriculture were UAH 1,548 in October 2010). The
average salary of a young officer appointed to initial
position (Lieutenant/Platoon Leader is UAH 2,093) is
also lower than the average salary in Ukraine.

higher than the salary of first-year contract service personnel, which makes this service uncompetitive even in rural regions, where salaries are lower.

In 2010 the pension legislation of retired personnel and members of their families

was improved.

The corresponding instruction[3] regulated the procedure of social support of retired

personnel and their families. This document also regulated the process of registration of
pension application and re-assessment documents and the process of payment provided
by other laws.

Due to new rules, the wages of a specific category of persons who served at nuclear

warfare maintenance have been re-assessed. According to information from the Pension
Fund of Ukraine, more than 5,000 people have thus received a pension increase of about
UAH 122 on average.

MEDICAL SUPPORT In order to improve medical support of personnel under conditions of limited resources
the Armed Forces have optimized the medical support[4] system and implemented
activities aimed at increasing the professional training of military doctors and
improving the technical equipment of medical establishments.

In 2010 Mobile Medical units of Regional Military-Medical Clinical Centres and

nurses brigades of Military Hospitals took part in 8 training exercises, which simulated
the response to man-made and natural disasters as well as explosions and fires in
arsenals and storage facilities for weapons, munitions and other materials.

The outcomes of international exercises proved the Medevac capabilities of the

AN-26 “Vita” plane, which with its special characteristics is the only plane in Europe
enabling surgery to be conducted during flight. Since the AN-26 began its service, over
300 patients have received operational, highly qualified medical support.

New technologies have been implemented in several medical establishments. For

example, a new section of x-ray cardiac vascular surgery has been opened in the Main
Military Medical-Clinical Hospital which enables the conducting of modern diagnostic
and treatment of cardiac and vascular diseases through the setting of medical stents in
coronary vessels and limb arteries.

HOUSING


The most significant social guarantee and one of the main criterion for increasing the
image of Armed Forces service is housing for Service personnel and their families.

Since 1992, the MOD has built or acquired over 84,000 apartments, over 33,000 of

them from the year 2000. Nonetheless, the problem of housing remains one of the most
urgent ones today (Figure 5.6).

took measures in 2010 to improve the Service housing situation, in particular:

                - Amendments to article 4 of the Law “On the Use of Military Property”[8] have been

introduced, according to which the MOD can use military property – without
changing its original purpose – for building houses for Service personnel and
their families, also as social and affordable housing.

Ukraine appeciates the assistance of international partners. Main attention during

the year were concentrated on cooperation with international organizations and foreign
structures, conducting re-training and preparation of Service personnel planning to
retire as well as retired Service personnel.

At the same time during the year the effectiveness of social and professional

adaptation significantly increased.

  - the information system throughout the Armed Forces and other formations

concerning social and professional adaptation of retired Service personnel has
been improved. The information required can be obtained through the website of the State Department of Retired Servicemen Adaptation and Conversion
of Former Military Objects[14] and Resources and Career Center for Retired
Servicemen[15];

  - Activities concerning social and professional adaptation of Service personnel

were carried out by corresponding supervisory councils under local state
administrations[16];

  - In different regions of Ukraine regular “Vacancy markets” for courses graduates

have been conducted, during which they were familiarized with participant
organizations and obtained information about available vacancies.

In 2010 cooperation with NATO, OSCE and Norway in the framework

of international projects and programmes continued, these organizations granted
financial support to provide re-training of retired personnel, and personnel who are
about to retire.

BILATERAL
COOPERATION


Deepening bilateral cooperation with MODs of strategic partners, neighbouring
countries and leading nations remains an important activity of the MOD. During
the year the main attention was concentrated on fulfilling agreements within acting
treaties and further improvement of mutually beneficial interaction at the bilateral
level.

Priority directions of bilateral cooperation are:

  - interacting with EU- and NATO-countries;

  - developing relations with strategic partners: the US, the Russian Federation and

Poland;

  - widening traditionally active cooperation with Germany, UK and France.

In 2010 the number of bilateral cooperation activities exceeded the previous year

Development of international cooperation, including

defence cooperation, between Ukraine and the US
remains one of the main directions of the State’s external
policy.

To implement the Memorandum[1] (2009) in November

2010 the elimination and demilitarization of missile
complexes 9К72 (SCUD) and equipment, materials and
rocket fuel components was started. The process is con­
ducted by the Ukrainian corporation “Spivdruzhnist”
under control of the US “Global Offshore Projects”
company experts.

In 2010 cooperation between the Ministries of Defence

of Ukraine and the Russian Federation was influenced by
significant changes, becoming an active dialogue. In total
during the year 25 activities took place.


168 (35%)


In the framework of political-military cooperation the Sub-Committee on Security

Issues of the Ukraine-Russia Inter-State Board was re-established. Meetings were
held of the Sub-Committee and its working bodies, the Panel on Military-Technical
Cooperation and the Panel on Cooperation between the Armed Forces of Ukraine and
Russia.

Important activities of military cooperation were the joint Naval Exercise

“Peace Fairway”, bilateral Ukraine-Russia Air Defence Forces exercise, and training
flights of Russian Nord Fleet aviation on take-off and landing training system
“NITKA“.

Bilateral cooperation with Poland was developed according to the following

directions:

                - mutually beneficial implementation of activities in the military-technical area;

               - future plans of cooperation with EU and NАТО;

               - participation of units in joint international exercises and peacekeeping

operations.

With establishing the Lithuania-Poland-Ukraine brigade LITPOLUKRBRIG,

the Working Group staff was approved, formalized documents were developed, in
particular common requirements of unit interoperability, and developing the schedule
was agreed.

A Protocol was signed to the Agreement between MOD Ukraine and the

Ministry of National Defence of Poland on military cooperation concerning
information exchange and Ukrainian and Polish aircraft flights over both countries’
airspace.

During 2010 cooperation continued between Ukraine and Germany. The visit in July

2010 to Ukraine of the Parliament State Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Defence
resulted in the Agreement on Cooperation in the area of Military Geo-Information, and
arrangements on re-establishing the Inter-governmental Ukraine-Germany Board on
Military-Technical Cooperation.

Cooperation between the Ministries of Defence of Ukraine and UK continued

at a consistently high level. In June 2010 the Memorandum of Understanding was
signed between the Defence Ministries providing MOD Ukraine with a UK Special
Defence Advisor. In the Memorandum framework cooperation on advisory support

started – a range of activites to prevent corruption
in executive bodies, particularly in the MOD, took
place. A new impetus was given to cooperation in
military education, for instance, the UK proposed
internships of Ukrainian cadets in its corresponding
institutions.

According to the Memorandum of Understanding,

signed in February 2010, between the Defence
Ministries of Ukraine and Denmark concerning
fulfilling joint military-transport operation on
transporting fuel – “Northern Falcon 2010” – Air
Force Transportation Aviation teams operated for the
second time in the Arctic. During the operation from
the 6[th] to 24[th] April 2010, there were 40 sorties from
the US Air Force base Thule, 517,000 litres of fuel and

49,000 kilos of load were transported to the Station “Nord”, Greenland, to sustain
the Station.

Special attention was given to cooperation with Turkey, particularly

in the defence industrial area. An important implementation mechanizm was the
annual meeting of the Inter-Governmental Ukraine-Turkey Board[2]. In 2010 there was
a significant increase in effectiveness of activities concerning professional training
of Ukraine Service personnel in Turkish military education institutions, particularly
officers trained in the Turkish Armed Forces Service academies at tactical and strategic
levels.

The military cooperation format with Belarus continued. During the year, Air

Defence Duty units undertook cross-state border training using Armed Forces aircraft
and a separate bilateral tacticial exercise took place.

Developing a legal framework to establish the joint Ukraine-Belarus Engineering

battalion to be used to eliminate the consequences of natural and man-made disasters
is in process.

There was a continuation of cooperation with Georgia. In November 2010 during

the visit of the Ukraine Defence Minister agreements were reached in conducting joint
military exercises and training of Ukraine military experts at the Mountain-Infantry
Unit Specialized Training Centre in Georgia.

Establishing effective bilateral cooperation with Ukraine’s strategic partners,

neighbouring countries and leading countries remains one of the priority directions
of the State’s external policy and is considered by Ukraine an active mechanizm of
developing mutually beneficial relations between countries and preventing military
conflicts.


MULTI-LATERAL
COOPERATION AND
COOPERATION IN
INTERNATIONAL
ORGANIZATIONS
FRAMEWORK


Successful implementation of multi-lateral cooperation activities within international

and regional organizations on security, stability and strengthening trust is one of
the main components of international defence cooperation. In total during the year
220 activities took place, representing 31 % of the total number of activities
(Figure 6.3.).
Cooperation with the European Union

The State’s external policy main priority is providing Ukraine’s integration

to European political, economic, legal and security environment with the aim of
European Union membership. That is why military cooperation with the EU in 2010
was practically oriented and is considered to be an important direction of Ukraine’s
new defence policy.

Ukraine launched implementation involving the AFU units into EU BG:

                - Air-medical evacuation aircraft Аn-26 “Vita” was designated to EU BG “Baltic”

(formed by Poland, Germany, Slovakia, Lithuania and Latvia) with the status of
an associated means to be additionally involved depending on the format and
aim of the operation;

                - an agreed list of Ukraine Armed Forces and capabilities to be declared to BG

HELBROC (Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Cyprus) work continued on these issues
concerning the BG to be formed by the Vyshegrad countries (Poland, Slovakia,
Hungary, Czech Republic);

                - the process continued of future involvement of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and

capabilities into the EU BG (Italy, Hungary, Slovenia) to be on duty in the sec­
ond half of 2012.

On 27 September 2010 Ukraine was officially recognized as a contributor to the EU

anti- piracy naval operation near the Somali coast “EU NAVFOR ATALANTA”, from
November 2010 the Ukraine Armed Forces representative has been a Staff Officer[3].

There was continuation of developing legislative documents involving the

Ukraine Armed Forces in the EU military operation EUFOR ALTHEA in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.

Successful implementation of EU cooperation plans in the military area gives a

possibility for the Ukraine’s Armed Forces to reach a new quality and enhance common
capabilities for participation in EU operations.

Partnership with NATO

Ukraine continues a constructive partnership with NАТО aimed at solving priority
tasks of Armed Forces development, providing stability and security in the world
through peacekeeping operations, and ensuring Ukraine’s readiness to participate
in such activity by developing appropriate level of interoperability of the Ukrainian
Armed Forces with those of NATO member-states.

The format of such cooperation was maintained and continued throughout 2010. By

carrying out its international obligations Ukraine is proving itself a predictable country
and reliable partner.

The MOD consistently implements the strategy of Ukraine’s relations with the

Alliance in the framework of the NATO-Ukraine Annual National Programme of
Cooperation for 2010 (ANP–2010), the NATO-Ukraine Military Committee Work Plan,

NATO-Ukraine Joint Working Group on Defence Reform Work Programme and the
“Partnership for Peace” Programme, components of which are the Planning and Review
Process (PARP) and the NATO-Ukraine Individual Partnership Programme.

According to the ANP-2010 Action Plan the MOD participated in 246 activities,

in 215 as a responsible executive body, in 31 as a co-responsible executive body. Of
these activities 126 were “completed” (51 %), 69 “partially completed” (28 %), 11 “not
completed” (4 %) and 7 activities “cancelled” (3 %).

The NATO-Ukraine Individual Partnership Programme is a practical mechanism

for exchanging experience between the armed forces of Ukraine and Alliance members
and partners. It has enhanced the level of cooperation in a number of directions:
military education and training; command, communications and informational
systems; standardization; interoperability; and logistics. In 2010 Ukrainian Armed
Forces representatives took part in a total of 55 programme activities: 31 courses; 7
seminars and workshops; 6 exercises; 3 working meetings and NATO expert visits; and
8 conferences and meetings.

In 2010 Ukraine’s participation in the NATO Programme on Air Situation

Data Exchange was extended, with the signing in May 2010 of a Memorandum of
Understanding between the MOD and the General Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces
and the Supreme Allied Command Operations. According to the Memorandum Air
Situation Data Exchange will take place between the Ukrainian Air Force Command
Post “South” and the Control and Notification Center of the Turkish Air Force in
Erzurum.

Another format of cooperation between Ukraine and NATO is participation of

the Armed Forces in the Planning and Review Process in the framework of the
“Partnership for Peace” Programme. The main efforts of the MOD and GS were
concentrated on training designated forces and means for interaction with EU and
NATO nations’ armed forces in peacekeeping, search and rescue and humanitarian
operations (figure 6.1).

In 2010 the format of UAF participation in NATO

operations was maintained with Ukraine participating
in four out of five NАТО operations:

The corvette “Ternopil” accomplished tasks in

the framework of the anti-terrorist “Operation Active
Endeavour” from 7 November till 27 December 2010;
in the course of its mission in the Mediterranean Sea it
took part in 5 patrols in various regions. During this time
the corvette crew communicated with 100 civilian ships
and sailed approximately 5,000 miles for 25 running
days and nights. Significant progress was achieved
in involving Ukrainian forces in the NATO Response
Force. For the first time since independence the Armed
Forces’ NBC protection unit was on operational duty as
a part of the 15th NATO Response Force rotation (July–
December 2010) (Figure 6.4).

Experience and training methods are being introduced

in other units that comprise the Joint Rapid Reaction
Forces and participate in PARP.

Thus, partnership with NATO remains one of the

priority directions of Ukraine’s defence policy, and
the MOD and the Armed Forces are ensuring highlevel political-military dialogue between Ukraine and
NATO and undertaking efforts to continue constructive
partnership on issues of common interest.

Cooperation in framework of other international
and regional organizations and initiatives

Cooperation in the framework of other international and regional organizations is an
important direction of Ukraine’s defence policy and one of the State’s mechanisms
for providing security in support of an atmosphere of stability and mutual trust in
Europe and the world.

In accordance with obligations undertaken by Ukraine the Armed Forces continued

in 2010 to actively participate in peacekeeping missions under the aegis of the United
Nations (UN). The most significant contribution in this area is being made by the 56th
Detached Helicopter unit in Liberia and Cote d’Ivoire.

At the time Service personnel are serving as peacekeepers in UN missions in the

Democratic Republic of Congo, Kosovo, Liberia and Sudan.

Ukraine is a permanent member of the Organization of Security and Cooperation

in Europe (OSCE) Forum for Security Co-operation. One of the most important and
successful directions of OSCE-Ukraine cooperation in the politico-military sphere in
2010 was the implementation of the OSCE-Ukraine project on rocket fuel (mélange)
disposal in the framework of the OSCE Document on Stockpiles of Conventional
Ammunition from 2003.

Ukraine considers cooperation with the Commonwealth of Independent States as an

important direction of external policy in the post-Soviet space. During the year MOD
delegations took place twice in work of the CIS Defence Ministers’ Council. Taking
into account the status of Ukraine as an observer summary meeting documents were
not signed.

Besides, implementing military cooperation continuation and pragmatism principles

during the Council meetings the following activities were conducted:

                - effective exchange of experience on defence defence reform and security system

management;

                - discussion of the World War II 65th Victory Anniversary celebration in Ukraine,

improvement of multi-lateral military cooperation legal support, military and
military-technical cooperation, organization and conducting of the International
Military-Scientific Works competition, flights safety, meteorological support of
military aviation;

               - bilateral meetings were held with Defence Ministries of Azerbaijan, Belarus,

Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and also with the Chief of the
General Staff of the Armed Forces of Tajikistan

Active participation in the South-East Europe Defence Ministerial (SEEDM) process

increases mutual confidence between the participants and strengthens Ukraine’s role
and interests in the Black Sea and the Balkans.

In September of 2010 a delegation of Defence Ministry took part in the

23 [rd] Coordinating Committee meeting and the 24 [th] Political Military Steering
Committee meeting held in Bulgaria. In October of 2010 the Ukrainian delegation
headed by the Defence Minister visited Albania to take part in the annual SEEDM
meeting.

During the meeting Ukraine offered its military training grounds for the training

and exercises of the South-Eastern Europe Brigade (SEEBRIG). It also expressed its
readiness to cooperate with other SEEDM countries in the spheres of airlift, chemical
and biological protection, and response to man-made and natural disasters. Moreover,
Ukraine confirmed its intentions to join the multinational peacekeeping brigade
SEEBRIG.

Cooperation with the Vysegrad Group (V4) is very important for Ukraine. In June

of 2010 the Chiefs of Defence of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Slovakia, Poland,
Czech Republic and Hungary met in Hungary. At this meeting the parties reached a
consensus on the involvement of Ukraine in the NATO helicopter initiative, projects
aimed at disposing of explosive objects and training activities within the framework
of the Multinational Engineering Battalion “Tysa”. The interest of the Ukrainian side
in continuing cooperation within the Multinational Helicopter Initiative was also
confirmed.

In addition, 2010 witnessed a deepening of regional cooperation in the Black

Sea area within the framework of joint Black Sea Naval Cooperation Task Force
BLACKSEAFOR. Ships conducted joint maritime exercises for the training of a number
of combat and humanitarian tasks. Port calls were made in the harbours of participating
countries Bulgaria, Russia, Romania, Turkey and Ukraine.

Cooperation continued between the navies of Ukraine, Turkey, Russia and Romania

for finding common methods of fighting illegal activity and the threat of terrorism in the
Black Sea within the framework of the “Black Sea Harmony” operation.

The active participation of the MOD and Armed Forces in the activities of

international security organizations helps to ensure international security in Europe
and the whole world and supports the creation of a zone of stability and mutual trust
around Ukraine.


PEACE-KEEPING
ACTIVITY


Ukraine is conscious of its responsibility to preserve international peace and security
and remains an active participant in international peacekeeping activity.

In 2010 Ukraine maintained the format of Armed Forces participation in international

peacekeeping operations and ensured the practical realization of the Strategy of
International Peacekeeping Activity[4].

In the course of the year 858 Service personnel participated in peacekeeping

contingents and 133 served as peacekeeping personnel. Altogether Service personnel
took part in 11 international peacekeeping operations in 8 countries (Figure 6.5).

In the course of the year measures were taken to reconstitute the Ukrainian

peacekeeping contingent in Kosovo into a new unit (a mobile company with a total of
134 Service personnel). As a component of the mobile battalion within the multinational

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. PEACEKEEPING. ARMS CONTROL

Battle Group “East” the Ukrainian contingent fulfills its tasks of ensuring the security
of the population and the rule of law and guaranteeing the observance of human rights
and protection of critical infrastructure.

Taking into account a UN[5] Security Council Resolution and the holding of elections

in Cote-D’Ivoire Ukraine deployed an air group from the 56[th] Detached Helicopter unit
serving in Liberia to provide urgent support to the UN Mission in the Cote-D’Ivoire[6].

Within the framework of the Concept of Pastoral Care in the Armed Forces and

at the initiation of the MOD Council of Pastoral Care a “Religious Affairs Officer”
was assigned to the 56-th Detached Helicopter unit in Liberia to satisfy the religious
needs of the Ukrainian peacekeeping contingent; a similar position in the peacekeeping
contingent in Kosovo was again filled.

Since March 2010 the Ukrainian Group within the Lithuanian Ghor Provincial

Reconstruction Team (PRT) of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in
Afghanistan has been carrying out the task of disposal of explosive devices. In the
course of the year the group destroyed around 10,000 explosive devices, including
airborne bombs, rocket and high-explosive shells, mortar mines as well as 4 improvised
explosive devices. Ukrainian doctors treated 1220 patients, conducting 6 difficult and
59 simple surgical procedures.

At the end of 2010 the total number of peacekeeping Service personnel in Afghanistan

was 17.

Ukraine’s participation in peacekeeping operations, including NATO operations

in Kosovo, Afghanistan and the Mediterranean Sea, furthers the national interests of
Ukraine and helps to support international peace and security. It also increases the level
of combat training of Service personnel, enabling them to obtain combat experience,
and helps the Armed Forces to achieve interoperability with the forces of other nations
participating in international peacekeeping operations.

5 UN Security Council Resolutions #1609 of 24 June 2005, #1865 of 27 January 2009, #1880 of 30 June 2009, and #1951 of 24 October 2010.

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. PEACEKEEPING. ARMS CONTROL

Efforts in verification of Armed Forces activity were focused on ensuring all parties’
adherence to arms control agreements, including the Open Skies Agreement, the
Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, the Vienna document of 1999
as well as bilateral inter-governmental agreements between Ukraine and Slovakia,
Hungary, Belarus and Poland aimed at additional confidence-building and security
measures.

The status of implementation of international

agreements and conventions in the sphere of arms
control in 2010 was the same as in previous years and
was characterized by the high level of attention paid to
verification activities on the territory of Ukraine without
the right to refuse and an increase of the number of
neighboring counties’ representatives in multilateral
inspection groups.

In the course of the year 52 verification activities

to fulfil arms control agreements and conventions were
conducted in Ukraine (Figure 6.6.). In addition, one
inspection was held in accordance with the Convention
on the Prohibition of Developing, Producing, Enriching
and Using Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.

Demonstrating its active participation in arms control,

Ukraine conducted 58 inspections on the territories of
other parties, twice more than last year (Figure 6.7).

Conducting of inspections abroad enabled Ukraine to

carry out effective control of other parties’ adherence to
the defined limits on the amount of main categories of
arms.

Fulfilling Ukrainian obligations under international


arms control agreements furthers the development of the European security system and
the integration of Ukraine within this system.


**International defence cooperation provides a stable pillar within Ukraine’s**

**overall foreign policy and is aimed at the implementation of the country’s strategic**
**course towards full membership in the European Union and integration in the**
**European security system.**
