## Foreword

Croatian Armed Forces Long Term Development Plan for the period 2015 to 2024 sums up in one way the efforts made at the conceptual-normative regulations of Defense area, and on the other hand it gives a clear outline of the new profile of the Armed Forces. 

In the past three years processes in the Defense Sector were focused on the implementation of appropriate reforms and adjustments related to the ambiguous strategic and regional environment. Functioning of the Defense Sector that was determined by limited Defense Budget and requirements to have capabilities to respond to current and future threats in a dynamic and complex security environment, were the main driving force in reviewing of the existing plans and functioning of Defense. An obsolete and outdated conceptual-normative framework prevented reform processes and therefore this segment was targeted for radical reforms. The Long-Term Development Plan reflects strategic shift toward a new, modern deliberation of Defense and its conceptual and institutional positioning in modern geopolitical and geostrategic realities. This is the first Long-Term Development Plan since we become members of NATO and the European Union, and this fact creates an essential framework for our efforts aimed at positioning defense functions in relation to the contemporary security architecture. Although one of the biggest challenges is to achieve the necessary level of Defense Capabilities in circumstances marked by reduced defense spending, the vision set out in this document attempts to position and understand the Defense and the social role of the Armed Forces in a far broader and more meaningful way.

The Republic of Croatia will develop respectable Armed Forces that will be able to: adequately respond to the long-term period challenges; Forces capable of executing its fundamental Constitutional role; Forces that are ready, trained and equipped to carry out their part in joint operations with Allies, and Forces that will be available to provide assistance to affected civil population during disasters and crisis situations.

At the same token, the Armed Forces will be developed as an important building block of the overall potential of the country, support to security, stability and development of society.

Since the adoption of the Croatian Armed Forces Long-Term Development Plan 2006-2015, significant changes have taken place in the strategic status of the Republic of Croatia. With the accession to Euro-Atlantic integration, the key strategic national goals have been accomplished. In 2009 the Republic of Croatia joined the NATO Alliance and in 2013 became the member of the European Union. Through this membership a stable and long-term security perspective has been achieved. Concurrently, due to economic crisis, the funds allocated for defense have been reduced, whereas the security environment at the global and regional levels generates new security and defense challenges and threats. This altogether requires further adjustments and transformation in the development of Defense Capabilities.

Reconsideration of conceptual solutions and available capabilities has resulted in decisions to elaborate and adopt the new legal regulations (the Defense Act1, the Act on Service in the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia2), and a series of strategic and planning documents in the field of Defense that will direct further development of the Croatian Armed Forces 
(hereinafter referred to as "the Armed Forces"). After the implementation of the Strategic Defense Review process, the final document was adopted by the Government on 25th July 2013. The development of the Croatian Armed Forces Long-Term Development Plan 2015-2024 (hereinafter referred to as "the LTDP") is a continuation of this process that puts into operation conceptual approaches and the necessity for transforming defense capabilities identified in the Strategic Defense Review.

The LTDP is the basic defense planning document defining the long-term projection of development of military capabilities and the required resources. 

Having considered all aspects of strategic circumstances and available capabilities and resources, the analytical phase played a key role in identifying Target Capabilities to be developed in the upcoming planning period. Within this process, a wide range of scenarios has been developed that can generate the need for the Armed Force engagement. The scenarios were analyzed, along with the probability of each scenario occurring, requirements, security impacts on the state and society, ambitions and possibilities for development of military capabilities that should be employed. Finally, summarization and prioritization were conducted, including harmonization of the type and size of the affordable capabilities which was taken as a basis for defining the size and organization of the Armed Forces.

## Security Strategic Framework

The global strategic environment is 

![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png) marked by highly dynamic political, social and economic changes that result in the shift of power and influence generating new instabilities, divisions, competitions and opposition of the global actors. In a narrow security sense, the environment was characterized by disruption of security by non-traditional security threats, such as new forms of international terrorism, trans-border organized crime, and proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, disruption of energy supply systems, potential dangers from missile and cyber-attacks, and piracy. Although the probability of conventional and nuclear attack on the European Union and NATO member states is not high, primarily due to their capabilities for defense and deterrence built through the combined efforts of the Allies, instabilities arising in the close vicinity of the Allies' borders could have far-reaching impacts on the global security architecture, thus reaffirming the importance of a balanced approach to the Alliance's core tasks - Collective Defense, Crises Management and Cooperative Security. Numerous conflicts and crisis areas, emerging failed and unstable states and various types of threats caused by the rise of extremist ideologies impose the need for the development of key capabilities and launching of international operations directed towards improving security.

An effective response to a broad spectrum of global threats is possible only through a strong and comprehensive cooperation with the Allies and Partners, and through integration of civilian and military capabilities. The tasks that are set before the Armed Forces impose the need for their further transformation and modernization, i.e. building and development of capabilities for a balanced approach to the Alliance's core tasks. In order to respond to modern challenges and threats, the Armed Forces should be capable of performing non-traditional tasks. They should be adjustable, mobile, interoperable, deployable and sustainable in the Area of Operations. Armed conflicts from the recent past that took place in the **Southeast European** Region have been replaced by a wide range and an extensive network of multilateral and bilateral cooperation. This has mostly been a result of a strong influence of external factors and aspirations of all countries in the Region to establish close connections with the Euro-Atlantic community. Countries in the Southeast European Region have recognized the importance 

![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)

of the regional cooperation and, with the support of the Euro Atlantic community, have established a series of initiatives for cooperation. As a result of the years long successful cooperation, the states of the Region have gradually taken over the ownership over regional initiatives, as for example the US-Adriatic Charter (A-5), Southeast Europe Defense Ministerial - SEDM, 
RACVIAC - The Center for Security Cooperation and have taken over the implementation of the Agreement on Sub regional Arms Control (*Article IV, Annex 1-B of the* General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina - Dayton Accord). The results of such efforts have been positive and are reflected in a wide range of mutual cooperation between the countries in the Region focused on multilateral 

![10_image_1.png](10_image_1.png)

![10_image_2.png](10_image_2.png)

solutions to security problems, i.e. in the readiness to settle interstate and interior disputes through an open dialogue. 

The aspiration to connect with the EuroAtlantic community, to a greater or lesser degree has been present in all countries of the Region, and every step towards Euro-Atlantic integration has further reduced the likelihood of new crises or renewed conflicts.

However, in spite of the aforementioned positive characteristics of the security environment, there have still been potential security threats resulting from open regional issues caused by the legacy of the 1990s. In the spectrum of potential regional threats we cannot exclude the probability of armed conflicts, so there is still a need for international military and police presence in some countries of the Region. 

While the Republic of Croatia could be indirectly exposed to implications of potential regional conflicts, there is no danger from direct armed aggression on its territory in the context of the existing strategic circumstances.

Starting from the considerably strengthened international position of the Republic of Croatia, unquestionably determined by its affiliation with NATO and the EU, the Armed Forces will participate more actively in multilateral and bilateral regional cooperation projects by strengthening regional stability and good neighborly relationships and by helping the countries in the Region to join the Euro-Atlantic integration, not neglecting multilateral and bilateral cooperation with all Allies and Partners in the Euro-Atlantic community and beyond. In accordance with the strategic orientation of the Republic of Croatia, the Armed Forces have given a significant contribution to international peace and security for more than a decade by participating in NATO, EU and UN missions and operations which required a gradual development of the entire spectrum of new capabilities. These capabilities of the Armed Forces will be 

![11_image_2.png](11_image_2.png)

![11_image_3.png](11_image_3.png) further developed, inter alia, through various types of international training, courses and exercises. The commitments of the Armed Forces resulting from the new Security and Defense architecture of the Republic of Croatia governed by the Defense Act that envisages assistance provided to Allied countries, declaring their forces for Multinational Response Forces, joining the multinational military structures and engagement in Peace Support Operations, Crisis Response Operations, Humanitarian Operations, and other activities abroad. Participation in the UN Peace Support Missions will remain one of the priorities of the Croatian contribution to maintaining international peace and security. With its own war experience, the Republic of Croatia has acquired expertise in managing UN Peace Missions that have become an important mechanism that can stop international conflicts. In that context, the Republic of Croatia has gained additional credibility and globally applicable substantial knowledge. It has also assumed responsibility to apply its excellence in implementation of the international peace activities and to pass on practical experiences. Participation in the UN Peace Missions and operations, in addition to maintaining world order based on obeying the international law, is also useful in the context of strengthening strategic partnerships with key partners. 

NATO membership obligates the Republic of Croatia to give full contribution to the Collective Defense of the Allies under Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty according to its capabilities, and to engage its forces to actively participate in the execution of other tasks in accordance with the NATO Strategic Concept, including the activities related to Crisis Management and the 

![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)

![11_image_1.png](11_image_1.png)

![11_image_4.png](11_image_4.png)

![11_image_5.png](11_image_5.png) contribution to international peace and security. The Armed Forces have significant obligations that are a result of declaring their forces for NATO Response Forces (NRF), improved military capabilities and interoperability through participation in the implementation of concepts used to develop mechanisms for mutual cooperation on building, maintaining and strengthening Defense Capabilities. Capability Targets that the Republic of Croatia assumed in the NATO Defense Planning Process play a crucial role as direct indicators of the dedication to the development of the Alliance, and their implementation will form a backbone of the Armed Forces development. The European Union strives to structure its Security and Defense dimension more firmly through a series of initiatives and activities within Common Security and Defense Policy. Therefore, the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union implies a new commitment to the development of the Armed Forces capabilities. The Republic of Croatia will continue to give contribution to the Peace Support Operations within the EU framework and the EU Battle Group (EU BG), and participate in the Pooling and Sharing initiative and in the activities of the European Defense Agency (EDA). As a full-fledged member, the Republic of Croatia has taken over the commitments of potential employment of the Armed Forces in providing assistance to the EU member states regarding their defense and their employment in accordance with the Solidarity Clause. Common affiliation of the majority of NATO and EU member states, common values and strategic interests present a new challenge to the Republic of Croatia, its Defense Sector and the Armed Forces. 

This means a possibility and an obligation 

![12_image_1.png](12_image_1.png) to participate in numerous initiatives and activities arising from the need for enhancing the complementarities and coordination of these two organizations, particularly in the area of practical cooperation in missions and operations and cooperation in the development of Defense Capabilities.

## Financial Framework

Due to the economic crisis, the Defense 

![12_image_2.png](12_image_2.png)

Sector has been faced with a reduced Defense Budget, and with the imperative to adapt to financing under the conditions of fiscal rationalization and savings. Emanating from the macroeconomic reality that is currently not capable of producing reliable medium and long-term forecasts of GDP dynamics, this Document is based on the assumption that for the next three years the Defense Budget will remain 

![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png) at the level of Fiscal Year 2014, i.e., the total Defense Budget will be 4.3 billion HRK, and this will, in a real sense, put an end to its year-long continuous decrease. With the recovery of the economy and the GDP growth, and in accordance with the European Union procedures related to the excessive deficit, the conditions for a gradual increase in the Defense Budget will be met, that is, the prerequisites for a gradual accomplishment of the long-term ambition to increase the Defense spending by 2 percent of the country's GDP. 

Long-term planning in the Defense Sector under the conditions of uncertain economic movements and continuous budget restructuring has been accompanied by a series of challenges and risks which require intensive short-term management and fast adaptations. 

THE CROATIAN ARMED FORCES **LONG−TERM DEVELOPMENT PLAN** 2015 − 2024

## Principles Of The Armed Forces Development

In the planning period defined in this Plan, the Armed Forces will be organized according to the following principles:
- Strategic Coherence: the development of Defense Capabilities will ensure readiness to respond to present and future threats and security challenges. 

- Focus on Capabilities: Taking into account threat diversity and risks resulting from the complexity of the Security environment, the Armed Forces should have capabilities required for the execution of various types of operations and activities - the ones resulting from their basic Constitutional role and commitments assumed under Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty; Crisis Response Operations outside the territory of the Republic of Croatia that contribute to international security and stability; activities for providing assistance to civilian institutions and population, that is, various kinds of Humanitarian Operations at home and abroad.

- Flexibility: The Armed Forces will undergo continuous adjustments and transformation in accordance with the complexity of Security environment.

- Competence Based Approach: 
Human resources of the Armed Forces will be continuously strengthened as well as the institutional prerequisites for the professional development of the members of the Armed Force based on competencies.

# Ii. Development Vision

![14_Image_0.Png](14_Image_0.Png)

## The Misssion Of The Armed Forces

In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia, there are three missions of the Armed Forces: the Defense of the Republic of Croatia and its Allies, the contribution to international security and support to civil institutions. 

The defense of territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence, and the defense of Allies is a primary mission of the Croatian Armed Forces. Therefore, the Armed Forces should be ready: 
to deter, halt and reject, independently, and with the help of the Allies, the armed aggression on the Republic of Croatia; contribute to the Defense of the Allies in the operations pertinent to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty and to protect the sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia on land, at sea and in air. Contribution to International Security is a mission of the Armed Forces through which they contribute to international security and to the creation and maintenance of the most suitable international environment. This is accomplished by participation in Peace Support Operations, Defense Diplomacy and Arms Control, Disarmament and Prevention of Proliferation of Weapons. 

Support to Civil Institutions is a mission in which the Armed Forces provide assistance to civil institutions and population in the Crisis Management process and in dealing with different types of risks and threats of a non-military nature. This support is accomplished through the support to the Police and other state bodies, as well as through the support in Protection and Rescue, and the support to civil society. 

## Vision Of The Armed Forces

At the end of the development period covered within the Long Term Development Plan, the Armed Forces will be managed, well trained, and equipped, capable and ready to carry out the defined missions and tasks. Imbued with patriotism and faced with the requirements of the 21st century, radically different from the previous ones, the military profession will develop in accordance with the principles of high professionalism, expertise and social responsibility.

The Armed Forces are not only the instrument for implementing missions and tasks, but also one of the key elements and an indicator of the identity of state and society. Established in the Homeland War, with a high social reputation based on the successful, historically significant mission of defending and liberating the country, they will with the provision of adequate resources, continue to be one of the fundamental pillars of security, stability and development of the society.

The Armed Forces will be developed as an important integral element of the overall potentials of the state, and one of the indicators of integration of modern Croatian 

![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png) society into contemporary European and global developmental trends. 

Their activity will continuously confirm the social role, commitment of the country to the Alliance and to the values underlying the European and Euro-Atlantic community. 

Extending the traditional role of the military in modern environment and the increasing complexity of conditions in which its engagement is taking place have not reduced but rather increased the demands and the complexity of military vocation. 

In addition, the economic crisis has significantly slowed down the development processes and did prevent the allocation of social resources to the Defense Sector from being in line with its role in a significantly changed environment. 

The development of the Armed Forces in such circumstances is not based on the growth of the Defense Budget3 taken out of the social context, but on rationalization and effectiveness of the management processes. Development of the Armed Forces, together with the necessary budget funds, underlines that ideas and visions could mitigate and partly compensate for the lack of resources. Development of the Armed Forces is based not only on new weapons and military equipment but on personnel too. Investment into personnel, their education, overall care and improvement of their working and living conditions is a presumption of making the vision of their development real.

## Key Long−Term Goals Of The Armed Forces Development

Development of the Armed Forces, based on such elaborated vision, will be focused on the accomplishment of the following key Long term goals:
1. Building of the Armed Forces capabilities for effective engagement in current and future theater of operations.

2. Optimizing the strength and structure of the Armed Forces and increasing the effectiveness of the management process, Command and Control.

3. Credible and consistent activities in terms of the system of Collective Defense and arrangements within the EU Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) and the UN Peacekeeping Missions.

4. Developing the Armed Forces as an organization based on competencies and imbued with social accountability.

5. Strengthening the capacity for the implementation of non-military tasks at home and abroad that include providing assistance to civil institutions and population in Crisis Management and Crisis Response Operations, in cases of accidents, disasters and catastrophes, Humanitarian Operations, Search and Rescue operations on land, at sea and in the air, that is, those capabilities foreseen for civil-military dual use.

3 According to the regulations for the elaboration of the State Budget in the Republic of Croatia, the official term for the "defense budget" is the Financial Plan of the Ministry of the Defense.

# Iii. Level Of Ambition

![16_Image_0.Png](16_Image_0.Png)

The Republic of Croatia refers to the defense against the armed aggression in terms of Article 5 of North Atlantic Treaty. 

In the defense of sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Republic of Croatia will use all available forces and resources including development of its own Armed Forces and accepting the Allied forces up to the required level. In defending the Allies, the Armed Forces will participate primarily with capabilities that have been developed within NATO Defense Planning framework as well as with the other available forces.

The Republic of Croatia will develop the Armed Forces whose primary mission will be the defend sovereignty and territorial integrity and to maintain capabilities for initial response to a potential armed aggression and acceptance of Allied forces in conducting Collective Defense on the national territory. With this purpose, up to 20000 members of the Assigned Reserve will be posted to the Reserve Armed Forces together with corresponding weapons and equipment. The mechanisms of activating Mobilization Reserve, together with reactivating Compulsory Military Service will ensure the growth of the forces up to the level required for the successful counter potential armed aggression on the national territory. 

The Republic of Croatia will develop capabilities for sustainable participation in operations abroad with up to 1000 Armed Forces members. The required Defense Budget funding will be planned for the participation in operations with up to 200 Armed Forces members while the funding of the possible participation above the stated number will be provided outside of the Defense Budget. 

The Republic of Croatia will keep on contributing with its forces to the NATO Response Forces (NRF) and European Union Battle Groups (EU BG). Overall declared forces of the Republic of Croatia for the NATO Response Forces will make up to 1% 
of the NATO Immediate Response Forces (IRF).4 Within the Immediate Response Forces, the Armed Forces will participate contributing with a Company-size unit of a Mechanized infantry or equivalent forces. 

The Armed Forces will participate with declared forces within the NATO Response Forces Pool (RFP). In addition to the ambition to contribute in filling in the share of the NATO Command Structure, the Republic of Croatia will continuously join the NATO Force Structure. Parallel to this, the Republic of Croatia remains open to joining forces through other initiatives and multilateral arrangements beyond the framework of NATO and EU, especially in the regional environment. Participation in the EU BG will range from a significant contribution in the time span 4 The Immediate Response Forces (IRF) are part of NATO Response Forces. Their size is up to 13,000 members of the land, air and naval forces. The Armed Forces will participate with up to 130 members or the equivalent of a maneuver company.

of every three to four years (up to 300 Armed Forces members), to lesser contributions to combat groups within these intervals. Additionally, participation in NRF and EU BG, does not exclude the possibility of joining other multinational formations intended for Immediate Response to crisis situations. Contribution to missions and operations under the auspices of the United Nations will be provided through appropriate participation of units, teams and individual members. By the end of 2018, the Land forces will be capable of sending sustainable forces of a Combat group size within Mechanized battalion to the Peace Support Operations. In order to achieve this level of ambition, the Land forces will be developed in a way that 50% of total Land forces is structured, trained and equipped for participation in Peace Support Operations, and 10% of forces are sustainable in operations. Naval forces will develop capabilities to protect sovereignty and to control and protect legal rights and interests of the Republic of Croatia at sea. In the first part of the planning period, the capabilities for the execution of traditional naval tasks will remain at the existing level. Their further development will be planned for the period after the year 2017. Although the focus will be on the execution of tasks at the Adriatic Sea, naval forces will continue to develop capabilities in NATO, EU and UN operations outside the Adriatic as well. Naval forces will improve their capabilities of control and protection of legal rights and interests of the Republic of Croatia at sea in cooperation with other state bodies and Allies relying upon the development of Coastal patrol boats and capabilities 

![17_image_0.png](17_image_0.png) of creating integrated picture of the naval situation at the Adriatic Sea. In addition to the mentioned capabilities, naval forces will develop capabilities of counter-mine activities, capabilities for the protection of merchant ships from piracy and criminal activities during navigation and capabilities for naval interception.

In the process of developing capabilities of the naval forces, NATO and the EU Maritime Strategy will be taken into consideration in an appropriate manner. 

Capability of controlling and protecting the airspace of the Republic of Croatia within NATO Integrated Air and Missile Defense System (NATINAMDS) will be accomplished primarily by existing combat aircrafts until the end of the resource lifecycle, with the support of Surveillance, Command and Control System. By the end of 2016, the possibilities to retain this capability will be determined, including a multinational approach to its maintenance or abandonment of certain elements of this capability and searching for the solution within the Collective Defense of NATO. 

By 2018, the Air Forces will have capabilities to deploy helicopter forces (up to eight medium transport helicopters) for Peace Support Operations, sustainable for six months (without rotation). They will be capable of sending and maintaining helicopter forces up to the size of four mid transport helicopters on rotation basis. In order to accomplish the Level of Ambition, the Air Forces will be developed in a way that 40% of total Air Forces are structured, trained and equipped for participation in Peace Support Operations, and 8% of the forces will be sustainable in Peace Support Operations. In the process of developing particular capabilities, the Republic of Croatia will join the initiatives within the framework of Allied and Partnership arrangements. At the same time, in certain initiatives, depending on the real possibilities, Croatia will take the leading role. When conducting international operations the Republic of Croatia will focus on Joint forces generated within NATO and the EU. Capabilities of the Armed Forces in assisting civil institutions will be developed through the enhancement of institutional capabilities in the Republic of Croatia that will, by synergy strengthen the resilience of the society to disasters and crisis situations, and will be also used in international Humanitarian Operations. 

Existing capabilities of the Air Forces will be the backbone of maintenance and development of the national capabilities for aerial firefighting.

# Iv. Capabilities Development

![18_Image_0.Png](18_Image_0.Png)

Possessing and developing relevant capabilities is a prerequisite of successful accomplishment of the Armed Forces missions and tasks. Dynamic security environment characterized by series of hardly predictable specific threats and challenges considering form and effectiveness together with a low degree of possibility of a traditional threat by armed aggression, determines the approach to the capability based planning of the Armed Forces development. Successful response to a threat or challenge requires capabilities that are tailored and built with regards to types and the nature of threats or challenges and act accordingly. Since the acquiring of the capabilities is accomplished by means of organization and other elements of capabilities5, the requirements that define the capabilities direct all aspects of organization and development of the Armed Forces. 

Capabilities that the Armed Forces should possess and develop are to be considered through seven main areas:
1. Prepare, 2. Communications, command and control (C3),

# V. Armed Forces Organization And Structure

The Armed Forces restructuring is conducted through reorganization that will result in more efficient Command Structure, decentralization of the Command System and will also improve management and synchronization of processes, through improvements in development and employment of capabilities, planning balance and resource rationalization. The ultimate goal is to maintain more operational, highlytrained and well-equipped Armed Forces that are smaller in size, but able to carry out all assigned missions and tasks. The Armed Forces will be organized into headquarters, commands, units, institutions and other organizational units, and with regard to their role and functions, they will be clearly divided into two components - Operational and Institutional component. The Armed Forces operational component will be composed of organizational units that will be organized and prepared to implement combat and non-combat operations (Operational Commands, Guard Brigades, Flotilla and Croatian Coast Guard, Air Force, Special Operations Forces Command, etc.). The Armed Forces Institutional Component will be composed of organizational units whose purpose is to build capabilities or support capability building of the Operational Component (Support Commands, Military Schools, Training Centers, Service Units, etc.). In the following period the Armed Forces will implement reorganization measures in order to downsize their administrative and command structure in relation to the operational forces. Through functional integration or separation of organizational units, the Armed Forces will consolidate and/or establish new organizational units, create a more efficient command structure and achieve decentralization of the command system. 

Special Operations Battalion will be reorganized into the Special Operations Forces Command in order to fulfill the commitment to improve capabilities to conduct special operations. Croatian Army Military Police Regiment (Land Forces) and Military Police platoons 
(the Croatian Navy, Air Force and Air Defense) will be reorganized and combined into a single General Staff sub-staff unit. The Personnel Management Center will be extracted from the Support Command unit. It will be reorganized as a General Staff sub-staff unit. 

Figure 1:

![24_image_1.png](24_image_1.png) CAF Organizational Structure The Croatian Army Signal Regiment will 

![24_image_0.png](24_image_0.png)

be reorganized as a General Staff substaff unit and redesigned as the Center for Communication and Information Systems. Signal Battalion will become a subordinate unit under the command of the Army Commander. 

The Center for Electronic Reconnaissance as a General Staff sub-staff unit and a part of the Croatian Army Military Intelligence Battalion will be reorganized and combined into a General Staff sub-staff unit redesigned as the Intelligence Operations Center. The remainder of the Croatian Army Military Intelligence Battalion will be reorganized and become a part of the Guard Brigade Military Intelligence Companies. 

By the end of 2017 the reorganized Armed Forces will comprise up to 15,000 employees and up to 400 military Cadets.

The current Branch and Service structure of the Armed Forces will be basically retained, apart from downsizing and organizational changes referred to above. The Armed Forces will consist of the Croatian Army (CA), Croatian Navy (CN), Croatian Air Force and Air Defense (CAF&AD), Croatian Defense Academy (CDA), Support Command (SC), Special Operations Forces Command (SOFCOM), Court Martial (CM), 
Military Representations (MRs) and the following Sub-Staff Units (SSUs):
- Intelligence Operations Center (IOC),
- Military Police Regiment (MPR), - Honor Guard Battalion (HGB),
- Center for Communication and Information Systems (CCIS),
- Personnel Management Center (PMC) - CAF General Staff Support Unit (CAF GS 
SU). 

## Armed Forces Structure

Based on the findings and recommendations of the Strategic Defense Review, the Armed Forces Organizational Structure will be formed as shown in Figure 1. CAF General Staff (CAF GS) is a joint body of the Croatian Armed Forces organized within the Ministry of Defense. It has a responsibility to prepare command, use and employ the Armed Forces. 

CAF Service Commands have a responsibility to enable the functioning of the CAF 

![25_image_0.png](25_image_0.png) Services and to prepare subordinate commands and units to carry out their tasks. 

Service commands participate in professional development and have a responsibility to provide training for Active Duty and Reserve personnel. 

Croatian Defense Academy (CDA) provides military education for Armed Forces requirements. It is responsible for conducting scientific research and publishing activities. 

Support Command (SC) provides continued logistics, medical and other support to CAF commands and units when executing their tasks at home and abroad. It also provides functional training to CAF members in the field of Logistics. 

Special Operations Forces Command 
(SOFCOM) plans and conducts special operations and activities in order to support and protect national interests. The Special Operations Forces Command will be responsible for training and equipping Special Operations Forces, doctrine development and it will also coordinate preparations for Special Operations training. Military Representations (MRs) represent the Croatian Armed Forces and perform other professional tasks related to participation in the activities and supervision of different Boards, Working Groups, Standing and Interim bodies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union, the Allied Command Operations (ACO) and the Allied Command Transformation (ACT). 

Court Martial (MC) represents an autonomous and independent body who decides on disciplinary liability of CAF members for committing a disciplinary offence and material liability of CAF members. It will consist of General Court Martial in Zagreb and District Courts Martial in Osijek and Split. 

Sub-Staff Units are established for the purpose of developing capabilities to carry out different tasks and support activities that other CAF components, due to its specificity or scope, cannot provide within their organic entities.

## Caf General Staff

Croatian Armed Forces General Staff will be organized into the following organizational units shown in Figure 2.

The Chief of the General Staff is the Head of the CAF General Staff. He is superior to commands, units and institutions of the Armed Forces, the Croatian Military Representative to NATO and the EU as part of the Permanent Representation of Croatia to NATO, the Croatian National Military Figure 2: The CAF General Staff structure Representative to Allied Command Operations (ACO) and the Allied Command

Figure 3: The CAF General Staff Sub-Staff Units Further development of functional areas 

![27_image_0.png](27_image_0.png)

will result in the development of a Functional Management Model that will enable Chiefs of the General Staff Directorates who are responsible for certain functional areas to serve as commanders of the General Staff Sub-Staff units that are responsible for task execution in the particular functional area. This model will enable a reduction in the number of executive command functions. 

## The General Staff Sub-Staff Units

The General Staff Sub-Staff units will be organized into the following organizational units shown in Figure 3. Intelligence Operations Center will continue to conduct strategic electronic surveillance for the purposes of Security and Intelligence Agencies of the Republic of Croatia in accordance with the Security and Intelligence System Act, and will provide joint intelligence support to the Croatian Armed Forces in carrying out peacetime tasks and in the execution of combat and non-combat operations. It will also provide training and professional development of the CAF Military Intelligence branch. Military Police Regiment will carry out military police tasks in the Croatian Ministry of Defense and the Croatian Armed Forces. The Military Police Regiment will provide protection of personnel, facilities and property of great importance to the CAF and the Croatian MOD, and undertake preventive and repressive measures to prevent acts against military discipline and breach of duty. It will also conduct criminal investigations. The Military Police Regiment will be responsible for the provision of MP training and the development of capabilities for breeding and training service dogs.

## Vi. Human Resources Development

Management of Human Resources is implemented through four areas: Admission, Professional Development, Personnel Support, Transition and Separation of Personnel.

## Situation In The Area Of Human Resources

One of the main characteristics of the area of Human Potentials is harmonization of the personnel structure aimed to create an optimal ratio of officers, NCOs and Soldiers/Seamen in addition to downsizing the number of civil employees. 

Planned admission provides for gradual improvement of the age structure of the Active Duty military personnel. 

Obligatory conscription has been suspended since the year 2008 and Voluntary conscription has been established. However, the annual number of voluntary conscripts (from 500 to 800) is significantly smaller compared to the planned (2000), primarily due to the insufficient funds.

| TOTAL:          | 17,450     | 1,386    | 5  | 18,841 |

A new personnel category of Military Specialists has been introduced through the system in early 2014 whereas Contract and Mobilization Reserve are being established. 

The system of Deployment to International Operations and appointments to duties abroad has been established at satisfactory level. 

The portion of female officers in Active Duty military composition has reached the targeted strength of 10% (on June 1, 2014 a total of 10.34%, female officers 15.66%, female NCOs 11.27%, and female Soldiers 5.71% respectively).

Designated strength of the Armed forces amounts to a total of 17,504 Active Duty military personnel and 1,905 civil employees. The real strength as of January 1, 2014 is shown in the following table. 

## Direction Of Human Resources Development Targeted Personnel Strength And Structure

Total targeted strength of the Armed Forces is 15,000 employees (Active Duty military personnel and Civil employees) and up to 400 Cadets by the end 2017. Of the stated number there will be 14,380 Active Duty military personnel and 620 civil employees. By the end of the year 2020 a ratio from 1: 3 to 1: 5 should be THE CROATIAN ARMED FORCES **LONG−TERM DEVELOPMENT PLAN** 2015 − 2024

reached compared to the total number of the NCOs and Soldiers at the level of the Armed Forces. 

Within the category of Active Duty military personnel a newly established subcategory of Military Specialists will be fully developed. Their career will be regulated by separate regulations and a special system of salaries will be established for them. This way the need to staff especially demanding positions with experts will be solved.

In the first part of the planning period up to 2,000 conscripts annually will undergo voluntary military training for the purpose of manning Active Duty personnel positions and Assigned Reserve. That number will be increased respectively as required for manning Active Duty component and Assigned Reserve. With the aim to provide for manning Active Duty military composition with officers, up to 400 Cadets will receive education at the CDA study programs in accordance with requirements of the Branches and Services of the Armed Forces. 

Table 4: Planned personnel strength of the Armed Forces on December 31, 2017

## Reserve Component Of The

![48_Image_0.Png](48_Image_0.Png) Armed Forces

Active Duty composition of the Armed Forces will exist in peacetime and in war and it will form the basis for growth of the Forces. Reserve component will be formed of the Contract and Mobilization Reserve that will provide for growth of the Forces. Part of the Active Duty military personnel will be deployed to additional duties, fulfilling the key organizational positions in Reserve units in conformity with the Wartime Formation. 

Contracted reserve will fulfill insufficient Military-Occupational Specialties that are not adequate or cost-effective for organization in Active Duty composition. A part of the Contract Reserve members will be assigned to organizational positions in Reserve units, as required. 

Mobilization Reserve will be formed of the Assigned and Non-assigned reserve.

Assigned reserve will be formed of the conscripts assigned to Military Occupational Specialty, after conscription, voluntary military training or Active Duty military service. 

Non-assigned Reserve members will be listed in military records and in the case of required development of Defense Capabilities; they will have to undergo medical examinations and evaluation of their capability for military service. They will also be able to enter Active Duty military service. Engagement of the Reserve component will result in growth of the overall Defense Capabilities of the Armed Forces to conduct missions and tasks at home and abroad. 

Contracted and Assigned reserve members will be evaluated during training and execution of duties and will be upgraded or rather promoted to higher rank. A special concept of military education will be developed for Contracted and Assigned Reserve members (for candidates for Reserve Officers and NCOs, for Reserve Officers and NCOs, as well as for more demanding Military Occupational Specialties). 

For requirements of the Reserve Component, the Armed Forces will keep/store weapons and equipment. 

## Contracted Reserve

Contract Reserve will number up to 1,000 members, and for the most part it will comprise of organizational positions for specific Military Occupational Specialties indispensable for conduct of operations that, for some particular reasons, are not suitable for manning Active Duty military component of the Armed Forces. These will mainly be highly specialized medical personnel for ROLE-2 and other person-

![48_image_1.png](48_image_1.png)

Figure 12: Organizational chart of the Assigned Reserve.

nel, as required. Top sportsmen will be included in Contracted Reserve. 

Recruitment of the Contracted Reserve will be carried out for requirements of the Armed Forces. Upon selection, the Ministry of Defense will sign a contract with Contracted Reserve that will regulate rights and duties of the Contracted Reserve member. Appropriate compensation will be given to Contracted Reserve members in conformity with the signed contract. 

Training of the Contracted Reserve members will be organized and exercised in the Armed Forces and Contracted Reserve will participate in the organizational structure of the Armed Forces units, in missions and tasks at home and abroad. 

## Assigned Reserve

Assigned Reserve will be formed of the draftees who underwent training for Military Occupational Specialty during conscription, voluntary military training, in Active Duty military service or through some other forms of in-service training. Of the total number of Assigned Reserve members, 20,000 of them will be assigned to Reserve Units (Infantry, Artillery, Air Defense and Logistics regiments, Engineering and Signal Battalions) deployed to the territory of the Republic of Croatia. 

Training of the Assigned Reserve will be organized and exercised in the Armed Forces. Together with other organizational units of the Armed Forces, Assigned Reserve will participate in conduct of the missions and tasks in our country. 

## Non-Assigned Reserve 

![49_Image_0.Png](49_Image_0.Png)

Non-assigned Reserve will be formed of draftees listed in military records (who were not conscripts and did not undergo voluntary training). Only in the case of the required growth of the Armed Forces, their capabilities will be evaluated; they will undergo training and enter Active Duty military service. 

Calling up of the Non-assigned Reserve will be carried out when professional composition and Assigned Reserve would not be sufficient to conduct missions and tasks in our country. Non-assigned Reserve will take part in conduct of the missions and tasks of the Armed Forces in our country. It will not be organized within mobilization-development of the Armed Forces nor will organizational positions of the Non-assigned Reserve be shown in Organizational Structure of the units and commands of the Armed Forces. 

## Improvements Personnel Management

Based on the analysis of the existing organizational framework and competences in Personnel Management, a more efficient and more simplified business processes and intensified procedures will be established in order to eliminate overlaps. 

Management of civilian and military personnel will be improved by introduction of the Long-Term Personnel Planning based on available financial resources and on principles of equal opportunities and on clearly established standards and incentives for Professional Development. 

Consistent, measurable and transparent criteria of advancement and retention in service will be established and applied as well as efficient protection from violation of individual rights. Career advancement of Active Duty military personnel will be harmonized with requirements of the future strength and structure of the Armed Forces. Participation in Allied and other international operations will become an inseparable part of professional obligations and requirements. Instead of the previous voluntary nature of participation, future participation will be determined by the requirements of the Service. 

## Goals Of Human Resources 

![50_Image_0.Png](50_Image_0.Png) Management Areas Personnel Recruitment

A combined model will be retained for manning Officer's duties. This model presents a combination of the modified and upgraded ''Cadet'' model, granting scholarships in support of lacking Services and Occupations, admission from labor market, admission among employees from the category of NCOs and contract soldiers/ seamen, education in foreign countries. 

The possibility of contract based admission will also be taken into consideration. Soldiers/seamen will be, as so far, admitted to Contract service and NCOs solely from the ranks of the best soldiers/seamen who served at least one contract.

Standards for professional/contract soldier/seaman will be defined taking into account the heterogeneity of requirements and obligations resulting from missions of individual services of the Armed Forces, operations in international environment and roles of the Armed Forces in society. Stimulating measures will be developed for unavailable, i.e., critical specialties of Active Duty military personnel aimed at more efficient attraction/recruitment and retention in service. A particular status and consideration will be given to the physicians, that is, to a model of attraction and retention that will be established and suitable for requirements of the military system and specific characteristics of the medical profession. Up to 100 NCOs, 350 to 1000 soldiers/
seamen and up to 80 officers will be annually admitted in service. Annual number for admission of Cadets and Contract Reserve will be established according to requirements for individual occupations and capacities of education. The number of conscripts will be up to 2,000 annually with increase in the second part of the planning period for the manning purposes of the Active Duty military composition and Assigned Reserve. Personnel who underwent military training or have given up Active Duty military service will enter Assigned Reserve on annual basis, and an equal number will be discharged. Exceptionally, a minimal number of candidates for officer and NCO duties of military specialists will be admitted directly from labor market and this will apply also to civil employees. 

## Professional Development

Professional Development of Active Duty military personnel during their service will be based on training and education, carrying out of duty, and continuous life-long learning and self-development. Educational system will be harmonized with national educational standards and with NATO recommendations. Advancement in service will be based on acquiring new knowledge and skills that will be evaluated, on building and maintaining capabilities that are necessary for carrying out duties at higher level. The existing system of Military-occupational specialties will be upgraded in support of development.

Personnel Support Particular attention will be paid to quality of living and the implementation of specific measures in the area of Support to Readiness, Welfare and Recreation of the members of the Armed Forces and protection of their rights. That will contribute to attracting and retaining quality-personnel as well as development and maintenance of appropriate organizational culture that should be monitored and systematically built. In the forthcoming period, in the area of Personnel Support projects will be implemented with the aim to provide for conditions that can guarantee retention and attraction of quality, qualified and motivated personnel. The existing systems of selection, monitoring the state of personnel and support will be improved and upgraded, respecting medical, psychological and physical requirements and its scientific and professional foundation. 

Through direct cooperation with Religious communities/unions and on the basis of signed Agreements, the implementation of the policy of openness in the area of spiritual guidance will continue, ensuring the freedom of religious expression and realization of the members' spiritual needs. 

## Health Care

![51_Image_0.Png](51_Image_0.Png)

Health care of the employees of the Ministry of Defense and members of the Armed Forces will be developed within the integral Health Care System of the Republic of Croatia and will be implemented through the system of Medical Support as part of the comprehensive system of logistics support of the Armed Forces. Military Health Centre of the Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces, as a military health institution, will provide health care to employees of the Ministry of Defense and members of the Armed Forces at primary level. Health care of the employees of the Ministry of Defense and members of the Armed Forces not provided by capacities of the Armed Forces will be provided by the Public Health Service or through the network of Occupational Medicine physicians in the Republic of Croatia.

In operations abroad, Health Care of the members of the Armed Forces shall be provided and implemented through their own system of medical support and will also relay on Allied forces and their capabilities, based on contracts and technical agreements. 

## Transition And Separation Of Personnel

The specificity and complexity of the military service will be followed by solutions that provide Active Duty military personnel retirement under the special conditions, which should go side by side with quality preparation for leaving the service, while respecting the principles of equality and fairness. 

In order to achieve the strength of the Armed Forces of 15,000 employees and up to 400 Cadets that was also planned in the Strategic Defense Review from the year 2013, the planned downsizing has already begun in the year 2014. Within this downsizing about 4,200 Active Duty military personnel and 1,500 civil employees will be separated by the end of 2017. Separation of civil employees will be mostly carried out through outsourcing of the jobs of Supply and Maintenance of military locations and structures and Logistic services in barracks. 

The program for preparation of the personnel for separation will be further developed. The program of transition and separation of the Contract Soldiers/Seamen who will be discharged from military service after one, two or three contracts will be developed. Moreover, special program of transition of civil employees will be taken into consideration.

VII. EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
Demands placed before the Armed Forces and the entire Defense Sector involve training of the personnel for undertaking actions in the new and increasingly complex circumstances, intricate/complicated Defense and Security structures and new technologies. Therefore, training of the new and in-service training of the existing personnel in the field of Defense and Security is of primary importance. Having in mind the vision of the Armed Forces where the military profession is being developed in accordance with the high professional principle, expertise and social responsibility, education for the needs of the Armed Forces and the Defense Sector respectively, as well as activities within the Science Sector -represent the core areas of the Long Term Development Plan. This Plan is oriented towards increasing the quality of military education at all levels and categories of personnel. However, the capability to execute various programs of training has already been developed to a great extent, as e.g., Military-Occupational Training of NCOs and soldiers, various forms of functional training, learning foreign languages, etc., and the emphasis is placed on activities within higher level of education and science for requirements of the Armed Forces and the Defense Sector. 

## Higher Military Education And Science

In the period comprised within this Plan, higher education for defense requirements will be transformed. This process will be implemented in three phases:
1. The first phase will establish Undergraduate university study programs within Croatian Defense Academy, in cooperation with and in conformity with regulations that govern the Scientific Sector and higher education in the Republic of Croatia or rather Bologna Process. The academic year 2014/2015 begun with the implementation of two Undergraduate Study programs - Military Engineering and THE CROATIAN ARMED FORCES **LONG−TERM DEVELOPMENT PLAN** 2015 − 2024

![54_image_0.png](54_image_0.png)

Military Leadership and Management that will include the current program of Basic Officer Education. Afterwards, two Undergraduate Study programs for requirements of the Croatian Navy will be established (Military Nautical Science and Military Marine Engineering), and one Undergraduate Study for requirements of the Croatian Air Force and Air Defense (Military Aerospace Engineering). Development of these programs would place emphasis on development of Basic Military Competencies and adoption of the Officer's Code of Conduct by future Officers. Through the influence and contribution of the educative component of the Program, Officers will be prepared to respond to future challenges of the security environment.

2. In the second phase, also in cooperation with the University community, study programs at Undergraduate level will be established. They will comprise the current program of inter service Command and Staff education and Military Occupational Specialty education for Officers in functional area, and programs at Post-graduate level that will comprise the former program of strategic education (War College). These study programs will be established in the year 2018. 

3. In the third phase, by the year 2020 at the latest, higher education for defense requirements at the Petar Zrinski CDA will be institutionalized, i.e., Croatian Defense Academy as an institution of higher level education and scientificresearch institution organized in conformity with regulations governing higher education and scientific activities in the Republic of Croatia.

This process will be followed by further investments that will upgrade the standard of living and work of the students at all levels of education. Selection and education of the teaching cadre represents the key element for implementation of all study programs, stimulation for earning higher academic degrees, selection to scientific-teaching and teaching professions and creating conditions to retain scientific-teaching cadre within Defense Sector. 

Programs of Education and Training with other governmental bodies will concurrently be developed, focused on achieving capability for common response to challenges and threats, joint participation in operations and assistance to civilian institutions.

In addition to meeting the defense needs and to ensure the high-quality, also the mobility of the personnel from military environment to civilian and vice versa is being achieved in this manner. Higher level of education for Defense requirements should be organized in a way to provide training to future officers of the Croatian Armed Forces and more broadly, for experts in the Ministry of Defense and other government bodies whose activities are related to Defense and National Security, researchers in scientific research institutions and research institutions who conduct research in the field of Defense, and other entities outside the State administration system. Furthermore, partner relations with educational institutions in other countries, primarily with NATO and the EU will be developed. These will provide for acquiring new knowledge, skills and capabilities that will contribute to more efficient development of the Armed Forces and fulfillment of their basic missions and assignments. 

Institutionalization of education for Defense and Security requirements according to principles that govern scientific activities and higher level of education in the 

![56_image_0.png](56_image_0.png)

Republic of Croatia has created presumptions for a greater degree of integration and compatibility with NATO institutions and programs, harmonization with standards of the Bologna Process and use of NATO and EU resources. In the recent years NATO has undertaken important steps directed towards harmonization of the education and training in educational institutions of the NATO 
member and Partner countries with standards of the Bologna Process. 

The goal of these processes is to improve quality in education and training, as well as confidence and transparency, both among the states and within the states between the Armed Forces and society.

Harmonization of the education for Defense requirements in NATO member states with Bologna Process presumes that Defense educational institutions are integrated in scientific-educational systems of their countries. Attainment of the goals of this Plan provides for efficient application of the mechanisms developed to upgrade the quality of education, enable mobility of students and teachers and contribute to mutual confidence. Examples of such mechanisms are represented by:
- ERASMUS, educational program of the European Union for promotion of mobility of the European students and professors that has become a core factor in internationalization and 'Europeanization' of higher education in European Union.

- European Initiative for Exchange of Young Officers Inspired by Erasmus Program ("Military Erasmus") - a concept aimed at improving quality of education and training of the military personnel in the EU 
member countries. As a general goal of the *"Military Erasmus"* prominence is given to increased interoperability among European Armed Forces, development of the Common Security culture and sharing of same values. 

- European Defense Agency (EDA) with numerous programs that include educational component.

- European Security and Defense College 
(ESDC) as a platform for connecting and networking of the institutions of higher level education for Defense and Security requirements of member states.

- *NATO Security through Science Programme* that contributes to security, stability and solidarity by application of science in problem solving. 

- NATO concept of the Centers of Excellence that provides for development of expert opinions in areas that are of core importance for the Alliance, and in which a single nation can give its most visible contribution. 

Scientific-research activity (work) will be primarily developed within Croatian Defense Academy. Strengthening scientific-
THE CROATIAN ARMED FORCES **LONG−TERM DEVELOPMENT PLAN** 2015 − 2024

teaching potentials concurrently develops the capability of implementation of the study programs, as well as the capability of conducting scientific-research activity, particularly in areas of special interest, such as military technology, strategy research and military history. 

In the other segment, Scientific and Research activities will enhance the development of the functions of articulating directions and the need for Research and Development, whereas implementation will be provided in cooperation with research potentials of the civilian sector. Cooperation will be established with scientific institutions within their scope of work and activities during implementation of Research and Development projects needed in Defense field. They will contribute to development of the studies and expert opinions. Research and development for defense requirements will be directed toward a specific purpose and in support of development of the core capabilities. 

## Lifelong Education And

![57_Image_0.Png](57_Image_0.Png) Military Vocational Training

Acquiring competencies should be a continuous process, made relevant through activities of all forms of learning during life time and aimed to upgrade knowledge, skills, independence and responsibility for professional, social and personal requirements. Development of an individual during his/her working life in the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces should be, not only in function of upgrading overall capabilities, but also in acquiring competence that can be used for the well-being of the entire society. It is possible that an individual acquires competencies and continues to develop at the end of his/her military career through use of supportive Transition programs.

Requirements for implementation of military education in support of professional development, particularly officer's, are significantly greater than the present capacities. Therefore, the level of capabilities necessary to increase the level needed for enhancement of the present educational capacities will be continually developed. For requirements of manning Reserve units in the later planning period, education of Reserve officers and NCOs will be initiated.

Learning foreign languages will be intensified, both within capacities of the Armed Forces (Foreign Language Centre, Foreign Languages Training in units), and through civilian capacities. Equipping units with multimedia language classrooms will also be continued.

Validation of the Training efficiency in comparison to operational/working requirements will be carried out on regular basis.

# Viii. Training And Doctrine

## Training

Training in the Armed forces will be implemented on the single doctrinal principles, regardless of whether it is training for execution of tasks in our country or for participation in international Peace Support Operations, and it will focus towards development and maintenance of the capabilities of professional composition and for practice of the Reserve as a basis for growth of the Forces. Training priorities in this planning period will be put on development and maintenance of the capabilities for defense of the national territory and implementation of the NATO Capability Targets in order to ensure capabilities for participation in on-going operations and to maintain the Level of Ambition regarding participation of the deployable forces in NRF and EUBG 
and other UN/NATO/EU forces. Interoperability and development of the operational capabilities aimed to ensure elements of Combat Readiness for possible operations have remained the main training objectives. Interoperability will be achieved through joint training and exercises with Allies and declared forces will join NATO 
components and formations. Special emphasis will be placed on participation of the members and units of the Armed forces in various forms of multinational training and practice at all levels. These will provide intellectual, procedural and technical interoperability and cohesion with Allied forces.

Training will have an important role in support to multinational and regional cooperation. Stability and good neighborly relations will be strengthened through training, by focusing on support to countries from the Region that expressed interest in joining into NATO and/or EU, 
passing on their own experiences. Focus will also be placed on development of the capabilities to provide support to civilian institutions in natural, technical and technological disasters.

## Development Of The Training System And Improvement Of Training Infrastructure

The organization, contents, standards and methodology of implementing training will be affected by reform of the Armed Forces, application of modern techniques and technologies that are being introduced gradually and by establishment of Reserve composition training. New training programs will be developed in conformity with tactical-technical requirements of the new equipment and contemporary tactics, techniques and procedures. Further development and adoption of new methods and equipping with new training 

![60_image_0.png](60_image_0.png) assets (simulators, simulations, modern shooting ranges, drill grounds and other training facilities) will reduce training costs. However, high level of realism and challenge will be retained. Capabilities that are not cost-effective or do not have relevance of being developed or maintained independently, will be developed within NATO initiatives and projects and in cooperation with partners.

For the purpose of development of capabilities of the Armed Forces, the projects of equipping, modernization and construction will be aimed towards development of the training infrastructure and procurement of training aids and assets, mainly simulators and simulation systems. Drill grounds and shooting ranges will be built for individual and joint training up to the level of platoon/company for weapons/firearms handling. 

Barracks will also be equipped with labs and training simulators. Conditions will be created for distance learning aimed to accelerate gaining of new knowledge and skills and faster exchange of information. Equipping and modernization projects of the training infrastructure will be developed as a integral part of the development projects for the barracks and military training areas, taking into account the type, kind and required operational capabilities of the units. Projects will also include requests for development of the training infrastructure that are based on Allied documents and international agreements.

## Individual Training

The goal of individual training will be training for a prompt and qualified inclusion in unit's training at all levels, integration of gained knowledge and skills into multibranch training and taking over the role of trainers. It is expected of each individual to adapt to technological progress and changes in security environment. The focus of individual training will be training aimed at gaining personal Military-Occupational Specialty.

Manning of the Armed Forces that is based on voluntary principle enables training with motivated personnel and an easier achievement of the training goals. Basic military training will be exercised through voluntary training for all categories of military personnel. The goal of conducting voluntary military training is to gain basic military knowledge and skills and to improve physical and psychological readiness for service in the Armed Forces. Training for personal Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) will be organized in the following manner:
- Branch Specialty Training of the Croatian Army will be organized in centers THE CROATIAN ARMED FORCES **LONG−TERM DEVELOPMENT PLAN** 2015 − 2024

![60_image_1.png](60_image_1.png)

and branch units of the Croatian Army,
- Branch Specialty Training and specialties of the Croatian Navy within technical service will be conducted at the Navy Training Centre,
- Branch Specialty Training and technical service of the Croatian Air Force and Air Defense will be carried out in the Air Force Training Centre,
- for acquiring Military Occupational Specialty of the Support services and occupations, logistics training will be organized in the Logistics Training and Doctrine Center,
- for acquiring Military Occupational Specialty of the Signal branch, training will be organized in the CIS Centre and at the Signal Battalion of the Croatian Army,
- for acquiring Military Occupational Specialty of the Military-Intelligence branch, training will be organized in the Centre for Intelligence Operations 
- for acquiring Military Occupational Specialty of the MP branch training will be organized in the Military Police Regiment. 

Centers and branch units that conduct individual training for acquiring MOS in the branches/support services are also responsible for implementing functional courses and other forms of training of Soldiers/Seamen, NCOs and officers for the purpose of their professional development in the branch/support service.

## Collective Training

Collective training (Commander training, Staff training, and unit training) of all levels will be mission focused and based on doctrine and experiences of the present time operations. The goal will be to attain excellence of the unit as a whole and readiness for active participation within the higher level of units. Efficiency of joint training will be provided through further equipping with modern teaching assets and aids, development of training infrastructure at barracks, drill grounds, shooting ranges and training areas and upgraded training for Commander and Staff. An integrated environment will create conditions for realistic evaluation and certification of the units designated for participation in NATO-led operations and exercises. 

## Reserve Training

Training of Reserve units will be managed according to the same standards as training of the professional composition, with the employment of the same doctrine and training process. It will differ only in various degrees of readiness for conduct of the mission. Focus of the Contract Reserve training will be on an individual, or rather refresher training and maintaining of individual capabilities and skills and on pre-deployment training for Peace Support Operations. Individual training of the Assigned Reserve will be focused on refresher training of basic soldier's skills and maintaining of the training for Military Occupational Specialty, especially of the critical ones. Training of the units will be concentrated on firing and tactical tasks of the squads and platoons in addition to conduct of tactical exercises. 

Training of the Non-assigned reserve will be composed according to training phases for development of individual capabilities and skills, mainly basic military skills and training for Military Occupational Specialty.

## Joint Training

Joint training will be oriented towards training of the Commands for planning, conduct and participation in joint operations. Single Commands, units, groups and individuals will be trained and prepared accordingly for efficient planning, organization and participation in joint systems. 

General Staff will lead the joint training in the Armed Forces and it will be carried out through joint exercises. Training Doctrine of the Armed Forces will be revised with the particular emphasis on further decentralization of training.

## Doctrine

![62_Image_2.Png](62_Image_2.Png)

![62_Image_3.Png](62_Image_3.Png)

![62_Image_4.Png](62_Image_4.Png)

![62_Image_5.Png](62_Image_5.Png)

Doctrine represents the doctrinal foundation and fundamental principles of operations and a guide for the military forces in support of national goals. It deals with missions, functions and capabilities and represents a common frame of reference for operations that are conducted or could be conducted in the very near future. Although this doctrine should be seen in its entirety, and not only as a publication alone, in this planning period the emphasis will be placed on doctrinal organization of the entire system that will be obtained through consistent doctrinal hierarchy, from the top to the bottom. This will ensure consistency in using unified terminology and harmonization of doctrinal standpoints at all levels. 

In conformity with defined hierarchy of doctrinal publications, the process of developing Joint, Functional and Service doctrinal publications will continue. This will also apply to publications that, in terms of their content, are aimed at integral understanding of military terms and symbols.

Joint and Service doctrinal publications will describe the use of operational component of the Armed Forces in operations (campaigns, major operations and tactical activities), whereas preparation of the Armed Forces will be standardized through administrative, technical, training and teaching publications. An exception is Training Doctrine that will, although it belongs to the field of preparation of the Armed Forces, be included in doctrine hierarchy due to the commitment that we will conduct training in the manner we conduct operations. 

By the year 2017 Joint and Service doctrinal publications will be prepared - ZDP-1: 
Croatian Armed Forces Doctrine (2nd edition), ZDP-10: Human Resource Management, ZDP-35: Special Operations, ZDP36: Psychological Operations, ZDP-40: Logistics Support Doctrine, ZDP-70: Training, DPM-100: Maritime Doctrine, DPK200: Land Forces Doctrine, ZDP-S: Military Symbols, ZDP-30: Joint Operations, ZDP-50: Operations Planning, and ZDP-60: Communication and Information Systems. Drafting and adoption of doctrinal and other publications will be in function of establishing procedures and processes in the Armed Forces that are not regulated by legislative or by-law provisions.

Development of the branch doctrinal publications, particularly those that prescribe 

![62_image_0.png](62_image_0.png)

![62_image_1.png](62_image_1.png)

![62_image_6.png](62_image_6.png)

tactics, techniques and procedures of single commands and units, falls solely within national jurisdiction, while individuals, units and temporary compositions that have been preparing for participation in NATO Command Structure and Force Structure and NATO led operations will use original NATO doctrine.

By the year 2020 publications will be developed for operations of Naval, Land and Air Forces or their parts in support of joint operations, functional joint concepts and service doctrinal publications for staff functions and tactics of the units and employment of the units of service support. Guidance given through doctrinal publications will be built into teaching and training processes. In that manner, in addition to adoption and understanding doctrinal principles, their feasibility and application in practice will be verified.

## Lessons Learned

The process of recognizing, processing and applying positive experiences/best practices in the Armed Forces is distinctive to a military organization and it is one of the obligations of the Commanders and Heads of the organizational units at all levels. In the forthcoming period, the system of Lessons Learned with clearly defined tasks, competencies and responsibilities will be established in terms of organization and its structure. 

In development of the Lessons Learned System, focus will be on establishment of the processes, building structure and development of tools at all levels that will contribute to enhancement of the interoperability of forces, or rather overall development of the Armed Forces' capabilities.

# Ix. Equipping And Modernization

Despite improvements that have been made in single areas in recent years, in reference to implemented projects of Equipping and Modernization, material assets and equipment at the disposal of the Armed Forces are at present partly obsolete. That affects efficiency and hinders full interoperability with the Allies. Due to the complex process of procurement and modernization and lengthy service life of the weaponry and military equipment, decisions that are made regarding Equipping and Modernization of the Armed Forces will significantly affect capabilities in the forthcoming 30 years and more. 

Limited funds for defense requirements have resulted in decisions on retaining or abandoning certain capabilities. Some of the capabilities have already been significantly limited and without new investments in Equipment or Modernization, they would practically be lost. With the aim to retain key capabilities and bearing in mind the uncertainty of long-term challenges of the Security environment, plans will also be developed for Equipping and Modernization to begin at the end of the planning period. Their completion and financial effect mostly extend to the next planning period. Projects that are singled out due to their high financial demands and due to the importance of the capabilities that are realized within them are:

## 1. Croatian Army

a. Armored Vehicles
- A total of 48 tanks will be retained in operational use in the Armed Forces and they will be subjected to revision process; one Tank Company will be modernized;
- End of equipping and phasing into operational use of the APC Patria with other weapon and military systems (anti-armor system, remote weapon station of 30 mm, communication equipment);
- Maintenance and modernization of the infantry combat vehicle BVP M-80, including modernization with new antiarmor systems;
- Equipping with new mobile anti-armor system. 

## B. Air Defense Assets

- Equipping with Man Portable Short Range Air Defense System (MANPADS).

## C. Enginery

- Further development of the Engineer branch and phasing in of the mines with self-destruction or self-deactivation, the system of distance mine planting, the system of quick opening of passages in mine fields and replacement of the launching systems for quick bridging over and floating bridges systems; 
- Equipping with engineer assets and

equipment for general and combat support and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD).

## 2. Croatian Navy

a. Equipping with Coastal Patrol Boat; b. Equipping with Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV);
c. Equipping with Anti-Ship Missile System.

## 3. Croatian Air Force And Air Defense

a. By the end of the year 2016 decision will be made regarding retaining or abandoning Autonomous Protection of the Air Space; b. Equipping with Air Defense system of mid-range.

Equipping and Modernization policy is oriented towards development and maintenance of the targeted capabilities of the Armed Forces defined by basic documents in Defense Sector. Additionally, equipping and modernization policy will include monitoring and analyzing possibilities of national and foreign capacities involvement in equipping and modernization processes. Priorities in equipping and modernization are aimed at achieving and maintaining the capabilities in support of the missions and tasks of the Armed Forces, realization of the NATO Capability Targets and completion of the initiated projects.

Equipping and modernization will be implemented in accordance with requirements, technical and economic validity of requirement, available budget allocations and applicable regulations. Wherever possible manufacturing capacities of the domestic Defense Industry as the sources of equipping and modernization will be taken into consideration to the maximum extent as well as international agreements under which equipping and modernization could be realized through donation or procurement of weapons and military equipment under favorable financial conditions. As one of the methods of financing equipping and modernization, consideration will also be given to the possibility of using EU funds (EU funding for Dual Use), with focus on procurement of equipment necessary for development and achievement of the targeted capabilities of using Armed Forces in support of civilian structures. Research and Development in support of equipping and modernization will be implemented in cooperation with Croatian scientific research institutions, as well as institutions of NATO and European Defense Agency. Their resources and potentials can contribute to research and development of weapons and military equipment for the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces. In addition, cooperation with NATO institutions and European Defense Agency will be considered as well. Their developmental projects for weapons and military equipment are available and of interest for development and achieving of the targeted capabilities of the Armed Forces.

Projects of equipping and modernization shown in the Long Term Development Plan are mostly divided in two priority levels, and some in three levels. Projects of the first level represent absolute priority because they comprise projects that are of key importance in building capabilities, through which NATO Capability Targets are reached. Therefore, they are necessary for the efficient execution of the missions and tasks. Projects of the second priority level are important for Armed Forces activities; they upgrade capabilities, and affect dynamics and quality of single capabilities. However, the scope and dynamics of their realization are to the certain degree subject to corrections. Priorities of the third level are subject to significant corrections in the scope and dynamics of realization.

## Croatian Army Priorities

The priority of the Croatian Army is modernization and equipping of the key maneuver units of the Armed Forces. In the period till the year 2020 priority will be given to equipping of the Mechanized Guard Brigade and that represents a direct contribution to realization of the NATO Capability Targets. The second priority in the period till the year 2020 is equipping other declared units. In the period from 2021 till the end of 2024 and even beyond that period, projects of equipping and modernization of the Guards Armored-Mechanized Brigade will be initiated as indispensable for retaining and increasing the level of its capabilities.

## Infantry Weapons And Equipment

The quantities of serviceable infantry weapons in the Armed Forces meet requirements of the proposed structure. 

These weapons are technologically obsolete and their calibers and maintenance requirements do not provide for harmonization of the operational activities with the Armed Forces of NATO and 

![67_image_0.png](67_image_0.png) EU members. 

In the previous planning period the Armed Forces began equipping with the new VHS assault rifle and accompanying equipment (of NATO caliber) in a quantity of 6,000 pieces. Equipping will continue in the first two planning periods in order to complete equipping of the CAF Active Duty component by late 2020. Equipping of the CAF Reserve component with the VHS assault rifle is planned for the third planning period. 

By late 2020 it is necessary to equip other units of the Croatian Army declared for the NATO Pool of Forces with machine guns and universal machine guns of NATO caliber. Equipping of the Active Duty component with this type of weapon should be completed by the end of the entire planning period. Given the fact that the Armed Forces have no ammunition of NATO caliber in stock, along with procurement of the new assault rifles, machine guns and light machine guns, it is necessary to equip the CAF with accompanying ammunition. 

Within the planning period, priority is given to continued equipping the troops with individual equipment until the Armed Forces are fully equipped, including renewal of the following equipment: 
camouflage uniforms with digital press, military boots and combat helmets, combat modular vests, backpacks and individual night vision devices. CAF 
units declared for NATO and EU operations should be equipped to operate under extreme weather conditions. 

The project of equipping troops with upgraded systems of performance, protection and communication will begin in the second part of the planning period. Priority in equipping with infantry weapons and equipment will be given to units scheduled for deployment to NATO / EU operations.

Support Artillery 

![68_image_0.png](68_image_0.png)

The Armed Forces are equipped with artillery weapons of various origin and caliber (105, 120, 122, 130, 152, 155 mm). 

They are technologically obsolete; computing of the initial elements is slow as well as correction of fire and velocity of reaction. Features regarding range and precision are also unsatisfactory. 

In view of the new requested capabilities, it is necessary to begin a process of equipping with new artillery systems of unified 155 mm caliber. In that way, mobility and interoperability in joint operations with NATO and EU forces members will be increased. Putting new artillery systems into operational use will enable implementation of the NATO Capability Targets to operate at distances up to 40 km by using various types of precise ammunition, fire control system and exchange of information with Partners. Equipping and putting the system into operational use will be completed by the year 2019, and full operational capability will be reached by the year 2022. 

## Anti-Armor Combat Assets

Armed Forces are equipped with obsolete anti-armor systems of unsatisfactory performance regarding range, guidance and penetrability. Anti-armor guided missile system (POVRS) has a range of 2, 5 km, and mobile anti-armor system Maljutka has been declared nonprospective. 

The capability of anti-tank combat will be upgraded in the forthcoming period by equipping of the armored personal carrier Patria (APC), with modern antitank systems of the 3rd generation. Replacement of the mobile systems Fagot and Metis with more advanced ones will be also taken into consideration, or the existing systems will be equipped with modern/advanced ammunition of greater range and greater penetrability and easier launching of anti-tank projectiles. 

## Armor Assets

Armed Forces are equipped with the tank M-84, which has (after the revision process) fulfilled requirements for the planning period. 

Mechanized infantry of the Croatian Army is equipped with full tracked infantry combat vehicle BVP M80A for which modernization will be considered at the end of the planning period.

Equipping with modern armor vehicle on wheels APC Patria (in 7 various versions) and phasing into operational use of 126 carriers will end in the year 2016. The combat armor vehicle (BOV) will be equipped with modern communication system and remote controlled machine gun of 12, 7 mm caliber. By the end of 2016 part of the vehicles will be equipped with remote controlled gun of 30 mm caliber and advanced anti-armor system.

THE CROATIAN ARMED FORCES **LONG−TERM DEVELOPMENT PLAN** 2015 − 2024

![68_image_1.png](68_image_1.png)

## Light Armor Vehicle (Combat)

By the end of 2017 equipping and phasing into operational use of the light armor vehicles (M-ATV, MRAP) will be carried out in cooperation with bilateral partner. 

## Air Defense Assets

Weapons of the Croatian Army comprise of Air Defense guns of 20 mm caliber, self-propelled surface to air missile systems S-10 CRO and S-10M and shoulder launched "IGLA" and "S2M" light missile systems. 

All artillery AD systems as well as manportable, shoulder-fired low altitude surface-to-air missile system S-2M have been proclaimed non-prospective. For requirements of the Air Defense capability for protection of maneuver units, Croatian Army will be equipped with systems of short range for Air Defense of the maneuver units (MANPADS).

## Engineering Assets

The existing bridging and pontoon assets and equipment are tactically and technically outdated and are not meeting the new requirements. Consequently, there is a high level of malfunctioning, high maintenance costs and the inability to provide full engineering combat support in the segment of ensuring mobility of the maneuver units in operations. In conformity with the new operational requirements for maintaining operational tempo in high mobility operations, in the forthcoming period priority for the Armed Forces will be to finish equipping of the declared Engineering forces for NATO (one Platoon and one Company for general engineering support, one platoon for engineering combat support and one EOD platoon) with engineering machines, trucks, EOD equipment and special EOD vehicles. The Armed Forces will also begin equipping with new engineering systems necessary for realization of the accepted NATO Capability Targets.

## Nbcd Assets And Equipment

Resource life cycle has expired for most of the personal Nuclear, Biological and Chemical protective equipment (PPE), self-protection and personal decontamination assets. Priority in the forthcoming period will be given to equipping of the Armed Forces units with individual protective equipment, treatments for the first self-help, dosimeter, and equipment for personal decontamination of the skin, clothes, personal gear and personal weapons as well as equipping of the multifunctional NBC protection platoon. The adopted Capability Targets also involve obligation of providing networked chemical and radiological point-detectors, deployable assets for collective protection against NBC agents/hazards and assets for establishment and development of the NBC Warning and Reporting System.

## Signal Assets And Systems 

![69_Image_0.Png](69_Image_0.Png)

The priority in the forthcoming period will be equipping of the Croatian Army units with assets that provide conditions for implementation of the NATO Capability Targets. Signal assets and systems will also be provided simultaneously with the equipping with combat armor vehicles, self-propelled artillery systems, light armor combat vehicles, Air Defense systems and BVP vehicles.

## Croatian Navy Priorities

Croatian Navy will be developed as a navy with a limited range of combat capabilities focused on Defense and Crises Management. Firstly, it will develop capabilities that are recognized as critically important for conduct of the basic missions of the defense and protection of national interests at sea. These are: 
- Capability to act against surface targets,
- Capability for mine and anti-mine operations, 
- Capability for Command and Control, Information-Communication networking, data gathering and sea monitoring.

Having in mind the responsibility of the Croatian Navy for the safety at sea in peace-time, the priority of equipping and modernization of the Croatian Navy is aimed at developing the capability of the Coast Guard through continuation of the project of equipping the Coast Patrol Boats. By the year 2017 another two projects have been defined as priority-projects: (1) Achieving full capability of control of the sea surface through modernization of the radar system Enhanced Peregrine and procurement of the alternate radars for obsolete GEM radars. The priority of this project is to achieve integration of all national sources in one radar picture

![72_image_2.png](72_image_2.png) of the naval situation in the Adriatic Sea in addition to the capability of sharing information with NATO; (2) In the period from 2015 - 2018 to achieve the capability of anti-mine operations by procurement of two mine hunters and their equipping and modernization by the end of 2020. At the end of the planning period, the project of multi-role patrol boat will begin; it will be designed to carry out a variety of tasks, i.e., to have the capability of combating surface targets and elements of anti-submarine combat., Depending on the analysis of the security environment, the Navy will be equipped

## Croatian Air Force And Air Defense Priorities

Croatian Air Force and Air Defense will develop capabilities of control and protection of the air space of the Republic of Croatia within NATO Integrated System of Air Defense (NATINADS). It will also give support to execution of the Coast Guard's missions, helicopter air transportation, support to paratrooper training and light air transportation, support to aerial fire-fighting, aeronautical-technical logistic support to its own forces and Allied forces as well; execute all types of training of individuals and units for conduct of missions of the Armed forces' services in the Republic of Croatia and in Peace Support Operations and assistance to civilian institutions in the Republic of Croatia. As the service life cycle of the overhauled airplanes MiG-21 expires by the end of 2024, the priority is to find a permanent solution for protection of the air space. Possible solution for protection of the air space lays in development of the multinational approach based on the principles of cooperation, sharing resources and capabilities with Allies and Partners, or rather 

![74_image_1.png](74_image_1.png)

![74_image_2.png](74_image_2.png)

within the system NATINAMDS. Decision regarding possibilities and modalities for development of this capability will be made by the end of 2016. 

Having in mind specific features of the existing transport helicopter capabilities that are currently in operational use, during the planning period consideration will be given to options and modalities for replacement of transport helicopters, and depending on the resources, for the beginning of the process of transition and introduction of new helicopters which will ensure sustainability of the CAF transport helicopter capabilities.

In addition to the above stated, within 

![74_image_0.png](74_image_0.png) the framework of available programs of cooperation with strategic partners, possibilities will be further explored for continuous improvement of the overall helicopter capabilities by putting into operational use other types of helicopters in addition to transport helicopters. Such projects will be implemented if they would present a significant contribution to the overall capabilities of the Armed Forces and if at the same time they would not create such a resource burden that could affect the implementation of other planned projects.

## Equipping And Modernization Of The Communication And Information System

Communication and information systems have an increasing importance in all segments of the Defense Sector. Informatization of the Command and Control System (C2) is among the priorities at tactical, operational and strategic level. 

Such systems integrate traditional distribution in stationary and deployable (mobile) systems. Integration of information from other sources and sensors has also progressively developed. Informatization of the single processes in the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces has been carried out with continuity. However, the greatest challenge in the future period will be their integration and consolidation into an integral system capable of immediate mutual exchange of information according to requirements and authorizations. In this process, particular attention will be given to security and defense of that system. Building of an integral system will be carried out gradually and it will include integration, optimization and consolidation of the existing systems and upgrading of their capabilities. 

The framework for construction of the Communication-Information system comprises a mobile system, the system of basic and the system of functional services. The mobile system includes technical levels of signal transmission, and the system of basic services includes those services that are common for the entire Defense field. They contain systems for transmission of messages and circulation of documents, systems for text processing, systems of identity authorization and verification and access to other basic services. Functional part of the system is specific for single functional areas and it is built on basis of the services and capabilities of the database and of the basic layer. 

The focus on development will be placed on consolidation and modernization of the mobile system and the system of basic services on which functional services will perform. 

Functional services will be built according to requirements of single functional areas and in conformity with solutions that are accepted and used by NATO. Applications will be developed with the aim to be mutually open for data exchange and open for capabilities to connect with adequate systems of the Allied countries. 

In the Defense Sectors worldwide an increasing importance has been given to the defense of the information area, due to the growing importance of the Communication-Information systems and 

![77_image_0.png](77_image_0.png) their vulnerability. Systems for defense of the communication-information system will be developed in Defense Sector. 

Development of the information systems and their modernization and consolidation will ensure the basic elements of information systems reliability: confidentiality (secrecy), integrity and continued availability and elements of their security as, for example, authentication (verification of identity), authorization (verification of authorization) and irrevocability of all transactions in the entire information system of the Defense Sector. This requires development and constant upgrading of the system of cryptographic protection and digital signature throughout the entire Communication-Information System according to the level of secrecy. 

Modernization of Data Centers makes the specific part of information protection and defense of the IT space that will allow for more efficient physical and technical protection of the file Server and other central network equipment, as well as for security of data and information systems. Building of the detached Redundant Data Centre will allow for separate secure Data Backup and Data Recovery systems, as special security function of the information systems against threats that could come either from the information area (Cyber attack) or classical kinetic attack or rather natural threat to the Data Centre. At the same time, this will also correct or remove observed deficiencies of the current Data Centre. In addition to stationary and deployable communication capabilities, a system will be developed that allow communication (voice and data) with members of the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces who are deployed on assignments abroad, either in missions and operations or on Defense Attaché duties or similar tasks. In order to achieve these goals it will be necessary to continuously carry out equipping and modernization of the existing Communication-Information Systems that have progressively short life cycle before becoming technologically obsolete. Reorganization of the existing systems must ensure integral management of the Communication-Information

System and consolidation of the mobile system and the system of basic services. 

Continuous, quality, reliable and sufficient protection for all types of the Communication-Information services will be necessary in the area of fixed communications, mobile communications (mobile GSM networks, mobile radio networks), satellite communications and all types of information services and services that use networks for data transmission. This includes equipping with assets and signal systems earmarked for troops, team leaders, commanders of all levels, as well as systems that provide contribution to the common operational picture, distribution of data in real time and use of indispensable functional services. In addition to the modernization of equipment and consolidation of the data and processes, high level of expertise of the specific cadre and organizational solutions of their positioning in the system must be ensured.

# X. Facilities And Infrastructure

![80_Image_0.Png](80_Image_0.Png)

## Current Status Of Facilities And Infrastructure

Military properties intended for defense purposes are owned by the Republic of Croatia while the Ministry of Defense has received them for property management and utilization. These military properties are categorized as follows: 
- prospective military properties (properties built for military purpose, utilized by the Ministry of Defense),
- temporarily prospective military properties (properties that are built for military purpose and used by the Ministry of Defense, and are in the process of being abandoned), and
- Non-prospective military properties 
(properties built for military purpose and not utilized by the Ministry of Defense).

Through the rationalization process of utilizing military properties, the Ministry of Defense will use only prospective properties whereas all non-prospective and temporarily prospective military properties 
(after abandonment) will be given to the management by the State Office for State Property Management. By the transfer of the non-prospective and temporarily prospective military properties, the Ministry of Defense will reduce the costs of passive standby regime, protection, and guarding of such properties whereas the State Office for State Property Management may initiate the procedure of their conversion to for different utilization in accordance with the physical planning documentation.

## Course Of Development In The Area Of Facilities And Infrastructure

Construction, renovation and reconstruction of the facilities and the infrastructure at the locations that are foreseen for the planned deployment of the Armed Forces will mainly adhere to the principle that main barracks having no capacity for development for more than 2000 persons and do not have exercise areas or training facilities will be considered to be non-prospective. With the purpose to increase effectiveness, at prospective locations, first of all the accommodation capacities, training and logistics in training areas and barracks will be improved. The total number of non-prospective properties will be rationalized and the abandoning and transfer of non-prospective properties will be intensified aiming at decreasing the costs for their insurance and maintenance. The standards of work, accommodation and training at the prospective locations will be raised continually, and the renovation of the facilities will be in accordance with the legal regulations of the Republic of Croatia in the field of physical planning, construction, fire protection, work safety, environment protection and technical safety.

Systems of technical safety for protection of military locations will be built during the construction of new facilities and reconstruction of the existing buildings and infrastructure, which enables rationalization of military personnel guarding military locations.

In order to achieve faster accommodation of the Armed Forces at prospective military locations, the concept of building housing facilities, logistic and other facilities in the form of prefabricated, modular buildings and fast build systems. During construction, reconstruction, and adaptation, the Energy Efficiency and Waste Management procedures will be applied. Funding will be accomplished through Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund subvention for building and reconstruction of military facilities. Biomass Energy Plants will be designed and built at military training ranges and other military locations where there are resources and possibilities of biomass preparation. In the upcoming planning period the focus will be on rationalization and downsizing of non-prospective properties through the following actions:
- transfer of non-prospective properties to the State Office for State Property Management, 
- selling the part of military properties in accordance with the legal prerequisites, and 
- increasing and centralizing accommodation capacities, administrative, storing, training and other capacities, as well as through targeted move of the Armed Forces for which building and organizing of the needed capacities at the prospective locations is required.

Pursuant to the Act on Management and Disposal of the Property Owned by the Republic of Croatia, the Ministry of Defense is no longer required to pay utility fee which reduces the costs of using prospective properties. 

The financial means obtained from selling non-prospective and temporarily prospective military properties will be invested in the modernization of the Ministry of Defense infrastructure.

The European Union funds and other possible resources will be taken into consideration when financing projects of infrastructure building and modernization. 

Military Geographic Information System

## Military Geographic Information System

![81_Image_0.Png](81_Image_0.Png)

will develop topographic and cartographic database of geospatial data for the territory of the Republic of Croatia, and printed charts of new military topographic maps in the range of 1:50.000 and 1:250.000 scale in accordance with NATO standards. The goal of Military Geo Information System is to equip the Armed Forces with updated, digital, standardized, functional and interoperable geospatial data. Geospatial data obtained through the project of the Military Geographic Information System are in direct support of the NATO Capability Targets. Standardization of geospatial data and products, will allow their exchange with other NATO members.

# Xi. Logistics System

## Current Status Of The Logistics System

Logistics system of the Armed Forces is unique for all services and parts of the Armed Forces, taking into account the particularities of logistic support of combat service units and combat service support units, services and elements. The present concept of the logistic support has been developed through the transformation and abandonment of the territorial placement and organizational structure of the Armed Forces. The main features of this system are numerous stationary logistic elements that offer logistic support in the barracks, mobile capacities of field logistics and abandonment of certain logistic activities and some of civil logistics personnel separation. Food services, catering and cleaning have been singled out and are now being performed by newly established company Pleter-usluge d.o.o. and the overhaul tasks are being done by Aeronautics Technical Centre Ltd. 

Logistics system has fulfilled the requirements of accomplishing tasks on the territory of the Republic of Croatia, while the field logistics capabilities have not been fully developed in accordance with the planning. The process of abandoning logistics catering services has not ended yet and more civil persons have been retained than previously planned.

## Goals Of The Logistics System Development

The goal is to develop the process oriented, reliable and adaptable logistics system with greater emphasis on mobile capacities of field logistics and more efficient lifecycle management of combat technique. Logistics system will acquire new capabilities regarding the integration of new combat resources that are obtained through the equipping programs. Rationalization of the organizational structure will be conducted and similar logistic activities will be linked together and that way the number of personnel will be decreased and their competencies will be THE CROATIAN ARMED FORCES **LONG−TERM DEVELOPMENT PLAN** 2015 − 2024

![88_image_0.png](88_image_0.png)

equaled/balanced. Greater efficiency will be achieved, resource e expenditure will be reduced, supplies will be optimized, and the quality of logistic information will be raised. Moreover, the speed of their exchange will be increased and the capabilities for integration into collective logistics will be enhanced in accordance to NATO Logistics Doctrine. The objectives of the Logistics Systems development are:
1. To ensure the logistics readiness and continuation of logistics support to the Armed Forces pertinent to missions, tasks and the level of ambition; 2. To rationalize logistics support by integration of logistic activities and application of new organizational solutions; 3. To optimize logistics processes in the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces by developing logistic standards and criteria, codification, quality control, and automatization of the logistics information exchange process; 4. To reform the procurement system and supply chain management; 5. To maintain combat resources in terms of readiness requirements; 6. To develop capabilities for operations within collective logistics.

## Logistics Readiness

Logistic readiness refers to the timely availability of armament and military equipment, availability of classes of supplies, efficiency of the procurement system and the sustainability capability of the forces participating in operations. Capability of the logistics system is expressed through the ratio of logistics readiness in relation to the amount of invested financial resources. Funding for logistics support is intended for maintenance of armament and military equipment, energy supplies, accommodation, food and other types of logistics support. In the past five years, financial means invested in logistic support had a tendency of decreasing and amounted to an average of less than 15% 
of Defense Budget. In order to keep logistic readiness according to its missions and tasks, and to enable logistics to respond to challenges and needs while supporting the Armed Forces, the objective is to keep the logistic share at the same level in the following three years, and after that to gradually increase to optimal 20% of the overall value of Defense Budget.

## Rationalization Of Logistics Support

Personnel structure will be balanced within combat support services, i.e., the number of personnel will be downsized in Army Service Corps, construction and transport services. Technical and medical service will be improved by intensified specialization of capabilities and capacities corresponding with the major requirements of combat service and combat service support. Measures and ways of rationalization of logistics system organization are as follows: - Transfer of the remaining operational and technical functions of logistics support from the Ministry of Defense and General Staff of the Armed Forces to the Armed Forces units which will be accomplished in accordance with changes of Regulations on Material Procurement of the Armed Forces;
- Logistics functions of procurement will be unified as well as transport and construction support in the Support Command which will be accomplished within the re-organization of the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces; 
- Downsizing of personnel working within stationary logistics system in all combat service support units. 

- Abandonment of tasks related to direct maintenance and logistics support to units and locations of the military facilities. Infrastructure maintenance and military facility management will be outsourced to contractors, and the existing personnel will be reorganized within the existing or within a new company.

## Optimization Of Logistics Processes

Optimization will contribute to faster and more efficient logistics system that will remove redundant parallel activities at several management levels. The goal is to establish a process, organization and functioning of logistics and to clearly define the purpose and tasks of the organizational units. This will be achieved by several measures and ways through the procedure of procurement, acquisition and distribution, by defining and informatisation of process documentation as well as through the better contracting of logistics support including the contracting abroad. Within the optimization of the logistics system, the following initiatives have been taken:
- Optimization of public procurement through harmonizing competencies and responsibilities of organizational units and by conducting automated operational-technical communication within procurement procedure. The objective is to obtain and maintain complete transparency of public procurement and to shorten the duration of procedures for obtaining funding for the Armed Forces including procurement in the Area of Operations.

- Reform of the standards of materiel supplying. Legal and regulatory framework of materiel supplying will be reformed in view of future cooperation with business entities of domestic military industry and providers of logistic support services. The goals of equipment and modernization will be linked to the strategy of equipping with the purpose of better cooperation of all state institutions involved in procurement of combat systems. In terms of increasing international defense cooperation, the strategy of equipping will bring harmonized and a unique approach of all national stakeholders being a part of the international Defense market. There will be a transparent decision making on the procurement of combat systems and their efficiency.

- Codification and optimization of the 

![90_image_0.png](90_image_0.png)

![90_image_1.png](90_image_1.png)

![90_image_2.png](90_image_2.png)

![90_image_3.png](90_image_3.png)

![90_image_4.png](90_image_4.png)

procurement and distribution system and the inventory monitoring. The new procurement system based on modern codification and informatization is introduced with the purpose of affordable management of the resources and shortened period of distribution to a unit as the end user. The goal is to reform the Codification System in accordance with NATO standards, and to develop organizational and technical capacities in the Ministry of Defense for the systematic codification of weaponry and military equipment. 

- Implementation of the Quality Management System in accordance with NATO 
standards. The purpose is to conduct weaponry and military equipment quality management in its entire life cycle. The implementation of the Quality Management System will bring better technical specification for procurement and maintenance, more transparent procurement procedure, better quality equipment and weaponry procurement for the Armed Forces in terms of the invested money and greater interoperability of military equipment and weaponry.

- Automatization of the logistic information exchange and the knowledge about logistic situational awareness information is a basic prerequisite for the planning of the logistics support. Therefore, it is necessary to develop logistics information system that will give logistics information and be compatible within a unique information system of the Defense Sector. With the purpose of logistic operational reporting at the national level, the NATO program tools will be used. Implementation of logistic information system will enable the complete control and visibility of material assets and will support material and financial operations in the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces.

## Supply And Supply Chain Management

The goal of material inventory manage-

![91_image_0.png](91_image_0.png) ment is to reduce the cost of obtaining and keeping the supplies by providing logistic readiness of the Armed Forces. Supply of Fuel and Lubricants. The goal is to enable independent activities of the Armed Forces in the period of 30 days through their planning, storing and distribution system. A strategic and operational level location is designated for storing the fuel and lubricant supplies and several locations are being designated at the tactical level. The goal is to build and improve the conditions for safe storage of fuel and oil derivatives in compliance with the Environment Protection standards. 

In the next planning period, the implementation of the Concept of One Type of Fuel in the Armed Forces will be finalized. The Armed Forces will withdraw the majority of the equipment that uses petrol as a fuel.

Supplies of Lethal Ordnance. The goal is to ensure funds for the procurement of new lethal ordnance by decreasing the costs of keeping the inventory. Lethal ordnance reserve will be optimized according to caliber and types and the total of the required quantities. By the end of 2017 all perspective lethal ordnance will be kept in the functional storage facilities with high standards of counter-explosive protection and environment protection. In modern warehouses better atmospheric conditions are achieved with which resource life cycle is prolonged and the costs of maintenance are optimized as well as the reliability of lethal ordnance. NATO standards will be respected in dealing with lethal ordnance. Supplies for the Reserve Component. Strategic Defense Review has foreseen the establishing of mechanisms for the enhancement of Defense Capabilities by developing the Reserve component for which the weaponry and equipment will be obtained and stored. This means that needs/requirements should be defined and logistics requirements fulfilled at the national level. All material resources for the needs of the Assigned Reserve will be stored by the Support Command. Functional storage and garage facilities will be built in the perspective barracks for storing and keeping the weaponry and basic means for the Reserve component. Logistic Distribution Center. In order to reduce the costs of storage and distribution, a Central Logistic Distribution Center will be built in Zagreb. The objective is to achieve organizational savings in personnel and decrease of operational costs in distribution and manning. Moreover, better overview of the inventory will be achieved as well as monitoring of the inventory and the status of military equipment taken out.

![92_image_0.png](92_image_0.png)

![92_image_1.png](92_image_1.png)

The costs of storing the supplies of medical material and equipment will be analyzed and consequently, the surpluses will be determined, the obsolete items will be defined as well as the way of their disposing in affordable and ecologically acceptable way.

## Maintenance Of Combat Assets

The goal is to improve the present way of maintenance in conceptual and organizational terms. The integrated model of quality keeping for certain technical means or platform and upgrading in its life cycle will be established. Maintenance capacities will be organized in accordance with specific maintenance procedure conducted by the staff and users of material resources, organic logistic units for maintenance, and Support Command units for maintenance, Depot Overhaul Center or outside suppliers of maintenance services. The emphasis will be on military capacities for the overall maintenance of all types of weapons whereas the maintenance of other technique will be conducted by combined military and civilian capacities of maintenance. 

Military capacities and maintenance capabilities will be defined for the designated preventive maintenance and repair of combat technique and means in field conditions as well as for the repair shop maintenance and servicing. The size and the distribution of capacities will be determined according to the types and number of technique that are being maintained including technical means for the Reserve component. 

The capacities for wider repair shop maintenance and overhaul of combat platforms will be developed in Economic Sector through the program of strategic partnership and will be provided by contract. The Armed Forces will develop technical and engineer capabilities for the quality control of the work in civil maintenance companies. The capacities of the maintenance of technical materials for civil purpose and the overhaul of non-combat vehicles will not be developed. 

Depot Overhaul Center of the Support 

![92_image_2.png](92_image_2.png)

![92_image_3.png](92_image_3.png) Command will be transformed having the capacities of maintenance and overhaul of combat vehicles, weaponry, target and measuring devices, military electronics and capabilities of weapons modification except for the vessel artillery weaponry and platforms. In the Depot Overhaul Center there will be new capabilities for technical testing, measurements, assessments, control and other expertise of the weaponry and lethal ordnance, expertise to test the reliability of weapons and technical expertise in management processes of the life cycle of the combat systems. Depot Overhaul Center will provide military and technical assistance to the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff and participate in programs of Research and Development in cooperation with civilian scientific and technical institutions. Maintenance of ships and other naval technical resources will be carried out mainly by entities from the corporate sector, with the exception of specific assets to be maintained in the Croatian Navy capacities. Organization of aviation maintenance will be implemented in accordance with the regulations governing the airworthiness and maintenance of military aircraft. Capacities for maintenance in the Air Force and Air Defense will be modernized and rationalized through specialization and optimization. Aeronautical Technical Institute is a strategic partner in the maintenance of military aircraft and its engineering. 

The integration of new weapons systems that are introduced in the Armed Forces will require systematic rethinking of organizational solutions and establishing of structures that will be responsible for the

![93_Image_0.Png](93_Image_0.Png)

![93_Image_1.Png](93_Image_1.Png)

logistic support of the new systems, the capacities for the maintenance and locations of these capacities. The Croatian Army and The Support Command shall be organized in a way to enable capacities for maintenance and servicing and the light overhaul of Armored Personnel carrier Patria and all Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles (MRAPs). 

## Capabilities To Operate As A Part Of Collective Logistics

The Armed Forces will not develop all logistics capacities for logistics support and sustainability within the operations abroad. According to the principles of cost effectiveness and cooperation, and in accordance with NATO Logistics Doctrine, comprehensive logistics support is provided through collective logistics. In accordance with the tasks and the overall Capability Targets of the Armed Forces, national capabilities of the non-stationary 
(mobile) logistics will be developed. The Logistics units will be equipped with mobile logistics modules. For those logistics capabilities that cannot be developed by the Republic of Croatia, multinational solutions will be found. Therefore, the Armed Forces will intensify cooperation with logistics agencies and other organizations of NATO and the EU. The Republic of Croatia will not develop its own strategic transport capabilities, but, by participating in NATO and other international initiatives, bilateral agreements and commercial contracts, it will ensure timely access to facilities of strategic deployment, in accordance with the needs and decisions on the engagement of the units of the Armed Forces outside Croatian territory. 

The development of medical support capabilities will focus on providing continuous medical and veterinary protection for the needs of all activities and planned goals of the Armed Forces target capabilities alongside with the rationalization of material and human resources. 

Combat branches develop their own medical support. The lowest tactical levels will train and organize Combat Rescue Team as additional combat capability with their task to provide emergency first response until the arrival of professional medical help. Special operation units will train and organize combat medics. Medical support of the maneuver units will be carried out primarily relying on the organic unit at the Role 1 level that provides health care for their members in the Theatre of Operations. For the purpose of providing medical support to the activities and tasks of the Support Command and providing medical support to the units that do not have their own elements of medical support, the Military Health Center has been established as a military health institution. Military Health Center is responsible for the implementation of health care at the primary level and specific health care, and is responsible for the development of medical support at the Role 2 level.

Through the project of equipping and modernization the pool of vehicles will be expanded and modernized having medical equipment in accordance with applicable standards, and the Role 1 maneuver units will be equipped. Military Health Center will carry out veterinary preventive activities and veterinary care for service animals and will continuously monitor monitoring of safety and hygienic standards of food, water and work surfaces at home and abroad. 

Military Health Center will have capabilities of deploying individuals and teams to support the conduct of operations and other specific activities of the Armed Forces at home and abroad, especially in cases when it comes to operations of consequence management/mitigation of impacts of natural and technical disasters. 

Proper training capabilities will be developed as well as training programs for medical staff and personnel who provide health care support, primarily in the Logistics Doctrine and Training Center of the Support Command as well as in other organizational units of the Armed Forces.

# Xii. Financial Resources

Appropriations for Defense for the period covered by the Long Term Development Plan will depend on real annual growth rate of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 

The starting point of this Plan is to stop the multi-year trend of falling Defense Budget and to keep it, in the initial three year period, within the real amount at the level of the year 2014. Financial analysis and assessments from the existing perspective suggests that in order to complete the project and reach the capabilities defined by this Plan, in the next 10 year period, the defense funding should amount to at least 48 billion Kuna. Therefore, the objective is to maintain the existing level of Defense Budget within real amount until 2017, and together with the economic recovery and GDP growth make prerequisites for significant real growth of Defense Budget in the continuation of the planning period which implies gradually reaching the long term ambition of the Defense funding up to 2% of GDP. In this way the funding will be provided in the ten year period needed for the development of planned capabilities together with flexible and efficient conduct of operational tasks in the Defense Sector. Financially the most challenging final decision regarding the possibilities and the model of maintenance of the com-

of the growth of defense budget in the absolute amount per year (in bill. KN)

2014 **2024**

![95_image_0.png](95_image_0.png)

![95_image_1.png](95_image_1.png)

bat aircraft capabilities will be adopted 

![95_image_3.png](95_image_3.png) by the end of 2016. The complexity of this capability, or the time required to introduce the new aircraft, as well as calculations based on the ten years of investment, indicate that there is a need for such a process, which will begin in 2019 and the continued investment in the next planning period. Consequently, this decision will affect the sheer size of the Defense Budget in 2019. Projected total Defense Budget in the ten-year period covered by this Plan is increased, depending on the variants of the financing capability of combat aircraft in amount varying between 2.4 and 4.2 billion HRK. 

Figure 13 shows projections of the Defense Budget with three versions of its growth from the year 2019. In addition to the basic version that implies around LEGEND: Operation costs Equipping and construction Salary Other expenses related to personnel Costs of international missions and operations 6 **Costs of the personnel** 
comprise salaries, fiscal giving, different allowances, such as allowances for participation in international missions and operations Operational costs comprise costs of regular functioning of the Armed Forces units and the Ministry of Defense organizational units and they include costs of equipment and infrastructure maintenance, procurement costs of materiel and raw materials, energy, services, membership fee etc., costs of the support to civil institutions and other expenditures for the employees.

Equipping and construction costs comprise the costs of major projects of equipping and modernization, supporting projects that are in support of introducing major projects, and costs of construction and modernization of facilities and infrastructure defined in chapters: Equipping and Modernization, and Facilities and Infrastructure.

48 billion HRK of the total defense allocation in the planning period, there are 

![96_image_0.png](96_image_0.png)

![96_image_1.png](96_image_1.png)

also shown two possible versions that provide combat aircraft maintenance capability through the multinational approach and initiative, and through selffinancing. The overview as such is indicative and it implies a multi-year funding model requiring further, more in-depth and detailed analysis that will be prepared by the end of 2016 to support final decision-making. During the planning period, together with the end of the declining period and with the gradual growth of the Defense Budget, special emphasis will be put on the improved budget structure underlining the direction and increase of the available resources in equipping and construction6 which amounts to 67:21:12 in the year 2014 (Figure 14), and it will change gradually in the direction of 46:33:21 ratio at the end of the period comprised in this Plan (Figure 15). Downsizing of the total number of personnel in the Armed Forces and administration in the Ministry of Defense will gradually decrease the annual expenditure for personnel by the end of the planning period. In projections that include means for retaining combat aircraft capabilities in one or the other option, anticipated cost ratio would be even more favorable (Figure 16 and Figure 17).

# Xiii. Management Processes

Realization of the goals and ambitions of the Long-Term Development Plan (LTDP) 
requires continuous management of its implementation with clear division of competencies and responsibilities. Croatian Parliament will regularly monitor implementation of the LTDP through examination of the Annual Report on Defense and of the Defense Budget proposal within the framework of the State Budget of the Republic of Croatia. 

To support the role of the Croatian Parliament, the Ministry of Defense will, during the preparation of the Annual Report on Defense, report in a separate chapter about the LTDP implementation. 

Government of the Republic of Croatia will establish dynamics and priorities of the LTDP implementation through the Strategy of the Governmental Programs and Guidelines of the Economical and Fiscal Policy. 

The Ministry of Defense will ensure operationalization of the LTDP through the Defense Planning Process. Analyses will also be carried out and proposals will be put forward of all regulations that represent normative presumptions for the efficient implementation of the LTDP.

Regulations regarding Defense Planning will be of special importance in operationalization of the LTDP. It is particularly important in this process, to sustain and improve three planning processes:
1. To determine the state of capabilities, or rather, identify missing or unsatisfactory elements of individual capabilities and priorities in their development and financing. 

2. To identify a starting point and priorities of the realization and financing of the projects in mid-term period. 3. To establish Financial and Human Resources framework for midterm and short-term period. 

Fundamental risks that could occur during management of the LTDP implementation are: - Insufficient resources for financing priorities of the highest level in defined time frame
- Occurrence of new, higher level priorities, than those for which realization has entered the phase of significant financial expenditures.

Government of the Republic of Croatia and the Ministry of Defense will manage the process of overcoming the risks connected with realization of priorities. 

The LTDP will be reviewed every third year. In the case of major and more significant changes in strategic and security environment, in facilitating social and economic processes, primarily connected with the state of financial resources or with the occurrence of other circumstances that could indicate a requirement for a substantial revision of the document, the process of Strategic Defense Review will be previously carried out as established by the Defense Act. With the aim to ensure an optimal level of implementation and adaptability to changes that could have implications on planning solutions identified within this document, the Government of the Republic of Croatia could, if required, propose its minor amendments on annual basis.
