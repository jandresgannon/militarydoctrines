### Gen Nakatani

Minister of Defense


Defense policy must always be relevant to the constantly changing security environment. And now is

precisely when Japan’s defense policy is at a major turning point in our history.

Japan faces an increasingly severe security environment. China has increased its defense budget

by over 10% for fi ve consecutive years, strengthening its military forces broadly and rapidly. Chinese

government ships conduct intermittent incursions into Japan’s territorial waters. China carries out extremely

dangerous acts that could cause unintended consequences, such as the fl ying of Chinese military fi ghter

jets abnormally close to Self-Defense Force (SDF) aircraft. It has to be said that China lacks transparency

on many fronts regarding its military affairs and security issues, including its rising defense budget. North

Korea has conducted ballistic missile launches repeatedly, and its nuclear development and enhancement of

ballistic missile capabilities constitute a serious and imminent threat to the security of Japan. Turning our

attention to the rest of the world, Russia appears to have intervened directly or indirectly in its neighboring

country Ukraine. The international terrorist group ISIL has been gaining strength in Syria and Iraq.

Tragically, despicable acts of terrorism have occurred that killed or injured Japanese nationals outside of

Japan. Domestically, many precious lives were lost as a result of the landslides in Hiroshima Prefecture and

the eruption of Mt. Ontake. In Nepal, a massive earthquake took place that caused catastrophic devastation.

The Ministry of Defense (MOD) and the SDF are the fi nal bastion in securing Japan’s territorial land,

water, and airspace in any situation. In this regard, it is critically important that the MOD and the SDF

make ceaseless efforts and steadily improve their response capabilities. At the moment, Diet deliberations

are under way on the Peace and Security Legislation, which enables seamless responses to any situations

in order to secure the lives and peaceful livelihood of the Japanese people. Furthermore, the Guidelines for

Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation was revised for the fi rst time in 18 years after the last revision to further

deepen Japan-U.S. defense cooperation in a wide range of areas. Additionally, reforms of the MOD are being

undertaken, including the strengthening

of the SDF’s integrated operational

functions and the new establishment of

the Acquisition, Technology and Logistics

Agency. Moreover, under Japan’s policy of

Proactive Contribution to Peace based on

the principle of international cooperation,

the MOD and the SDF promote United

Nations Peacekeeping Operations (PKO),

counter-piracy operations, and defense

cooperation with countries mainly in the


Minister of Defense Nakatani visiting a “response at collapsed houses” exercise (GSDF Camp Nerima)


Asia-Pacific region. We also continue to work to build a Dynamic Joint Defense Force that is necessary for

effective deterrence of and response to various situations.

As these revisions to the defense policy get under way, every day SDF personnel are steadily

performing diverse tasks in difficult conditions across Japan and across the world. These tasks include

surveillance, exercises, U.N. PKO, disaster deployments, and logistics support to these missions. For me, as

a former SDF personnel who worked on the ground, the ground represents my starting point. I have visited

GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF units on the ground as well as South Sudan and Djibouti to offer encouragement

to personnel. What I saw there were personnel making tireless efforts in order to live up to the trust placed

in them by the Japanese people and the international community, even with the diversification of the SDF’s

tasks to adapt to the changing times.

Public understanding and support are indispensable for the defense of Japan. In addition, there

is much significance to maintaining the transparency of Japanese defense policy for gaining the further

understanding and trust of countries. We are pleased to learn that according to the Cabinet Office’s FY2014

Public Opinion Survey on the SDF and Defense Issues, the public maintained an overall high level of interest

in defense issues and a positive impression of the SDF, following on from the previous survey in 2012. The

Defense of Japan has no doubt contributed to these results. As it happens, the aforementioned important

and broad defense policy revisions are being carried out this year, which marks the 70th anniversary of

the end of World War II. I believe this year’s Defense of Japan that outlines these revisions takes on added

importance compared to previous years’ white papers. It is my sincere hope that this year, once again, the

Defense of Japan will be read by as many people as possible, and that they will have a deeper understanding

of the MOD and the SDF.

**Part I Security Environment Surrounding Japan**


**Overview**



-  The security environment surrounding Japan has become
increasingly severe, with various challenges and destabilizing
factors becoming more tangible and acute.

-  In the periphery of Japan, there has been a tendency towards an
increase in and prolongation of so-called “gray-zone” situations,
that is, neither pure peacetime nor contingencies over territory,
sovereignty, and maritime economic interests. In addition, there has
been a noticeable trend among neighboring countries to modernize
and reinforce their military capabilities and to intensify their military
activities. In this regard, security challenges and destabilizing factors
in the Asia-Pacifi c region are becoming more serious.

-  In a global security environment, there is a growing risk that
unrest or a security problem in a single country or region could

immediately develop into a challenge or destabilizing factor for
the entire international community. The activities of international
terrorist organizations, including the Islamic State of Iraq and the
Levant (ISIL), are gaining momentum and expanding. Russia has
attempted to change the status quo by force or coercion in Ukraine
(so-called “hybrid warfare”). Cyber attacks have become more
sophisticated and complicated. As these examples exemplify, the
security challenges and destabilizing factors are complex, diverse,
and wide-ranging, and it is becoming ever more diffi cult for a
single country to deal with them on its own.

-  Territorial disputes over the Northern Territories and Takeshima,
both of which are inherent parts of the territory of Japan, remain
unresolved.

**North Korea**


General Situation

-  North Korea seems to maintain and reinforce its so-called
asymmetric military capabilities and repeatedly uses militarily
provocative words and actions. Such military trend in North Korea
heightens tension in the Korean Peninsula and constitutes a serious
destabilizing factor to the security not only of Japan but also of the
entire region and the international community. Accordingly, it is
necessary for Japan to pay utmost attention to them.

Development of Weapons of Mass Destruction and Missiles

-  In March 2013, North Korea adopted the so-called “new strategic
line” policy of simultaneous economic and nuclear development.

-  With regard to North Korea’s nuclear development, some have
argued that it is a so-called brinkmanship policy designed to
receive a reward of some sort. However, North Korea is deemed to
be developing nuclear weapons as an indispensable deterrent for
maintaining the existing regime.

-  North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests since 2006 and
has repeatedly hinted at further nuclear tests since March 2014,
raising international concerns.

-  Taking into account that North Korea has not changed its stance
of continuing its nuclear weapons program, it is believed that with
the passage of time, there would be a greater risk of North Korea
deploying a ballistic missile mounted with a nuclear warhead that
includes Japan in its range. In this regard, related developments
need to be monitored carefully.

-  It has been suggested that North Korea is developing a SubmarineLaunched Ballistic Missile (SLBM) and an SLBM-carrying submarine.
In May 2015, North Korea announced that it conducted a successful
test launch of the SLBM. It is deemed that North Korea intends to
diversify its attack capabilities and improve survivability. Furthermore,
it has been suggested that North Korea is carrying out significant
modification of its rocket launch tower in Tongch’ang-ri district. In
the future, North Korea could launch long-range ballistic missiles
which are larger compared to the past.

-  Should North Korea acquire longer-range ballistic missile capability
and achieve the miniaturization of nuclear weapons and acquired
nuclear warheads, and in turn have a false sense of confidence
and recognition that it secured strategic deterrence against the
United States, this could lead to increases in and the escalation of
military provocations by North Korea in the region and could create
situations that are deeply worrying also for Japan.

-  The ballistic missile launches since 2014 have demonstrated
improvements in the operational capabilities of North Korea’s
ballistic missile units, including surprise attack capabilities, with
several ballistic missiles launched from locations and at timings
as North Korea chooses. The North Korean ballistic missile threat
is increasing further.

-  The development of WMDs and missiles by North Korea constitutes,
coupled with its provocative words and actions, including missile
attacks against Japan, a serious and imminent threat to the
security of Japan. Additionally, such development poses a serious
challenge to the entire international community with regard to the
non-proliferation of weapons, including WMDs.


Domestic Affairs

-  Kim Jong-un, First Chairman of the National Defense Commission,
has conducted frequent personnel reshuffles, and individuals
selected by First Chairman Kim Jong-un have been assigned to
the key party, military, and cabinet posts. It is believed that the First
Chairman endeavors to strengthen and consolidate his regime as
its sole leader.

-  In 2014, the North Korean media stopped reporting the activities
of Kim Kyong-hui, Secretary of the Korean Workers’ Party and First
Chairman Kim Jong-un’s aunt. Meanwhile, the North Korean media
began to report the activities of the First Chairman’s younger sister,
Kim Yo-jong, as a senior member of the Korean Workers’ Party. It
is suggested that a generational change in the leadership may be
taking place among the Kim family.

-  The Kim Jong-un regime appears to be moving on track to a
certain degree. However, the chilling effect resulting from the
frequent personnel reshuffles, including dismissals, could propel
North Korea to turn to military provocative actions without making
sufficient diplomatic considerations. In addition, some point to
the concern over social control such as the increasing inequality
between the rich and the poor and the inflow of information
from abroad – a concern which needs to be monitored from the
perspective of regime stability.

Relations with Other Countries

-  China is a vital political and economic partner for North Korea and
maintains a degree of influence on North Korea. However, North
Korea does not necessarily adopt actions which are in line with
the position of China over nuclear and ballistic missile issues,
and mutual visits of senior officials have decreased. In this light,
relations between China and North Korea may be cooling on the
political and diplomatic domains. Given such circumstances, North
Korea-China relations will continue to be followed.

-  On the other hand, in 2014, North Korea intensified its diplomacy
with Russia. The year saw mutual visits by many senior officials as
well as advances in economic cooperation.

Situation of Activities in Japan s Surrounding Waters
and Airspace

-  In recent years, China is believed to be aiming to build up
capabilities to conduct operations in more distant waters and
airspace. Accordingly, China has rapidly expanded its maritime
activities based on sea power and air power, both qualitatively
and quantitatively. Such activities by China include dangerous acts
that could cause unintended consequences and are extremely
regrettable. China is urged to act on the basis of the principle of
the “rule of law”.

-  The Chinese government announced that it established the “East
China Sea ADIZ” including the Senkaku Islands which China
described as if they were a part of China’s “territory,” and that
the Chinese Armed Forces would take “defensive emergency
measures” in the case where aircraft does not follow the relevant
rules set forth by the Chinese Ministry of National Defense. These
measures unduly infringe the freedom of overfl ight over the high
seas, which is the general principle of international law. Japan
is demanding China to revoke any measures that go against the
principle of the freedom of overfl ight over the high seas.

-  The number of Chinese naval surface vessels advancing to
the Pacifi c Ocean has increased in recent years, and such
advancements are currently conducted routinely. It is understood
that China seeks to improve its deployment capabilities to the
open ocean.

-  With regard to the activities of Chinese government vessels, since
October 2013, the operations of government vessels intended
to intrude into terrirotial waters near the Senkaku Islands have
become routinized. In this light, an operations manual or other
codes may have been developed. Furthermore, China has striven
to develop larger government vessels and is proceeding with the
construction of the world’s largest 10,000-ton class patrol vessel.

-  It is thought that one of the objectives of China s maritime activities
is to weaken the control of other countries over the islands to which
China claims territorial sovereignty, while strengthening the claim
of its territorial sovereignty, through various surveillance activities
and use of force at sea and in airspace surrounding the islands.

-  In recent years, China has shown interest in taking steps to
avoid and prevent unexpected situations at sea. In April 2014,
China, together with other countries such as Japan and the
United States, agreed to the Code for Unplanned Encounters at
Sea (CUES). Additionally, in January 2015, Japanese and Chinese
defense authorities resumed the consultations to swiftly begin
the implementation of the Maritime and Air Communication
Mechanism. In November 2014, the United States and China
announced their agreement on two confi dence-building measures.

Situation of Activities in the South China Sea and
Indian Ocean

-  In August 2014, a Chinese fi ghter allegedly fl ew abnormally close
to and intercepted a U.S. Navy aircraft in the South China Sea.

-  China has pressed ahead with rapid and large-scale land
reclamation work in seven features in the Spratly Islands. On
some of them, it is considered that China is building infrastructure
including runways and ports, which has raised concerns among
the international community, including the United States.

-  A Song-class submarine conducted activities in the Indian Ocean
from September to October 2014, and is deemed to have called
at a port in Colombo, Sri Lanka, twice in the same year. As such
examples demonstrate, the Chinese Navy has improved its
capacity to execute operations in more distant waters, including
the Indian Ocean.

**Russia**



-  Russia has made clear its adversarial stance against the West and
other countries over Ukraine, which Russia considers is under its
sphere of influence. Even in the face of a severe economic situation,
Russia has continued to increase its defense budget and modernize
the Russian Armed Forces. Recently, Russia has intensified the
activities of the Russian Armed Forces not only in the Asia-Pacific,
but also in the Arctic, Europe, and areas near the U.S. mainland, and
there has been a trend to expand their area of activity.

-  In the Eastern Military District, including the Far East, the large-scale
exercise “Vostok 2014” participated by over 155,000 personnel

**Southeast Asia**


-  In the South China Sea, there are territorial disputes with China,
and recently, there has been growing friction with China. Since
May 2014, the Philippines and Vietnam have lodged protests
over China’s alleged activities, including land reclamation and
construction of runways at the reefs of the Spratly Islands.


was conducted in September 2014, in which the combat readiness
of units was assessed. In addition, an exercise was conducted in
the “Kuril Islands” that include the Northern Territories.

-  In Ukrainian territory, Russia has attempted to change the status
quo by force or coercion by engaging in “hybrid warfare,” in which
acts of aggression are carried out through methods that cannot
be clearly labeled an “armed attack” based on their outward form.
Russia’s action is recognized as a global issue that could impact
the entire international community, including Asia.

-  In recent years, Southeast Asian countries have increased their
defense spending against the backdrop of economic development
and other reasons, and are modernizing their military forces
focusing on inducting major equipment of their naval and air forces,
such as fourth-generation modern fighters and submarines.

**Trends in Regional Conflict and**
**International Terrorism**



-  An array of problems is at the root of conflicts occurring in recent
years in various parts of the world, including ethnicity, religion,
territory, and resources. In many cases, areas where civil wars or
regional conflicts have created or expanded a governance vacuum
have become a hotbed of the activities of terrorist organizations.
Among them are organizations which operate across national
borders and regions, which continue to pose imminent security
challenges to the international community. The presence of states
with weak governance has made it difficult to tackle risks such as
the pandemic and spread of infectious diseases.

-  As a general trend, with the advancement of globalization,
transnational terrorist organizations are using social media and
other cyber space tools to share information and conspire within
their own organizations or with other groups as well as to acquire


weapons and funds and recruit fighters. These organizations carry
out propaganda using tactical public relations strategies. ISIL has
gained strength by seizing the opportunity of the confusion in Syria
and Iraq. ISIL has an exceptionally substantial funding source, a
powerful military force which can stand face-to-face with a nation,
and de facto control of some territory, making ISIL a particularly
striking presence. Under these circumstances, organizations that
pledge allegiance to ISIL have emerged worldwide.

-  In developed countries, such as the United States and European
countries, there has been a rise in young people who sympathize
with the extremism of international terrorist organizations,
including ISIL, against the backdrop of dissatisfaction towards
estrangement from society, discrimination, poverty, and disparities.
In an increasing number of cases these people have joined the


-----

activities of international terrorist organizations as fighters and
conduct “home-grown” and “lone-wolf” terrorism activities in
their countries. Such developments have heightened the risk of
terrorism in developed countries, and Japan is not in any way
immune from it.

-  The proliferation of the threat of terrorism has gained momentum.
The diversification of its perpetrators, coupled with the growing
complexity of regional conflicts, has made it further more difficult to
prevent their occurrence. For this reason, international cooperation
on counter-terrorism measures has become even more important.

**Maritime Trends**


-  In the East China Sea and the South China Sea, it has become
increasingly common for countries to unilaterally assert their
rights or take actions, based on their unique assertions which are
incompatible with the existing international law and order. This has
caused situations of undue infringement upon the principles of
“freedom of navigation in the high seas” and “freedom of overflight
over the high seas.”

-  The Arctic states have been more proactively promoting efforts
to acquire their interest in resource development and use of

**Outer Space and Security**


-  Major countries make efforts to enhance the capabilities of a
variety of satellites and launch them for the purpose of enhancing
C[4]ISR* functions. Such satellites include image reconnaissance
satellites reconnoitering military facilities and targets, satellites
gathering radio wave information for military communications,
communication satellites for military communication, and
positioning satellites for navigating naval vessels and aircraft and


Currently, the international community as a whole is taking various
steps, including military actions as well as cutting off the funding
sources of terrorist organizations and preventing the international
movement of terrorist fighters.

-  The rapid and vast outbreak of the Ebola virus disease in West
Africa threatens the stability of the affected countries, which have
weak governance and poor crisis management capabilities, and
spread the disease to other countries in the West, shedding light
on the risk posed by the spread of infectious diseases seriously.

the sea route. The strategic importance of the Arctic Region is
thus increasing.

-  “Open and Stable Seas” constitute the basis for peace and
prosperity of the international community as a whole. In this
regard, each state has been tackling on its own or with others
various issues including piracy, unidentified vessels, illegal
dumping, contraband, human smuggling, maritime disasters, and
the removal of hazardous substances, for maintaining the stability
of sea lanes of communication.

enhancing the precision of weapons systems.

-  Meanwhile, as illustrated by China’s Anti-Satellite Test, the
development of anti-satellite weapons and the spread of space
debris have been noted as a threat against space assets such
as satellites owned by countries. In this regard, the risk to the
stable use of outer space has become one of the critical security
challenges countries face.



-  C[4]ISR: Stands for Command, Control, Communication, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance.


**Trends concerning Cyberspace**



-  For armed forces, information and communications form the
foundation of command and control, which extend from central
command to ground-level forces. In this regard, information
and communications technology (ICT) advancements are
further enhancing the dependence of units on information and
communication networks.

-  For this reason, cyber attacks are regarded as an asymmetrical
strategy capable of mitigating the strengths of adversaries by
exploiting the weaknesses of an adversary’s forces. It is believed
that many foreign military forces are developing offensive
capabilities in cyberspace.

-  Cyber attacks have frequently been carried out against the
information and communication networks of government


organizations and military forces of various countries. It has been
suggested that government organizations of China, Russia, North
Korea, and other countries have been involved. In addition, cyber
attacks have been growing more sophisticated and complicated
by the day. Cyber security has become one of the most important
security issues for countries.

-  There has been a movement to establish codes of conduct
in cyberspace. It has been suggested, however, that there is
disagreement between the countries’ assertions, with countries
such as the United States, European countries, and Japan calling
for maintaining free and unrestricted cyberspace, while many
countries such as Russia, China, and emerging countries call for
strengthening the national control of cyberspace.

**Outline of the National Security Strategy**



-  The National Security Strategy (NSS) clearly defines the following
as Japan’s national interests and national security objectives to
achieve its fundamental principle of continuing the path it has
followed as a peace-loving nation, and proactive contribution
to peace based on the principle of international cooperation:
maintaining sovereignty and independence; defending territorial
integrity; ensuring the lives, property and safety of citizens;
economic development; and maintaining and protecting the
international order based on rules and universal values.

-  The NSS clearly defines the security environment surrounding
Japan and national security challenges on a global level as well as
in the Asia-Pacific region.

-  The NSS specifies the strategic approach centering on diplomatic
policy and defense policy that Japan should implement, such as
the establishment of a comprehensive defense architecture to
protect Japan.

-  Based on the NSS, the National Defense Program Guidelines
(NDPG) specify basic policies for Japan’s future defense, the role of
its defense capabilities, and objectives for specific SDF equipment.

**Outline of the National Defense Program Guidelines**


-  Based on the NSS, the basic policy consists of the following:
(1) Japan’s own efforts; (2) strengthening of the Japan-U.S.
Alliance; and (3) active promotion of security cooperation.

-  The NDPG states that Japan will build up a Dynamic Joint
Defense Force by conducting capability assessments based on
joint operations to enhance deterrence and response capabilities
by pursuing further joint operations, improving the operational
standards of defense equipment, and further increasing defense
activities, as well as ensuring the necessary and sufficient quality
and quantity of defense capabilities underpinning various activities.

-  As an effective means of deterrence and response to various
situations, Japan will achieve intelligence superiority through
persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR)
activities over an extensive area around Japan. In addition, Japan
will ensure a posture that emphasizes the following points:
(1) ensuring the security of the sea and airspace surrounding
Japan; (2) response to an attack on remote islands; (3) response
to ballistic missile attacks; (4) responses in outer space and
cyberspace; and (5) responses to major disasters.

-  As part of Japan’s efforts towards the stabilization of the AsiaPacific region and improvement of the global security environment,
Japan will conduct persistent ISR in the area surrounding Japan,
and implement activities such as training and exercises in a timely
and appropriate manner. Moreover, Japan will promote multi-tiered
initiatives, including bilateral and multilateral defense cooperation
and exchange, joint training and exercises, and capacity building
assistance. Japan will actively promote international peace
cooperation activities, anti-piracy measures, and capacity building
assistance, among other activities.

-  To ensure that the defense force can function as effectively as
possible, Japan will strengthen the foundations underpinning the
defense force.

**Stationing of the U.S. Forces**



-  The United States is proceeding with the force posture realignment
of the U.S. Forces in Japan in order to mitigate the impact on local
communities, such as those in Okinawa, while maintaining the
deterrence capabilities of the U.S. Forces. In Okinawa, the United
States is taking such measures as the relocation of MCAS Futenma,
the transfer of Marines in Okinawa to Guam and the return of land
south of Kadena.

-  The Government of Japan believes that it is imperative not to allow
MCAS Futenma to remain indefinitely at its current location, which
is in the vicinity of houses and schools in the center of Ginowan City,
Okinawa Prefecture. This is believed to be a fundamental idea shared
between the Government of Japan and the people of Okinawa. As for
the relocation of MCAS Futenma, the Government of Japan has not
changed its stance that the current plan to construct the Futenma
Replacement facility in the Camp-Schwab Henokosaki area and
adjacent waters is the only solution to avoid the continued use of


MCAS Futenma. Japan plans to make further efforts to achieve the
relocation and return of MCAS Futenma as early as possible and to
mitigate the burden on Okinawa in a timely manner.

-  The relocation of MCAS Futenma holds more significance than
merely moving the facility from one location to another. Rather, it
also contributes greatly to mitigating the impact on Okinawa. As
such, the government will work as one to implement this initiative.

-  Regarding the Futenma Replacement Facility construction project,
in addition to complying with the relevant laws and regulations,
including completing the environmental impact assessment and the
application for approval of the reclamation of publicly-owned waters,
the Government of Japan has devoted ample time to completing all
necessary procedures, including soliciting the opinions of the people
of Okinawa Prefecture. On that basis, the Government of Japan
commenced offshore boring survey work on August 14, 2014.


The Geopolitical Positioning of Okinawa and the Significance of the U.S. Marine Corps Stationed in Okinawa


**Okinawa holds a position of great**
**strategic importance**

**1. Reasons for Stationing the U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa**
Compared to locations such as the U.S. mainland, Hawaii and
Guam, Okinawa is closer to various regions in East Asia.
⇒ In the event where urgent deployment within this region is
required, the U.S. military in Okinawa can respond rapidly.

**Effective Deterrence and Response**


Ensuring Security of Sea and Airspace Surrounding Japan

-  The SDF persistently engages in warning and surveillance activities
in the waters and airspace surrounding Japan in peacetime so
that it can respond to various contingencies immediately and
seamlessly.

-  In FY2014, the ASDF aircraft scrambled 943 times, a significant
increase by 133 in comparison with the previous fiscal year. This
is the second largest number since 1958 when the ASDF started
taking strict anti-territory intrusion measures.

-  In 2014, there were seven incidents of activity by Chinese Navy
vessels involving the passage through the southwestern islands, and
also another incident of such activities confirmed in waters south
of Okinawa.

-  In December 2012, a fixed-wing aircraft (Y-12) of the Chinese

Russian Air Force intruded into Japanese airspace in the vicinity
of Okinoshima, Fukuoka Prefecture. Moreover, September 9 of the
same year, an incident where a presumably unmanned aircraft of
unidentified nationality flew over the East China Sea. The ASDF
urgently scrambled fighters in response to these incidents.

-  Even after the establishment of the “East China Sea Air Defense
Identification Zone” by China in November 2013, the MOD and the
SDF have been implementing warning and surveillance activities,
in addition to other existing activities, in the East China Sea. The
MOD and the SDF have also decided to continue engaging in strict
airspace anti-intrusion measures.

Defense of Japan’s Remote Islands

-  Japan possesses a number of remote islands. In order to respond
to attacks on these islands, the SDF will position units and so
forth in the area, and will detect signs at an early stage through
Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) conducted by
the SDF in peacetime. By conducting a joint operation involving the
GSDF, ASDF, and MSDF, troops will be expeditiously deployed and
concentrated in an area expected to be attacked, and will deter
and remove enemy attacks. If, by any chance, islands are captured
without any signs detected in advance, the enemy will be brought
under control by ground fire from aircraft and vessels, and then
tactical operations will be implemented to regain the islands by the
landing of SDF forces and taking other initiatives.

-  The MOD and SDF will strengthen the country’s defense foundation
from peacetime, by newly forming a coast observation unit in
Yonaguni Island and establish an “Amphibious Rapid Deployment


Brigade (provisional name)” equipped with a full function for
amphibious operations, and will establish the 9th Air Wing at Naha
Air Base.

-  For the purpose of developing a persistent Intelligence, Surveillance,
and Reconnaissance (ISR) posture and an immediate response
system, acquisition of fixed-wing patrol aircraft (P-1) and aegis
equipped destroyers (DDG) will be implemented.

-  In order to secure capabilities for swift and large-scale transportation
and deployment of units, the improvement of Osumi class transport
LST (Landing Ship, Tank) and overseas research to review the role of
multipurpose vessels will be conducted, and at the same time, V-22
Ospreys will be introduced to enhance rapid deployment capabilities.

-  In January through March of 2015, the GSDF and US Marine
Corps conducted a field training exercise (Iron Fist) in California to
improve amphibious operational capabilities.

Response to Ballistic Missile Attacks

-  Japan’s BMD is based on an effective multi-tier defense system using
Aegis-equipped destroyers and Patriot PAC-3, interconnected and
coordinated by the Japan Aerospace Defense Ground Environment
(JADGE).

-  The additional TPY-2 radar was deployed to the U.S. Kyogamisaki
Communication Site in December 2014.

-  North Korea repeatedly engaged in a variety of provocative acts,
including an implication of missile launches in both 2014 and
2015. Under such circumstances, the MOD and the SDF continue
to be ready to take every necessary measure to protect the lives
and properties of the nation in any potential situation.

Initiatives towards Ensuring Maritime Security

-  In order to ensure the safety of maritime transport, the MOD and
the SDF promote various kinds of initiatives such as implementing
counter-piracy activities, providing capacity building assistance
to coastal countries, and enhancing joint exercises and practices
using a variety of opportunities.

Responses in space

-  From the perspective of further promoting cooperation in the space
field between the defense authorities in Japan and the U.S., the
“Space Cooperation Working Group (SCWG)” was established
based on the instruction given in the Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial
Talk in April 2015. Making use of this working group, reviews will
be further promoted in broader fields such as: 1. promotion of
policy-related consultation regarding space, 2. closer information
sharing, 3. cooperation for nurturing and securing experts,
4. implementation of tabletop exercises.

The Whole-of-Government approach

-  In March 2014, a “Cyber Defense Group” was established under the
SDF C4 (Command, Control, Communication & Computers) Systems
Command.

-  The “Cyber Defense Policy Working Group” (CDPWG) has been set
up as a framework between the defense authorities of the U.S.
and Japan, under which opinion exchange is conducted by experts
regarding various cooperation fields on Japan-U.S. information
**Build-Up of Defense Capability in FY2015**


-  Japan will steadily build up its defense capability during FY2015, which
serves as the second fiscal year under the NDPG and new MTDP, to
establish a Dynamic Joint Defense Force, based on these programs.

-  Japan will improve its defense capabilities in order to seamlessly


sharing, human resources exchanges, and other themes. In May
2015, the Japan-U.S. joint declaration was issued, indicating the
specific direction for future Japan-U.S. cooperation.

-  In 2013, the “Cyber Defense Council” (CDC) was set up, having
around ten companies in the defense industry as its core members,
and efforts are being made to improve capacities to counter cyber
attacks through joint exercise and other initiatives.

Response to Large-Scale Disasters

-  When disasters such as natural disasters occur, the SDF works
in collaboration with municipal governments, engaging in various
activities such as the search for and rescue of disaster victims
or missing ships or aircraft, controlling floods, offering medical
treatment, preventing epidemics, supplying water, and transporting
personnel and goods.

-  In August 2014, a landslide occurred in Hiroshima City in Hiroshima
Prefecture due to heavy rain. The SDF conducted lifesaving operations
and searches for missing persons deploying approximately
14,970 personnel. In September of the same year, a volcanic
eruption occurred on Mount Ontake. In order for the SDF to
conduct lifesaving operations and searches for missing persons
in cooperation with the municipality, police, fire department, and
other relevant organizations, approximately 7,150 personnel were
dispatched for disaster relief.

GSDF personnel conducting disaster relief mission related to Mount Ontake Eruption

Transport of Japanese Nationals Overseas, etc.

-  The SDF will protect the Japanese nationals and other parties in
the destination country of a dispatch operation, and safely guide
and transport them to aircraft, ships or vehicles. To this end, the
SDF maintains operational readiness, with the GSDF designating
helicopter unit and leading transport unit personnel, the MSDF
designating vessels such as transport ships (including boarded

**Human Foundation and Organization**
**that Supports the Defense Force**



-  In order to exert their defense capabilities with the maximum
effectiveness, it is necessary that the MOD and the SDF enhance
and reinforce their human foundation. Since the various activities
of the MOD and the SDF are only feasible if understanding and
cooperation is received from the Japanese people, as well as
local authorities, it is necessary to further deepen the mutual trust
between the SDF, and local communities and the people.

-  In January 2015, the MOD formulated the “Action Plan for promoting

**Measures on Defense Equipment**


The Current Status of Defense Production and
Technological Bases, and the Strategy on Defense
Production and Technological Bases

-  In light of the current severe financial situation and the
reorganization of European and American enterprises, as well
as progress in international joint development, the “Strategy on
Defense Production and Technological Bases” was formulated
in June 2014. The Strategy included various measures for
maintaining and strengthening Japan’s defense production and
technological bases, and indicated the current situation and future
direction of each defense equipment field.


the Active Participation of the Female Employees and Work-Life
Balance,” which incorporated three reforms – “Working style
reform,” “Reform to realize a successful career with a balanced
life between child-rearing and nursing, etc.,” and “Reform for
promoting successful female personnel” – in order to promote
the work-life balance of the personnel in a unified manner whilst
promoting further recruitment and promotion of female personnel.

Improvement of the contract system

-  Following the enactment of the “Bill concerning special measures
on the upper limit of acts that incur national debt with respect to
specific defense procurement,” the MOD will realize the reduction of
procurement costs for equipment and services associated with the
introduction of a “long-term contract” as well as stable procurement.

-  A cross-functional Integrated Project Team (IPT) headed by a Project
Manager (PM) has been established for the acquisition of primary
defense equipment, and the development of a system in which
projects can be managed in a unified way from conception to disposal
is in progress.


-----

Research and Development

-  As part of these initiatives, the MOD’s own funding program called
“Innovative Science & Technology Initiative for Security” (competitive
funding) was newly established in FY2015 to discover creative research
conducted by the universities, research institutes and companies
etc. that are noted for their application of defense equipment, and to
nurture emerging research that is deemed promising.

Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation

-  Based on the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment
and Technology, Japan promotes cooperation in defense equipment
and technology with other countries in order to contribute
to promoting the maintenance and enhancement of defense
production and technological bases, as well as contributing to the
promotion of peace and international cooperation.

-  Since 1992, Japan has implemented 19 joint research projects and
1 joint development project with the U.S. In addition, the Japanese
government has been working to enable the involvement of
Japanese companies in the manufacturing process of the
production of F-35A and to establish upgrading facilities.

-  In July 2013, Japan launched a joint research project with the U.K.,
the first country other than the United States in this regard.

-  Japan and France signed the Japan-France Agreement concerning
the Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology in March 2015.

**Defense Cooperation and Exchanges**
**with Other Countries**


The international community today is facing an increasing number
of challenges, which are extremely difficult for one country to deal
with on its own. Therefore, it is important to strengthen bilateral
and multilateral security cooperation, as well as proactively engage
in international peace cooperation activities, from the perspective
of “proactive contribution to peace” based on the principle of
international cooperation.

Initiatives under Multilateral Security Framework and Dialogue

-  Based on the proposal by Prime Minister Abe at the ASEAN-Japan
Commemorative Summit in December 2013, the Japan-ASEAN
Defense Ministers’ Roundtable Meeting took place in Myanmar in
November 2014. At the Shangri-La Dialogue held in May 2015,
Minister of Defense Nakatani delivered a speech at the second
plenary session.

-  In order to enthusiastically and actively create stability within the
region and improve the global security environment, the MOD is
actively working on capacity building assistance.

Defense Cooperation and Exchanges with Other Countries

-  Australia: At the Japan-Australia Summit Meeting in July 2014,
Prime Minister Abe described the relationship between the two
countries as a “Special Strategic Partnership for the 21st Century
” and signed the Agreement on the Transfer of Defence Equipment
and Technology between Japan and Australia.

-  South Korea: In December 2014, the defense authorities of Japan,
the U.S., and the ROK signed the “Japan-U.S.-ROK Information
Sharing Agreement among the Defense Authorities,” which has
enabled the defense authorities from the three countries to share
security secrets regarding the threat of the North Korea’s nuclear
weapon and missiles



-  In May 2015, Japan decided to commence consultations with
Australia, together with the participation of companies from the
private sector to examine what kind of cooperation Japan can
provide for the Australian Future Submarine Program.

-  With India, three Joint Working Group (JWG) meetings have been
held to facilitate bilateral cooperation for the US-2 aircraft.

-  Between the Association of South-East Asia Nations (ASEAN) and Japan,
exchanges of views are taking place regarding defense equipment and
technology cooperation in non-traditional security sectors.

Ensuring maritime security

-  For Japan, a major maritime state, strengthening order on the seas
based on such fundamental principles as the rule of law and the
freedom of navigation, as well as ensuring safe maritime transport,
is the foundation for its peace and prosperity. For this reason, in
cooperation with the relevant countries, Japan will support antipiracy operations, as well as promoting various initiatives including
assistance for capacity building in this fi eld for coastal states, and
making the most of various opportunities to enhance joint training
and exercises in waters other than those in the immediate vicinity

**Overview**


**Section 1 Trends in the International Community**


The security environment surrounding Japan has
become increasingly severe, with various challenges and
destabilizing factors becoming more tangible and acute.
Even after the end of the Cold War, interstate conf icts
remain in the periphery of Japan, and as such, this region has
not witnessed major changes in the security environment
as were observed in Europe. Opaque and uncertain factors
such as territorial disputes and reunif cation issues remain.
There has been also a tendency towards an increase in and
prolongation of so-called “gray-zone” situations, that is,
neither pure peacetime nor contingencies over territory,
sovereignty, and maritime economic interests[1]. In addition,
there has been a noticeable trend among neighboring
countries to modernize and reinforce their military
capabilities and to intensify their military activities. In this
regard, security challenges and destabilizing factors in the
Asia-Pacif c region including the area surrounding Japan
are becoming more serious.
In a global security environment, interdependence
among countries has expanded and deepened with
globalization and rapid advances in technological
innovations. At the same time, there is a growing risk
that unrest or a security problem in a single country or
region could immediately develop into a challenge or
destabilizing factor for the entire international community.
Recently, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)[2]
has gained strength in Iraq and Syria. As illustrated by
these developments, there has been a trend in the activities
of international terrorist organizations gaining momentum
and expanding once again. Furthermore, in Ukraine, Russia
has engaged in so-called “hybrid warfare”[3] that is diff cult
to identify def nitively as an armed attack by a country, and
has attempted to change the status quo by force or coercion.


While the international community has strongly condemned
and imposed sanctions against Russia, the pre-conf ict
situation has still not been restored, leaving challenges for
the international response. In addition, the recent spate of
cyber attacks has become more sophisticated and complex
by the day, with government involvement suggested in
various attacks. In this context, there are increasing risks to
the stable use of cyberspace.
Under these circumstances, the United States, while
faced with a diff cult f nancial situation, has made clear
that it would continue to pursue the policy of focusing
its strategies, including the National Security Strategy,
more towards the Asia-Pacif c region, and strengthening
its relations with allies in the region (rebalance to the
Asia-Pacif c region). In addition, the United States has
made a clear commitment to continue playing a leading
role in tackling global security challenges, based on the
recognition that it is the only country capable of leading
the international community. Furthermore, with expanding
and deepening interdependence, major countries have
a growing shared interest in building a more stable
international security environment. For example, they have
taken steps to avoid and prevent unforeseen consequences
in the maritime domain, implemented coalition-led military
activities against ISIL as part of the “War on terror,” and
engaged in diplomatic efforts at the summit level to prevent
the further escalation of regional conf icts. Increasingly,
countries with a shared interest in resolving issues are
working together to take proactive responses to achieve
regional and global stability.
The multi-polarization of the world continues as a
result of shifts in the balance of power due to the economic
development and extension of political inf uence of


So-called “gray-zone” situations concisely describe a broad range of situations, that is, neither pure peacetime nor contingencies. For example, they could involve the following circumstances:
1) Conflicting assertions between states, etc., over territory, sovereignty, economic interests including maritime interests, and other forms of rights and interests;
2) Not relying only on diplomatic negotiation among parties for a party to make its country’s assertions or demands, or to have the other party accept said assertions or demands; and
3) Showing physical presence frequently, or attempting or making changes to the status quo in an area related to the dispute by using armed organizations or other means to the extent that it does
not constitute armed attack, in order to appeal a party’s assertion or demand or to force acceptance of it.

ISIL stands for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. ISIL has become the common term in the documentation of the international community, including United Nations Security Council resolutions.

While various explanations have been offered for so-called “hybrid warfare,” in this white paper, the term is used to mean, “aggression conducted by methods that are diffi cult to identify defi nitively
as ‘armed attack’ based on their outward appearance, involving a combination of non-military means, such as sabotage and information manipulation, and military means which are utilized covertly.”
With regard to the recent situation in Ukraine, the United States and European nations note that there was clear and direct Russian military intervention. Russia, on the other hand, has consistently


-----

countries such as China, India and Russia, and the relative
change of inf uence of the United States. Increases in
demand for natural resources, energy, and food stemming
from economic growth in emerging countries and a
larger middle class are expected to further intensify the
international competition for these resources. Against this
backdrop, changes in or denial of the existing regional
and international order, or assertions and activities to
secure economic interests could become more tangible and
acute. This in turn could lead to increases in “gray-zone”
situations and regional conf icts in the future.
Additionally, the rapid spread of the Internet and ICT
networks, including social media – one of the key factors
of globalization – have given non-state actors a much
greater ability to disseminate their opinions and assertions
as well as mobilize supporters, and by extension, have
signif cantly increased their inf uence on countries and
the international community. For example, criticism of a
nation sent out by an individual, or extremism disseminated
by an international terrorist organization, have tended to
propagate and spread explosively or be transmitted across
the world by ICT networks. Controlling these activities
have become increasingly challenging even for countries
like authoritarian nations with strong control over their


people, as well as for the international community that
strives to contain the operations of international terrorist
organizations. As a result, countries have been forced to
pay greater considerations to public opinion on domestic
governance and management of state affairs. At the same
time, the international community is faced with more
complex issues which need to be resolved and which are
increasingly diff cult to address.
In addition, it is believed that national security decisionmaking is more complex than ever before, as some nations
have important economic relationships despite differences
in fundamental values and strategic interests, as seen in the
case of Europe and Russia with regard to the Ukraine issue
in 2014.
The security challenges and destabilizing factors in the
international community which has these characteristics
are complex, diverse, and wide-ranging, and it is becoming
ever more diff cult for a single country to deal with them
on its own. In this context, it is increasingly important
for countries which share interests in regional and global
stability to cooperate and actively respond to security
challenges. Cross-cutting government efforts are also
critical to overcome these challenges.


**Section 2 Asia Pacific Security Environment**


In the Asia-Pacif c region, alongside the various changes
that have taken place with the increase in power of China
and other nations, countries in the region have made
efforts to enhance and strengthen specif c and practical
intra-regional coordination and collaboration with a
particular focus on non-traditional security f elds such as
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. In addition,
defense authorities in the region have made progress on
efforts to avoid and prevent unforeseen consequences in the
maritime domain. On the other hand, this region abounds
in political, economic, ethnic, and religious diversity,
and confrontational relations between countries/regions
remain even after the end of the Cold War. In addition, their
views on security and threats are different, and therefore,
the kinds of major changes in the security environment
seen in Europe after the end of the Cold War have yet to
emerge, and long-standing issues of territorial rights and
reunif cation continue to remain in the region.
In the Korean Peninsula, the Korean people have
been divided for more than half a century, and the faceoff
continues between the military forces of the Republic of
Korea (ROK) and North Korea. There are issues concerning
Taiwan and the South China Sea. Furthermore, with regard
to Japan, territorial disputes over the Northern Territories
and Takeshima, both of which are inherent parts of the


territory of Japan, remain unresolved.
On top of this, recent years have seen a continued
tendency towards the prolongation of “gray-zone”
situations, raising concerns that they may develop into more
serious situations in the absence of a clear path towards the
resolution of the situations.
In North Korea, following the change of regime that
made First Chairman of the National Defense Commission
(NDC) Kim Jong-un the leader of the country, many
personnel reshuff es have taken place, primarily involving
key posts of the party, military, and cabinet. In this
way, it is deemed that measures continue to be taken to
tighten the regime’s grip and to strengthen the regime to
make NDC First Chairman Kim Jong-un the sole leader.
North Korea is military-focused and deploys a massive
military force. It is also proceeding with the development,
deployment, transfer, and proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction (WMDs), including nuclear weapons, and
ballistic missiles, and it maintains a large-scale special
operations force. Through these activities, North Korea
continues to maintain and strengthen asymmetrical military
capabilities[4]. In particular, North Korea’s ballistic missile
development has presumably entered a new stage as a result
of technological improvements through a series of missile
launches. In addition, recently, North Korea has engaged in


Asymmetrical military capabilities, in this context, refer to means of attack different from those of an opponent with superior conventional military capabilities. Such measures are exploited to


-----

not only research and development of ballistic missiles, but
has also intensif ed activities to increase their operational
capabilities, including surprise attack. As for nuclear
weapon development, the Six-Party Talks, which aim at
achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,
have been suspended since late 2008. North Korea has
conducted nuclear tests in def ance of calls of restraint
from the international community, so the possibility cannot
be ruled out that it has successfully miniaturized nuclear
weapons for warheads and enabled them to be equipped on
ballistic missiles. With the passage of time, it is considered
that there is a growing risk that North Korea would deploy
ballistic missiles mounted with a nuclear warhead that have
ranges covering Japan. Moreover, there is a possibility that
North Korea is developing nuclear weapons using highlyenriched uranium. North Korea has repeated provocative
rhetoric and behavior against related countries including
Japan, especially in 2013, emphasizing that Japan is within
the range of its missiles, referring to specif c Japanese
cities. Such North Korean military trends constitute a
serious destabilizing factor to the security not only of Japan
but of the entire region and the international community.
Therefore, Japan needs to pay utmost attention to such
activities. North Korea’s abduction of Japanese nationals,
a grave issue concerning the sovereignty of Japan and
the lives and security of the Japanese people, is yet to
be resolved. A solution will require concrete actions by
North Korea.
Today, China has signif cant inf uence in the
international community. Accordingly, China is strongly
expected to recognize its responsibility in the international
community, accept and comply with international norms,
and play an active in a more cooperative manner in
regional and global issues. In the meantime, China has
been continuously increasing its defense budget at a high
level and has been rapidly reinforcing its military in a wide
range of areas. As part of such effort, China is believed to
be making efforts to strengthen its asymmetrical military
capabilities to prevent military activity by other countries
in the region by denying access and deployment of foreign
militaries to its surrounding areas (so-called “AntiAccess/Area-Denial” [“A2/AD”] capabilities[5], as well
as to build its structure for joint operations and enhance
combat-oriented military trainings. China has not clearly
stated the purposes and goals of the military buildup,
and transparency concerning its decision making process
on military and security matters is not fully achieved. In
addition, China is rapidly expanding and intensifying its
activities in the maritime and aerial domains in the region
including in the East China Sea and South China Sea. In
particular, China has continued to take assertive actions
with regard to issues of conf icts of interest in the maritime


domain, as exemplif ed by its attempts to change the status
quo by coercion, and has signaled its position to realize its
unilateral assertions without making any compromises. As
for the seas and airspace around Japan, China has intruded
into Japanese territorial waters frequently by its government
ships, and has engaged in dangerous activities that could
cause unforeseen consequences, such as its vessel’s
direction of f re control radar at a JMSDF destroyer, the
f ight of f ghters abnormally close to JSDF aircraft, and
its announcement of establishing the “East China Sea Air
Defense Identif cation Zone (ADIZ)” based on its own
assertion thereby infringing the freedom of overf ight
over the high seas. In the South China Sea, China has also
intensif ed friction with countries in the surrounding area
by proceeding rapidly with land reclamation projects in
multiple reefs, among other activities, based on China’s
unilateral assertion of sovereignty. In addition, a Chinese
f ghter is alleged to have f own abnormally close to and
conducted an intercept of a U.S. Forces aircraft. As Japan
has great concern about these Chinese activities, it will
need to pay utmost attention to them, as these activities
also raise concerns over regional and global security. This
is why China is asked to further increase transparency
regarding its military and why further strengthening of
mutual understanding and trust by promoting dialogue and
exchanges with China is an important issue. Against this
backdrop, recently, China has begun to actively respond to
the calls to take measures to avoid and prevent unforeseen
consequences in the maritime domain. It is strongly hoped
that progress on these efforts supplements the existing order
based on international law and leads to enhancing China’s
compliance with international norms.
Russia, while perceiving the buildup of an aff uent
nation as its task for the present, attaches importance to
becoming an inf uential power based on the deployment of
its new economic, cultural, and military might. Against the
backdrop of its economic development, Russia has promoted
the strengthening of the readiness of its Armed Forces and
the development and induction of new equipment, while
continuing to give priority to its nuclear force. Recently, a
confrontational relationship has developed between Russia
and such countries as the United States and European
nations over Ukraine which Russia deems is part of its
sphere of inf uence. Under these circumstances, Russia
faces a severe economic situation due to falling crude oil
prices, a plunging ruble, and the impacts of EU and U.S.
economic sanctions, among other factors. On the other
hand, even as expenditure cuts are made in a wide range of
areas, Russia has continued to increase defense spending
and modernize its Armed Forces. Recently, Russia has
intensif ed its military activities not only in the Asia-Pacif c
region, but also in the Arctic, Europe, and the periphery


Anti-Access (A2) is a concept introduced by the United States and refers to capabilities, usually long-range, designed to prevent an opposing force from entering an operational area. Area-Denial (AD)
refers to capabilities, usually of shorter range, designed to limit an opposing force’s freedom of action within the operational area. Weapons used for A2/AD include ballistic missiles, cruise missiles,

of mainland United States, and has been expanding the
area of activities. In the Far East, the Russian Armed
Forces has conducted large-scale exercises. Furthermore,
in the territory of Ukraine, Russia has engaged in “hybrid
warfare” that is diff cult to identify def nitively as an armed
attack by a country, and has attempted to change the status
quo by force or coercion. This is recognized as a global
issue that could affect the entire international community,
including Asia.
As seen above, in the Asia-Pacif c region, where the
security environment has increasingly grown severe, the
presence of the U.S. Forces remains extremely important
in order to achieve regional stability. Accordingly, Japan
and other countries, such as Australia and the ROK, have
established bilateral alliances and partnerships with the
United States, and allow the stationing and deployment


of U.S. Forces in their territories. In addition, the U.S.
Forces have recently taken measures to further strengthen
their presence.

See Fig. I-0-2-1 (Major Military Forces in the Asia-Pacific Region (Approximate
Strength))

Moreover, opportunities for bilateral defense
exchanges between countries in the region have increased
in recent years. Multilateral security dialogues, including
the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the ASEAN Defense
Ministers’ Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus), conferences
hosted by non-governmental institutions with the
participation of relevant defense ministers, and bilateral
and multilateral joint exercises are held. Promoting and
developing such multi-layered approaches among countries
is also important to ensure stability in the region.

**Section 3 Global Security Issues**

A range of regional conf icts still exists across the globe,
which have complex and diverse backgrounds and
forms. Especially in the Middle East and Africa, against
the backdrop of the turmoil, civil war, and regional
conf ict that followed the “Arab Spring,” areas which
lack national governance have expanded. In many cases,
international terrorist organizations made inroads in these
areas, expanded their organizations, and intensif ed their
activities. These cases have made regional conf icts more
complex, making it increasingly challenging for nations
and regional organizations with conf icts in their regions
to address and resolve them, as well as for the international
community. On the other hand, climate change and
competition between sovereign nations to secure resources
and energy could become more tangible and cause regional
disputes, and in such ways, become a new factor that
affects the global security environment. Furthermore, even
as the various functions of military forces are utilized more
to conduct prompt rescue activities in response to largescale natural disasters and outbreaks of infectious diseases,
the presence of countries with weak governance has made
it more diff cult to deal with risks such as the explosive
outbreak and spread of infectious diseases.
The proliferation of WMDs, such as nuclear,
biological, and chemical (NBC) weapons, and ballistic
missiles that serve as the means of delivery of WMD is
still viewed as a signif cant threat to the international
community. In particular, there are continuing concerns
about the acquisition and use of WMDs by non-state actors,
such as international terrorist organizations. In this regard,
under the leadership of the Nuclear Security Summit, the
international community continues to pursue efforts to
counter terrorism activities that utilize nuclear materials
and other radioactive substances. Meanwhile, with regard to
Iran’s nuclear program, the United States and the European
Union (EU) have strengthened sanctions against Iran, while
engaging in discussions with Iran. They agreed on the Joint
Plan of Action in 2013 aimed at a comprehensive resolution
of the nuclear issue, and continue to hold negotiations
to reach a f nal comprehensive agreement. In addition,
initiatives which focus on nuclear non-proliferation and
disarmament are under way, such as the new Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) entering into force
between the United States and Russia in 2011.
There has been a growing tendency for the threat of
international terrorism to spread rapidly. The diversif cation
of actors that carry out acts of terrorism, coupled with the
increasing complexity of regional conf icts, have made
the prevention of terrorism even more challenging. As the
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) demonstrates,
terrorist organizations have emerged which, unlike
conventional terrorist organizations, are well funded and
have powerful and sophisticated military capabilities By


making effective use of the Internet and social media for
the organizations’ propaganda purposes, they communicate
their extremism and gain multiple followers and new
members around the world. In addition, the United States,
European nations, and elsewhere face concerns over
the threat of so-called “home-grown” and “lone-wolf”
terrorism – namely, acts of terrorism perpetrated in the home
country singlehandedly by those who experienced combat
in a conf ict area and returned to their home country, or
those who have become inf uenced by extremism, among
others. This has increased the risk of terrorism occurring
in developed countries. In view of the terrorist incident
regarding the murder of Japanese which took place in Syria
in early 2015, it cannot be said that Japan is immune from
the threat of international terrorism.
Securing the stable use of global commons such as sea,
air, outer space, and cyberspace is becoming a signif cant
security challenge for the international community. The
growing attention paid in the f eld of international security
to outer space and cyberspace, which cannot be perceived
from a conventional geographical perspective, stems
from the increasing dependence of social infrastructure
and military activities on outer space and cyberspace for
various reasons such as further developments in military
and science technology and the recent dramatic advances
in information and communications technology (ICT). On
the other hand, in recent years, concrete initiatives aimed at
strengthening an entire country’s response capabilities that
include private companies have been under way in various
countries, in order to deal with cyber attacks on a range of
government and military information and communication
networks and key infrastructure, some of which allegedly
have the involvement of government agencies. There is
also an effort in the international community to establish a
code of conduct in cyberspace. With regard to the maritime
domain, which has been regarded as a fundamental means
for supporting international trade, piracy acts have taken
place in various parts of the world, and there have been
cases where countries unilaterally assert their rights and
take action based on their own assertion that is inconsistent
with the existing international maritime law and order,
thereby unduly infringing the freedom of navigation on and
f ight over the high seas. In response to these situations, the
international community has been taking various measures
such as continuing to dispatch vessels and other assets to
conduct anti-piracy operations in relevant waters including
off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, sharing
the view on the importance of international norms including
freedom of navigation, and initiatives designed to avoid and
prevent unforeseen consequences in the maritime domain.
As seen above, the international community today faces
diverse, complex, and multilayered security challenges and
destabilizing factors These challenges could even occur


-----

simultaneously or compound one another. In addition
to deterrence and handling of armed conf icts, the roles
of military forces in responding to these challenges are
becoming so diverse that they include a broad spectrum
of activities from conf ict prevention to reconstruction
assistance. Moreover, as opportunities for military forces
to play such an important role increase, comprehensive
responses are required that combine military capacity with
other capacities such as diplomacy, law enforcement and
justice, intelligence, and the economy.
Developments in science and technology, as
represented by the great leaps forward in ICT in recent
years, have also had spillover effects on the military. The
United States and other developed countries put emphasis


on research and development of new technologies including
those for precision guidance, unmanned vehicles, and
stealth capability, while actively seeking international joint
development and production to address rising development
and production costs and the deterioration of the national
f scal situation. On the other hand, states and non-state
actors without cutting-edge technology are anticipated
to develop and acquire WMDs and asymmetrical means
of attack such as cyber attacks, while acquiring the
technologies of developed countries in an illicit manner.
How these trends in military science and technology will
unfold is expected to have signif cant effects on military
strategies and military balance in the future.

**Chapter** **Defense Policies of Countries**
##### 1


**Section 1 The United States**

**1** **Security and Defense Policies**


As the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq spanning more than a
decade draw to a close, the patterns of U.S. involvement in
the world are changing. While faced with a severe f nancial
situation, the United States is anticipated to continue to play
a role in the peace and stability of the world by drawing on
its world-leading, comprehensive national power.
In February 2015, President Barack Obama
unveiled his administration’s second National Security
Strategy (NSS). It presented the U.S. strategic policy
for the remaining two years of his presidency. The NSS
underscores that the United States would continue to play a
leading role in tackling a variety of challenges, such as the
threat of terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction (WMDs), and cyber attacks, as well as advance
a rules-based international order and take collective action
with its allies and partners, while continuing to pursue the
four national interests outlined in the 2010 NSS: (1) The
security of the United States, its citizens, and U.S. allies
and partners; (2) A strong, innovative, and growing U.S.
economy that promotes prosperity; (3) Respect for
universal values at home and around the world; and (4) A
rules-based international order that promotes peace,
security, and opportunity.
The NSS maintains that the United States would
continue to advance its rebalance to Asia and the Pacif c,
one of the priorities identif ed in the new Defense Strategic
Guidance[1] released in January 2012 and in the Quadrennial
Defense Review (QDR) released in March 2014.
Accordingly, the Obama administration has indicated that
the United States would continue to attach importance to
this region.
Meanwhile, the growing budget def cits of the U.S.
government in recent years have called for deep cuts in
spending. In January 2012, the Department of Defense
(DoD) announced that defense spending would be
reduced by about US$487 billion over the 10 years from
FY2012 to FY2021[2]. In addition, the government budget
sequestration[3], including defense spending, was initiated in


March 2013, bringing various impacts on the U.S. Forces
including suspension of training, delayed deployment
of aircraft carriers, and grounding of air squadrons.
Although the Bipartisan Budget Act of the Democratic and
Republican parties mitigated the sequestration spending
cuts for FY2014 and FY2015, the QDR emphasizes that
the risks to the U.S. Forces would increase considerably if
sequester-level cuts return in FY2016. Much attention will
be paid to how the mandatory sequestration cuts in defense
spending will impact the U.S. defense strategies and
security policies outlined in the QDR and other documents.
In response to the attacks in Iraq and Syria since
2014 by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL),
the United States, since August 2014, has led Operation
Inherent Resolve (OIR), a military operation against ISIL
that includes airstrikes. In addition, in response to the
growing tension over the recent situation in Ukraine, the
United States has shifted away from the “reset” diplomacy
of the past aimed at improving U.S.-Russia relations, and
is undertaking a major review of the bilateral relationship.
Focus will be on how these changes in the situations in the
Middle East and Ukraine impact U.S. policies, including
the policy of rebalancing to the Asia-Pacif c region.

Defense Chuck Hagel [White House photo]


The formal title of the document is “Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense.”

According to a document published by the DoD concerning the FY2013 budget request that was submitted to Congress in February 2012, “the amount of reduction” refers to the difference between
the total DoD base budget for 10 years estimated at the time of the FY2012 budget request (submitted to Congress in February 2011) and the total DoD base budget for 10 years estimated at the
time of the FY2013 budget request.

(2) Build security globally: Continue a strong U.S.
commitment to shaping world events in order to deter
and prevent conf ict and to assure the allies and partners
of the shared security.
(3) Project power and win decisively: The U.S. Forces deter
acts of aggression in one or more theaters by remaining
capable of decisively defeating adversaries, while
projecting power to provide humanitarian assistance
and disaster relief.
The QDR states that across the three pillars, the U.S.
Forces are capable of simultaneously implementing the
following undertakings, and if deterrence fails at any given
time, the U.S. Forces could defeat a regional adversary in a
large-scale multi-phased campaign, and deny the objectives
of—or imposing unacceptable costs on—another aggressor
in another region[4].
1) Defending homeland
2) Conducting sustained, distributed counterterrorist
operations
3) Deterring aggression and assuring allies through forward
presence and engagement in multiple regions.
Furthermore, in order to achieve the three pillars, the
DoD seeks innovative approaches to how it f ghts, how
it postures its force, and how it leverages its asymmetric
strengths and technological advantages. More specif cally,
the QDR mentions positioning additional forwarddeployed naval forces in critical areas, such as the AsiaPacif c region, and deploying new combinations of ships,
aviation assets, and crisis response forces.
The QDR also makes reference to rebalancing the
Joint Force. Given the changes in the security environment
surrounding the United States, including geopolitical
changes, changes in modern warfare, and changes in the
f scal environment, the QDR states that the Joint Force
would: rebalance for a broad spectrum of conf ict; rebalance
and sustain its presence and posture abroad; rebalance
capability, capacity, and readiness; and equip itself with
advanced capabilities and readiness while scaling back
the U.S. Forces. The QDR states that even as budget and
other resource cuts are made, the DoD would give priority
to the following capability areas that are in close alignment
with the pillars of the defense strategy: (1) Missile defense;
(2) Nuclear deterrence; (3) Cyber; (4) Space; (5) Air/


**1** **Understanding of Security**

In the NSS released in February 2015, President Obama
outlined that today the United States and the international
community face challenges, including a rising risk of
attacks on the United States and its allies due to violent
extremism and the terrorist threat, escalating challenges to
cybersecurity, aggression by Russia, and the outbreak of
infectious diseases. President Obama went on to state that
the United States has a unique capability to mobilize and
lead the international community to meet these challenges,
and that strong and sustained U.S. leadership will safeguard
U.S. security interests. At the same time, the NSS notes
that whether or not the international community is able to
respond effectively to the risks depends on the behaviors
of major powers, and that the steadfastness of allies and
the cooperation of other emerging powers are essential for
making progress.
The QDR released in March 2014 states that the
future international security environment remains
uncertain and complicated due to the shifting international
balance of power; the greater interaction between states,
non-state entities, and private citizens; the proliferation
of technology; and the rapidly accelerating spread of
information. In addressing this challenging environment,
the QDR states that the United States would collaborate
with allies and partners and invest in the technological and
human capital strengths of the U.S. Forces to accomplish
a wide range of goals.


**2** **Defense Strategy**

The QDR states that the following three pillars, which
are interrelated and mutually reinforcing, would be
emphasized in order to embody priorities outlined in the
Defense Strategic Guidance including rebalancing to the
Asia-Pacif c region and maintaining a strong commitment
to stability in Europe and the Middle East.
(1) Protect the homeland: Maintain the capability to deter
and defeat attacks on the United States. Protection of
the homeland includes assisting U.S. civil authorities
in protecting U.S. airspace, shores, and borders, and in
responding effectively to domestic disasters.


The 2010 QDR stated that the U.S. Forces possess the capability of countering attacks by two countries while also being able to conduct a wide range of operations. The 2012 Defense Strategic
Guidance states that the United States maintains forces that are able to fully deny a capable state’s aggressive objectives in one region while being capable of denying the objectives of – or imposing

sea; (6) Precision strike; (7) Intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance (ISR); (8) Counter terror and special
operations; and (9) Resilience[5].
However, the QDR emphasizes that if sequester-level
cuts return in FY2016, risks to the U.S. Forces posed by
shifts in the security environment would grow signif cantly[6].


areas in Northern Australia, which would offer greater
opportunities for joint training and exercises. The joint
initiatives are described as part of the efforts to embody
the basic concept of the force posture of the U.S. Forces
presence in the Asia-Pacif c region, which intends to
pursue “a more geographically distributed, operationally
resilient, and politically sustainable military presence.”
Other examples include the rotational deployment of
up to four Littoral Combat Ships (LCS)[8] to Singapore
announced by then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert
Gates in June 2011. LCS started the f rst rotation in April
2013 and the second rotation in December 2014. Also, the
United States repeatedly conducted joint military exercises
with and provided military technologies and assistance to
Southeast Asian countries in an effort to build up trusting
relationships and strengthen the readiness of the countries.
With regard to Japan, the United States deployed P-8
patrol aircraft to Kadena Air Base, temporarily assigned
unmanned reconnaissance aircraft Global Hawk to Misawa
Air Base, and deployed a second TPY-2 radar[9] in Japan
to the Kyogamisaki Communications Site. In addition, in
April 2014, then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel
announced that two more Aegis ballistic missile defense
ships would be deployed to Japan by 2017[10]. Furthermore,
apart from the two aforementioned ships, the U.S. Navy
deployed an Aegis cruiser to Yokosuka in June 2015.
The United States has been expressing its stance to
emphasize the Asia-Pacif c region not only to its allies and
partners but also to China. The 2014 QDR states that the
United States would sustain dialogue with China to improve
the ability to cooperate in practical areas such as counterpiracy, peacekeeping, and humanitarian assistance/disaster
relief operations. At the same time, the United States would
manage the competitive aspects of U.S.-China relations in
ways that improve regional peace and stability consistent
with international norms and principles.


**3** **Rebalance to the Asia-Pacific Region**


As indicated by the Defense Strategic Guidance, the
QDR, and the NSS, the United States places emphasis
on the Asia-Pacif c region and is continuing a policy to
enhance its presence in the region. In November 2011,
U.S. President Obama delivered a speech to the Australian
Parliament, clearly stating, for the f rst time, that he would
give top priority to the U.S. presence and mission in the
Asia-Pacif c region. The President indicated that the United
States would maintain its strong presence in Japan and the
Republic of Korea (ROK), while enhancing its presence
in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, the QDR states that the
centerpiece of the DoD commitment to the rebalance to
the Asia-Pacif c region is to update and enhance security
initiatives with its allies in the region, including Japan.
Additionally, the QDR notes that by 2020, the U.S. Forces
would station 60% of the assets of the Navy and Air Force
in the Asia-Pacif c region.
Concrete examples of the enhancement of U.S. Forces’
presence in the Asia-Pacif c region include enhanced
presence of the U.S. Forces in Australia. In November
2011, U.S. President Obama and then-Australian Prime
Minister Julia Gillard jointly announced U.S.-Australia
force posture initiatives, which include: (1) the rotational
deployment of U.S. Marines to Darwin and other areas
in Northern Australia for around six months every year
where they would conduct exercises and training with
the Australian Defence Force (ADF)[7]; and (2) increased
access of U.S. Air Force aircraft to ADF facilities and


The capability areas constitute primarily of the following:
(1) Missile defense: Increasing the number of Ground-Based Interceptors, deploying an additional radar in Japan, increasing the reliability, effi ciency, and discrimination capabilities of interceptors,
studying the best location for deploying Ground-Based Interceptors
(2) Nuclear deterrence: Continuing to invest in modernizing delivery systems; warheads; command and control; and nuclear weapon infrastructure
(3) Cyber: Forming the Cyber Mission Force by 2016, integrating and migrating information systems
(4) Space: Diversifying and expanding the coverage of Space Situational Awareness, accelerating initiatives to counter adversary space capabilities including ISR and precision strike
(5) Air/sea: Countering A2/AD threats by investing in combat aircraft, including fi ghters and long-range strike, survivable persistent surveillance, resilient architectures, and undersea warfare
(6) Precision strike: Procuring advanced air-to-surface missiles and a long-range anti-ship cruise missile to improve the joint ability of U.S. Forces to attack airspace defended by the adversary
(7) ISR: Making focused investments in systems that will function effectively in airspace defended by the adversary and areas that the U.S. Forces are denied entry or free maneuver, expanding use
of space ISR systems
(8) Counter terror and special operations: Increasing the Special Operations Forces (SOF) to 69,700 personnel, mobilizing more SOF to support the Joint Force to counter a range of challenges across
the globe
(9) Resilience: Improving the ability to maintain and restore the functions of air, naval, ground, space, and missile-defense capabilities against attacks, dispersing land and naval expeditionary forces,
investing in capabilities to repair runways more quickly

Some of the implications anticipated in the case of the return of the sequester-level cuts include a reduction in end strength of active Army to 420,000, retirement of the USS George Washington
aircraft carrier (10 aircraft carriers), a reduction in end strength of Marine Corps to 175,000, a further retirement of Air Force aircraft, and a slowdown of purchases of F-35 aircraft.

The initial deployment consisted of a company of about 200 U.S. Marines. The aim is to eventually establish a rotational presence of up to a 2,500-person Marine Air-Ground Task Force including
aircraft, ground vehicles, and artilleries over a few years. In 2014, about 1,150 Marines, including the Marine Helicopter Squadron, were deployed, marking a signifi cant increase from the deployment
of about 250 U.S. Marines in the previous fi scal year.

be required for multiple opponents, including advanced
countries like Russia and China, regional states like Iran
and North Korea, and non-state actors with advanced
capabilities. In addition, the competitive environments
have changed signif cantly due to innovations in
commercial technologies. In order to follow and make use
of commercial technologies, the United States must work
more closely with the private sector. Furthermore, Deputy
Secretary Work notes that the proliferation of technology
could cause superiority to be lost in a short timeframe.
The DoD maintains that to achieve the initiative, the
following should be promoted: development of leadership;
a new Long-Range Research and Development Planning
Program; reinvigoration of war-gaming approaches; new
operational concepts; and increased eff ciency of business
practices. In particular, under the Long-Range Research
and Development Planning Program, the DoD will
identify, develop, and operate technologies and systems
which have the potential to f eld breakthroughs that will
be key to maintaining and strengthening U.S. military
capabilities – from technology f elds such as autonomous
systems, robotics, miniaturization, big data, advanced
manufacturing, and dispersed network systems. To this end,
under the leadership of the U.S. Under Secretary of Defense
for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, f ve working
groups – (1) space technology, (2) undersea technology,
(3) air dominance and strike technology, (4) air and missile
defense technology, and (5) technology-driven working
groups – will be established, as well as one integrated
group to supervise and coordinate these working groups.
The FY2016 budget request sets forth the advancement
of this initiative. The budget request identif es that
the priority technology areas are: assured positioning,
navigation, and timing; high speed strike weapons; an
aerospace innovation initiative; railgun development; and
high energy laser technology[12].

**4** **Defense Innovation Initiative**


In November 2014, then-U.S. Secretary of Defense
Hagel announced the Defense Innovation Initiative and
expressed his expectation that it would develop into a
third offset strategy. Since the 1950s, the United States
has invested in the development of military technologies
in new f elds in which adversaries do not have capabilities.
Through a strategy of acquiring asymmetrical means
to offset an opponent’s capabilities[11], the United States
has maintained military operational and technological
superiority. However, today, such U.S. superiority is
gradually eroding as a result of potential adversaries
modernizing their military forces and acquiring advanced
military capabilities, and with technologies proliferating.
The United States notes that this initiative was established
to newly identify innovative ways to sustain and expand
U.S. superiority, utilizing limited resources.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work, who is
leading the work of establishing this initiative, states that
its formulation is more challenging than the earlier offset
strategies. The reasons are that different strategies will


11 Secretary Hagel stated that the previous two “offset strategies” were as follows: (1) In the 1950s, the United States offset the conventional capacity of the former Soviet Union by using the nuclear
deterrent; and (2) In the 1970s, while the nuclear capabilities of the former Soviet Union achieved parity with those of the United States, the United States gained superiority over the former Soviet
Union by acquiring new systems, such as extended-range precision-guided missiles, stealth aircraft, and ISR platforms.

Navy, improve the inspections regime, and improve career
management, among other activities.

See Part I, Chapter 2, Section 2-1 (Nuclear Weapons)


**5** **Nuclear Strategy**

While U.S. President Obama aims to realize a world without
nuclear weapons, he notes that this will not be realized in
the near future, and indicates the need to maintain a nuclear
deterrent as long as nuclear weapons exist.
The Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), which was
released in April 2010, indicates that the nuclear security
environment is changing and nuclear terrorism and nuclear
proliferation are an imminent threat today. Furthermore, it
points to the necessity of working on the issue of ensuring
strategic stability with existing nuclear powers, in particular
Russia and China.
The NPR presents f ve key objectives based on
awareness of this security environment: (1) preventing
nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism; (2) reducing
the role of U.S. nuclear weapons; (3) maintaining strategic
deterrence and stability at reduced nuclear force levels;
(4) strengthening regional deterrence and reassuring U.S.
allies and partners; and (5) sustaining a safe, secure, and
effective nuclear arsenal.
In June 2013, U.S. President Obama delivered a
speech on the reduction of nuclear weapons in Berlin,
which was followed by the release of the Report on Nuclear
Employment Strategy by the DoD on the same day. In the
speech and report, the United States announced that it
would negotiate with Russia to pursue up to a one-third
reduction in U.S. deployed strategic nuclear weapons.
In February 2014, following missteps by nuclear
missile launch off cers including possession of illegal
drugs and misconduct related to prof ciency tests, thenU.S. Secretary of Defense Hagel instructed an internal
and external review of the entire DoD Nuclear Enterprise
(Nuclear Enterprise Review [NER]). In November 2014,
Secretary Hagel announced the results of the NER, in
the form of a summary of an internal study report and a
report of an external study conducted by retired military
personnel and other reviewers. The NER found that while
the existing nuclear forces of the U.S. Forces are meeting
the demands of their mission, signif cant improvements
are required to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the
force in the future. The two reports made recommendations
focusing around areas, such as improving oversight and
management issues, increasing investment in the nuclear
deterrent enterprise, and personnel and training including
boosting morale. Based on these recommendations, the
DoD decided to prioritize funding on actions that improve
the security, ensure modernization of the force, and address
shortfalls. The DoD will work to increase the number of


**6** **FY2016 Budget**


As the budget def cit of the U.S. government is deepening in
recent years, the Budget Control Act enacted in August 2011
established a deep cut in government spending by FY2021.
In January 2012, the DoD announced that the reduction in
defense spending in light of the act would amount to about
US$487 billion over the 10 years from FY2012 to FY2021
(about US$259 billion over the f ve years from FY2013
to FY2017). In March 2013, the mandatory sequestration
of government spending including defense spending
started based on the provisions of the Budget Control Act.
Mandatory sequestration for the FY2014 and FY2015
budgets was eased as a result of the Bipartisan Budget
Act of the Democratic and Republican parties passed in
December 2013. However, the President and Congress have
yet to reach an agreement on the handling of mandatory
sequestration in FY2016 and beyond.
For the FY2016 DoD budget request, the DoD
allocated US$534.3 billion[13] for the base budget. For the
overseas contingency operations budget, the DoD allocated
US$50.9 billion, which is US$13.3 billion less than the
FY2015 enacted budget level, based on the completion
of the U.S. Forces’ combat mission in Afghanistan in late
2014 and the progress made towards their withdrawal in
late 2016. The key principles of the defense budget are as
follows: (1) Seek a balanced force; (2) Manage enduring
readiness challenges; (3) Continue to focus on institutional
reform; (4) Pursue investments in military capabilities;
(5) Provide for the people; and (6) Support overseas
operations. On this basis, the DoD has decided to: decrease
the Army’s end strength to 475,000 active soldiers from the
FY2015 level of 490,000 active soldiers; continue to fund
the overhaul/life extension of the USS George Washington
of the Navy, following on from the previous f scal year, and
maintain 11 aircraft carriers; keep the F-35, the KC-46, and
the Long-Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B) as the Air Force’s
top three modernization programs; and once again plan
to retire the A-10 aircraft that was not realized during the
previous year due to opposition from Congress. The DoD’s

spending cap by about US$36 billion, contending that at
sequester-level funding, the DoD cannot achieve its goal
of restoring readiness and execute the defense strategy[14].

spending including defense spending.


**2** **Military Posture**


2012, the United States announced that it would continue
investments in MD programs in its homeland and Europe
while reducing the spending for deployable regional MD
systems with a view to increasing reliance on its allies and
partners in the future. Further, in March 2013, the United
States announced that it would additionally deploy groundbased interceptors in the U.S. homeland and mobile radars
for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) in Japan in order to
bolster homeland security in response to North Korea’s
nuclear test and the advancement of its long-range ballistic
missile development, while restructuring the program
of the standard missile (SM-3) Block IIB scheduled for
deployment in Europe.
The operation of the U.S. Forces is not controlled by
the individual branches of the broader armed forces, rather
it is operated under the leadership of the Unif ed Combatant
Commands, comprising leaders from multiple branches
of the armed forces. The Unif ed Combatant Commands
consist of three commands with functional responsibilities
and six commands with regional responsibilities.
The U.S. ground forces consist of about 490,000 Army
soldiers and about 180,000 Marines, which are forward

**1** **General Situation**


In regard to strategic offensive weapons including nuclear
force, the United States is moving ahead with its reduction
based on a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty that came
into force in February 2011. In April 2015, it announced that
its deployed strategic warheads[15] stood at 1,597, while its
deployed delivery platforms stood at 785[16]. The United States
is studying the concept of a Conventional Prompt Global
Strike (CPGS), as an effort contributing to the nation’s new
ability to reduce reliance on nuclear weapons[17].
In regard to Missile Defense (MD), the United States
announced the Ballistic Missile Defense Review (BMDR)
in February 2010. On homeland defense, the review noted
that the United States would use ground-based interceptors
to respond to Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs)
from North Korea and Iran, and that in regard to regional
defense, the United States would expand investments in
MD systems while taking a phased adaptive approach
(PAA) that is tailored to each region and improve the MD
capabilities step by step, working with partner countries
and properly sharing the burden. However, in January

deployed in Germany, the ROK, and Japan, among other
countries. As described in the Defense Strategic Guidance,
the Army continues its transition to a smaller yet capable
force fully prepared to conduct a full range of operations
worldwide. The Marine Corps aims to acquire forces
capable of responding to any threat as a “middleweight
force,” bridging the seam between smaller special
operations forces and larger heavy conventional forces. In
January 2012, the DoD announced that it would reduce the
number of active duty Marines to 182,000 and in February
2014 the number of active duty Army soldiers to 440,000 –
450,000, with further reductions to both in the future.
The U.S. maritime forces consist of about 950 vessels
(including about 70 submarines) totaling about 6.20 million
tons. The 6th Fleet is deployed in the East Atlantic Ocean,
the Mediterranean Sea, and Africa; the 5th Fleet in the
Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and northwest Indian Ocean; the 3rd
Fleet in the eastern Pacif c; the 4th Fleet in South America
and the Caribbean Sea; and the 7th Fleet in the western
Pacif c and Indian Ocean.
The U.S. air forces consist of roughly 3,600 combat
aircraft across the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. In
addition to carrier-based aircraft deployed at sea, part of
the tactical air force is forward-deployed in Germany, the
United Kingdom, Japan, and the ROK.
Moreover, in addressing the increasing threats in
cyberspace, the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM)
was founded in order to oversee operations in cyberspace.
The U.S. Cyber Command attained Initial Operational
Capability (IOC) in May 2010 and commended full
capability in November in the same year[18].

See Fig. I-1-1-3 (Structure of the Unified Combatant Command)


**2** **Current Military Posture in the Asia-Pacific Region**

The United States, a Pacif c nation, continues to play an
important role in ensuring the peace and stability of the
Asia-Pacif c region by placing the Pacif c Command, a
joint command consisting of the Army, Navy, Air Force,
and Marine Corps, in the region. The Pacif c Command is
a command with regional responsibilities for the largest
geographical area, and its component commands include
U.S. Forces Japan and U.S. Forces Korea. In order to
broaden the perspective of the U.S. Forces and promote
better understanding of the U.S. Forces from allies, the
Pacif c Command headquarters accept personnel from
allies in the region. Under this scheme, personnel from
Canada and Australia are currently serving in the Pacif c
Command as deputy director level-off cials.
The Pacif c Command consists of the U.S. Army Pacif c,
U.S. Pacif c Fleet, U.S. Marine Forces Pacif c, and U.S.
Pacif c Air Forces, which are all headquartered in Hawaii[19].
The Army Pacif c’s subordinate commands include
the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii, the 8th U.S. Army in
the ROK, which is the Army component of the U.S. Forces
in the ROK, and the U.S. Army Alaska. In addition, the
Army Pacif c assigns approximately 2,400 personnel to
commands, such as I Corps Forward and the U.S. Army
Japan Command in Japan[20].
The U.S. Pacif c Fleet consists of the Seventh Fleet,
which is responsible for the Western Pacif c and the Indian
Ocean, and the Third Fleet, responsible for the East Pacif c
and Bering Sea. The U.S. Pacif c Fleet in total controls about
180 vessels. The Seventh Fleet is centered on a carrier strike
group with main stationing locations in Japan and Guam.
Their mission is to defend territorial lands, people, sea lines
of communication, and the critical national interests of the
United States and its allies. The f eet consists of aircraft
carriers, amphibious ships, and the Aegis combat system.
The U.S. Pacif c Marine Corps deploys one Marine
Expeditionary Force each in the U.S. mainland and Japan.
Of this force, about 16,000 personnel are in the 3rd Marine
Division and the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, which are
equipped with F/A-18 f ghters and other aircraft, in Japan. In
addition, maritime pre-positioning ships loaded with heavy
equipment and others are deployed in the Western Pacif c.
The U.S. Pacif c Air Force has three air forces, of
which three air wings (equipped with F-16 f ghters and
C-130 transport aircraft) are deployed to the 5th Air Force
stationed in Japan and two air wings (equipped with F-16
f ghters) to the 7th Air Force stationed in the ROK.

**Section 3 China**

**1** **General Situation**


China, the world’s most populous country, has a vast
landmass surrounded by a long borderline shared with
14 countries as well as a long coastline. China is also a
nation with various races, religions, and languages. Most
of its ethnic minorities populate the borderlands often with
the same ethnic groups living across the borders. China,
with a long history, has been shaping and maintaining a
distinct culture and civilization. China’s pride in its unique
history and semi-colonial experience in and after the 19th
century is driving its desire for a strong nation and fueling
its nationalism.
In recent years, China has increased its presence
in the international community. For example, China has
played a def nite role in non-traditional security areas. It
actively sends personnel to U.N. peacekeeping operations
(PKO) and has been sending its ships continuously for
counter-piracy activities off the coast of Somalia and in
the Gulf of Aden. Furthermore, China has participated
proactively in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief
activities, including dispatching a hospital ship to the
Philippines which sustained damages from a typhoon, as
well as dispatching vessels and other assets for the search
of a missing Malaysian airliner. These activities have been
highly appreciated by the international community.
There are high expectations for China to recognize its
responsibility in the international community, accept and
comply with international norms, and play an active role in
a more cooperative manner on regional and global issues.
Yet, at the same time, there are disputes between China
and other countries on issues such as trade imbalances,
currency rates, and human rights. While advocating
“peaceful development”[1], China, particularly over
maritime issues where its interests conf ict with others’,
based on its own assertions incompatible with the existing
international legal order[2], continues to act in an assertive
manner, including coercive attempts at changing the status
quo, and is poised to fulf ll its unilateral demands without
compromise[3]. China’s actions include dangerous acts that
may invite unintended consequences, raising concerns over
China’s future direction. Against this backdrop, China has


attempted to advance its own initiatives in the security
f eld. At the Conference on Interaction and Conf denceBuilding Measures in Asia (CICA), for example, China
criticized military alliances and proposed “the security of
Asia by the people of Asia”[4]. On the other hand, in the
f eld of international f nance, China established the New
Development Bank BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China,
and South Africa) and is preparing to establish the Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
In addition, China faces various problems domestically.
The spread of bribery and corruption among the central and
local leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
has become a signif cant political problem. Furthermore,
China’s rapid economic growth has brought with it
emerging problems such as regional disparities between
urban-rural and coastal-inland regions, the issue of the
tax system that facilitates these disparities, wealth gaps
among urban residents, inf ation, environmental pollution,
and lack of agricultural and industrial water. Moreover,
issues associated with the rapid aging of the population are
forecasted to arise in the future, including pension and other
issues related to the social security system. The Chinese
government is expected to tighten its control over society
as these potentially destabilizing factors to the government
administration expand and diversify. However, analysts
point out that controlling the activities of the masses
will become increasingly diff cult with the spread of the
Internet, coupled with other factors. Additionally, China
confronts issues involving ethnic minorities in the country,
with protests being staged by ethnic minorities in the Tibet
Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous
Region, and elsewhere. Some ethnic minorities undertake
campaigns in pursuit of separation and independence.
Against this background, during the third plenary session
of the 18th CCP Central Committee in November 2013, the
session adopted the “Decision on Major Issues concerning
Comprehensively Deepening Reforms” regarding reforms
in a wide range of areas, such as economics, politics,
culture, society, environment, and national defense and
the military. The way by which China substantiates these


The term China’s “peaceful development” began to come into formal use in around 2004. According to a paper then-State Councilor Dai Bingguo presented on March 11, 2011, “peaceful
development” is thought to refer to China’s development whose nature is (1) peaceful, (2) independent, (3) scientifi c, (4) cooperative, and (5) common with other countries.

China makes its own assertion about the Senkaku Islands, which are an inherent territory of Japan. In addition, in May 2013, a newspaper of the CCP carried an article which seemingly calls into
question the fact that Okinawa is part of Japan, stating for example that, “It may be time to revisit the unresolved historical issue of the Ryukyu Islands.” The Chinese government explained that the
article was written by researchers in their personal capacity.

China strongly urges Japan, the United States, and other countries to respect China’s “core interests.” “Core interests” include “national sovereignty,” “national security,” “territorial integrity,” “national
reunifi cation,” “national political system and social stability,” and “basic safeguards for ensuring sustainable economic and social development.” In particular, “territory” refers to Taiwan, Tibet, and
Xinjiang. Some analysts suggest that China’s territorial claims in the East China Sea and South China Sea are also included.

In May 2014, in his address at CICA, President Xi Jinping proposed the “new Asian security concept” and underscored that “to beef up and entrench a military alliance targeted at a third party is not


-----

reforms will be a point to watch out for. In China, under
the policy of cracking down on both “tigers” and “f ies”[5],
“corruption” has been subject to severe charges, including
former prominent leaders of the party and military such
as Zhou Yongkang, former Politburo Standing Committee
member, and Xu Caihou, former Vice Chairman of the
Central Military Commission. During the fourth plenary
session of the 18th CCP Central Committee in October
2014, a decision that makes reference to advancing the
“rule of law” under the guidance of the CCP was adopted[6].
Accordingly, it is possible that further steps will be taken to
address corruption within the party and military.
On the diplomatic f eld, it is believed that, in order
to maintain national stability, China strives to maintain
stability in the strategic international environment by
sustaining good relations with major powers such as the
United States and Russia, while deepening relations with
neighboring countries, and is strengthening cooperation
with developing countries. In addition, China seeks to
promote multipolarization of the world through building
China-led multilateral mechanisms and to secure interests
necessary for economic development such as natural
resources and energy supply.
On the military front, for over a quarter decade,
China has strengthened its military forces broadly and
rapidly by sustaining large increases in its defense budget.
In particular, China gives priority to the Taiwan issue
as an issue pertaining to the “core” interest of national
sovereignty. It is deemed that China is strengthening its
military forces for the time being with the aim of improving
military capabilities to prevent Taiwan’s independence. As
part of such efforts, China is believed to be enhancing its


asymmetric military capabilities to deter military forces of
other countries from approaching and advancing to China’s
surrounding region, and to inhibit their military activities
in the region (so-called “Anti-Access/Area-Denial” [“A2/
AD”] capabilities[7]). Additionally, China has made active
efforts to acquire capabilities for missions other than for
dealing with the Taiwan issue. With China now having
considerable inf uence in the international community not
only politically and economically but also militarily, other
countries are closely watching China’s military trends.

**2** **Military Affairs**


forces; and to protect the stability and peace of the world[8].
China has a policy to actively promote “Revolution
in Military Affairs with Chinese Characteristics,”
which mainly aims to encourage the mechanization and
informatization of its military power, based on its military
strategy to win local wars under informatized conditions,
in response to global trends in military developments
observed in the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, the Iraq War, and
other wars. It is believed that China emphasizes not only
physical means but also non-physical means in military


**1** **Defense Policies**


China positions the buildup of strong defense capabilities
and powerful military forces that match national security
and interests of development as the strategic mission to
modernize the state. China considers the main goal and
mission of national defense policies as: to defend the
sovereignty, security, and interests of development of the
state; to protect the harmony and stability of the society; to
promote modernization of national defense and the military


On January 22, 2013, General Secretary Xi Jinping stated during the second plenary session of the 18th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection that the party needs to crack down on “tigers”
and “fl ies” at the same time to punish corruption.

At the fourth plenary session of the 18th CCP Central Committee, the “CCP Central Committee Decision on Major Issues concerning Comprehensively Advancing Rule of Law” was adopted.

For a definition of A2/AD capabilities, see Part I Overview, Section 2, Footnote 5.

According to China’s National Defense in 2010. In China’s Peaceful Development white paper released in September 2011, China explained that it pursues “peaceful development” but “never seeks
hegemony,” and stated that it is firm in upholding its “core interests” which include: “national sovereignty”; “national security”; “territorial integrity”; “national reunification”; “China’s political system

affairs and warfare, and incorporated the concept of “Three
Warfares” — “Media Warfare,” “Psychological Warfare,”
and “Legal Warfare” — into the tasks of the political work
of the military[9]. In addition, China has set forth a policy of
close coordination between military struggle and political,
diplomatic, economic, cultural, and legal endeavors.
China is believed to be strengthening its military
forces by being mindful of its top priority, namely, dealing
with the Taiwan issue, more specif cally, improving
China’s capabilities to hinder the independence of Taiwan
and foreign military support for the independence of
Taiwan. Furthermore, in recent years, China is working
actively to acquire capabilities for missions other than
dealing with the Taiwan issue, and stresses the use of the
military in non-traditional security areas. With regard to
China’s military strengthening, China proclaims that it
would “realize the basic mechanization and achieve major
progress in construction of informatization by 2020” and
“by focusing on the capability to win local wars under
informationized conditions, it will improve the abilities to
accomplish diversif ed military missions and thoroughly
complete the historical military missions in a new phase
of the new century,”[10] suggesting that China’s military
forces will be developed in tandem with the enhancement
of its national strength.
China has sustained large increases in its defense
spending and broadly and rapidly reinforced its military
forces, mainly its nuclear and missile force as well
as its Navy and Air Force. As part of such efforts, it is
understood that China is strengthening its so-called “A2/
AD” capabilities. In addition, China is working to improve
joint operational capabilities, enhance capabilities for
extended-range power projection, conduct practical
exercises, cultivate and acquire highly-capable personnel
for administering operations of informatized forces,
improve the foundation of its domestic defense industry,
and ensure law-based military governance. Furthermore,
China has rapidly expanded and intensif ed its activities
at sea and in airspace, including the East China Sea and
South China Sea. China, particularly over maritime issues
where its interests conf ict with others’, continues to act
in an assertive manner, including coercive attempts at
changing the status quo, and is poised to fulf ll its unilateral


demands without compromise. Japan has great concerns
over such Chinese military activities, etc., together with
the lack of transparency in its military affairs and security
issues, and needs to pay utmost attention to them. These
activities also raise security concerns for the region and
the international community.


**2** **Military Transparency**


China has not disclosed specif c information on possession
of weapons, procurement goals and past procurements,
organization and locations of major units, records of
main military operations and exercises, and a detailed
breakdown of the national defense budget. Moreover,
China has neither set out a clear and specif c future
vision of its military strengthening, nor ensured adequate
transparency of its decision-making process in relation to
military and security affairs.
China has released defense white papers including
China’s National Defense every two years since 1998.
China also conducts numerous dialogues with national
defense authorities of other countries. Furthermore, in
August 2007, China expressed its wish to return to the
United Nations Register of Conventional Arms and to
participate in the United Nations Instrument for Reporting
Military Expenditures, and has submitted annual reports
based on each framework. The Chinese Ministry of National
Defense has been giving monthly press conferences by a
spokesperson since April 2011. In addition, in November
2013, the position of spokesperson was newly established
at seven departments, including the Navy and Air Force[11].
Such moves by China can be perceived on the one hand
as efforts that contribute to the improvement of the
transparency of military forces, and on the other as efforts
to strengthen “Media Warfare.”
However, with regard to national defense spending,
China has not provided a detailed breakdown of the
procurement expenses of major equipment and other
details. In the past, China disclosed the total amounts
and general purposes for the following three categories:
personnel; training and maintenance; and equipment[12].
Nonetheless, such explanations have not been offered in
recent years. Moreover, in China’s defense white paper


9 China amended the Regulations of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on the Political Work in 2003 to add Media, Psychological, and Legal Warfares to the PLA’s political work. The U.S. DoD’s “Annual
Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (August 2011) explains these warfares as follows:

-  Media Warfare is aimed at influencing domestic and international public opinion to build public and international support for China’s military actions and to dissuade an adversary from pursuing
policies perceived to be adverse to China’s interests.

-  Psychological Warfare seeks to undermine an enemy’s ability to conduct combat operations through psychological operations aimed at deterring, shocking, and demoralizing enemy military
personnel and supporting civilian populations.

-  Legal Warfare uses international and domestic laws to gain international support and manage possible political repercussions of China’s military actions.

10 China’s National Defense in 2008 also states the following target: “by and large reach the goal of modernization of national defense and armed forces by the mid-21st century.”

11 The seven departments are: PLA General Political Department; PLA General Logistics Department; PLA General Armaments Department; PLA Navy; PLA Air Force; PLA Second Artillery Corps; and
People’s Armed Police.

12 China’s National Defense in 2008 and 2010 provided a breakdown of personnel expenses, training and maintenance costs, and equipment costs for the active force, reserve force, and militia, limited


-----

titled, “The Diversif ed Employment of China’s Armed
Forces,” released in April 2013 as well as the defense white
paper titled, “China’s Military Strategy,” released in May
2015, the contents were limited to selective topics. While
on some topics they gave more details than in the past, the
papers make no reference to national defense spending
that was described in previous defense white papers.
Additionally, the overall volume of text has decreased. In
this respect, transparency is declining in regard to national
defense spending, and China has not yet achieved the levels
of transparency expected of a responsible nation in the
international community.
Incidents have been occurring that incite concerns
over China’s military decision-making and actions,
including Chinese explanations that are contrary to
the truth. For example, details have yet to be disclosed
regarding the causes of the Chinese nuclear-powered
submarine’s submerged navigation in Japan’s territorial
waters in November 2004, although it constitutes a breach
of international law. Furthermore, with respect to the
incident of a Chinese naval vessel directing its f re-control
radar at a JMSDF destroyer (January 2013), among other
incidents, both the Chinese Ministry of National Defense
and Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave explanations which
were inconsistent with the facts, such as denying the use
of the radar itself. With regard to the incident in which
Chinese f ghters f ew abnormally close to aircraft of the
JMSDF and JASDF (May and June 2014), the Chinese
Ministry of National Defense gave explanations that were
contrary to the truth, namely that Japanese aircraft “entered
the airspace for the Chinese drills without reporting to
China and conducted dangerous acts.” When a Chinese
f ghter allegedly f ew abnormally close to and intercepted
U.S. Forces aircraft (August 2014), the Chinese Ministry
of National Defense provided an explanation that differed
from the United States’, stating that “the operations made by
the Chinese pilot were professional and the Chinese jet kept
a safe distance from the U.S. planes.” In recent years, amid
the signif cant changes in the environment surrounding the
military, including advancement in military specialization
and diversif cation of missions associated with military
strengthening, some see that relations between the CCP
leadership and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have


become increasingly complex. Others opine that the degree
of military inf uence on foreign policy decisions has been
changing[13]. Such situations are also a point to watch out
for in terms of crisis management. Another point to watch
out for is the relationship between the National Security
Commission, which was established at the third plenary
session of the 18th CCP Central Committee and which
China announced was tasked with the unif ed planning and
coordination of important national security matters, and the
Central Military Commission that has been instructing and
commanding the PLA and the PLA itself.
China’s inf uence in the international community
has risen not only politically and economically but also
militarily, and other countries are closely following China’s
moves. In order to allay other countries’ concerns over
China, it is becoming more important for China itself to
improve the transparency of its national defense policy and
military capabilities. It is hoped that China will increase
transparency concerning its military affairs by such efforts
as disclosing specif c information pertaining to its defense
policies and military capabilities.


**3** **National Defense Budget**


China announced that its national defense budget for
FY2015 was approximately 886.9 billion yuan[14, 15]. However,
this amount excludes some expenses which were included
through the previous f scal year, such as expenses
associated with the relocation to the regions. Their addition
brings the total to approximately 889.6 billion yuan. This
initial budget amount represented a growth of approximately
10.1% (approximately 81.4 billion yuan)[16] compared to the
initial budget amount for the previous f scal year. China’s
announced national defense budget thus continues to increase
at a rapid pace, recording double-digit annual growth nearly
consistently from FY1989 to the present[17]. The nominal
size of China’s announced national defense budget has
grown approximately 41-fold in 27 years since FY1988 and
nearly 3.6-fold in 10 years since FY2005. China positions
the buildup of defense capabilities as important a task as
economic development. It is believed that China continues to
invest resources in the improvement of its defense capabilities
in tandem with its economic development.


13 For example, some point out that there are an increasing number of cases in which the PLA expresses its position on security issues concerning national sovereignty or maritime interests. On the
other hand, others point out that the extent of the military’s involvement in the party’s decision-making process is limited because the number of PLA representatives to key decision-making bodies
of the CCP is fewer than in the past. Meanwhile, the PLA has repeatedly stressed “absolute instruction of the forces by the party.”

14 National defense budget within central budgetary expenditures.

15 Converting national defense budgets of foreign countries into another currency simply by applying currency exchange rates does not necessarily reflect an accurate value due to differences in price
level. If, hypothetically, China’s national defense budget for FY2015 was converted at a rate of 18 yen per yuan (FY2015 rate that the Japanese government uses for official purposes), this would
result in approximately 15,964.2 billion yen. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimates that China’s military expenditures for 2014 were approximately US$191 billion,
ranking it second place in the world behind the United States.

16 China announced that the rate of growth for its FY2015 national defense budget is “an increase of approximately 10.1% compared to the previous year.” This is the growth rate calculated by
comparing the spending of FY2014 with the initial budget of FY2015.

Note: The total defense budget for FY2002 was not disclosed. Discrepancies arise if the disclosed rate and amount of growth are applied to the initial budget of the previous year. Therefore, for FY2002,
168.4 billion yuan was used based on a calculation conducted on the assumption that the disclosed rate and amount of growth represent increases from the actual defense expenditure in FY2001.


In addition, it must be noted that the amount of the
defense budget announced by China is considered to
be only a part of its actual military expenditures[18]. For
example, it is believed that the announced defense budget
does not include all the equipment procurement costs and
research and development (R&D) expenses.

bodies would be optimized, that the system of instruction
and management of forces would be perfected, that the
Central Military Commission’s command structure for
joint operations and command system for joint operations
in theaters would be developed, and that reforms of joint
operation trainings and logistical support mechanisms
would be promoted. It is believed that these reforms
are aimed at developing a more practical PLA through
improving its joint operational capabilities and logistical
support capabilities. Although how these reforms will
take shape is currently unclear, the developments to come,
such as the reforms’ impact on the security of the region
including Japan, will be a point to watch out for.

**(1) Nuclear and Missile Forces**
China has made independent efforts to develop nuclear
capabilities and ballistic missile forces since the mid1950s, seemingly with a view to ensuring deterrence,
supplementing its conventional forces, and maintaining
its voice in the international community. With regard to


**4** **Military Posture**


China’s military forces are composed of the PLA, the
People’s Armed Police Force (PAP)[19], and the militia[20]. It
is provided that these bodies be instructed and commanded
by the Central Military Commission[21]. The PLA is def ned
as a people’s army created and led by the CCP, comprising
the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Second Artillery
Corps (strategic missile force).
During the third plenary session of the 18th CCP
Central Committee, it was decided that the functions and
organizations of the Central Military Commission and other


18 The U.S. DoD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (May 2015) estimates China’s military-related defense spending as having
been at least US$165 billion in FY2014. The same report indicates that China’s announced defense budget (US$136 billion) does not include major categories of expenditure such as foreign
procurement and R&D expenses.

19 Missions of the PAP include security of party and government, border security, social projects, and firefighting activities. According to China’s National Defense in 2002, “it is to maintain state security
and social stability, and assist the PLA in wartime in defense operations.”

20 The militia engages in economic development in peacetime and other activities and has a duty to provide logistical support for combat operations in wartime. China’s National Defense in 2002
explains, “[u]nder the command of military organs, the militia in wartime helps the standing army in its military operations, conducts independent operations and provides combat support and
manpower replenishment for the standing army. In peacetime, it undertakes the tasks of performing combat readiness support, taking part in disaster relief efforts, and maintaining social order.”
According to a PLA Daily article dated October 9, 2012, “China now has six million primary militia members” as of 2010.

21 Formally, there are two Central Military Commissions—one for the CCP and another for the state. However, both commissions basically consist of the same membership, and both are essentially

the nuclear strategy, it is recognized that China employs
a strategy where it can deter a nuclear attack on its land
by maintaining a nuclear force structure able to conduct
retaliatory nuclear attacks on a small number of targets
such as cities in the adversary’s country[22].
China possesses various types and ranges of
ballistic missiles: intercontinental ballistic missile
(ICBM); submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM);
intermediate-range ballistic missile/medium-range ballistic
missile (IRBM/MRBM); and short-range ballistic missile
(SRBM). The update of China’s ballistic missile forces
from a liquid propellant system to a solid propellant system
is improving their survivability and readiness[23]. Moreover,
it is believed that China is working to increase performance
by extending ranges, improving accuracy, mounting
warheads, and by other means.
China’s main ICBM strategic nuclear asset had been
the f xed-site liquid-fuel DF-5[24]. However, China has
deployed the DF-31, which is a mobile type ICBM with
a solid propellant system mounted onto a transportererector-launcher (TEL), and the DF-31A, a model of the
DF-31 with extended range. According to some analysts,
China has already deployed the DF-31A and will increase
its numbers[25]. Regarding SLBM, China currently appears
to be deploying Jin-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile
submarines (SSBNs) to carry the JL-2, whose range is
believed to be approximately 8,000 km, which is currently
under development. Once the JL-2 reaches a level of
practical use, it is believed that China’s strategic nuclear
capabilities will improve by a great margin[26].
As for the IRBM/MRBM covering the Asia-Pacif c
region including Japan, China has deployed the solidpropellant DF-21, which can be transported and operated
on a TEL, in addition to the liquid-propellant DF-3 missiles.
These missiles are capable of carrying nuclear warheads. It is
believed that China possesses conventional ballistic missiles
with high targeting accuracy based on the DF-21[27], and it
has been pointed out that China has deployed conventional
anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs), which could be used


to attack ships at sea including aircraft carriers. In addition
to IRBM/MRBM, China possesses the DH-10 (CJ-10), a
cruise missile with a range of at least 1,500 km, as well
as the H-6 (Tu-16), bombers that are capable of carrying
nuclear weapons and cruise missiles. It is deemed that these
missiles will complement ballistic missile forces, covering
the Asia-Pacif c region including Japan[28]. Concerning
SRBM, China possesses a large number of solid-propellant
DF-16, DF-15, and DF-11, and they are believed to be
deployed facing Taiwan[29]. It is believed that their ranges
cover also a part of the Southwestern Islands including the
Senkaku Islands, which are inherent territories of Japan.
Furthermore, in order to acquire striking force that
will enable penetration of the missile defense shield, China
is considered to be developing a hypersonic glide vehicle
which is launched by mounting to a ballistic missile.
Attention will be paid to the relevant developments[30].
China announced that it had conducted tests on
midcourse missile interception technology in January 2010
and 2013. Attention will be paid to China’s future trends in
ballistic missile defense[31].

See Fig. I-1-3-2 (Range of Ballistic Missiles from China (Beijing))


22 The defense white paper “China’s Military Strategy” (May 2015) states that “China has always pursued the policy of no fi rst use of nuclear weapons and adhered to a self-defensive nuclear strategy
that is defensive in nature. China...will never enter into a nuclear arms race with any other country.” On the other hand, the U.S. DoD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments
Involving the People’s Republic of China” (May 2015) states that there is some ambiguity over the conditions under which China’s “no first use” policy would or would not apply.

23 For differences between the liquid-propellant system and solid-propellant system, see Part I, Chapter 1, Section 2, Footnote 30.

24 The DF-5 is thought to carry multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs).

25 The U.S. DoD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (May 2015) indicates that China is developing a new road mobile ICBM
known as “DF-41,” possibly capable of carrying MIRVs.

26 The annual report (November 2014) of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (a bipartisan advisory body established at U.S. Congress to monitor, investigate, and submit a report
on U.S. security implications of the trade and economic relationship between the United States and China) states that the JL-2 has already reached initial operational capability allowing for deployment,
and that by the end of 2014, a JIN-class SSBN carrying the JL-2 is set to conduct its fi rst patrol. Furthermore, the U.S. DoD’s ”Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving
the People’s Republic of China” (May 2015) states that JIN-class SSBNs carrying the JL-2 are expected to conduct nuclear deterrence patrols in 2015.

27 According to the defense white paper “China’s Military Strategy” (May 2015), China identifi es “possessing both nuclear and conventional missiles” as one of the strategies for enhancing the military
capabilities of the Second Artillery Force.

28 In its Annual Report of November 2010, the U.S.-China Economic Security Review Commission pointed out, among other items, that China could attack five out of the six main U.S. Air Force bases
in East Asia with its normal missiles (ballistic missiles and ground-launched cruise missiles), and also has the ability to target air bases in Guam by enhancing the capability of its bombers.

29 The U.S. DoD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (May 2015) states that as of late 2014, China possessed at least 1,200
SRBMs, including the DF-16.

30 In January, August, and December 2014 (total: 3 times), China reportedly conducted fl ight tests of the hypersonic glide vehicle “WU-14,” which is deemed to travel at ultra-high speed and be diffi cult
to intercept by a missile.

**(2) Ground Forces**
The size of the Chinese ground forces is the largest in the
world with approximately 1.6 million personnel. Since
1985, China has continuously sought to modernize its
armed forces by curtailing the number of personnel and
streamlining organizations and systems in order to improve
eff ciency. China aims to develop highly capable military
forces, while reducing units inferior in equipment and
technologies. Specif cally, it is improving mobility by
such measures as switching from the past regional-defense
model to a nationwide-mobile model, working to motorize
and mechanize its infantry. In addition, China is believed to
be strengthening its airborne troops (belonging to the Air
Force), amphibious forces, and special operations forces
and helicopter units. China undertakes efforts to make its
military units multifunctional, to build a command system
for improvement of its joint operational capabilities and


eff cient operations, and carries out reforms to improve its
logistical support capabilities.
Since “Stride 2009” was conf rmed in 2009, China
has carried out “Mission Action” from 2010 through
2013 and “Stride 2014” and “Firepower 2014” in 2014.
As such, China has annually conducted mobile exercises
that cut across multiple military regions aimed at verifying
and improving capabilities necessary for deployment
of Army units to distant areas, such as the Army’s longrange maneuvering capabilities[32] and logistical support
capabilities, including mobilization of militia and public
transportation. Furthermore, the Navy and Air Force
reportedly took part in “Mission Action 2013,” suggesting
that such exercises are also intended to improve joint
operational capabilities.

**(3) Naval Forces**
The naval forces consist of three f eets—the North Sea,
East Sea, and South Sea Fleets. The Chinese Navy has
approximately 870 ships (including approximately 60
submarines), with a total displacement of approximately
1.47 million tons. The Navy is in charge of maritime


national defense and protection of the sovereignty of
territorial waters and maritime rights and interests. The
Chinese Navy mass produces the indigenous state-of-theart Yuan-class submarines[33], as well as surface combatant
ships[34] with improved air defense and anti-ship attack
capabilities. In addition, the Navy is increasing the number


33 These submarines are believed to be superior in quietness and to be equipped with an air independent propulsion (AIP) system. By carrying the necessary oxygen in advance, this system allows these
submarines to remain submerged underwater for longer periods than previous submarines without accessing atmospheric oxygen by surfacing or other means.

34 For example, in recent years, China is considered to have signifi cantly increased the number of: the Luyang III-class destroyer, a fl eet air defense ship called the “Chinese Aegis” with reinforced radars
and a new model of vertical launch system (VLS) that fi res multiple missiles; the Jiangkai II-class frigate called the “mini-Aegis” equipped with VLS, and the Jiangdao-class corvette which is a “light


-----

of large landing ships and supply ships. It commissioned a
large hospital ship in October 2008.
With regard to aircraft carriers, China has renovated
the Varyag, an incomplete Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier
purchased from Ukraine. China began trial navigations
in August 2011, and named the carrier “Liaoning” and
put it into commission in September 2012[35]. Even after
the carrier was commissioned, China is thought to be
continuing the training of carrier-based aircraft pilots and
R&D of necessary technologies, including the development
of a domestic carrier based f ghter, J-15, such as takeoff
and landing tests on the “Liaoning.” In November 2013, the
carrier sailed in the South China Sea for the f rst time and
conducted sea trials in this sea area[36]. Some analysts point
out that China may also be constructing its f rst domestic
aircraft carrier[37].
In view of these developments concerning the
strengthening of the naval forces, China likely aims to build
capabilities for conducting operations in more distant waters
in addition to near sea defense[38]. It is necessary to continue
to monitor the development of the Chinese naval forces[39].


**(4) Air Forces**
The Chinese Air Force and Navy have approximately 2,620
combat aircraft in total. The number of fourth generation
modern f ghters is rising steadily. China imported from
Russia and produced under license the Su-27 f ghters, and
imported from Russia the Su-30 f ghters equipped with
anti-surface and anti-ship attack capabilities. China is also
mass-producing the J-11B f ghter, which is allegedly an
imitation of the Su-27 f ghter, as well as the domestic J-10
f ghter. Additionally, China is developing the J-20 and J-31,
which are said to become next-generation f ghters[40]. China
is also making continuous efforts to improve capabilities
which are essential for operations of modern air forces by
introducing the H-6U tanker and KJ-2000 Airborne Early
Warning and Control system. Furthermore, it is reported
that China is developing a new Y-20 large cargo aircraft[41]
in order to improve its transportation capability. In addition
to domestically developing, producing and deploying
a variety of aircraft and introducing them from Russia,
China is deemed to be domestically developing a variety of
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)[42], including those capable
of long-hour f ights at high altitude for reconnaissance and
other purposes and those capable of carrying missiles and
other weapons for attack purposes. China also appears to be
producing and deploying some of these unmanned aircraft.
Judging from the modernization of the air forces, it is
believed that China is not only improving its air defense
capabilities for its national territory, but also aiming to
build up capabilities for air superiority and anti-surface
and anti-ship attacks in areas which are further distant
from China, and improving long-range transportation
capabilities[43]. Further attention needs to be paid to these
activities conducted by the Chinese air forces.


35 The U.S. DoD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (May 2015) expresses the view that the aircraft carrier “Liaoning” will not
enable long-range power projection compared to U.S. aircraft carriers, and will continue to play a role in training. It also notes that the air wing is not expected to embark the carrier until 2015 at the
earliest or later.

36 In May 2013, it was reported that the first carrier air wing was officially established in China.

37 The U.S. DoD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (May 2015) states that China will likely build multiple indigenous aircraft
carriers over the next 15 years.

38 The U.S. DoD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (May 2015) states that the Navy’s primary area of activity is gradually
shifting from the “near seas” to the “far seas.” China’s defense white paper “China’s Military Strategy” (May 2015) also identifi es “offshore waters defense and open seas protection” as a strategy for
enhancing the military capabilities of the Navy.

39 According to the defense white paper “China’s Military Strategy” (May 2015), “the traditional mentality that land outweighs sea must be abandoned” and China will aim to “develop a modern maritime
military force structure.” As implied by these references, it is deemed that China attaches importance to its maritime strategy.

40 In his testimony at the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2011, then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated his view that China had the potential to deploy 50 next-generation
fighters equipped with stealth capability by 2020 and 200 fighters by 2025. In January 2011, China successfully conducted its first flight test of the J-20 prototype and created a total of four
prototypes by late 2014. A prototype of J-31 was confi rmed at the Zhuhai Airshow in November 2014.

41 On January 26, 2013, the Ministry of National Defense of China announced that for the fi rst time it succeeded in a trial fl ight of the Y-20 large cargo aircraft developed by China. It is believed that
since then China has continued to conduct related tests and trial fl ights.

42 During the counter-terrorism joint exercise “Peace Mission 2014” in August 2014, a CH-4 (Cai Hong-4 or Rainbow-4) medium-sized UAV conducted a demonstration bombardment.

43 In April 2014, Xi Jinping, Chairman of the Central Military Commission, visited an Air Force organization and referred to establishing an air force that “builds air-space capabilities and conducts
offensive and defensive operations.” The defense white paper “China’s Military Strategy” (May 2015) identifi es “building air-space capabilities and conducting offensive and defensive operations” as


-----

**(6) Establishment of Joint Operational Posture**
The command structure of the PLA is centered on the Army.
In recent years, however, organizational reform has been
under way to improve integrated and combined operations
capability among the military services. For example, the
third plenary session of the 18th CCP Central Committee in
November 2013 proposed a government policy to “enhance
joint operations capability and reform the command system
and organization.” As part of this, in November 2013, China
is deemed to have established the “East China Sea Joint
Operational Command Center” to jointly operate the Navy
and Air Force for such purposes as the effective surveillance
of the “East China Sea Air Defense Identif cation Zone”[44].
Some analysts have stated that the CCP also established the
“Central Military Commission Joint Operations Command
Center” to carry out decision-making at the highest strategic
level. Furthermore, China has recently conducted drills
aimed at the development of a joint operational posture,
as demonstrated by the long-distance mobile exercises
which cut across military regions such as “Stride,” as well
as the joint exercises conducted among the Army, Navy,
Air Force, and other units such as “Mission Action 2013.”
It is perceived that the establishment of joint operational
command centers, along with the above drills, is intended to
further facilitate coordination among the different military
services as well as investments across military regions. The
relevant developments will be a point to watch out for.


**(5) Military Use of Space and Cyber Warfare Capabilities**
China is said to have developed its space program the
fastest in the world, and may be utilizing space for
military purposes. China is considered to be developing
directed-energy weapons and satellite jammers in order
to restrict and interfere with the use of space-based assets
by adversaries in wartime. In addition, China has interest
in cyber space. Some have speculated that China is
reinforcing its A2/AD capabilities by using cyber attacks
to destroy an adversary’s network in the entire region. This
can be attributed to the fact that information gathering and
command and communication in the military sector, which
are vital for swift and eff cient exercise of military strength,
increasingly rely on satellites and computer networks.

See Part I, Chapter 2, Section 4 (Outer Space and Security); Part I,
Chapter 2, Section 5 (Trends in Cyberspace)


**5** **Maritime Activities**


**(1) General Situation**
In recent years, China is believed to be aiming to build up
capabilities to conduct operations in more distant waters
and airspace. Accordingly, China has rapidly expanded its
maritime activities based on sea power and air power, both
qualitatively and quantitatively. With regard to its activity
in the sea areas and airspace surrounding Japan, Chinese
naval vessels[45] and navy and air force aircraft have been
observed conducting training exercises, such as carrierbased helicopter f ights and f eet formation and maneuver
exercises, as well as information gathering activities. A
large number of Chinese government ships and aircraft
belonging to maritime law-enforcement agencies[46] have


44 During his regular press conference on July 31, 2014, the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense of China was asked whether the “East China Sea Joint Operational Command Center”
had been established, and he responded that “Setting up a joint operational command system is the inevitable requirement of joint operations under informationized conditions,” de facto confi rming
the Center’s establishment.

45 Examples of the activities of Chinese naval vessels are: a submerged Chinese nuclear-powered submarine navigated in Japan’s territorial waters in breach of international law in November 2004; it
was confirmed that a total of five Chinese naval vessels, including one Sovremenny-class destroyer, were sailing near the Kashi gas field (Tianwaitian in Chinese) in the East China Sea and some of
them circled around said gas field in September 2005.

46 Surveillance and other activities at sea used to be conducted by “Maritime Police” (Haijing) of the Ministry of Public Security, “China Maritime Surveillance” (Haijian) of the State Oceanic Administration
of the Ministry of Land and Resources, “China Fisheries Law Enforcement Command” (Yuzheng) of the Bureau of Fisheries of the Ministry of Agriculture, “Maritime Safety Administration (Haixun)” of
the Ministry of Transport, and the maritime anti-smuggling force of the General Administration of Customs, all of which were under the State Council. In March 2013, China decided to reorganize the
four agencies, excluding “Maritime Safety Administration” into the new “State Oceanic Administration” and that the new organization would carry out surveillance and other activities under the name of
“China Coast Guard (Zhongguo Haijing)” under the guidance of the Ministry of Public Security. In July of that year, the China Coast Guard was formally launched. It is believed that the State Committee
of Border and Coastal Defense, under the guidance of the State Council and the Central Military Commission, is coordinating maritime activities by these maritime law-enforcement agencies and the

been observed engaging in monitoring activities for the
protection of its maritime rights and interests[47]. Such
activities by China include those that involve intermittent
incursions into Japan’s territorial waters, intrusion into
Japan’s airspace, and dangerous acts that could cause
unintended consequences, including a Chinese vessel’s
direction of a f re control radar at a JMSDF destroyer,
the f ight of Chinese military f ghter jets abnormally
close to JSDF aircraft, and activities that could infringe
upon the freedom of overf ight over the high seas, such
as the establishment of the “East China Sea Air Defense
Identif cation Zone.” These activities are extremely
regrettable, and China is urged to act on the basis of the
principle of the “rule of law.”

See Part I, Chapter 2, Section3 (Maritime Trends)

**(2) Situation of Activities in Japan’s Surrounding**
**Sea Areas**

Regarding the activities of naval forces, the number of
Chinese naval surface vessels advancing to the Pacif c
Ocean has increased in recent years, and such advancements
are currently conducted routinely. Every year since 2008,
Chinese naval f eets have been passing the sea area between
the main island of Okinawa and Miyako Island. However,
in April 2012, a naval f eet passed the Osumi Strait
eastward for the f rst time, and in October of the same year,
they navigated the sea area between Yonaguni Island and
Nakanokami Island near Iriomote Island northward for
the f rst time. In July 2013, Chinese naval f eets passed the
Soya Strait eastward for the f rst time. In March 2015, naval
f eets navigated the sea area between Amamioshima Island
and Yokoatejima Island westward. As such, the Chinese
naval f eets’ advancement and homing routes between the
East China Sea and the Pacif c Ocean continue to become
diverse by incorporating the areas north of Japan, and it
is understood that China seeks to improve its deployment
capabilities to the open ocean. Furthermore, in October
2013, China conducted “Maneuver 5,” the f rst joint exercise
by its three naval f eets in the western Pacif c Ocean. In
December 2014, a similar joint exercise involving the three
f eets[48] was reportedly conducted. Subsequently, some of
the vessels that participated in the exercise transited the
Soya and Tsushima Straits to circle Japan.
In addition, Chinese naval vessels appear to routinely
conduct operations in the East China Sea[49]. After referring
to its own position regarding the Senkaku Islands, China
alleges that patrols by Chinese naval vessels in the sea
areas under its jurisdiction are completely justif able and
lawful. In January 2013, a Chinese naval vessel directed


f re-control radar at a JMSDF destroyer and is suspected to
have directed f re-control radar at a helicopter based on the
JMSDF destroyer[50].
With regard to the activities of Chinese government
vessels, in December 2008, “China Maritime Surveillance”
vessels belonging to the State Oceanic Administration
(SOA) of the Ministry of Land and Resources of China
hovered and drifted inside Japan’s territorial waters near
the Senkaku Islands – operations which are not permitted
under international law. In September 2010, Japan Coast
Guard patrol vessels and a Chinese f shing trawler collided
in Japan’s territorial sea surrounding the Senkaku Islands.
Subsequently, in August 2011 as well as in March and July
2012, “China Maritime Surveillance” vessels and “China
Fisheries Law Enforcement Command” vessels belonging
to then-Bureau of Fisheries of the Ministry of Agriculture
of China intruded into Japan’s aforementioned territorial
waters[51]. As these examples demonstrate, “China Maritime
Surveillance” and “China Fisheries Law Enforcement
Command” vessels have gradually intensif ed their activities
in Japan’s territorial waters in recent years. Such activities
intensif ed considerably and Chinese government vessels
began to intrude into the aforementioned territorial waters
intermittently after September 2012, when the Japanese
government acquired property rights to and ownership of
three of the Senkaku Islands (Uotsuri Island, Kitakojima
Island, and Minamikojima Island). In April and September
2013, eight Chinese government vessels intruded into the
aforementioned territorial waters simultaneously. Since
October 2013, the operations of government vessels
intended to intrude into territorial waters have become
routinized. In this light, an operations manual or other
codes may have been developed.
China has deployed increasingly larger government
vessels to waters near the Senkaku Islands. In February
2015, three over 3,000-ton-class government vessels
intruded into Japan’s territorial waters simultaneously
for the first time. Additionally, China is proceeding with
the construction of the world’s largest 10,000-ton-class
patrol vessel.

and Yokoatejima Island southwestward (March 2015)


47 Concerning the PLA, there is a view that by turning exception into normality through uniform peacetime and wartime force deployment and exceeding traditional activity spaces, China intends to
desensitize the alertness of others and make the international community tolerate and accept changes in the situation (Taiwan’s 2009 National Defense Report).

48 Some news reports call this exercise as “Maneuver 6.”

49 For example, a PLA Daily article dated February 19, 2014 reported that in recent years, the average number of days in a year that a unit in the East Sea Fleet of the Chinese Navy conducted operations
exceeded 190 days.

50 See Part I, Chapter 2, Section 3-1 (Trends Related to the “Principle of the Freedom of the High Seas” in the East China Sea and South China Sea)

51 In February 2012, a survey vessel of the Japan Coast Guard conducting a marine survey in Japan’s EEZ was demanded to stop the activity by two “China Maritime Surveillance” ships that belong to

vessels, conducted a joint exercise with a focus on
maintaining and defending China’s territorial sovereignty
and maritime interests. Furthermore, the Navy is believed
to be supporting maritime law enforcement agencies both
in terms of operation and equipment. For example, the
Navy is thought to have handed over retired Navy vessels
to the China Coast Guard[52] that was formally launched in
July 2013. In 2014, the Navy and the China Coast Guard
conducted a coordinated drill. Also, the Navy and the
Maritime Safety Administration conducted the joint drill
“Poseidon 2014.”

See Fig. I-1-3-4 (Recent Chinese Activities in Waters near Japan)

**(3) Situation of Activities in Japan’s Surrounding**
**Airspace**

In recent years, activities by Chinese Navy and Air
Force aircraft, which appear to be activities for gathering
information about Japan of some form, have been observed
frequently. The number of scrambles by the JASDF against
Chinese aircraft is also increasing dramatically[53].
With regard to the activities of air forces in the airspace
above the East China Sea, Chinese aircraft have been
diversifying their f ight patterns. Multiple H-6 bombers

Islands. In 2012, China intensif ed the activities of its
aircraft, including f ghters. In January 2013, the Chinese
Ministry of National Defense made public the fact that
Chinese military aircraft regularly conducted warning and
surveillance activities and that Chinese f ghters conducted
activities believed to be Combat Air Patrols (CAP) in the
East China Sea. In addition, in the same Chinese defense
white paper, the phrase “air vigilance and patrols at sea”
was added for the f rst time.
On November 23, 2013, the Chinese government
announced that it established the “East China Sea ADIZ”
including the Senkaku Islands which China described as if
they were a part of China’s “territory,” and that the Chinese
Armed Forces would take “defensive emergency measures”
in the case where aircraft does not follow the relevant rules
set forth by the Chinese Ministry of National Defense[54]. On
the same day, a Tu-154 intelligence gathering aircraft and a
Y-8 intelligence gathering aircraft f ew over the East China
Sea, respectively. The Chinese Air Force announced that it
conducted its f rst patrol f ight since the establishment of the
ADIZ. Subsequently, the Chinese Armed Forces announced
on November 28 that its KJ-2000 Airborne Early Warning
and Control system and Su-30 and J-11 f ghters conducted
patrol f ights in the ADIZ, and announced on the following
day that its Su-30 and J-11 f ghters scrambled. On December
26, 2013, the Chinese Armed Forces announced that in the
one month that passed since the establishment of the ADIZ,
a total of 87 reconnaissance aircraft, early warning aircraft


and f ghters were mobilized to the relevant airspace.
In March and April 2011 and in April 2012, Chinese
helicopters and other aircraft that appeared to belong to the
SOA f ew close to JMSDF destroyers which were engaged
in monitoring and surveillance in the East China Sea[55].
Further still, in May and June 2014, two Su-27 f ghters
of China f ew abnormally close to the aircraft of JMSDF
and JASDF that were conducting routine monitoring and
surveillance activities in the East China Sea[56]. The Chinese
Ministry of National Defense announced that JSDF
aircraft conducted dangerous acts against Chinese aircraft.
However, the operations of JSDF aircraft were legitimate
activities in compliance with the international law. There is
no truth to the Chinese assertion that JSDF aircraft carried
out dangerous acts.
With respect to air forces’ advancement into the
Pacif c Ocean, it was conf rmed for the f rst time by the
JASDF’s scrambling f ghters that a Y-8 early warning
aircraft and a H-6 bomber f ew through the airspace
between the main island of Okinawa and Miyako Island
and advanced to the Pacif c Ocean in July and September
2013, respectively. Similar f ights were conducted by two
Y-8 early warning aircraft and two H-6 bombers (total:
four aircraft) on three consecutive days in October of the
same year, by one Y-8 intelligence gathering aircraft and
two H-6 bombers (total: three aircraft) in March 2014,

gathering aircraft, and two H-6 bombers (total: f ve

55 For example, on March 7 2011, a Chinese Z-9 helicopter believed to belong to the SOA flew as close as approximately 70 m and as low as approximately 40 m above the water around the Japanese
destroyer Samidare, which was patrolling the waters in the central area of the East China Sea. On April 12, 2012, an incident occurred in which a Y-12 aircraft, believed to belong to the SOA flew as
close as approximately 50 m and as low as approximately 50 m above the water around the destroyer Asayuki.

aircraft) on December 6, 7, 10, and 11, 2014, by one Y-9
intelligence gathering aircraft on two consecutive days in
February 2015, and by two H-6 bombers in May 2015.
As such activities demonstrate, China has been further
intensifying the activities of its aircraft[57].
Regarding Japan’s airspace over and around the
Senkaku Islands, in December 2012, a Chinese aircraft,
namely, a f xed-wing aircraft belonging to the SOA,
violated this territorial airspace for the f rst time. Since
then, f xed-wing aircraft belonging to the SOA have been
frequently observed f ying near the airspace[58].

vessel navigating in the South China Sea. In August 2014,
a PLA f ghter is alleged to have f own abnormally close to
and intercepted a U.S. Forces aircraft. It is also reported
that Chinese naval vessels f red warning shots at f shing
boats of neighboring countries. Furthermore, in recent
years, there has been growing friction between China
and its neighboring countries over the South China Sea,
as illustrated by protests by Vietnam and the Philippines
against China’s activities in these waters, including land
reclamation on the features.
China has pressed ahead with rapid and large-scale
land reclamation works in seven features in the Spratly
Islands[59, 60]. On some of them, it is considered that China is
building infrastructure including runways and ports, which
has raised concerns among the international community,
including the United States[61]. Among them, Fiery Cross
Reef has become the largest feature in the Spratly Islands,
surpassing Itu Aba Island that was formerly the largest
feature. Presently, China is thought to be building a 3,000
m-long runway there. Furthermore, on Subi Reef where
China started large-scale land reclamation work in early
2015, analysts have speculated that reclaimed land has
already become large enough to accommodate another
runway as of April 2015.

See Part I, Chapter 1, Section 6 (Southeast Asia); Part I, Chapter 2,
Section 3 (Maritime Trends)

Additionally, Chinese naval vessels have advanced
into the Indian Ocean. Since December 2008, Chinese
naval vessels have been navigating in the Indian Ocean and
advanced into the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden
to take part in international anti-piracy efforts. In 2010 and
2013, a Chinese Navy’s hospital ship carried out “Mission
Harmony,” a medical service mission, to assist countries,
including countries off the coast of the Indian Ocean.
Furthermore, from the end of 2013 to the beginning of
2014, the Chinese Navy’s Shang-class nuclear submarine
reportedly conducted operations in the Indian Ocean.


**(4) Situation of Activities in the South China Sea and**
**Indian Ocean**

China has also been intensifying its activities in the South
China Sea, including waters around the Spratly Islands and
the Paracel Islands, over which territorial disputes exist
with neighbors, including some ASEAN member states. In
March 2009 and December 2013, a Chinese naval vessel
and other vessels approached and intercepted a U.S. Navy


57 On March 30, 2015, the spokesperson of the PLA Air Force announced that Air Force aircraft transited the Bashi Channel, between Taiwan and the Philippines, and conducted their fi rst training in
airspace over the West Pacifi c. On May 21, 2015, the same spokesperson announced that for the fi rst time PLA Air Force aircraft fl ew through the airspace between the main island of Okinawa and
Miyakojima Island and conducted training in airspace over the West Pacifi c.

58 There are also reports that China is constructing a heliport and radar installations on the Nanji Islands facing the East China Sea.

59 The seven features are: Johnson South Reef; Cuarteron Reef; Gaven Reefs; Hughes Reef; Fiery Cross Reef; Mischief Reef; and Subi Reef.

60 The U.S. DoD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (May 2015) states that “[a]s of late December 2014, China had reclaimed
about 500 acres (about 2 km[2]) of land” and that China may build “harbors, communications and surveillance systems, logistics support, and...airfi eld.” At the time of this annual report’s release, a
U.S. DoD offi cial noted that the area of land reclaimed by China totals about 2,000 acres (about 8 km[2]). This would mean that the size of the reclaimed area nearly quadrupled in roughly four months.
On April 29, 2015, in regard to a comment concerning rising international concern over China’s land reclamation, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China stated that a few ASEAN
countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam have illegally occupied the islands of the Spratly Islands and are undertaking large-scale construction work to build airports and other fi xed facilities.
Indeed, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) of the United States, Vietnam carried out land reclamation in two locations in the South China Sea from 2010 to April
2015, stating that Vietnam added about 65,000 m[2] to West London Reef and about 21,000 m[2] to Sand Cay. However, as U.S. Vice President Biden noted in his address at the commencement of the
U.S. Naval Academy on May 22, 2015, China’s land reclamation is not nearly on the scale comparable to what other countries are doing.

61 As regards U.S. concerns, for example, in March 2015, then-U.S. Pacifi c Fleet Commander Harry Harris expressed concern, referring to China’s land reclamation in the South China Sea as “a great
wall of sand.” On May 16, 2015, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry held talks with Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi of China and stated “we are concerned about the pace and scope of China’s
land reclamation in the South China Sea.” On May 30, at the 14th Shangri-La Dialogue (Asia Security Summit), U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter stated that the United States was “deeply
concerned” about China’s land reclamation, saying it has generated tension in the region, and called for “an immediate halt” to land reclamation. At the same meeting, Sun Jianguo, Deputy Chief of
General Staff of the PLA stated that such land reclamation on the features in the South China Sea falls “well within the scope of China’s sovereignty “ and that these activities meet the “necessary
defense needs” in addition to such objectives as maritime search and rescue and disaster prevention and relief. In addition, the Deputy Chief asserted that “the situation in the South China Sea is on
the whole peaceful and stable, and there has never been an issue with the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.” As regards the concerns of the international community, for example, the
ASEAN Chairman’s Statement adopted in April 2015 states, “we share the serious concerns,” on the land reclamation being undertaken on the features in the South China Sea. On May 26, 2015, EU
President Donald Tusk criticized China over its land reclamation on the features in the South China Sea, stating that “construction activities on the sea” “will make it much more diffi cult to solve the
problem” in the region. Furthermore, at the G7 Summit held in Elmau, Germany on June 7-8, 2015, a Leaders’ Declaration was released stating that, “[w]e strongly oppose...any unilateral actions

From September to October 2014, a Song-class submarine
conducted operations in the Indian Ocean and is deemed
to have called at a port in Colombo, Sri Lanka, twice in
the same year. This marked the f rst time that a Chinese
submarine entered port abroad[62]. Also in 2014, a Chinese
naval vessel is said to have advanced into the Indian Ocean
from the Sunda Strait and conducted trainings. As such
examples demonstrate, the Chinese Navy has improved
its capacity to execute operations in more distant waters,
including the Indian Ocean.

**(5) Objectives of Maritime Activities**
Taking into consideration such factors as the situation of
the development of Chinese naval and air forces, situation
of activities in sea areas and airspace, statements in defense
white papers, China’s geographical location and economic
globalization, the maritime activities of the Chinese Navy,
Air Force and other organizations are considered to have
the following objectives.
The f rst one is to intercept operations by adversaries
in waters and airspace as far as possible from China
in order to defend its territory, territorial waters and
territorial airspace. Behind this objective is an increase in
effectiveness of long-range attacks due to recent progress
in science and technology.
The second objective is to develop military capabilities
to deter and prevent Taiwan’s independence. China
maintains that it will not allow any foreign intervention
in solving the Taiwan issue and realizing the unif cation


of China. In order for China to try to prevent foreign
intervention into Taiwan surrounded by the sea in all
directions through China’s use of force, it needs to enhance
its military operational capabilities at sea and airspace.
The third objective is to weaken the control of other
countries over the islands to which China claims territorial
sovereignty, while strengthening the claim of its territorial
sovereignty, through various surveillance activities and use
of force at sea and in airspace surrounding the islands.
The fourth objective is to acquire, maintain, and
protect its maritime rights and interests. China is engaged
in oil and gas drilling as well as building facilities and
surveying for the drilling in the East China Sea and South
China Sea. The government has conf rmed that in addition
to its existing platforms, China has been building a new
offshore platform on the Chinese side of the Japan-China
median line of the East China Sea since June 2013. Japan
has repeatedly lodged protests against China’s unilateral
development and demanded the termination of such work[63].
The f fth objective is to defend its sea lanes of
communications. In the background is the fact that its
sea lanes of communications, including its crude oil
transportation routes from the Middle East, are extremely
important for the globalizing Chinese economy. The
question of which parts of its sea lanes of communication
the Chinese Navy deems it should defend depends on such
factors as the international situation at the time. However,
given the recent strengthening of the Chinese Navy and Air
Force, it is believed that they will develop a capacity to


62 On September 25, 2014, the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense of China formally admitted for the fi rst time that a Chinese submarine called at a port in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

63 With regard to resource development in the East China Sea, in September 2010, China unilaterally announced postponement of the negotiation to conclude an international agreement with Japan
for implementing the so-called “June 2008 Agreement.” While the negotiation has not been resumed yet, it is pointed out that China is highly likely carrying out gas production in the Kashi gas field

defend areas going beyond the waters near China.
Given these objectives and recent trends in China’s
activities in sea areas and airspace, it is believed that China
plans to further expand the sphere of its maritime activities,
and further intensify its operations in waters surrounding
Japan, including the East China Sea and the Pacif c Ocean,
as well as the South China Sea and the airspaces over these
seas areas. Therefore, more attention needs to be paid to
activities such as operations of naval vessels as well as Navy
and Air Force aircraft, various surveillance operations near
Japan, developments of facilities that serve as bases for
these activities[64], and evolution of China’s interpretation
regarding the nature and scope of rights in China’s exclusive
economic zones (EEZs) and other areas[65].
Meanwhile, in recent years, China has shown interest
in taking steps to avoid and prevent unexpected situations at
sea. For example, in April 2014, China, together with other
countries such as Japan and the United States, agreed to the
Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES), which sets
forth the standards of behavior in the case that the naval
vessels or aircraft of the Western Pacif c Naval Symposium
(WPNS) member states have unexpected encounters.
In September 2014, Japanese and Chinese defense
authorities agreed in principle to resume consultations to
swiftly begin the implementation of the Maritime and Air
Communication Mechanism, which China had not agreed
to since September 2012. Based on the achievements made
at the Japan-China Summit Meeting in November 2014, the
fourth Joint Working Group meeting was held in January
2015[66]. In November 2014, President Obama and President
Xi Jinping announced that they agreed on two conf dencebuilding measures[67] in order to lower the risk of unintended
incidents between the United States and China.


promote its national interests overseas, as well as China’s
intent to raise its stature by demonstrating its will to fulf ll
its responsibilities to the international community.
China states that it consistently supports and actively
participates in U.N. PKO. According to the Ministry of
National Defense of China, it has sent more than 30,000
military personnel to U.N. PKO. According to the U.N.,
as of late April 2015, China has deployed a total of 2,899
personnel, civilian police off cers, and military observers
to U.N. PKO, including the United Nations Mission in
the Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS). Thus, China
demonstrates certain presence in U.N. PKO. It is deemed
that China’s proactive attitude towards U.N. PKO is partly
due to China’s wish to strengthen its relations with the
regions where PKO is conducted, particular with African
nations, through these activities.
Furthermore, as its f rst mission in distant waters,
the Chinese Navy has dispatched vessels to the coast of
Somalia and the Gulf of Aden since December 2008 in
order to escort Chinese and other ships. The Chinese Navy
is hence improving its capacity to continuously execute
naval operations in more distant waters, demonstrating that
China is placing a greater emphasis on protecting its sea
lanes of transportation.
In view of the deteriorating situation in Libya,
China carried out an evacuation operation of Chinese
nationals from the country from February through March
2011. In this operation, China dispatched a naval frigate
and transportation aircraft of the Air Force to Libya in
addition to private chartered aircraft. This is the military’s
f rst participation in an evacuation operation of Chinese
nationals living overseas. In addition, from November
to December 2013, China dispatched a hospital ship to
conduct medical relief activities in the Philippines. From
March to September 2014, China dispatched a Navy vessel,
Air Force transport aircraft, among other assets for the
search of the Malaysian airliner that went missing in March
2014. In December 2014, a Chinese Navy vessel helped
supply water in Malé, the capital city of the Maldives.
In response to the Ebola virus disease outbreak in West
Africa, China conducted assistance centered on medical
assistance, including the dispatch of units to Sierra Leone
and Liberia to help f ght Ebola[68]. Furthermore, from March
to April 2015, based on the worsening situation in Yemen,


**6** **International Military Activities**


In recent years, the PLA has begun emphasizing nontraditional security missions such as peacekeeping,
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and anti-piracy.
In order to carry out these missions, it has actively dispatched
its units overseas. It is believed that in the background of
the PLA’s stance on international military activities is the
expansion of China’s national interests beyond its national
borders, which in turn increased its necessity to protect and


64 China is reportedly constructing a large-scale naval base that has underground tunnels for nuclear-powered submarines in the city of Sanya located in the southern tip of Hainan island. Experts point
out that the base is in a strategically important location that secures access to the South China Sea, as well as the western Pacific, and that China is advancing construction work in order for the base
to play a role as a major hub of the South Sea Fleet, including for the deployment of aircraft carrier.

65 It is pointed out that, in recent years, China aims to limit military activities of other countries in coastal areas of China’s EEZs by employing its own interpretations of the United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). For instance, the Chinese government announced in a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on November 26, 2010 that it is opposed to unsanctioned military
activities by any country in coastal areas of China’s EEZs.

66 Since 2008, Japanese and Chinese defense authorities have conducted three rounds of consultations. In June 2012, the two sides agreed to hold regular meetings, set up a hotline, and establish
a “maritime communication mechanism” to allow for direct communication between vessels and aircraft. The purpose was to deepen mutual understanding and mutual trust, strengthen defense
cooperation, avoid unexpected incidents, and prevent unexpected situations at sea and in airspace from developing into military confrontations or political issues. At the fourth Joint Working Group
meeting, the two sides agreed to change the name of the mechanism to “Maritime and Air Communication Mechanism” to clarify that aircraft are included.

67 The fi rst measure concerns mutual notifi cation of military activities, and the second measure concerns rules of behavior to avoid incidents at sea and in airspace.

68 China’s assistance for the Ebola response has garnered international praise. Meanwhile, some note that China is manufacturing the generic of the anti-infl uenza drug Avigan tablet that is hoped to

the Chinese Navy’s counter-piracy forces docked at the
ports of Aden, Al Hudaydah, and elsewhere, and engaged
in operations for the evacuation of Chinese nationals and
foreign nationals, including one Japanese national, living in
Yemen. It has been pointed out that through such activities,
China aims to build a pacif st and humanitarian image of
its military forces and to demonstrate, both domestically
and internationally, its intent to place priority on military
operations other than war, as well as its desire to prove the
ability to project its military power to distant locations.


other than war (MOOTW), education in knowledge and
expertise required for informatization, simulated training
of high-tech weapons and equipment, network training, and
training in complex electromagnetic environments where
electronic interference occurs, in addition to joint exercises
by different services.
In the education spectrum, the PLA aims to develop
military personnel versed in science and technology. In 2003,
it launched a human resource strategy project to develop
human resources capable of directing joint operations/
informatized operations and of building informatized
armed forces. The project has a goal of achieving a big leap
in the development of military personnel to 2020. In recent
years, the PLA appears to be increasing its wage standards.
It is believed that its objective is to secure highly capable
human resources. Moreover, in 2000, in order to recruit
highly capable and highly educated people, the military
started a system where it provides scholarships for civilian
college students and then allows them to enter the military
as commissioned off cers after graduation. On the other
hand, in recent years, a variety of issues have been raised in
relation to benef ts, including remuneration, the personnel
development system, and the treatment of veterans[70].
China has been developing a mobilization system
with a view to effective use of civilian resources in the case
of war and other emergencies. In February 2010, China
enacted the National Defense Mobilization Law, which is
the basic law for wartime mobilization, and in July of the
same year, put the law into effect.
In November 2014, China enacted and immediately
entered into force the Counter-Espionage Law, which is
the revised National Security Law, in order to strengthen
China’s counter-espionage arrangements. China is also
expected to develop other legislation, such as the CounterTerrorism Law currently in deliberation. Attention will be
paid to the specif c steps that advance the “rule of law”
presented at the fourth plenary session of the 18th CCP
Central Committee in 2014.


**7** **Education and Training**


In recent years, the PLA has conducted practical exercises
including large-scale exercises such as joint exercises of
the Army, Navy, and Air Force, actual troop confrontation
exercises, landing exercises, and exercises that cut across
military regions, as well as night-time exercises and joint
exercises with other countries in order to strengthen
its operational capabilities. The goal of “being able to
f ght and winning battles” was repeatedly mentioned in
statements addressed to the military by General Secretary
Xi Jinping as well as in the military training instructions
given by the general staff. This is construed as evidence
that the military is promoting implementation of more
practical exercises[69]. The whole PLA military training
conference in 2006 emphasized promotion of a shift from
military training under the conditions of mechanization to
military training under the conditions of informatization.
The new Outline of Military Training and Evaluation, in
effect since 2009, highlights training for military operations


**8** **National Defense Industry Sector**


While China imports highly sophisticated military
equipment and parts that it cannot produce domestically
from other countries such as Russia, China is believed to
place emphasis on their indigenous production. The country
manufactures much of its military equipment domestically


69 The 2015 military training instructions continued to promote practical trainings. In addition, they pursued the realization of military governance based on law, showing that the “rule of law” element
presented at the fourth plenary session of the 18th CCP Central Committee in 2014 was refl ected.

70 The report “China’s Incomplete Military Transformation” (February 2015) by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission and the RAND Corporation identifi es the weaknesses of the
PLA as the following: (1) Organizational structure (e.g., party-military relations); (2) Organizational culture (e.g., corruption); (3) Force structure (size of the PLA, recruitment system, veteran’s benefi ts);

and actively carries out R&D of new equipment. China’s
national defense industry sector appears to be making
advances due to the improvement of private industry
infrastructures accompanying economic growth, use of
dual technologies, the absorption of foreign technologies,
as well as its own efforts. The sector serves the role of
supporting the strengthening of Chinese military forces[71].
Growth in the Chinese defense industry was once
hindered by ineff ciency caused by excessive secrecy and
other factors. However, in recent years, reform of the defense
industry has progressed. Under the State Administration of
Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense
(SASTIND) of the Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology, a department of the State Council, China has


formed ten corporations to develop and produce nuclear
weapons, missiles, rockets, aircraft, vessels, and other
conventional weapons. In doing so, China promotes, in
particular, two-way technological exchanges where military
technologies are utilized for developing the national
economy, and, in turn, civilian technologies are absorbed
for a buildup of national defense. As a result, specif cally,
the technologies of the defense industry have contributed to
the development of civilian space exploration, the aviation
industry, and the shipbuilding industry.
Furthermore, China encourages and supports
international cooperation and competition in dual-use
industries. China is thus thought to have interest in
absorbing foreign technologies through dual-use industries.

**3** **Relations with Other Countries**


are thought to include alleviating other countries’ concerns
regarding China by strengthening its relations with these
countries, creating a favorable security environment for
China, enhancing China’s inf uence in the international
community, securing stable supplies of natural resources
and energy, and building foreign bases. China is believed
to consider military exchanges as a strategic means to
safeguard its national interests, and as such, to position
military exchanges as an element in China’s overall
diplomatic strategy. Moreover, in the f eld of international
f nance, China has established the New Development Bank
BRICS and is preparing to establish AIIB.


**1** **General Situation**


China, particularly over maritime issues where its interests
conf ict with others’, continues to act in an assertive
manner, including coercive attempts at changing the
status quo, and is poised to fulf ll its unilateral demands
without compromise. In addition, China has acted to create
its unique international order. In May 2014, President
Xi Jinping criticized military alliances and proposed
“the security of Asia by the people of Asia” at CICA.
Furthermore, China has proposed to build a “New Model
of Major-Country Relations” with the United States[72], and
calls on the United States to respect China’s “core interests.”
Some have speculated that through this concept, China
attempts to have the United States accept the partitioning
of U.S. and Chinese interests in the Asia-Pacif c. On the
other hand, China recognizes that a peaceful and stable
international environment is necessary for maintaining
sustainable economic development and enhancing China’s
overall national power. Based on such recognition, in its
relationships with other countries, China proactively
carries out military exchanges including reciprocal visits
by senior military off cials and joint military exercises. In
recent years, China has been engaged in dynamic military
exchanges not only with major powers such as the United
States and Russia and with its neighboring countries
including Southeast Asian countries, but also with
countries in Africa and Latin America. At the same time,
the objectives of China’s promotion of military exchanges


**2** **Relations with Taiwan**

China upholds the principle that Taiwan is a part of China,
and that the Taiwan issue is therefore a domestic issue.
The country maintains that the “one-China” principle is
the underlying premise and foundation for discussions
between China and Taiwan. China also claims that it would
never abandon its efforts for peaceful unif cation, and
expresses that it would take up policies and measures to
solve issues of Taiwanese people’s interest and to protect
their due authority. Meanwhile, China is strongly opposed
to any foreign intervention in the unif cation of China as
well as any move towards the independence of Taiwan, and
on this basis, has repeatedly stated that it has not renounced
the use of force. The Anti-Secession Law, enacted in March
2005, clearly lays out the non-renunciation of the use of


71 The U.S. DoD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (May 2015) states that China’s advanced technology acquisition strategy
continues to rely on the acquisition of advanced and Western dual-use technology, components, equipment, and know-how.

72 “New Model of Major-Country Relations” dates back to 2012, when then-Vice President Xi Jinping visited the United States and utilized the term during his talks with President Obama. China explains

military force by China[73].
Ma Ying-jeou (Kuomintang), re-elected in the
presidential election in January 2012, continues to
advocate, in his second term, a policy of pursuing Taiwanese
economic development by expanding economic exchanges
with China and the status quo rather than independence.
As exemplif ed by the entry into force of the Economic
Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), the bilateral
relationship is deepening primarily along the economic
realm. In February 2014, the Minister of the Taiwan Affairs
Off ce of the State Council of China and the Minister of
the Mainland Affairs Council of Taiwan held the f rst
ministerial meeting between China and Taiwan in Nanjing.
However, the Kuomintang suffered a crushing defeat in
the nine-in-one local elections in November 2014, and this
may have implications on China-Taiwan relations. On the
security front, while China urges that the two countries
make contact and hold exchanges over military issues
at an appropriate time in order to explore the creation
of mechanisms for building mutual trust over military
security, Taiwan has shown a cautious stance, stating that
the conditions are not yet met[74]. Regarding the Senkaku
Islands, China and Taiwan have their own assertions[75],
and Taiwan has expressed reluctance to work with China.
Attention will be paid to trends of political dialogues,
including on military affairs, as well as to trends in the
future relations between China and Taiwan in the lead-up
to the next presidential election in 2016.


the two countries. At the same time, the United States
calls on China to uphold international rules and norms on
global issues, including maritime security, international
trade, and human rights, and states that it would continue
to closely monitor China’s military modernization
and expanding presence in Asia[76]. Conversely, China
seeks to establish what it calls a “New Model of MajorCountry Relations” based on mutual respect and “winwin” cooperation. However, the United States and China
have not necessarily reached a consensus on what this
relationship exactly entails[77].
Regarding the Senkaku Islands, the United States has
reiterated that the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty applies to
the islands[78]. China protested, stating that it would never
accept any word or deed that includes the islands within
the scope of the treaty (statement by a spokesperson of
China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2010). With regard
to the issues over the South China Sea, the United States
has noted on various occasions that it would take action to
settle the dispute fairly and peacefully and to safeguard the
principle of freedom of navigation in the high seas[79].
China and the United States have deepened military
exchanges and conducted various policy dialogues. China
has dispatched observers to U.S. military exercises, and
joint drills have been conducted between the Chinese and
U.S. navies on mutual port visits. A military hotline between
the defense departments of the two countries was set up in
April 2008. In November 2013, the U.S. and Chinese armies
conducted a humanitarian assistance and disaster relief
exercise. In addition, from June 2014, Chinese navy vessels
participated in the Rim of the Pacif c Exercise (RIMPAC)
for the f rst time. However, while China wishes to develop
relations between the Chinese and U.S. militaries, it asserts
that there are a number of issues that must be resolved in
order to realize the sound development of the relations.
The issues include U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, activities
of U.S. military vessels and aircraft within China’s EEZs,
legal hurdles in mutual military exchanges, and a lack of
strategic trust in China on the part of the United States[80].
In addition, some unstable facets have been observed in


**3** **Relations with the United States**


There are various outstanding issues between the United
States and China, such as human rights in China, the Taiwan
issue, and trade issues. However, since a stable U.S.-China
relationship is essential for China to develop its economy,
it is believed that China will continue to aspire to maintain
stable relations with the United States.
The United States states that it welcomes the rise of
a stable, peaceful, and prosperous China, and that it will
continue to further deepen cooperative relations between


73 The law stipulates, “[in] the event that the ‘Taiwan independence’ secessionist forces should act under any name or by any means to cause the fact of Taiwan’s secession from China, or that major
incidents entailing Taiwan’s secession from China should occur, or that possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted, the state shall employ non-peaceful means and other
necessary measures to protect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”

74 For China’s stance, see the remarks made by then-CCP General Secretary Hu Jintao at the discussion on December 31, 2008, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the announcement of the
Message to Compatriots in Taiwan. For Taiwan’s stance, see the “Quadrennial Defense Review” (QDR) released by the Ministry of National Defense of Taiwan on March 13, 2013.

75 Taiwanese authority vessels intruded into Japan’s territorial waters near the Senkaku Islands three times in 2012.

76 U.S. National Security Strategy (February 2015)

77 The United States is cautious on the concept of the “(New Model of) Major-Country Relations” that describes the United States and China as having an “equal” and “special” relationship. The United
States has shown intent not to utilize the term “core interests” and align itself with China’s unilateral assertions.

78 In April 2014, President Obama became the fi rst U.S. President in history to clearly state that Article 5 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty applied to the Senkaku Islands.

79 For example, on May 22, 2015, U.S. Vice President Biden stated the following in his address at the commencement ceremony of the U.S. Naval Academy: “In the disputed waters of the South China Sea,
the United States does not privilege the claims of one nation over another. But we do – unapologetically – stand up for the equitable and peaceful resolution of disputes and for the freedom of navigation.”

80 According to remarks by then-Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) Xu Caihou in a meeting with then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates (October 2009). Deputy Chief of
the PLA General Staff Department Ma Xiaotian stated at the 11th round of the U.S.-China Defense Consultative Talks held in December 2010 that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, U.S. laws that impose
restrictions on contacts between the military forces of the two countries, and the frequent military reconnaissance operations conducted by U.S. naval vessels and aircraft in coastal areas of China’s

military exchanges of the two countries. For example, China
notif ed suspensions of the major military exchanges with
the United States when the U.S. DoD notif ed Congress of
possible arms sales to Taiwan in October 2008 and January
2010. On the other hand, the United States maintains that
China’s military development, lack of transparency of the
decision-making process, and other issues raise questions
about its future conduct and intentions. It asserts that
U.S.-China relations must be undergirded by a process of
enhancing conf dence and reducing misunderstanding. For
this reason, with regard to military exchanges, it is believed
that the aim of the United States is to improve the current
situation, wherein such exchanges are frequently suspended
once problems arise, and to build relations that are capable
of maintaining more stable channels of decision-making
for mutual understanding. In recent years, for instance,
Strategic Security Dialogues have been established in 2011
in the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogues, and
these dialogues have been held annually.


**4** **Relations with Russia**

Since the China-Soviet confrontation ended in 1989,
both countries have placed importance on their bilateral
relationship. The deepening of the “strategic partnership”
between China and Russia, which was established in the
mid-1990s, has been emphasized. In 2001, the ChinaRussia Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly
Cooperation[81] was concluded. Subsequently, in 2004, the
long-standing issue of border demarcation between the two
countries came to a settlement. The two countries have a
common view on promoting the multipolarization of the
world and the establishment of a new international order. In
addition, economic motives including their currency swap
agreement, collaboration on high-speed railway, multiple
investment framework agreements, and natural resource
and energy supply through the construction of a natural gas
pipeline have further deepened the relations between them
in recent years.
On the military front, since the 1990s, China has
purchased modern weapons from Russia, including f ghters,
destroyers, and submarines. Russia is currently the largest
supplier of weapons to China. Meanwhile, some point
out that their trade amounts have been on the decline in
recent years due to the advancement of indigenous weapon
production in China. However, China has reportedly shown
strong interest in continuing to import advanced equipment,
such as Russia’s Su-35 f ghter and S-400 surface-to-air
missile[82]. It is also pointed out that Russia, which shares
a land border with China, has a policy of not supplying
sophisticated weapons to China that would cause a threat
to Russia. Furthermore, Russia is said to have concerns
about competing with China in arms exports. China and
Ukraine have deep ties in the f eld of arms procurement, as
indicated by China’s purchase from Ukraine its unf nished
Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier “Varyag,” which became
the basis of the aircraft carrier “Liaoning.” In this regard,
attention will also be paid to the situation in Ukraine.
China-Russia military exchanges include regular
visits by senior military off cials. In addition, joint military


81 Regarding the military field, this treaty mentions military confidence building or strengthening of mutual troop reductions in border areas, military cooperation such as military technical cooperation,
and holding discussions in the event that there is awareness of any threat to peace.

82 China and Russia reportedly reached an agreement on S-400 surface-to-air missile imports. Meanwhile, China is alleged to be plagiarizing and copying Russia’s military and science technology,
including uniquely redesigning the J-11B fi ghter based on the Russian-made Su-27 fi ghter. Some suggest that Russia harbors deep dissatisfaction and concerns over China, and is cautious about

exercises are conducted, such as the large-scale joint naval
exercise, “Naval Interaction,” in the Yellow Sea, the Sea
of Japan off the coast of Vladivostok, northern East China
Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea in April 2012, July 2013,
May 2014, and May 2015, respectively[83]. It is believed
that through these exchanges the two countries can deepen
mutual understanding and build conf dence between their
military forces, and China can learn operational methods
of Russian weapons and military operational doctrines. In
2015, an agreement was reached that the leaders of both
countries would attend each other’s events commemorating
the 70th anniversary of World War II victory[84]. In May,
President Xi Jinping attended the ceremony marking the
70th anniversary of Russia’s victory in the Great Patriotic
War held in Moscow, and the PLA participated in the
military parade.


visited Brunei, Thailand and Vietnam. While China has
deepened its economic and cultural cooperation with
ASEAN member states through diplomatic forums, more
recently, it has proactively advanced cooperation in the
area of national security by enhancing exchanges of
military personnel such as mutual visits of their senior
military off cials and exchanges and cooperation between
military departments.

**(2) Relations with Central Asian Countries**
The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, located in the
western part of China, is situated next to Central Asia. It
shares borders with the three countries of Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, and has ethnic minorities settled
in the areas straddling borders. Naturally, the region hosts
lively exchanges between the people of those countries.
Therefore, China is deeply concerned about the political
stability and security situations in Central Asian states such
as terrorism by Islamic extremists. Chinese engagement
in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which
was established in June 2001, is viewed as an indication
of China’s concerns in such areas. Moreover, China is
strongly interested in the abundant energy and natural
resources of Central Asia, with a view to diversifying its
supply source and procurement methods of these resources.
China promotes cooperation in the energy f eld with Central
Asian countries, such as the construction of oil and natural
gas pipelines between China and Central Asian nations.


**5** **Relations with Other Countries**


**(1) Relations with Southeast Asian Countries**
As for its relations with countries in Southeast Asia,
China has continuously developed bilateral relations with
the countries through active mutual top-level visits and
other means. For example, China has had good relations
with Myanmar and has assisted in developing Myanmar’s
infrastructure such as pipelines for petroleum or natural
gas, ports, and railroads. It also has supplied key military
equipment. Some point out that this close relationship is
associated with Myanmar’s location which provides China
the shortest access to the Indian Ocean[85].
Meanwhile, China’s drilling in the oil and gas f elds
in the Paracel Islands in May 2014 has escalated tension
between China and Vietnam. Similarly, China and the
Philippines have ongoing disputes over the Scarborough
Shoal, Second Thomas Shoal, and other areas. Some
ASEAN countries have shown alarm over China’s
advancements in the South China Sea.
China is actively involved in multilateral frameworks
such as ASEAN Plus One (China), ASEAN Plus Three
(Japan, China and the ROK), and the ASEAN Regional
Forum (ARF). In October 2013, President Xi Jinping
visited Indonesia and Malaysia, and Premier Li Keqiang


**(3) Relations with South Asian Countries**
China has traditionally maintained an extremely close
relationship with Pakistan, and mutual visits by their
leaders take place frequently[86]. It is believed that, as
illustrated by the joint development of the JF-17 f ghter,
their cooperation in the military sector, including
exporting weapons and military technology transfer, is
also deepening. As the importance of sea lanes increases
for the globalizing Chinese economy, it is believed that
the importance of Pakistan is rising for China. This is
partly because of the geopolitical features of Pakistan,
namely, it faces the Indian Ocean.
China and India have an unsettled border, and it is


83 China and Russia conducted their fi rst large-scale joint military exercise in China’s Shandong Peninsula and other locations in August 2005. In addition, the counter-terrorism joint exercise Peace
Mission was carried out among SCO member states in August 2007, July 2009, September 2010, June 2012, July to August 2013, and August 2014.

84 The announcement was made by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China during a regular press conference on February 6, 2015.

85 Some observers also believe that Myanmar is attempting to end its excessive dependence on China in terms of diplomacy.

86 In April 2015, Xi Jinping made the fi rst offi cial visit to Pakistan as a Chinese President in nearly nine years. During the summit meeting, Xi Jinping underscored China’s intention to build a ChinaPakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and strengthen their security cooperation. China identifi es CPEC, which starts from the port of Gwadar in Pakistan, as a fl agship project of the “One Belt, One Road”

deemed that “problems” over this area have arisen between
the two countries even in recent years[87]. On the other hand,
China has recently striven to improve its relationship with
India, while also paying consideration to maintaining
balance with Pakistan. Identifying China’s relationship
with India as a strategic partnership, the leaders of the
two countries actively conduct mutual visits. It is believed
that the deepening of bilateral relations is attributed to the
importance China places on the economic growth of both
countries as well as China’s response to strengthening
U.S.-India relations.
In recent years, China has also proceeded to deepen
its relations with Sri Lanka. China constructed a deep
sea port in Hambantota. In addition, the Chinese and Sri
Lankan governments are jointly carrying out a port city
development project in Sri Lanka’s major city of Colombo.
However, President Maithripala Sirisena who won the
election in January 2015 criticized excessive dependence
on China and noted on strengthening relations with Japan,
the United States, India, among other countries. Sri Lanka
is thus expected to pursue balanced foreign relations, and
attention will be on the future of China-Sri Lanka relations.
Regarding military exchanges, China has conducted
a variety of joint exercises with Pakistan and India since
2003, including joint naval search and rescue exercises.

**(4) Relations with EU Countries**
For China, the European Union (EU) countries are now
as important a partner as Japan and the United States,
especially in the economic f eld. China, through diplomatic
opportunities, strongly requests EU countries to lift their
arms embargoes against China which have been imposed
since the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989[88].
Regarding information technology, avionics, and air
independent propulsion (AIP) systems for submarines and
other areas, EU member countries possess more advanced
technologies than China or Russia which exports weapons
to China. Therefore, if the EU arms embargo on China
were lifted, the weapons and military technologies of EU
countries would transfer to China and would be utilized as
a bargaining chip to gain the edge in weapons transactions
with Russia. For this reason, Japan has consistently


expressed to the EU its objection to the lifting of the
arms embargo on China, as well as requested EU member
states to carry out more rigorous management of the
exports of arms, dual-use goods, and their technologies to
China. Continuous attention will need to be paid to future
discussions within the EU.

**(5) Relations with Middle East and African Countries,**
**Pacific Islands, and Central and South American**
**Countries**

China has been enhancing its relations with Middle Eastern
and African nations in the economic realm, including
providing active assistance for their infrastructure
development and investment in their resource and energy
development, and has been further expanding its inf uence
in the region. In recent years, not only interactions among
state leaders and senior military off cials but also arms
exports and exchanges between military forces are actively
conducted[89]. Behind these moves, some see China’s
intention to ensure a stable supply of energy and natural
resources and to secure overseas hubs in the future[90].
Furthermore, China has strengthened its engagement in the
region, actively sending personnel to U.N. PKO missions
in Africa and dispatching a group of public health experts
to Sierra Leone and Liberia to respond to the Ebola virus
disease outbreak.
China has also been boosting its relations with the
Pacif c islands. It has been developing oil, natural gas,
and cobalt mines in Papua New Guinea and has signed
an agreement on military cooperation with the country.
Proactive and continual economic assistance has also
been implemented to other islands. Furthermore, military
exchanges are being promoted with Fiji and Tonga[91].
China has striven to further deepen its relations with
Central and South American countries. Chinese senior
military off cials have continuously visited countries,
such as Argentina and Brazil. In 2011, the Chinese Navy’s
hospital ship conducted a medical service mission in this
region. In January 2015, China and the Community of
Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) held their
f rst ministerial meeting.


87 According to a press conference by the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense of China in August 2013. In September 2014, when President Xi Jinping visited India, Prime Minister Modi
expressed concern over the PLA’s cross-border activities in this area and underscored the need for the resolution of the issue.

88 For example, in November 2010, then-Chinese President Hu Jintao visited France, and on this occasion, China and France announced a joint statement that included text supporting the lifting of the
arms embargoes against China. It is deemed that some EU countries have positive opinions about the lifting of their arms embargoes against China.

89 On February 6, 2015, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced the establishment of a permanent mission to the African Union (AU).

90 In May 2015, President Ismail Omar Guelleh of Djibouti revealed that the country and China were negotiating on the establishment of a Chinese military base in the port of Djibouti.

including Venezuela and Bolivia. Some experts claim
that China transfers weapons in order to strengthen its
strategic relationships with allies, enhance its inf uence in
the international community, and secure energy and natural
resources. Some observers point out that China supplies
weapons to countries that struggle with democracy or have
human rights problems[92]. Attention will be paid to whether
China will increase the transparency of international
weapons transfer in response to the concerns of the
international community.

reportedly stated that the transformation into all-volunteer
forces would not be feasible until 2016. At the same time,
the Taiwanese armed forces attribute importance to the
introduction of advanced technologies and improvement
of joint operational capabilities. Additionally, in light
of the serious damage that occurred from the typhoon in
August 2009, the Taiwanese armed forces identify disaster
prevention and relief as one of their major missions.
With regard to Taiwan’s military power, at present,
ground forces, including the Navy Marine Corps, have a
total of approximately 215,000 personnel. In addition, it is
believed that approximately 1.66 million reserve personnel
of the air, naval, and ground forces would be available
in case of war. Regarding naval capabilities, in addition
to Kidd-class destroyers which were imported from the
United States, Taiwan possesses relatively modern frigates
and other vessels. Regarding air capabilities, Taiwan
possesses F-16 A/B f ghters, Mirage 2000 f ghters, Chingkuo f ghters, among other assets.


**6** **International Transfer of Weapons**

China’s arms export total has surpassed its arms import
total since 2010. China has expanded provision of weapons
such as small arms, tanks, and aircraft to developing
countries in Asia, Africa, and other areas. Specif cally, it is
reported that the main recipients are Pakistan, Bangladesh,
and Myanmar, while weapons are also being exported to
African countries such as Morocco, Tanzania, Nigeria, and
Egypt as well as Central and South American countries


**1** **Relations with China**

Under President Ma Ying-jeou, based on the basic policy
of “no unif cation, no independence, and no use of
force,” Taiwan has made clear that it would not advocate
independence and has adopted a collaborative stance
towards China. In particular, Taiwan and China have seen
their economic relations deepen. However, from March to
April 2014, students against the approval of the Cross-Strait
Service Trade Agreement staged the Sunf ower Student
Movement and occupied the Legislative Yuan. Amid
rising dissatisfaction with the government, the ruling party
Kuomintang suffered a crushing defeat to the Democratic
Progressive Party in the nine-in-one local elections in
November 2014. In the lead-up to the next presidential
election in 2016, attention will be paid to the outcome of
Taiwan-China relations.


**2** **Military Capabilities of Taiwan**

Taiwan, under the guidance of building the “hard rock”
defense advocated by President Ma Ying-jeou, identif es
prevention of war, homeland defense, response to
contingencies, deterrence of conf ict, and regional stability
as the strategic objectives, and takes the military strategy of
“resolute defense and credible deterrence.”
Taiwan, for improved expertise of its military
personnel and other purposes, aims to transform its
armed forces currently consisting of drafted personnel
and volunteers into all-volunteer forces, while reducing
the total forces from 275,000 to 215,000 personnel by the
end of 2014. However, the Ministry of National Defense


**3** **Military Balance between China and Taiwan**

While China has continued to increase its defense budget by
a signif cant margin, Taiwan’s defense budget has remained
mostly unchanged for nearly 20 years. As of 2014, China’s
announced defense budget was roughly 13 times larger
than Taiwan’s defense budget[93].
In view of the fact that the PLA is enhancing its missile,
naval, and air forces, the Taiwanese military believes it
still needs to modernize its equipment. The U.S. DoD has
notif ed Congress of possible arms sales to Taiwan based on
the Taiwan Relations Act[94]. However, Taiwan also wishes


92 It has been confi rmed that Chinese-made equipment (FN-6 portable air defense missile system) were among the weapons utilized by ISIL.

93 This fi gure was obtained by comparing China’s announced FY2014 defense budget of approximately 808.2 billion yuan and Taiwan’s announced FY2014 defense budget of approximately 311.1
Taiwan dollars by converting them into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate for FY2014 released by the Central Bank of Taiwan (US$1 = 6.1434 yuan = 30.368 Taiwan dollars). China’s actual defense
budget is reportedly larger than the amount announced, and therefore, the actual difference in the defense budgets of China and Taiwan could be greater.

94 Recently, the U.S. DoD notifi ed Congress of possible sales to Taiwan of Patriot PAC-3 surface-to-air missiles and AH-64D attack helicopters in October 2008, possible sales of PAC-3 missiles, UH-60
helicopters, Osprey-class mine hunters, and other assets in January 2010, possible arms sales including equipment necessary to upgrade F-16A/B fi ghter aircraft in September 2011, and possible


-----

to purchase the F-16C/D f ghter, conventional-powered
submarine, and other arms from the United States, and
attention will be paid to the future developments. Taiwan
also promotes the independent development of military
equipment. The Tien Kung II surface-to-air missiles and
Hsiung Feng II anti-ship missiles are deployed, and it is
believed that the Hsiung Feng IIE cruise missiles are being
developed in order to acquire long-range attack capabilities,
while the Tien Kung III surface-to-air missiles are being
developed in order to ensure the capabilities to deal with
ballistic missiles. Furthermore, in order to counter large
vessels, including aircraft carriers, Taiwan is moving
to induct a new model of indigenous stealth high-speed
missile ships mounted with Hsiung Feng II supersonic antiship missiles.
The military capabilities of China and Taiwan are
generally characterized as follows:
1) Regarding ground forces, China possesses an
overwhelming number of troops; however, their
capability of landing on and invading the island of
Taiwan is limited. Nevertheless, China is making efforts
to improve its landing and invasion capabilities in recent
years, such as building large landing ships.


2) Regarding naval and air forces, China, which
overwhelms Taiwan in terms of quantity, has also been
steadily strengthening its naval and air forces in recent
years in terms of quality, where Taiwan had superiority
over China[95].
3) Regarding missile attack capabilities, Taiwan has been
strengthening its ballistic missile defense, including
upgrading PAC-2 to PAC-3 and newly inducting PAC-3.
China possesses numerous short-range ballistic missiles
and other assets with a range that covers Taiwan. Taiwan
is deemed to have few effective countermeasures.
In addition to the size of forces and performance and
quantity of military equipment, a comparison of military
capabilities should take into account various factors such
as the objectives and characteristics of envisioned military
operations, the operational posture, prof ciency in military
personnel, and logistics. Nevertheless, as China is rapidly
strengthening its military power, the overall military
balance between China and Taiwan is shifting in favor of
China. Attention must be paid to the strengthening of both
the Chinese and Taiwanese military capabilities and U.S.
weapon sales to Taiwan.

**Section 4 Russia**

**1** **General Situation**


Under President Vladimir Putin who reassumed off ce in
May 2012, Russia, having allegedly completed the phase of
revival and strengthening, sets an agenda of constructing a
prosperous Russia, and at the same time, attaches importance
to becoming an inf uential power underpinned by its new
position of economic, cultural, and military power[1].
“The collapse of the Soviet Union was a major
geopolitical disaster of the 20th century”[2]. President Putin,
who made this remark, aims to realize the concept of the
Eurasian Union[3] encompassing the areas of the former
Soviet Union. The President has made clear Russia’s
adversarial stance against the West, noting that the West
is responsible for the crisis in Ukraine, and that the West
exercises inf uence directly or indirectly on the former
Soviet Union countries that Russia considers are under its
sphere of inf uence[4].
In response to the increasingly tense situation in
Ukraine since February 2014, President Putin instructed the
mobilization of the Russian Armed Forces on the pretext
of guarding their facilities in Crimea and other purposes.
Russia asserts the legitimacy of its position, stating that
the “annexation” of Crimea in March 2014 was a decision
made by the Autonomous Republic of Crimea through a
“referendum” and was “fully legal”[5]. These unilateral
acts by Russia had the effect of boosting the approval


rating of the President. In regard to the situation in eastern
Ukraine where confrontations have continued between the
Ukrainian forces and separatist armed groups since April
2014, Western and other countries have noted that there was
clear and direct intervention by the Russian Armed Forces,
whereas Russia has consistently denied the presence of the
Russian Armed Forces in eastern Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia faces a severe economic
situation due to the effects of the falling prices of crude
oil – Russia’s key export, as well as the depreciation of
Russia’s currency the ruble, and the economic sanctions by
the West and other countries in response to the situation in
Ukraine. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine
is thought to have collaborated on the development of
Russia’s intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Analysts
have suggested that the suspension of Ukraine’s technical
support following the deterioration of bilateral relations
may impair the operations of Russian equipment which
rely heavily on Ukraine.
Under these circumstances, attention is on how
President Putin, while maintaining his power base, will
deal with Russia’s diplomatic isolation and economic
hardships as well as promote economic structural reforms
and measures aimed at the modernization of Russia’s
military forces[6].

**2** **Security and Defense Policies**


interests of Russia, and Russia expresses vigilance over
the U.S. plan to deploy a missile defense system (MD)
in Europe as well as the movement of NATO’s military
infrastructure closer to the Russian border.
As for national defense, Russia cites as challenges a
shift to a new military structure by increasing the number
of permanent readiness units[7] and improving organizational
and military alignment, while maintaining the capabilities
of its strategic nuclear forces.
The Russian Federation Military Doctrine, established
in February 2010 as a document substantiating the principles


**1** **Basic Posture**

Approved in May 2009, the “National Security Strategy of
the Russian Federation until 2020” sets out the objectives
and strategic priorities of domestic and foreign policies.
The National Security Strategy construes that Russia’s
inf uence has been strengthened by a policy of promoting
the multipolarization of the world and using the latent
capabilities of Russia. The unilateral approach to the use of
force and confrontation of major countries in international
relations are listed as having a negative impact on the


Annual State of the Nation Address by President Putin (December 2012).

Annual State of the Nation Address by President Putin (April 2005).

In an article in the Izvestia dated October 4, 2011, then-Prime Minister Putin proposed the creation of a “Eurasian Union” that would strengthen intraregional economic partnerships founded on the
Customs Union and the Common Economic Space.

Annual State of the Nation Address by President Putin (December 2014).

Annual State of the Nation Address by President Putin (December 2014). In an interview with the Russian media in March 2015, President Putin stated that he instructed the Ministry of Defence to
mobilize special operation forces, the naval infantry, and the airborne troops in Crimea on the pretext of strengthening the security of the Russian Armed Forces’ facilities in Crimea.

In his campaign platform papers published after January 2012, then-Prime Minister Putin listed his policies: expanding the public’s participation in politics; prevention of corruption; strengthening of
domestic industries by exiting the resource-dependent economy to modernize the economy; and development of a middle class that plays a leading role in the society.

The permanent readiness units have been created by reorganizing troops in the midst of a military forces reduction after the launch of the Russian Armed Forces. By concentrating personnel, combat

of the National Security Strategy in the military sphere, was
revised in December 2014 against the backdrop of foreign
policy factors, including the increasingly tense situation in
Ukraine. The new military doctrine states the existing view
that while the probability of an outbreak of a large-scale
war is decreasing, military risks to Russia are increasing,
including the expansion of NATO, the movement of NATO’s
military infrastructure closer to Russia’s borders, and the
establishment and deployment of strategic MD systems. In
addition, the doctrine expresses growing alarm, def ning the
following as new military risks: NATO’s military buildup;
the realization of the U.S. Global Strike concept; rise of
global extremism (terrorism); inauguration of governments
in neighboring countries that carry out policies threatening
Russia’s interests; and the incitement of ethnic, social, and
religious confrontations in Russia.
The doctrine continues to regard nuclear weapons as an
essential component for preventing the outbreak of nuclear
wars and wars that use conventional weapons. It claims
that Russia maintains a suff cient level of nuclear deterrent
capacity and reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in
response to an event where nuclear or other weapons of
mass destruction are to be used against it or its allies or
under circumstances wherein conventional weapons have
been used against it and where the survival of the country
itself is imperiled.
Furthermore, defending Russian interests in the Arctic
was newly added as one of the military’s tasks in peacetime.


the country aims to achieve troop reduction in order to
maintain an adequate troop level of one million personnel
by 2016[9]. Since December 2010, Russia reorganized its
six military districts into four military districts (Western,
Southern, Central and Eastern Districts). On this basis,
Russia established a joint strategic command in each
military district and is carrying out integrated operations
of its entire military forces, such as the ground force, naval
force, and air force under the control of the Military District
Commander. In December 2014, the new Joint Strategic
Command in charge of the Arctic became operational[10].
Regarding the modernization of the military
forces, based on the State Armaments Program (GPV:
Gosudarstvennaya Programma Vooruzheniya) 2011-2020
that appeared to have been approved by the President by
the end of 2010, Russia intends to further modernize its
equipment and invest about 20 trillion rubles (about 46
trillion yen) to increase its percentage of new equipment up
to 70%[11] by 2020.
Regarding the professionalization of the military
forces, in order to make the combat readiness of the
permanent readiness units effective, Russia promotes the
introduction of a contract service system which selects
personnel through contracts from the conscripted military
personnel. However, further review has been under way
due to the diff culties in securing personnel because of such
problems as high turnover rate and f nancial constraints[12].
Russia has continued to increase its defense budget,
even as spending cuts are made across the board due to


**2** **Military Reform**


Russia has implemented full-scale military reform since
1997 by presenting the three pillars of reform: downsizing;
modernization; and professionalization.
Moreover, based on the policy statement, “Future
Outlook of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation,”
that was approved by then-President Dmitry Medvedev
in September 2008, Russia is advancing measures to
modernize the Russian Armed Forces, including troop
reductions, structural reforms (from the division-based
command structure to a brigade-based one[8]), strengthening
of combat readiness, and the development and introduction
of new equipment.
Regarding the downsizing of the military forces,

8 The command structure is reorganized from the four-tiered structure of military district–army–division–regiment, to a three-tiered structure of military district– operational command–brigade. This
was supposed to be completed in December 2009, but in May 2013 the Guards Tamanskaya Motorized Rifle Division and the Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division, which had supposedly been
reorganized into brigades under Minister of Defence Anatoliy Serdyukov, were restored and participated in a victory parade.

9 It was decided that the total military force would be limited to 1 million people as of 2016 by an executive order in December 2008 (about 1.13 million people as of 2008).

10 While Joint Strategic Command had been established in each military district, the new Joint Strategic Command was formed on the basis of the Northern Fleet and does not entail the creation of a
new military district.

11 In his campaign platform paper on national defense policy published in February 2012, then-Prime Minister Putin indicated that he would strengthen military power, including nuclear force, aerospace
defense, and naval power by spending about 23 trillion rubles (about 43 trillion yen) in ten years.

12 Reasons behind the promotion of the contract service system may include a decrease of the population suitable for military service and the shortening of the conscription period (from January 2008,
the conscription period has been shortened to 12 months). At the Expanded Meeting of the Defence Ministry Board in December 2014, Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu stated that personnel
adequacy was 90.5% and contracted soldiers totaled about 295,000. The Regulation on the Military Service was amended in January 2015, enabling nationals who are not citizens of countries as

the recent severe economic situation. Russia is expected to
continue its efforts to build up the capacity of conventional
forces and maintain the strategic deterrence capability
provided by nuclear weapons, at least for the time being[13].

See Fig. I-1-4-1 (Russia’s Defense Budget)

**3** **Military Posture and Trends**


Russia’s military force is derived not only from the Russian
Armed Forces, but also from forces such as the Border
Troops of the Border Service of the Federal Security Service
of the Russian Federation (FSB) and the Interior Troops of
the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation. The
Russian Armed Forces have three services (forces) and three
independent corps (units): ground force; naval force; air
force; strategic-rocket unit; aerospace defense forces[14]; and
airborne unit[15].

Note: Offi cial fi gures announced by the Russian government

pursuant to the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
concluded with the United States[16]. Russia is working
to accelerate the development and introduction of new
weapons following the policy to prioritize the modernization
of nuclear forces based on its GPV.
In March 2011, Russia started the deployment of the
RS-24, which is thought to be a multi-warhead version of
the Topol-M ICBM[17]. In January 2013, “Yuri Dolgoruky,”
the f rst of the Borey-class nuclear-powered ballistic
missile submarines (SSBN), which are believed to carry
the new-type SLBM Bulava, was delivered to the Northern
Fleet. “Alexander Nevsky,” the second of the SSBNs,
and “Vladimir Monomakh,” the third of the SSBNs,
were delivered to the Pacif c Fleet in December 2013 and
December 2014, respectively. These SSBNs are scheduled
to be brought to the Pacif c Ocean in the near future[18].
In October 2013, a surprise inspection designed to
validate the combat readiness of strategic nuclear units
was implemented under the control of President Putin,
involving two ICBMs, two SLBMs, and live f ring of three
air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) from long-range
bombers. In May 2014 also, a f eld training exercise was
conducted including one ICBM and two SLBMs as well as
live f ring of six ALCMs[19].


**1** **Nuclear Forces**

Russia emphasizes its nuclear forces to secure its global
position, to strike a balance with the nuclear forces of
the United States and to supplement its inferiority in
conventional forces. It is thus believed that Russia is
working to maintain the immediate readiness of its nuclear
force unit.
Russia still possesses ICBM, submarine launched
ballistic missiles (SLBM), and long range bombers (Tu-95
Bears and Tu-160 Blackjacks) following only the United
States in scale.
Russia is obligated to reduce strategic nuclear arms


13 According to the FY2015-2017 budget plan of the Russian Federation which President Putin signed in December 2014, the FY2015 defense budget increased 33% from the previous fi scal year
to 3.2868 trillion rubles. In January 2015, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin stated that the GPV 2016-2025 expenditures may be similar to or slightly lower than that for the GPV 2011-2020.
The FY2015 defense budget approved by the Federal Assembly is 3.1168 trillion rubles.

14 At the Expanded Meeting of the Defence Ministry Board in December 2014, Minister of Defence Shoigu identifi ed the creation of aerospace forces as one of the priority tasks to be executed in 2015.

15 Three Air Assault Brigades which belonged to the ground forces were incorporated into the airborne unit in November 2013.

16 In April 2010, Russia and the United States signed the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty to replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty I (START I), and the treaty came into force in February 2011.
Each side is obligated to reduce deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 and their deployed delivery platforms to 700 within seven years after the entry into force of the treaty. In April 2015, the United
States announced that Russia’s deployed strategic warheads was 1,582 and their deployed delivery platforms was 515 as of March 1, 2015.

17 In March 2011, the fi rst regiment of RS-24 missiles was operationally deployed in the division in Teykovo, Ivanovo oblast in northeast Moscow. At the Expanded Meeting of the Defence Ministry Board
in December 2014, Minister of Defence Shoigu stated that three rocket regiments equipped with RS-24 were put on combat duty in 2014. In addition, it is believed that Russia is developing a new
heavy ICBM that can destroy robust ICBM launch sites and mount a large number of warheads, the light-weight mobile solid-fuel RS-26 Rubezh ICBM, as well as new warheads aimed at enhancing
the capability to penetrate missile defense. Rubezh is scheduled to be deployed to Irkutsk in 2015.

18 Eight Borey-class SSBNs plan to be built by 2020. The test launches of the Bulava started in September 2005. Through November 2014, 22 test launches have been conducted, 14 of which have been
successful. While the test launch of the Bulava from “Alexander Nevsky” in September 2013 is deemed to have failed due to problems with the missile’s nozzle, the same test launch was conducted
successfully in September 2014.

19 Under the leadership of President Putin, an exercise of strategic nuclear units, said to be the largest in recent years, took place in October 2012. The objective of the exercise was to assess the
automated communication management system and the new command algorithms for strategic nuclear forces through the integrated action of all the components of strategic nuclear systems. The
exercise involved one ICBM and one SLBM and the firing of four ALCMs. Surprise inspections are exercises designed to assess the combat readiness of the various service commands by ordering

As for non-strategic nuclear forces, Russia scrapped
ground-launched short- and intermediate-range missiles
with a range of between 500 and 5,500 km by 1991 in
accordance with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
(INF) Treaty with the United States, and removed tactical
nuclear weapons from naval vessels and stored them in
onshore missile silos in the following year. Russia, however,
still possesses a broad array of nuclear forces. Under
such circumstances, in July 2014, the U.S. government
concluded that Russia possesses ground-launched cruise
missiles (GLCM) in violation of the INF Treaty and notif ed
the Russian government. The Russian side denies this.


continued to participate in the counter-piracy operations off
the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden since 2008,
and maintained deployment of vessels in the Mediterranean
Sea[24]. In September 2013, a Kirov-class missile cruiser was
deployed to the eastern Arctic for the f rst time, where it
conducted military exercises. In September 2014, the
f otilla of the Northern Fleet transported equipment and
supplies to the New Siberian Islands in the eastern Arctic
to build a facility[25].
In June and September 2014, the Tu-95 long-range
bombers approached the airspaces of U.S. mainland and
Canada[26]. Furthermore, in October 2014, Russian aircraft,
including the Tu-95 long-range bomber, conducted largescale military exercises over the Baltic Sea, the North Sea,
the Atlantic Ocean, and the Black Sea[27]. From October to
November 2014, vessels of the Pacif c and the Black Sea
Fleets entered the South Pacif c Ocean, and the vessels of
the Baltic Fleet entered the South China Sea[28].
The Russian Armed Forces have thus intensif ed
activities not only in the Asia-Pacif c, but also in the Arctic,
Europe, and areas near the U.S. mainland. In particular,
Russia’s vessels and aircraft have tended to expand their
area of activity[29].
As for the future Russian military forces, since there
are uncertain elements which may be inf uenced by Russia’s
future economic and social development and trends in Russia’s
diplomatic relations with European and other countries, it is
necessary to continue to follow future developments.


**2** **Conventional Forces and Other Issues**


It is assumed that Russia is developing and procuring
conventional forces in accordance with its GPV. There
is a need to pay close attention to Russia’s development,
procurement, and deployment of new equipment in addition
to the introduction of Su-35 f ghters, which includes the
so-called f fth generation f ghters[20] and the Mistral-class
amphibious assault ships[21].
In addition to carrying out a range of exercises[22],
since February 2013, the Russian Armed Forces have been
conducting surprise inspections designed to validate the
combat readiness of the military districts and independent
corps for the f rst time since the collapse of the Soviet
Union[23]. Outside of Russia, the Russian Armed Forces have


20 According to media reports, in January 2015, President Yury Slusar of Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation stated that Russia’s PAK FA (Future Air Complex for Tactical Air Forces) fi fth generation
fi ghters have begun to be delivered to the Air Force for test fl ights. In March 2013, Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force Viktor Bondarev stated that PAK FA will enter service in 2016.

21 In December 2010, Russia decided to purchase two ships from a consortium with France. Their construction contract was signed in June 2011, and the launching ceremony of the fi rst ship,
Vladivostok, was held in October 2013 at a French shipyard. In November 2014, based on the increasingly tense situation in Ukraine, France announced the postponement of the handover of the
Vladivostok to Russia. As a result, its crew who were undergoing operational training for the ship in France returned to Russia in December 2014.

22 As it proceeds with its military reform, Russia has conducted large-scale exercises for verification and other purposes in recent years. Exercises involving field training at the level of military
district and above include “Center 2011” in the Central Military District, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan in September 2011. “Caucasus 2012” was carried out in the Southern Military
District in September 2012. In addition, “Zapado 2013” was carried out in the Western Military District and in the territories of Belarus in September 2013 and “Vostok 2014” in the Eastern
Military District in September 2014.

23 Surprise inspections were conducted at the Central and Southern Military Districts in February 2013, Southern Military District in March 2013, Western Military District in May 2013, Eastern and
Central Military Districts in July 2013, strategic nuclear units in October 2013, and Western and Central Military Districts from February to March 2014. In September 2014, a surprise inspection of
the Eastern Military District was conducted in the form of transitioning to the Vostok 2014 large-scale exercise.

24 Russia’s naval fleet in the Mediterranean, for which formation was completed on June 1, 2013, is positioned as a permanent operational force.

25 The Temp Airport on the New Siberian Islands (Novosibirsk) located in the Eastern Arctic, has been closed since 1993, but in October 2013, was restored to operation with the support of the
Northern Fleet.

26 On June 9, 2014, four Tu-95 long-range bombers fl ew in the airspace near Alaska and northern California. Two of these bombers fl ew within 50 miles off the coast of California. On September 17,
2014, six aircraft – two Tu-95 long-range bombers, two MiG-31 fi ghters, and two Il-78 air-to-air refueling aircraft – entered the U.S. Air Defense Identifi cation Zone. On September 18, two Tu-95
long-range bombers entered the Canadian Air Defense Identifi cation Zone.

27 According to NATO’s Allied Command Operations, NATO detected and monitored four groups of Russian military aircraft conducting signifi cant military maneuvers in European airspace over the Baltic
Sea, the North Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Black Sea on October 28 and 29, 2014. These sizable Russian fl ights are said to represent an unusual level of air activity over European airspace.

28 The vessels included the Pacifi c Fleet’s fl agship Slava-class guided missile cruiser Varyag and the Black Sea Fleet’s fl agship Slava-class guided missile cruise Moskva. Varyag was deployed off the
coast of Australia, and Moskva in the Philippine Sea. On November 15-16, 2014, the G20 Summit was held in Brisbane, Australia, which was attended by President Putin.

**4** **Russian Forces in the Vicinity of Japan**


**1** **General Situation**

Russia newly established the Eastern Military District and
the Eastern Joint Strategic Command in 2010[30]. Ground
Forces, the Pacif c Fleet, the Air Force, and Air Defense
Units have been placed under the control of the Military
District Commander, who has unif ed the control over each
of these services.
The current presence of the Russian Armed Forces
in the Far East region is signif cantly smaller than it was
at its peak. However, a considerable scale of military
forces, including nuclear forces, still remains in the region.
Russian military operations in the vicinity of Japan appear
to be increasingly active.
Given that the Russian Armed Forces set their basis
of operation on maintaining the combat readiness of their
strategic nuclear units and dealing with conf icts through
the inter-theater mobility of its round-the-clock readiness
units, it is necessary to continue paying attention to the
positioning and trends of the Russian Armed Forces in the
Far East region while also keeping in mind the movement
of units in other regions.


combat forces into permanent readiness units. The Eastern
Military District now consists of eleven brigades and one
division with about 80,000 personnel in total. In addition,
it has a naval infantry brigade equipped with amphibious
operations capability, and therefore, has amphibious
operations capability. The Eastern Military District has
inducted new equipment, such as the Iskander surfaceto-surface missile system and the S-400 surface-to-air
missile system.

**(3) Naval Forces**
The Pacif c Fleet is stationed and deployed from its
main bases in Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk. The f eet
comprises about 250 ships with a total displacement in the
region of about 600,000 tons, including about 20 major
surface ships and about 20 submarines (about 15 of which
are nuclear powered submarines) with a total displacement
of about 300,000 tons.


**(4) Air Forces**

In the Eastern Military District, Russia deploys about
350 combat aircraft from its Air Force and Navy combined.
Existing models are being refurbished and new models,
such as the Su-35 f ghters, are being introduced[32] to
improve their capabilities.


**(1) Nuclear Forces**
As for strategic nuclear forces in the Far East region,
ICBMs, such as SS-25s and about 30 Tu-95 long-range
bombers are deployed mainly along the Trans-Siberian
Railway. In addition, the Delta III-class SSBNs carrying
SLBMs are deployed in and around the Sea of Okhotsk. By
and large strategic nuclear units are believed to maintain
readiness posture. In a surprise inspection conducted in
October 2013 and a f eld training exercise conducted in
May 2014 for the strategic nuclear unit, the Delta III-class
SSBNs launched SLBMs in the Sea of Okhotsk. The second
of the Borey-class SSBNs Alexander Nevsky was deployed
to the Pacif c Fleet in December 2013 and the third of the
SSBNs Vladimir Monomakh in December 2014[31].

**(2) Ground Forces**
As part of its military reforms, Russia is thought to be
reorganizing the command structure from a divisionbased to a brigade-based one, while also shifting all of its


**2** **Russian Forces in Japan’s Northern Territories**


Since 1978 during the former Soviet Union era, Russia
has redeployed ground troops on Kunashiri, Etorofu,
and Shikotan Islands of the Northern Territories, which
are inherent territories of Japan. While the Russian troop
strength is thought to be far less than that at peak times,
one division with mainly defensive duties is still stationed.
Furthermore, tanks, armored vehicles, various types of
artillery, and anti-air missiles are deployed[33]. In August
2014, an exercise was conducted with the participation of
over 1,000 troops from the Eastern Military District on the
Northern Territories and the Chishima Islands.
After then-President Medvedev visited Kunashiri
Island[34] for the f rst time as head of state in November 2010,


30 The Eastern Military District’s headquarters is in Khabarovsk.

31 At the Expanded Meeting of the Defence Ministry Board in December 2014, Minister of Defence Shoigu stated that the second of the Borey-class SSBNs Alexander Nevsky and the third SSBN Vladimir
Monomakh would be brought to the Pacifi c and join the formation of the permanent readiness units in 2015.

32 In February 2014, 12 Su-35 fighters entered service with the 23rd Fighter Regiment based in Khabarovsk.

33 The 18th Machine Gun and Artillery Division, which comprises two regiments, is Russia’s only machine gun and artillery division amid the military’s reforms to turn divisions into brigades, and is
stationed on Etorofu Island and Kunashiri Island. The Division aims to prevent landings, and participated in surprise inspections conducted in the Eastern Military District and elsewhere in July 2013.

34 After the visit, Kunashiri Island and Etorofu Island were visited by First Deputy Prime Minister Shuvalov in December 2010, by then-Regional Development Minister Basargin in January to February
2011, followed by then-Deputy Prime Minister Ivanov in May 2011. Furthermore, Security Council Secretary Patrushev visited Kunashiri Island and Suisho Island of the Habomai Islands in September
2011. In addition, in January 2011, Deputy Minister of Defence Bulgakov, and in February 2011, then-Minister of Defence Serdyukov visited Kunashiri Island and Etorofu Island and inspected the

of facilities, among other measures, to ensure the security
of the “Kuril” Islands.
The number of Russian military personnel stationed in
this region in 1991 was about 9,500. At the Japan-Russia
Defense Ministerial Meeting held in 1997, then-Russian
Defence Minister Rodionov made known that the troops
stationed in the Northern Territories had been reduced to
3,500 personnel by 1995. In July 2005, when then-Russian
Defence Minister Ivanov visited the Northern Territories,
he declared that Russia would neither increase nor decrease
the troops stationed on the four islands, clarifying Russia’s
intention to maintain the status quo[35].
As mentioned above, Russian troops continue to be
stationed in the Northern Territories, which are inherent
territories of Japan, and it is hoped that the issue will be
resolved at an early date.


mobilization postures of the units in the Far East strategic
front, including the Arctic. The exercise included units
from not only the Eastern Military District, but also the
Western and Central Military Districts. The various units
conducted long-distance maneuvers covering a distance
of 12,000 km at most. Furthermore, the exercise improved
coordination among the Ministry of Defence and other
ministries, agencies, and local governments.
The number of exercises carried out by the Russian
Ground Forces in the areas adjacent to Japan has
decreased from the peak. However, some activities seem
to be on the rise.
With regard to naval vessels, their activities seem to
be on the rise in recent years. For example, joint exercises
and counter-piracy operations have been carried out
involving long voyages of the vessels of the Pacif c Fleet,
and nuclear submarines are carrying out patrols[38]. In
September 2011, 24 naval vessels including a Slava-class
guided missile cruiser passed through the Soya Strait
one after another. This was the f rst time since the end of
the Cold War that such a major transit of Russian naval
vessels through this strait has been conf rmed[39]. Prior
to the holding of the large-scale exercise “Vostok 2014”
in September 2014, ten vessels passed through the Soya
Strait in August 2014. In October of the same year, eight
vessels successively passed through the Tsushima Strait


**3** **Operations in the Vicinity of Japan**


Activities by the Russian Armed Forces in the vicinity of
Japan including exercises and drills that are believed to
have objectives such as verif cation of the results of the
military reform are on the rise.
In the large-scale military exercise “Vostok 2010” that
was conducted from June to July 2010, it is thought that
Russia verif ed its ability to respond to conf icts under its
new command structure and also its ability to manage units
from different services in an integrated manner. In addition,
by mobilizing troops that are not stationed in this region to
the Far East exercises, it is considered that Russia verif ed
its ability to deploy forces in regions far from where they
are stationed[36].
In September 2014, the large-scale exercise “Vostok
2014,” considered to be the largest and the most important
Russian Armed Forces’ exercises and drills conducted that
year, was carried out in the Eastern Military District. Over
155,000 personnel, over 4,000 combat vehicles, about 80
vessels, and about 630 aircraft participated in the exercise[37].
Its purpose was likely to verify the combat readiness and


35 During the 1998 visit to Russia by Japan’s Administrative Vice-Minister of Defense, then-Russian Minister of Defence Sergeyev commented that the number of Russian troops stationed in the Northern
Territories was being steadily decreased. In February 2011, a senior official of the General Staff stated that troops on the “Kuril Islands” would be maintained at around 3,500 personnel, within the
process of reorganizing the division into a brigade. In May 2014, Commander Surovikin of the Eastern Military District announced the buildup of military facilities on the Northern Territories. In August
2014, Russia opened a new airport in Etorofu Island. Through such measures, Russia has stepped up its activities to reinforce its claims to the Northern Territories.

36 In September 2011, a large-scale exercise was held involving anti-vessel and anti-aircraft live fire drills and landing drills in eastern Kamchatka Peninsula. More than 10,000 personnel, 50 naval
vessels, and 50 aircraft participated in the exercise. Furthermore, between June and July 2012, various exercises, including landing drills, were conducted in Sakhalin involving about 7,000 personnel,
40 naval vessels, and 60 aircraft. Through these drills and exercises, the units trained and improved ability to cope with various situations. Moreover, the large-scale exercise “Vostok 2014” was held
in the Eastern Military District in September 2014.

37 The large-scale exercise “Vostok 2014” was conducted over a vast area extending from the Arctic to the coastal area. In the Kamchatka Peninsula, ALCM launches were carried out from long-range
bombers, as well as launches of submarine-launched cruise missiles (SLCMs) from Oscar II-class nuclear-powered guided missile submarines (SSGN). In Wrangel Island in the Arctic, evening
parachute landings and survival drills were conducted. In the Sakhalin, the Naval Infantry conducted landing drills as well as drills to prevent the landings of opposing forces. In the coastal and inland
areas, drills were conducted of the launches of short-range ballistic missiles and GLCMs using the Iskander surface-to-surface missile system, as well as drills that made use of private infrastructure,
such as takeoff and landing drills of the Su-25 attack aircraft using roads for motor vehicles.

38 The number of cases of the Russian naval fl eet passing through the three international straits (Soya, Tsugaru, and Tsushima) of Japan that have been identifi ed and disclosed in FY2014 is as follows:
10 cases in the Soya Strait (6 in FY2012, 11 in FY2013); 1 case in the Tsugaru Strait (2 in FY2012, 1 in FY2013); and 8 cases in the Tsushima Strait (5 in FY2012, 4 in FY2013).

and entered the South Pacif c Ocean.
Regarding aircraft, since the resumption of the patrol
activities by its strategic aviation units in 2007, Russia
has been increasing f ights by long-range bombers and
carrying out f ights of Tu-95 long-range bombers and
Tu-160 long-range bombers which are refueled in midf ight and supported by A-50 early warning aircraft and
Su-27 f ghters[40]. Moreover, due to an upturn in its fuel
situation, among other factors, the pilot training time is
on an upward trend.
Activities such as f ights close to Japan’s airspace
and exercises and trainings have tended to increase[41], as
exemplif ed by the abnormal f ights of Russian aircraft

perspective of modernizing the country[46].
On the other hand, Russian efforts to strengthen
cooperative relations with the Western countries aimed
at modernization face challenges following the series
of events which have given rise to the increasingly tense
situation in Ukraine.
Attention will be on how Russia balances the posture it
takes towards other countries, which is economic-centered
and benef t-focused in order to realize the country’s
modernization, and Russia’s politics and diplomacy which
include the security domain. In addition, attention will be
on how Russia develops its relations with other countries.


**1** **General Situation**

Recognizing that, amid the trend towards multi-polarity,
Russia’s international position as one of the poles of
inf uence is being strengthened, Russia sets out its basic
foreign policy to achieve its national interests[43]. Moreover,
stating that its diplomacy is to be conducted based on the
national security that serves the interests of its people, Russia
aims to have a practical diplomacy conducive to solving
issues towards modernizing the country’s economy[44].
For this reason, Russia has been working to deepen
its economic partnerships with the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS)[45]. Furthermore, Russia aspires to
deepen its relations with the Asia-Pacif c countries from the


40 The Russian Ministry of Defence announced in January 2014 that surveillance flights of two Tu-95 long-range bombers took place with the assistance of Su-27 fighters and A-50 airborne early
warning and control aircraft.

41 When Tu-95 long-range bombers took a route that circled the area encompassing Japan in September 2011, they were refueled in mid-flight by an IL-78 air tanker in the temporary danger zone
set by Russia. In addition, when Tu-95 long-range bombers flew in the vicinity of Japan in February 2012 and February 2014, other aircraft such as A-50 Early Warning Aircraft flew with them. Two
Su-27 fighters and two Tu-95 long-range bombers invaded Japanese airspace in February 2013 and August 2013 respectively.

42 In April 2014, Deputy Minister of Defence Antonov stated that “Russian Air Force aircraft operated in strict compliance with the international law.” The Deputy Minister also asked the Japanese Ministry
of Defense to “alter its attitude towards cooperation with the Russian Ministry of Defence.”

and is intensifying its approach in many f elds including
politics, economy and security.


**2** **Relations with Asian Countries**

Russia recognizes that the signif cance of the Asia-Pacif c
region is increasing within its multi-pronged foreign policy,
and the relationship with Asian countries is also important
from the viewpoint of economic development in Siberia
and the Far East[47], counter-terrorism, and security[48]. In the
executive order concerning foreign policy issued in May
2012, President Putin held up his policy to participate in
the integration process of the Asia-Pacif c region in order to
accelerate socioeconomic development in the East Siberia
and Far East regions, and stated that Russia would work to
develop relationships with Japan, the Republic of Korea, and
other countries, in addition to China[49], India, and Vietnam[50].
Under this policy, Russia has participated in various
frameworks in the Asia-Pacif c region[51]. The Asia-Pacif c
Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit was held in
Vladivostok in September 2012.
Among these different countries, Russia and India
maintain a close relationship under a strategic partnership,
with the leaders of both countries paying mutual visits. In
October 2013, President Putin held talks with then-Prime
Minister Singh when he visited Russia, during which they
reached an agreement on enhanced military cooperation
including arms exports. In December 2014, President Putin,
during his visit to India, held talks with Prime Minister
Modi, and the two sides agreed to build a new Russian-made
nuclear power plant, among other matters. In January 2015,
Minister of Defence Shoigu, during his visit to India, held
talks with Minister of Defence Parrikar, and the two sides
discussed military and military technology cooperation
between the two countries. Both countries are strengthening
their military technology cooperation, including the joint
development of the f fth generation PAK FA f ghter jet and
the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile. Additionally, since
2003 Russia and India have been conducting INDRA antiterrorism exercises involving the Armies and Navies of both
countries. Regarding the relationship with Japan, Russia


**3** **Situation in Ukraine**


Following the political upheaval in Ukraine in February
2014, the Yanukovych government collapsed and was
replaced by an interim government led by the opposition
party. At the same time, in the Autonomous Republic of
Crimea in southern Ukraine, armed forces, believed to
be Russian forces, occupied the Council of Ministers
Building and the Parliamentary Building. In addition, the
military forces took control of airports, arterial roads that
travel through the rest of Ukraine, and the major facilities
of the Ukrainian military forces. In March 2014, Russia,
which took de facto control of Crimea, “annexed” Crimea
based on the results of the “referendum” on whether or not
Crimea should be “annexed” into Russia[52]. Meanwhile,
in April 2014, in eastern and southern Ukraine, separatist
armed groups believed to be ethnic Russian nationals
stepped up their protests and attacks against the interim
Ukrainian government and occupied buildings, including
the Council of Ministers Building. In response, the interim
Ukrainian government condemned Russia over its alleged
involvement and mobilized military forces in an attempt
to expel the occupying forces. This, however, did not lead
to the resolution of the situation. In May 2014, in parts
of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in eastern Ukraine, a
“referendum” was conducted under the control of separatist
armed groups on whether or not autonomy should be
expanded[53]. President Petro Poroshenko who assumed
presidency in June 2014 following the presidential election
in Ukraine announced a temporary ceasef re with separatist
armed groups and unveiled a peace plan[54]. Nonetheless,
the negotiations with separatist armed groups failed to
reach a breakthrough, and the Ukrainian forces resumed
their mop-up operation against separatist armed groups


47 Russia is currently developing resources in Siberia and Sakhalin.

48 The Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation (released in July 2008). In his campaign platform paper on foreign policy published in February 2012, then-Prime Minister Putin expressed his
recognition that the importance of the whole Asia-Pacific region was rising.

49 See Part I, Chapter 1, Section 3-3 for the relationship with China

50 President Putin made an official visit to Vietnam and the ROK in November 2013.

51 Russia has participated in regional frameworks, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), and the East
Asia Summit (EAS since 2011).

52 The West and Japan condemn and do not acknowledge the “annexation,” which violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine as well as the international law, including the United Nations
Charter. The West and Japan express the view that Russia’s act of changing of the status quo by force or coercion is a global issue that impacts the entire international community, including Asia.

53 President Putin urged separatist armed groups in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts to postpone the referendum. While around 90% of the residents are said to have voted in favor in the election, many
misconducts have been reportedly observed.

54 President Putin endorsed President Poroshenko’s decision on the ceasefi re in southeastern Ukraine, and expressed support for President Poroshenko’s announcement of intent to take a series of
concrete measures aimed at the realization of peace.

in July 2014. The attacks by Ukrainian forces fragmented
and decreased the areas under the control of separatist
armed groups, and the groups fell into a perilous situation.
Since August 2014, separatist armed groups, receiving
various supports from Russia that are deemed to be direct
intervention[55], regained lost territory and acquired the
power base to be able to sustain the confrontations with
Ukrainian forces.
In September 2014, partially owing to the calls made by
President Putin[56], the Ukrainian government and separatist


armed groups agreed to a ceasef re and signed a 12-point
document aimed at the realization of peace[57]. However,
agreement failed to be reached thereafter on the ceasef re
line, among other matters, and small-scale confrontations
continued. In early 2015, following the intensif cation
of f ghting once again between the Ukrainian forces and
separatist armed groups, the leaders of Germany, France,
Russia, and Ukraine held talks and agreed on 13 items,
including the ceasef re, in February 2015[58].
Throughout the crisis in Ukraine, Western and other
countries have pointed clearly to Russia’s direct military
intervention[59] and have strongly condemned Russia’s direct
or indirect intervention. The countries contend that Russia
used a combination of diverse non-military tactics, such
as sabotage and information manipulation, and military
tactics utilized in secrecy, conducting acts of aggression
through methods that cannot be clearly labeled an
“armed attack” based on their outward form, i.e., “hybrid
warfare”[60]. The countries invoked severe sanction measures
on Russia[61]. Despite the international community’s strong
condemnation and sanction measures, Russia’s attempt to
change the status quo by force or coercion could not be
stopped. The international community is facing challenges
in dealing with “hybrid warfare.”


55 In the crisis in Ukraine, it is believed that Russia developed a separatist armed group that nearly integrates such groups in Ukraine as ethnic Russian nationals and the Russian special operation forces.
While using the media to carry out propaganda warfare, Russia successively mobilized the paramilitary forces that have vague legal statuses, such as Cossacks, and ultimately had regular military
forces make invasions. Since August 2014, the intrusion of Russian humanitarian assistance supply trucks into Ukrainian territory has been reported, and the activities of airborne units which are
deemed to be Russian forces and the activities of T-72 tank, self-propelled artillery, and other units on Ukrainian territory. Meanwhile, Russia has consistently maintained the position that the Russian
forces have no presence in Ukraine.

56 On August 29, 2014, President Putin released a statement. The President commented that separatist armed groups have achieved a major success, and called on the Ukrainian government to stop
military actions and sit down at the negotiating table with “Donbass representatives.”

57 The items of the agreement document consisted of the following: (1) Immediate suspension of the use of weapons by both sides; (2) Monitoring by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) of the suspension of the use of weapons; (3) Adoption of the law on the special status of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts; (4) Creation of a security zone between Ukraine and Russia and
monitoring by OSCE; (5) Immediate release of all hostages; (6) Ban on the prosecution and punishment of persons in connection with the events that have taken place in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts;
(7) Continuation of inclusive national dialogue; (8) Implementation of measures to improve the humanitarian situation in Donbas (eastern Ukraine); (9) Early elections in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts;
(10) Withdrawal of the illegal armed groups, fi ghters, and mercenaries from Ukrainian territory; (11) Designing of a program for economic recovery and the rehabilitation of social life in Donbas; and
(12) Guarantee of personal security for the participants in the consultations.

58 The items of the agreement document consisted of the following: (1) Ceasefi re from February 15, 2015, 12 am (local time); (2) Withdrawal of heavy weapons to create a security zone that is
50-140 km wide; (3) Monitoring by OSCE of the ceasefi re; (4) Launch of dialogue that grants autonomy to areas controlled by separatist armed groups; (5) Pardon of detainees; (6) Release of
all hostages; (7) Provision of humanitarian assistance; (8) Resumption of socioeconomic systems in the east, including pensions and living subsidies; (9) Control of the border with Russia by the
government of Ukraine throughout the confl ict area; (10) Withdrawal of foreign armed formations, weapons, and mercenaries from Ukraine; (11) Entry into force of a new constitution by the end of
2015 that expands local autonomy; (12) Discussions on local elections in areas controlled by separatist armed groups; and (13) Strengthening of cooperation among Ukraine, Russia, and OSCE.

59 In August 2014, NATO released satellite images that are thought to show Russian combat forces engaged in military operations inside the territory of Ukraine.

60 An article published on the website of NATO’s Allied Command Operations in August 2014, co-authored by NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and Supreme Allied Commander Europe
Philip Breedlove, stated that Russia should withdraw its troops from Ukraine, stop using hybrid warfare tactics, and engage with the international community and the Ukrainian government to fi nd a
political solution to the crisis.

Russia positions the development of bilateral and multilateral
cooperation with the CIS as the top foreign policy priority.
Russia considers that its vital interests are concentrated in
the territories of the CIS[62], and has dispatched troops to be
stationed in Ukraine (Crimea), Moldova (Transdniester[63]),
Armenia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Georgia (South
Ossetia, Abkhazia), which left the CIS in August 2009[64].
In November 2014, Russia and Abkhazia concluded an
alliance and strategic partnership treaty[65]. In such ways,
Russia has worked to maintain its military inf uence[66].
With increasing activities by Islamic armed insurgents
in Central Asia and the Caucasus, Russia has been pursuing
military cooperation centered on counter-terrorism
measures in the region, and organized the Collective Rapid
Deployment Force in May 2001 within the framework of
the CIS Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO)[67].
Furthermore, in June 2009, a permanent joint rapid reaction
force was established to strengthen the functions of the CIS
Collective Rapid Deployment Force[68].
In addition, out of concern that the worsening
security in Afghanistan could lead to the destabilization of
Central Asia, Russia and Central Asian countries support
Afghanistan while considering measures to strengthen the
security of borders with Afghanistan[69].


**5** **Relations with the United States**

President Putin has striven to deepen cooperative relations
with the United States in the economic domain, and on the
other hand, has retaliated against the United States on any
action Russia considers as “a U.S. attempt to encroach on
Russia’s strategic interests.” Meanwhile, in response to the
recent increasingly tense situation in Ukraine, the Obama
administration has strongly condemned Russia’s violation
of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and
has imposed severe economic sanctions on Russia[70]. U.S.Russia relations have deteriorated from the time of the
inauguration of the Obama administration.
Russia strongly opposed the deployment plan of
the MD system in Europe by the United States, stating
that it would have a negative impact on Russia’s nuclear
deterrent capabilities. In September 2009, the United States
announced that it was reviewing the proposed deployment
of the MD system in Europe[71], which was cautiously
welcomed by Russia.
However, Russia’s understanding is that the New
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) effective
from February 2011 would be invalidated if the United
States developed, both quantitatively and qualitatively, its
MD capabilities and threatened Russia’s potential strategic
nuclear strength[72]. Russia has striven to keep the United
States in check in response to the recent progress of the
U.S. MD plan in Europe, indicating that Russia would
withdraw from the New START[73].


62 In August 2008, following the confl ict with Georgia, then-President Medvedev indicated that one of the five principles of Russia’s foreign policy was that there are regions in which Russia has
privileged interests.

63 In Transnistria, located on the eastern side of the Dniester River, ethnic Russian residents declared separation and independence from Moldova in 1990, but was never recognized as such by the
international community. Following the annexation of Crimea into Russia, in March 2014 the Parliament of Transnistria urged Russia to also incorporate the region. Moreover, during a telephone
conference between President Putin and President Barack Obama in March 2014, President Putin pointed out that Transnistria was experiencing a blockade. A Russian unit of about 1,500 troops is
currently stationed in Transnistria.

64 After the conflict with Russia in August 2008, Georgia withdrew from the CIS in August 2009, but Russia unilaterally recognized the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in the Georgian
territory and continues to have troops stationed in the regions. In the parliamentary election in October 2012 “Georgian Dream,” an opposition alliance with a campaign promise of improving GeorgiaRussia relations, defeated the ruling “United National Movement” that adopts an anti-Russian policy. In the presidential election of October 2013, Giorgi Margvelashvili, backed by “Georgian Dream,”
was elected and became president in November of the same year. In his inauguration speech, President Margvelashvili stated that he was ready to deepen the dialogue with Russia, expressing his
intention to continue with pro-Euro, pro-U.S. lines while pursuing improvement of the relationship with Russia.

65 Russia’s “Military Doctrine” revised in December 2014 states that Russia would promote cooperation with the Republic of Abkhazia and the Republic of South Ossetia aimed at shared defense
and security.

66 While some CIS countries continue to prioritize their relations with Russia, such as Belarus and Kazakhstan, others attempt to maintain a distance from Russia. Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and
Moldova have taken mostly pro-Western policies to reduce their security and economic dependence on Russia. In September 2012, Kyrgyzstan and Russia agreed on a 15-year extension of the
period of the use of Russian military bases in Kyrgyzstan, which otherwise would end in 2017. In October 2012, Tajikistan and Russia agreed to extend the lease of the base of Russia’s 201st Motor
Rifle Division in Tajikistan until 2042. In December 2013, Su-27 fighters of the Russian naval force were deployed in Belarus for the first time.

67 In May 1992, leaders of six countries (Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) signed the Collective Security Treaty (CST) in Toshkent, Uzbekistan. In 1993, Azerbaijan,
Georgia and Belarus joined the treaty, which came into effect in April 1994. However, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Uzbekistan withdrew from the treaty in 1999 without renewing it. In May 2002, CST
was reorganized into the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). Uzbekistan returned to CST in August 2006 but gave notice of suspension of participation in CSTO in June 2012, effectively
withdrawing from the organization.

68 Learning from the fact that CSTO could not sufficiently respond to the request by Kyrgyzstan for the peace-keeping activities at the time of the ethnic conflict in the southern part of Kyrgyzstan in
June 2010, CSTO has been discussing improvement in the efficiency of its crisis response system. The CSTO Summit Meeting in December 2011 warned against the foreign forces’ stationing in a
member state by requiring the consent of all member states when any member state builds a base of a third country. CSTO joint exercises, “Vzaimodeistvie” (cooperative operation), were implemented
in Kazakhstan in October 2009 and October 2010, in Armenia in September 2012, and in Belarus in September 2013.

69 During the December 2013 Expanded Meeting of the Russian Defence Ministry Board, President Putin said that the withdrawal of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) from Afghanistan
in 2014 would be a destabilizing element to not only Afghanistan but also the wider Central Asia and could pose a threat to the national interests and security of Russia.

70 The United States has gradually expanded the list of Russian individuals and companies subject to asset freezes and entry bans. In addition, the United States has expanded the targets of its loan
suspensions and asset freezes to include key industry sectors, including fi nance, energy companies, state-owned banks, and state-owned defense technology companies.

71 See Part I, Chapter 1, Section 1-2 for the U.S. deployment plan of the MD system in Europe.

72 Statement by the Russian Federation concerning missile defense (April 8, 2010)

73 Russia has demanded a legal guarantee that the MD plan of the United States is not targeted at Russia, and claimed that the United States is not considering Russia’s concerns. Russia issued an
executive statement in November 2011, mentioning countermeasures such as fielding of the early-warning radars and the possibility of its withdrawal from the New START. In addition, in November

With regard to the military exchanges with the United
States, Russia was thought to be wishing to establish
cooperative relations with the United States to some extent,
as exemplif ed from Russian vessels’ participation in
RIMPAC in waters around Hawaii for the f rst time in July
2012. However, following Russia’s moves in connection
with the situation in Ukraine, the United States announced
the suspension of the military exchanges with Russia in
March 2014[74]. In addition, the United States dispatched a
missile destroyer to the Black Sea and provided non-lethal
weapons to the Ukrainian government[75]. With the situation
remaining tense in eastern Ukraine, the United States has
stepped up its activities to keep Russia in check, including
hinting at the provision of lethal weapons to the Ukrainian
government in February 2015.


At the NRC summit held in Lisbon in November 2010,
Russia and NATO stated that both sides would work towards
building a true and modernized strategic partnership.
They are now searching for possibilities of dialogue and
cooperation in f elds such as MD, Afghanistan, cooperation
on counter-terrorism, and anti-piracy measures. With regard
to MD cooperation, no progress was made on RussiaNATO relations. For example, the talks at the meeting
of NRC defense ministers held in June 2011 highlighted
the difference in position between NATO advocating MD
cooperation in which only information and data would be
exchanged under the two independent systems of NATO
and Russia, and the position of Russia aiming at “sector
MD” in which both sides operate integrally by setting
zones for each country’s responsibility under a unif ed MD
system of NATO and Russia.
Meanwhile, there remains the unsolved issue between
Russia and NATO regarding the Conventional Armed
Forces in Europe (CFE) agreement[77].
Furthermore, the increasingly tense situation in
Ukraine has presented a threat to NATO’s eastern border
for the f rst time since the Cold War. Consequently, some
of NATO’s member states in Eastern Europe and the
Baltic harbor national security concerns. For this and
other reasons, NATO continues to take steps to ensure the
effectiveness of its collective defense[78].
Meanwhile, Russia has actively conducted the
air activity that can be deemed provocative in Europe,
especially near the Baltic countries[79].


**6** **Relations with Europe and NATO**


Through the framework of the NATO-Russia Council
(NRC), Russia has worked with NATO as an equal partner
on the areas of mutual interest, such as by participating in
certain decision-making processes. However, following the
recent increasingly tense situation in Ukraine, NATO and
European countries suspended their practical cooperation
with Russia, including in the military domain, except for
the NRC’s ambassador-level meetings[76]. Additionally,
NATO and European countries have maintained a severe
diplomatic stance towards Russia while working with the
Ukrainian government.


74 Following the occupation of the Crimean Peninsula by Russia, then-U.S. Department of Defense Spokesperson Kirby announced in March 2014 that the United States would cease all military exchange
with Russia, including joint exercises with Russian forces, consultations, and port calls.

75 The United States provided to Ukraine non-lethal weapons such as body armor, helmets, vehicles, night and thermal vision devices, heavy engineering equipment, advanced radios, patrol boats,
rations, tents, counter-mortar radars, uniforms, fi rst aid equipment, and other related items.

76 NATO issued a statement condemning Russia over the situation in Ukraine, and has deployed additional military forces to countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltic. However, there are discrepancies
among NATO’s member states in their responses to Russia. The United Kingdom has announced its intention to suspend equipment exports to Russia and to deploy fi ghters to bolster patrols of the
airspace over the Baltic countries, in addition to suspending military cooperation with Russia. Germany has announced the suspension of equipment exports to Russia.

77 At the 1999 Istanbul summit of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), an agreement was reached on changing the troop ceilings set formerly by blocks to those set by
country and territory and on complying with the current CFE Treaty until the adapted CFE Treaty comes into effect. Russia was dissatisfied with the fact that despite its ratifi cation of the adapted CFE
Treaty, NATO member states refused to ratify the Treaty on the grounds that Russian forces were not withdrawing from Georgia and Moldova. Therefore, in December 2007, Russia suspended the
implementation of the CFE Treaty and halted inspections based on this treaty. Presently, only four countries have ratified the adapted CFE Treaty—Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine—and it
has not yet come into effect. In addition, Russia has proposed dissolving the existing security framework that has NATO at its center and creating a new European security treaty that would provide
new fundamental principles for security in Europe and the Atlantic region.

78 At NATO’s Wales Summit in September 2014, the Readiness Action Plan (RAP) was adopted as a measure to strengthen NATO’s collective defense. The RAP includes the creation of the Very High
Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) as an initial response force of the NATO Response Force (NRF), a command and control presence on the territories of eastern Allies to facilitate the rapid increase
of troops, the development of host facilities, the advance deployment of equipment and supplies, and the enhancement of exercise plans focused on collective defense. Bulgaria, the Baltic countries,
Poland, and Romania have expressed their intention to provide facilities.

79 In October 2014, NATO announced that the Russian Air Force conducted signifi cant military maneuvers over the Baltic Sea, North Sea, Atlantic Ocean, and Black Sea on October 28 and 29. NATO

81 Russia concluded sales contracts with Indonesia for the Su-27 and Su-30 fighters in 2003 and 2007, and with Malaysia and Vietnam for the Su-30 fighters in 2003, and has delivered the fighters
to these countries. There are also reports of a sales contract with Vietnam in 2009 for the Su-30 fighters and Kilo-class submarines. In January 2014, the first of the Kilo-class submarines, “Hanoi,”
arrived in Vietnam. With regard to India, aircraft carrier “Admiral Gorshkov,” which had been refurbished in Severodvinsk, was delivered to India, renamed as INS Vikramaditya, which arrived in India in
January 2014. Moreover, in 2006, Russia concluded sales contracts with Algeria and Venezuela for arms, including Su-30 fighters, and has delivered some of these arms. Russia’s exports to China
have included Su-27 and Su-30 fighters, Sovremenny-class destroyers, and Kilo-class submarines. Against the backdrop of the advancement of indigenous weapon production in China, some point
out that the value of Russian exports to China has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, Russia has continued to export equipment such as aircraft engines for repair purposes. Russia and
China are also reportedly in talks on exporting the Su-35 fi ghter and the “S-400” surface-to-air missile.

a new Defence White Paper[6] that covers the key changes
in the domestic and overseas strategic environments since
the previous Defence White Paper was published in May
2009[7], which inf uence Australia’s national security and
defense capability build-up. The White Paper states that the
U.S.-China relationship will, more than any other single
factor, determine Australia’s strategic environment over
the coming decades, and that a new Indo-Pacif c arc is
beginning to emerge. Based on this recognition, the White
Paper notes that Australia’s strategic interests are (1) a
secure Australia, (2) a secure South Pacif c and TimorLeste, (3) a stable Indo-Pacif c, and (4) a stable, rules-based
global order, and on this basis, outlines tasks for the ADF
and its asset build-up[8].
In September 2013, the Abbott administration
was formed. No major differences are believed to exist
between the administration’s overall defense policies and
the policies of the previous Labor Party administration[9].
However, on the f nancial front, the Abbott administration
strongly criticizes the defense budget cuts of the previous
administration, and has indicated its intention to contrive
funds through the streamlining of bloated government
defense organizations and other means to actively
invest in areas deemed necessary for building a strong


defense force. Under this policy, the administration has
signif cantly increased the defense budget in 2014 and
2015[10], and continues to pursue the acquisition of highpriced equipment, such as a new submarine, air warfare
destroyer, amphibious assault ship[11], and the F-35 Joint
Strike Fighter (JSF)[12]. The concrete defense policies of the
Abbott administration are expected to be outlined in the
administration’s f rst Defence White Paper to be published
in 2015.

6 The Defence White Paper of Australia presents the government’s future plan and measures for national defense. It was previously published in 1976 (Fraser Liberal Party administration), 1987
(Hawke Labor Party administration), 1994 (Keating Labor Party administration), 2000 (Howard Liberal Party administration), 2009 (Rudd Labor Party administration), and 2013 (Gillard Labor Party
administration), a total of six times.

7 (1) Economic, strategic, and military shift to the Indo-Pacifi c; (2) The ADF’s operational drawdown from Afghanistan, Timor-Leste, and Solomon Islands; (3) The U.S. re-balance to the Asia-Pacifi c;
(4) Australia’s substantially enhanced practical cooperation with the United States pursuant to Australia’s Alliance relationship; and (5) The ongoing Global Financial Crisis, which have seen a signifi cant
deleterious impact on the global economy, domestic fi scal circumstances, and defense funding.

8 The White Paper identifi es tasks for the ADF in priority order as follows: (1) deter and defeat armed attacks on Australia; (2) contribute to stability and security in the South Pacifi c and Timor-Leste;
(3) contribute to military contingencies in the Indo-Pacifi c region, with priority given to Southeast Asia; and (4) contribute to military contingencies in support of global security. With regard to ADF asset
build-up, the White Paper states that maintaining an appropriate mix of high-end ADF capabilities is essential to defend Australia and its strategic interests, and that maintaining credible high-end
ADF capabilities enables Australia to act decisively when required, deter would-be adversaries, and strengthen its regional infl uence. The White Paper notes that accordingly, Australia will continue to
seek the acquisition of key equipment.

9 In the campaign policy prior to its inauguration, the Abbott administration made clear its position to support the defense policy objectives that the Howard administration of the same conservative
coalition presented in 2000 in the Defence White Paper published at the time. These defense policy objectives are: (1) Ensure the defense of Australia and its direct approaches; (2) Foster the security
and stability of its immediate neighborhood; (3) Support strategic stability in the wider Asia Pacifi c region; and (4) Support global security. The administration maintains that these must remain the
basic defense policy objectives of Australia. These defense policy objectives are considered to be generally in alignment with the concept of “strategic interests” that constituted the core of the defense
policies of the previous Labor Party administration.

10 In May 2014, the Abbott administration disclosed the FY2014-FY2015 federal budget, the fi rst budget that was established under the administration. Of this amount, the defense budget disclosed
by Australia’s Department of Defence was 29.3 billion AUD, about 15.2% more than the initial budget of the previous fi scal year. The Abbott administration intends to increase the defense budget’s
share from about 1.6% of GDP as of 2013, to 2% within the coming decade.

11 In November 2014, the fi rst ship HMAS Canberra (displacement: 27,000 tons) was commissioned. The ship is capable of embarking 1,000 amphibious troops, as well as landing craft and helicopters
to transport the troops. The Royal Australian Navy aims to induct two amphibious assault ships. The second ship is expected to be commissioned in 2016.

12 In April 2014, the Abbott administration approved the additional acquisition of 58 F-35 JSFs. This brings the total number to be acquired to 72 JSFs, combining the 14 JSFs that have already been
approved in 2009. In January 2015, training by Royal Australian Air Force pilots began in the United States. The aircraft is expected to be relocated to Australia sequentially from 2018 and start partial

**3** **Relations with Other Countries**


Australia outlines in its Defence White Paper that as
regional countries strengthen their military capabilities,
Australia would build deeper strategic partnerships and
contribute positively to the region’s security and stability
– while at the same time managing strategic uncertainty.
Specif cally, it states that recognizing the importance
of seizing opportunities to build deeper partnerships
in the Indo-Pacif c region, Australia would enhance its
relationships with other countries on the defense front for
the time being. In addition, the White Paper states that
Australia would attach importance to building effective
mechanisms to manage security issues and risks arising
from rivalries and the possibilities of miscalculation. It
notes that Australia’s contribution to regional security is
not restricted to deploying forces in a conf ict or crisis, and
that its efforts would be focused on reducing the risk of
conf ict through building trust and partnerships through
regular interaction with other nations. It is deemed that the
Abbott administration will continue to generally uphold
this policy[13].

convening the Australia-United States Ministerial
Consultations (AUSMIN) to discuss major diplomatic and
security issues. On the operational front, the two countries
have made efforts to increase interoperability through joint
exercises, including Exercise Talisman Saber[15]. Since April
2012, the U.S. Marine Corps have conducted rotational
deployments to northern Australia[16]. On the equipment
front, the two countries have been simplifying the export
procedures associated with equipment deals pursuant to
the Australia-U.S. Defence Trade Cooperation Treaty
that entered into force in May 2013. In addition, the two
countries are examining the joint development of the
F-35 JSF and missile defense cooperation[17]. Furthermore,
bilateral cooperation is being advanced in areas, such as
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR),
space[18], and cyber[19]. Since the Abbott administration came
into power, Australia has continued to pursue the further
deepening of bilateral relations. At the 29th AUSMIN held
in August 2014, the two sides signed the Force Posture
Agreement which provides a legal framework for the
rotational deployment of the U.S. Marine Corps. From
October 2014, the ADF has been participating in the combat
mission of the U.S.-led operation against the Islamic State
of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).


**1** **Relations with the United States**


The Australia-U.S. Alliance based on the Security Treaty
between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States of
America (ANZUS)[14] is Australia’s most important defense
relationship, and Australia attaches great importance to
this alliance as a pillar of its national strategy and security
arrangements. The Defence White Paper states that the
United States would continue to be the world’s strongest
military power and the most infuential strategic actor in
Australia’s region for the foreseeable future. Moreover, it
asserts that a U.S. presence in the region would continue
to be important amidst the Indo-Pacifc’s rapidly changing
strategic environment, and that Australia welcomes the
shift in U.S. strategic focus towards the region and the U.S.
commitment to maintain its strong diplomatic, economic,
and security presence.
Since 1985, the two countries have been regularly


**2** **Relations with China**


Australia’s Defence White Paper states that China’s
economic growth is a major contributor to global strategic
weight shifting to the Indo-Pacif c. In addition, it asserts
that Australia welcomes China’s rise and does not
approach China as an adversary; rather, its policy is aimed
at encouraging China’s peaceful rise and ensuring that
strategic competition in the region does not lead to conf ict.
It also states that the growth of China’s defense capabilities
and the modernization of its military is a natural and
legitimate outcome of its economic growth.
Moreover, Australia sees China as an important
partner in the region, and is committed to developing
strong and positive defense relations with China through
dialogue and practical activities. Under these policies,


13 The Abbott administration announced in its campaign policy that it would prioritize the Asia-Pacifi c and Indian Ocean regions, similar to the previous administration. In particular, the administration
has committed to focusing diplomatic, development, trade, and security efforts in parts of the Indian Ocean Rim that have the capacity to advance Australia’s interests. The administration has also
indicated that it would operate with its allies, particularly the United States, in the wider world when and where it judges that it is in its national interest.

14 A trilateral security treaty among Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, which went into effect in 1952. Since 1986, the United States has suspended its obligation to defend New Zealand
due to its adoption of a non-nuclear policy. The treaty is thus effective only between Australia and the United States and between Australia and New Zealand.

15 Exercise Talisman Saber, started in 2005, is a biennial combined Australia-U.S. training activity, designed to improve combat readiness and interoperability. About 21,000 U.S. Forces personnel and
about 7,000 ADF personnel participated in this training from July through August 2013. The exercise is scheduled to be conducted in July 2015.

17 At the AUSMIN held in August 2014, Australia and the United States agreed to continue to work together to counter the growing threat of ballistic missiles in the Asia-Pacifi c region. As a concrete
example of cooperation, the two countries gave the establishment of a working group to examine options for potential Australian contributions.

18 Since signing the Space Situational Awareness Partnership in November 2010, Australia and the United States have promoted space cooperation, including the relocation of the U.S. C-band groundbased radar system and the Space Surveillance Telescope to Australia.

19 At the AUSMIN in September 2011, the two nations signed a joint statement on cyberspace and confirmed that, mindful of their longstanding defense relationship and the ANZUS Treaty, the two would
consult together and determine appropriate options to address threats in the event of a cyber attack that threatens the territorial integrity, political independence, or security of either Australia or the

Australia continuously carries out dialogues between
defense authorities with China[20] and conducts exchanges
to develop cooperative relations between Australian and
Chinese forces, through joint exercises, mutual visits of
military ships, among other activities[21]. In October 2014,
northern Australia hosted KOWARI 2014, the f rst survival
exercise conducted by the land forces of the United States,
China, and Australia[22].
Meanwhile, the Abbott administration has been intent
on clearly communicating its concerns about China. In
a joint statement of the ministerial strategic dialogue
by ministers of defense of Japan, the United States, and
Australia in October 2013, and a Joint Communique of
AUSMIN in November 2013, the administration expressed
its stance that it opposes any coercive or unilateral actions
that could change the status quo in the East China Sea, and
that it thinks it is necessary for ASEAN and China to agree
on a Code of Conduct regarding the South China Sea[23]. In
addition, on China’s announcement of the establishment of
an Air Defense Identif cation Zone in the East China Sea in
November 2013, Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop
released a statement stating that Australia makes clear its
opposition to any coercive or unilateral actions to change
the status quo in the East China Sea.

**3** **Relations with India**

Australia states in its Defence White Paper that it
prioritizes the Indo-Pacif c region against the backdrop of
India’s emergence as an important strategic, diplomatic,
and economic actor and greater engagement in regional
frameworks. On this basis, Australia notes that it would
deepen its relations with India, with which it has a shared
interest in helping to address the strategic changes that are
occurring in the region.
The Australia-India relationship was elevated to
strategic partnership in November 2009, and the two
countries have regularly conducted strategic dialogues,
mutual visits by senior military off cers, interactions
among military services, and mutual dispatches of students
to military educational organizations. More recently, in
September 2014, Prime Minister Abbott visited India, and
a nuclear cooperation agreement that enables uranium
exports to India was signed[24]. In November 2014, Prime
Minister of India Narendra Modi visited Australia also for
the purpose of attending the G20 Summit, marking the f rst
visit to Australia by an Indian Prime Minister in 28 years.
The two leaders agreed to extend defense cooperation to
cover research, development, and industry engagement, to
hold regular meetings at the level of Defense Minister and
conduct regular maritime exercises[25], and to convene talks
between each of their military services.

See Part I, Chapter 1, Section 7-1-2 (Military Affairs)


20 In July 2014, Fan Changlong, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China visited Australia, and held talks with Prime Minister Abbott, Minister for Defence David
Johnston, and others. The two sides agreed to hold a U.S.-China-Australia trilateral joint exercise. In addition, Australia and China have regularly convened the Defence Strategic Dialogue since 1997.
At the 17th Dialogue held in China in December 2014, discussion took place on the plan for service engagement between the ADF and China’s People’s Liberation Army, among other matters.

21 In August 2013, Australia, the United States, China, and New Zealand conducted their fi rst humanitarian assistance and disaster relief joint exercise in Christchurch, New Zealand. In October 2013,
a Chinese naval vessel participated in the International Fleet Review held in Sydney.

22 In October 2014, KOWARI 2014 was held in northern Australia with the participation of ten U.S. Forces personnel, ten China’s People’s Liberation Army personnel, ten ADF personnel, and about 100
Australian support personnel. The exercise is said to have included activities for deepening understanding of the basic principles, procedures, techniques, and equipment that can enhance survival
prospects in a harsh natural environment.

23 The AUSMIN Joint Communiqué of August 2014 expresses opposition to unilateral attempts to change facts on the ground or water through the threat or use of force or coercion.

24 Australia restricts uranium exports to countries with which it has concluded a nuclear cooperation agreement in order to prevent the diversion of uranium for military purposes. Given that India
conducted nuclear tests and was not a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Australia had not allowed the export of its uranium to India.

Subsequently, in 2014, their leaders made mutual visits,
and in August, their foreign ministers signed a code of
conduct on intelligence cooperation[28]. By November, their
relations had recovered to the point of resuming high-level
exchanges between their military forces[29].
With Malaysia and Singapore, Australia carries out
regular joint combined exercises in the South China Sea
and other areas[30] under the framework of the Five Power
Defence Arrangements[31]. Australia stations the ADF in
Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) Base Butterworth, and
contributes to maintaining regional security and stability
through patrol activities in the South China Sea and the
northern Indian Ocean.
Australia plays a leading role in assisting Papua New
Guinea, Timor-Leste, and the South Pacif c countries in
f elds such as security maintenance, coping with natural
disasters, and maritime patrol[32]. In particular, in the f eld
of maritime patrol, Australia still regularly deploys ADF
assets to the South Pacif c to assist with patrol activities.
In addition, in June 2014, Australia unveiled a plan to
replace the 22 patrol vessels it provided to these countries
in the past.
With New Zealand, Australia has an alliance pursuant
to the ANZUS Treaty. The two countries hold regular
meetings by their leaders and defense ministers, and have
maintained close cooperative relations in the security and
defense f elds through joint exercises and joint activities in
the region.

Country)


**4** **Relations with Southeast Asia and South Pacifi c**
**Countries**

The Defence White Paper notes that Australia has an
enduring strategic interest in the stability of the Indo-Pacif c,
particularly Southeast Asia and the maritime environment.
Given that major sea lanes that are critical to Australian
trade pass through Southeast Asia, which sit astride the
northern approaches to the country, there would be cause
for concern if potentially hostile powers established a
presence in Southeast Asia that could be used to project
military power against Australia. From this perspective,
Australia perceives the stability and security of Indonesia,
its largest neighbor, to be of singular importance, and
believes that it benef ts from having a strong and cohesive
Indonesia as a partner.
Australia has been deepening its relations with
Indonesia in the security and defense f elds following
the signing of the Lombok Treaty in November 2006,
the elevation of their relationship to strategic partnership
in March 2010, and the conclusion of the Defence
Cooperation Arrangement in September 2012[26]. Since the
beginning of his administration, Prime Minister Abbott
had prioritized Australia-Indonesia relations, selecting
Indonesia as the destination of his f rst overseas visit in
September 2013. However, issues emerged, including
differences in their responses to stowaways from Indonesia
and the case of wiretapping of the Indonesian President and
others by Australia’s intelligence agency[27]. Consequently,
cooperative relations in the security and defense f elds
were temporarily stalled between the two countries.


26 The Lombok Treaty is a security cooperation framework that espouses wide-ranging cooperation in the defense fi eld. It entered into force in February 2008. The Defense Cooperation Arrangement
covers strengthened cooperation in counter-terrorism and maritime security.

27 To deal with the increasing number of stowaways from Indonesia, the Abbott administration has taken responses, such as turning them away at sea prior to their landing in Australia. This has prompted
backlash from the Indonesian government. In November 2013, it was reported that an Australian intelligence agency wiretapped the telephone calls of Indonesia’s previous President Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono, Mrs. Yudhoyono, ministers, and others. The Indonesian government lodged strong protests, including summoning the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia and demanding an apology to
the Australian government. The government also announced the suspension of military exchanges and intelligence cooperation with Australia.

28 Provisions were incorporated into the code of conduct, such as prohibition of intelligence activities that would harm the interests of the other party and promotion of intelligence exchanges.

29 The Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces visited Australia and held the Second Australia-Indonesia High Level Committee Meeting with the Chief of the Australian Defence Force. The
First Committee Meeting was held in April 2013.

30 In November 2013, Exercise Bersama Lima was held in the South China Sea and the Malay Peninsula, in which approximately 400 personnel, vessels, F/A-18 and other aircraft of the ADF participated.
In Exercise Bersama Lima held in the South China Sea, Malaysia, and Singapore in October 2014, about 500 personnel, vessels, and AP-3C and other aircraft of the ADF participated.

32 Australia has extended proactive assistance for the political and social stability of Timor-Leste since 1999, when the momentum for independence heightened in Timor-Leste. The ADF led the
International Stabilization Force (ISF) since 2006, and with the stabilization of the security situation in Timor-Leste, the withdrawal of the ADF was completed in March 2013. In the Solomon Islands,
the ADF extended assistance for their stabilization since July 2003 through the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). The ADF withdrew from the country in August 2013, when

ships is obstructed. Furthermore, in recent years, there is
a concern about nationals embarking to Iraq and Syria for
the purpose of joining the Islamic State of Iraq and the
Levant (ISIL) and engaging in terrorism after returning
to their countries[1]. In order to cope with these issues, the
countries in Southeast Asia are working to build military
forces for national defense and maintenance of domestic
public security, as well as for addressing new security
issues such as terrorism and piracy. In recent years, against
the backdrop of economic development, the countries have
been modernizing their military forces, particularly their
naval and air forces, as well as strengthening their maritime
law enforcement capacities.

any immediate external military threats, it faces internal
concerns, including the activities of Islamic extremists, such
as Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), and secession and independence
movements in Papua Province.

**2** **Malaysia**


Malaysia, which is located at the center of Southeast Asia,
considers itself to have common strategic interests with
its neighboring countries. Although Malaysia does not
acknowledge any imminent external threats at present, it
believes that its forces should maintain a level of readiness
that enables them to deal with all military threats, and
therefore, places importance on “Independence,” “Total
Defence,” “Commitment to the Rule of the Five Power
Defence Arrangements (FPDA)[8],” “Cooperation to the
U.N. for World Peace,” “Measures against Terrorism,” and
“Defence Diplomacy” in its defense policy. Moreover, as
part of “Defence Diplomacy,” Malaysia undertakes bilateral
joint exercises such as the “CARAT” and “SEACAT”
exercises with the United States, which is not a FPDA
country, and thereby, promotes military cooperation.
Despite conf icting assertions over the sovereignty of
the South China Sea and other matters, Malaysia and China
have strong ties, especially their economic relationship,
and the dignitaries of both countries often make mutual
visits. In December 2014, Malaysia and China conducted
their f rst bilateral joint tabletop exercise “Peace and
Friendship 2014” in Kuala Lumpur. When a Malaysian
airliner disappeared in March 2014, China deployed its
Air Force’s transport aircraft and its Navy’s vessel, among
other assets, to participate in the search activity. Despite the
recent navigation of Chinese government vessels around
the James Shoal and the South Luconia Shoal over which
Malaysia claims sovereignty, Malaysia has not lodged
any visible protests. In May 2014, Prime Minister Najib
Razak visited China, and during his talks with President Xi
Jinping, allegedly stated that the South China Sea dispute
should be handled through direct dialogue. Meanwhile, in
October 2013, Malaysia announced that it would construct
a new naval base in Bintulu close to the James Shoal and
the South Luconia Shoal. In recent years, Malaysia has
striven to deepen maritime defense capabilities.

See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1-4-6 ((7) Other Southeast Asian Countries)


Indonesia aims to achieve the requirements for minimum
defense capabilities – what it calls Minimum Essential
Force (MEF), and build the MEF in the next four years.
However, Indonesia has indicated that its maritime defense
capabilities, in particular, are still very much inadequate[3].
Indonesia emphasizes cooperation with other Southeast
Asian countries[4], and practices an independent and active
foreign policy. It is strengthening its cooperative relationship
with the United States in such f elds as military education
and training, and military equipment procurement[5], and
is involved in joint training with the United States. These
include the “CARAT (Cooperation Af oat Readiness and
Training)”[6] and the “SEACAT (Southeast Asia Cooperation
Against Terrorism)”[7] exercises. In 2010, President Barack
Obama visited Indonesia, and the two countries concluded
a bilateral comprehensive partnership. Since then, a
bilateral foreign ministers’ meeting has been held annually
in accordance with said partnership.
With China, the counter-terrorism training “Sharp
Knife” has been held among the special operation forces of
the two countries since 2011, and “Sharp Knife Airborne”
among the airborne units of the air forces of the two
countries since 2013. In November 2014, Minister of
Foreign Affairs Wang Yi visited Indonesia and held talks
with President Joko on maritime development cooperation.
In March 2015, President Joko visited China as a state
guest, and aff rmed with President Xi Jinping that they
would deepen bilateral relations under the framework of
comprehensive strategic partnership.


In October 2014, Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces Moeldoko commented that the country had only yet reached 38% of the target to achieve MEF in the next four years. Chief of
Staff of the Indonesian Navy Marsetio has stated that the country’s maritime defense capabilities are very much inadequate, and that 12 submarines and 16 frigates are necessary.

At the ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in July 2012, member states were divided over the content of the joint statement, and the joint statement was ultimately not adopted. However, after the
meeting, Minister of Foreign Affairs Marty Natalegawa of Indonesia held successive talks with the foreign ministers from the respective member states, and “ASEAN’s Six-Point Principles on the South
China Sea” was established.

The United States suspended International Military Education and Training (IMET) for Indonesian military personnel in 1992 over the issue of Timor-Leste. IMET provides opportunities for studying and

**3** **Myanmar**

Myanmar shares borders with China and India, which
are leading actors in the changes of balance of power in
the international community, and is also located on the
border of South Asia and Southeast Asia. In light of these
factors, Myanmar is noted for its strategic signif cance.
Following the collapse of its socialist regime in 1988,
the armed forces seized power in Myanmar, and the
United States and European countries imposed economic
sanctions in response to the military junta’s suppression
of pro-democracy movements. Against the backdrop of its
economic slowdown as a result of the economic sanctions
and isolation from the international community, Myanmar
issued a road map to democracy in 2003[9]. After a general
election in 2010, Thein Sein was elected as president in
February 2011. The road map to democracy was completed
in March 2011 with the launch of the new administration.
Since the launch of the new administration, the
government of Myanmar has actively taken steps toward
democratization, including the release of political prisoners
and ceasef re agreements with ethnic minorities[10]. The
international community to a certain extent has commended
Myanmar for these steps, with the United States and
European countries successively easing economic sanctions
on Myanmar. In 2013, President Thein Sein made the f rst
visit to the United States by a leader of Myanmar in almost
50 years, and held talks with President Obama. General
Sir Richards, Chief of the Defence Staff of the British
Armed Forces, made the f rst visit to Myanmar by a senior
military off cial from the West since the commencement of
Myanmar’s reform process.
At the same time, Myanmar has taken steps to reach a
ceasef re with ethnic minorities. In January 2015, President
Thein Sein requested the leaders of ethnic minority armed
groups to hold talks with the government on the country’s
Union Day (February 12), with a view to reaching a
nationwide ceasef re agreement. However, the talks were
not attended by some ethnic minority leaders. In the


northern region, sporadic f ghting has broken out between
the country’s military and ethnic minority armed groups.
In February 2015, the President declared a 90-day state of
emergency in the Kokang Self-Administered Zone in Shan
State where the f ghting took place[11], and promulgated a
military administrative order[12]. Under these circumstances,
in March 2015, the government of Myanmar announced
that the ethnic minority leaders who did not attend the
previous talks on a ceasef re agreement participated in the
talks, and a basic agreement was reached on the content of
the National Ceasef re Agreement.
On the other hand, concerns about nuclear issues and
military ties with North Korea have been pointed out[13].
The international community has growing concerns over
the impact on democratization of the conf icts which have
emerged since 2012 between Rohingya Muslim ethnic
minorities and Buddhists.
With regard to foreign policy, Myanmar upholds
the principle of independence and non-alignment. On
the other hand, China is thought to be an especially
important partner to Myanmar since its period of military

constitution; general election; convening of the House of Representatives; and the establishment of a new government.

10 About 30% of Myanmar’s population is ethnic minorities, some of which demand secession or greater autonomy for their regions. In the 1960s, the government of Myanmar implemented oppressive
policies involving human rights violations such as forced labor and forced migration, which led to armed conflicts with armed groups of ethnic minorities.

11 A state of emergency is issued as a presidential decree in situations such as when a state of emergency occurs that places the lives, housing, and property of the people in danger. For the purpose
of maintaining public security, the decree may designate regions and deadlines and restrict or suspend the basic rights of the people as necessary.

12 Pursuant to the promulgation of this order, the administrative and judicial powers and duties related to maintaining social order are conferred to the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services.

13 It is reported that at talks with then-President Lee Myung-bak of the Republic of Korea in May 2012, President Thein Sein admitted that some weapons trading took place with North Korea in the
past 20 years and indicated that the country would not engage in such trade in the future. He denied cooperation with North Korea on nuclear development. Moreover, it has been reported that, at
the 11th Shangri-La Dialogue (Asia Security Summit) held in June the same year, then-Defence Minister Hla Min disclosed that while the previous government attempted to start academic research

countries was completed and became fully operational.
Port construction has also begun. On the military front,
China is regarded as a major supplier of equipment. In
June 2014, President Thein Sein visited China, and the two
sides agreed to deepen cooperation in such areas as defense
practices, law enforcement, and security. Myanmar is also
strengthening its cooperative relationship with India both
in the economic and military areas. Myanmar participates
in the multinational naval exercise “Milan” hosted by India.
In January 2015, President Pranab Mukherjee of India
committed to extending US$5 million in assistance over
the next f ve years to Myanmar for developing a border
between the two countries.
Myanmar was the Chair of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2014, and attention
was paid to Myanmar’s leadership in ASEAN-related
international meetings. Myanmar played a certain level of
role, as exemplif ed by the release of joint statements at the
ASEAN-related international meetings Myanmar chaired[14].

the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro[17]. On
the other hand, in January 2015, military clashes occurred
between the government army and National Police, and
armed groups of the MILF and other armed forces opposing
the peace talks[18]. It is deemed that time will be required to
achieve practical peace.
The Philippines and the United States, with a
historically close relationship, consider that the U.S.Philippines alliance is a lynchpin for the peace, stability,
and prosperity of the Asia-Pacif c region. The two countries
have maintained a cooperative relationship under their
mutual defense treaty and military assistance agreement,
even after the withdrawal of the U.S. Forces in 1992[19].
The two countries have conducted the large-scale military
exercise “Balikatan” every year since 2000 as well as the
“CARAT” and “SEACAT” joint exercises. In addition,
the United States dispatched the Joint Special Operations
Task Force-Philippines (JSOTF-P) to southern Philippines
to support the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in
their campaign against Muslim extremist groups, such as
the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG)[20]. In December 2013, U.S.
Secretary of State John Kerry visited the Philippines and
announced support of US$40 million in three years in order


**4** **The Philippines**


The Philippines perceives that it confronts new security
challenges, including non-traditional threats, such as
transnational crime. At the same time, it identif es that
long-standing issues, such as the territorial disputes over
the South China Sea and terrorism perpetrated by domestic
anti-government armed groups, constitute major security
concerns. In particular, the government of the Philippines
was engaged in repeated armed conf icts with the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) for approximately 40
years. With the support of the activities of the International
Monitoring Team (IMT)[15], progress was made in the peace
process, and the Framework Agreement for the realization
of a f nal agreement on the Mindanao peace process was
signed in October 2012. In January 2014, the government
of the Philippines and the MILF jointly signed the Annex on
Normalization[16], and in March of the same year, they signed


14 At the ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in July 2012 chaired by Cambodia, opinion was divided among member states on the content of the joint statement, and consequently, a joint statement was
not adopted.

15 Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, Japan, Norway, and the EU are the member states of the IMT (as of March 2015).

16 After the Framework Agreement was concluded in 2012, of the four Annexes that had been continuously reviewed by the Philippine government and the MILF, agreements were already reached on
items related to transitional arrangements and modalities, revenue generation and wealth sharing, and power sharing. Consultations on normalization were left for last.

17 The goal of this agreement is to launch an autonomous government in 2016 after formulating the Bangsamoro Basic Law, holding a referendum in order to demarcate a jurisdictional domain,
abolishing the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), and establishing the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA).

18 In January 2015, in Mindanao, an exchange of fi re occurred between the Philippine National Police that were mobilized to arrest Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) suspects, and the MILF and Bangsamoro Islamic
Freedom Fighters (BIFF). This incident reportedly left casualties on both sides.

19 In 1947, a military base agreement was concluded that allows the U.S. Forces to use Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station for 99 years. A military assistance agreement was also concluded in
1947, followed by the mutual defense treaty in 1951. With the revision of the 1966 military base agreement, the time limit for the stationing of U.S. military bases in the Philippines was set for 1991.
Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station were returned in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Subsequently, the two countries concluded the Visiting Forces Agreement in 1998, establishing the legal
status of U.S. Forces personnel visiting for joint military exercises in the Philippines.

20 With the aim of building a Muslim nation, ASG conducts activities such as terrorist bombings, assassinations, and abductions in the southern Philippines. It is designated as a terrorist organization by
the United States. In October 2014, ASG reportedly demanded the German government to pay ransom in exchange for two male and female German nationals it took as hostages, as well as not to

to enhance coast guard and counter-terrorism capabilities.
In April 2014, the two countries signed the U.S.Philippines Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement[21]
aimed at strengthening bilateral cooperation in such areas
as maritime security, capacity-building of the AFP through
expanded joint exercises, and disaster relief. The Agreement
enables the U.S. Forces to utilize and improve facilities in
the Philippines, as well as preposition equipment, supplies,
and material. Attention will be on the relevant activities as
they relate to the strengthening of the presence of the U.S.
Forces in the Philippines.
The Philippines and China have conf icting territorial
claims over the Spratly Islands and the Scarborough Shoal
in the South China Sea. In recent years, the two countries
have stepped up their activities to assert their sovereignty,
with both countries lodging protests against the other’s
actions and assertions.

relations with ASEAN and the FPDA[22], and has concluded
defense cooperation agreements with countries within
and outside the region. With the aim of contributing to
peace and stability in the region, Singapore supports U.S.
presence in the Asia-Pacif c and permits it to use military
facilities in Singapore. Singapore and the United States
have agreed that a maximum of four U.S. littoral combat
ships (LCSs) would be rotationally deployed to Singapore
after 2013. Deployment began in April 2013[23]. In addition,
Singapore conducted joint exercises with the United States,
such as “CARAT” and “SEACAT.”
With China, in November 2014, Singapore conducted
the joint counter-terrorism exercise “Cooperation,” which
was carried out in 2009 and 2010. In addition, active
mutual visits have taken place between their dignitaries. In
November, Minister of Defence Ng Eng Hen visited China.
During his talks with Minister of National Defense Chang
Wanquan, the two sides agreed to develop their defense
cooperation and promote joint training. In May 2015, the
two countries conducted their f rst bilateral naval joint
exercise “China-Singapore Cooperation 2015.”

See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1-4-6 ((3) Singapore)


**5** **Singapore**


Given its limited land area, population, and resources,
Singapore’s existence and development depend on the
peace and stability of the region in a globalized economy.
Singapore gives high priority to national defense, with
defense spending accounting for about one-f fth of its
national budget.
Singapore identif es deterrence and diplomacy as
twin pillars of its national defense policy. Deterrence is
provided by a robust national army and stable national
defense spending, and diplomacy is established by strong
and friendly relations with the defense institutions of other
countries. Singapore is undertaking efforts to improve the
capability and modernize the Singapore Armed Forces
(SAF) in order to defend the nation against direct threats
and to respond to transnational security issues, such as
terrorism and piracy in peacetime. Due to its small land
area, the SAF uses the training facilities of other countries,
such as the United States and Australia, and continuously
dispatches units there for training.
Singapore emphasizes the importance of cooperative


**6** **Thailand**


Thailand’s defense policy includes: strengthening defense
cooperation through ASEAN, international organizations,
and other entities; defense that makes comprehensive use
of political, economic, and other national strengths; and
effective defense aimed at increasing the readiness of the
Royal Thai Armed Forces (RTAF) and developing the
defense industry. Attacks and bombing incidents by Islamic
extremists seeking secession and independence have
become a frequent occurrence in southern Thailand. The
government identif es the swift restoration of peace and
security of the lives and property of the people in southern
Thailand as an urgent task.
In August 2013, the submission of an amnesty bill[24] by
opposition parties to the House of Representatives sparked
large-scale anti-government demonstrations, mainly in
the capital city of Bangkok. The House was dissolved in
December 2013, and a declaration of a state of emergency


21 The Agreement states that the military bases in the Philippines to be utilized by the U.S. Forces shall be determined through consultations following the conclusion of the Agreement and set out in an
annex to the Agreement. However, petitions were fi led in the Philippines over the unconstitutionality of the Agreement, suspending consultations on the annex.

22 See Part I, Chapter 1, Section 6-2, Footnote 8

23 In December 2014, LCS USS Fort Worth arrived in Singapore for the second deployment.

24 The bill gives amnesty to those who were arrested in the political upheaval since the military coup d’état in 2006. It is deemed that the bill would allow former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who

was issued in January 2014[25]. While a general election
of the House of Representatives was held in February
2014, a series of polling stations cancelled voting due to
demonstrator interferences. As a result, in March 2014,
the Constitutional Court ruled that the general election
of the House of Representatives violated the Constitution
and was invalid. In May 2014, the Constitutional Court
ruled that the Cabinet’s reshuff e of off cials in the past
was unconstitutional. Then-Prime Minister Yingluck
Shinawatra and Cabinet members were instantly
dismissed[26]. That same month, following the declaration of
martial law nationwide, forces led by the RTAF launched a
coup d’état and seized power over the nation. Subsequently,
then-Commander-in-Chief Prayuth Chan-o-Cha of the
Royal Thai Army established the National Council for
Peace and Order that he chairs. In August 2014, he was
elected interim Prime Minister pursuant to the designation
of the National Legislative Assembly formed by the interim
constitution enacted in July 2014[27]. The King issued a
decree appointing the members of the interim Cabinet
which was formed by the Prime Minister. In September
2014, the Prayuth interim administration was formally
inaugurated. This administration aims to hold a general
election under the new Constitution and make the transition
to a new administration by September 2016 at the latest.
Thailand has the issue of non-demarcated borders with
neighboring countries, such as Myanmar and Cambodia.
Thailand has a border dispute with Cambodia over the nondemarcated border area near the Preah Vihear Temple[28],
and intermittent armed conf ict between the military forces
of the two countries had broken out in the area since 2008.
In November 2013, the International Court of Justice
declared the temple and a part of the surrounding area to be
Cambodian territory.
Under its f exible omni-directional diplomatic policy,
Thailand pursues cooperation with other Southeast Asian
countries and coordination with major countries, including
Japan, the United States, and China. Since the conclusion
of the Military Assistance Agreement in 1950, Thailand and
its ally[29], the United States, have maintained a cooperative
relationship. They have conducted the multinational
joint exercise “Cobra Gold” since 1982, as well as the


“CARAT” and “SEACAT” joint exercises. However, in
May 2014, the United States froze its military assistance
in response to the coup[30].
Thailand promotes military exchanges with China;
for example, their marine forces hold a joint military
training program codenamed “Blue Assault.” In addition,
Thailand and China agreed on the joint development of a
multiple rocket launcher system in April 2012. In February
2015, Minister of National Defense Chang Wanquan
visited Thailand. During his talks with interim Prime
Minister Prayuth, the two sides agreed to enhance their
joint exercises.

See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1-4-6 ((5) Thailand)


**7** **Vietnam**


Vietnam perceives that it confronts diverse and complex
security challenges. It considers that the issues in the South
China Sea have serious impacts on the maritime activities
of Vietnam, and non-traditional threats, such as piracy and
terrorism, are matters of concern.
During the Cold War era, the former Soviet Union
was the largest donor of assistance to Vietnam. Until
2002, Russia owned a naval base in Cam Ranh Bay. After
the collapse of the former Soviet Union, Vietnam rapidly
expanded its diplomatic relations, including establishing
diplomatic ties with the United States. At present, Vietnam
pursues an omni-directional diplomatic policy and states
that it would actively participate in international and
regional cooperation in order to build friendly relations
with all countries. In May 2013, Prime Minister Nguyen
Tan Dung announced the Vietnam People’s Army’s (VPA)
f rst participation in peacekeeping operations. Since June
2014, Vietnam has deployed military observers to the
United Nations Mission in the Republic of South Sudan
(UNMISS)[31]. Furthermore, in May 2014, a PKO Center
was established at the Foreign Relations Department of the
Vietnamese Ministry of National Defence. As such efforts
exemplify, Vietnam is committed to making contributions
to the international community.
In recent years, Vietnam has strengthened its
relationship with the United States in the military area


25 In November 2013, the ruling party abandoned the passage of the bill. However, anti-government forces shifted the objective of the demonstrations to “overthrowing the current government” and
continued the demonstrations.

26 The Constitutional Court ruled that the transfer of then-National Security Council chief to a sinecure position in September 2011 was conducted for political purposes to promote a relative of thenPrime Minister Yingluck to a higher position. The Court ruled that this was unconstitutional as it infringes the provisions of the Constitution which prohibit state ministers from intervening unjustifiably
in public servant appointments. The Prime Minister who was responsible for the reshuffle and relevant ministers were instantly dismissed on the grounds that the reshuffle constituted reason for
dismissal provided for in the Constitution.

27 As the National Council for Peace and Order continues to exist even after the inauguration of the interim administration, Prayuth concurrently serves as Council Chair and interim Prime Minister.

28 A Hindu temple located on the border between Cambodia and Thailand. The International Court of Justice ruled in 1962 that the temple was situated in territory under the sovereignty of Cambodia;
however, the border of the area around the temple had not been demarcated. The 2013 ruling did not clarify the attribution of the remaining disputed region. Nevertheless, both countries accepted
the ruling, and a joint committee comprised of working-level offi cials will be holding talks on the ruling’s content.

29 Thailand and the United States have an alliance based on the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, or Manila Pact, of 1954 and the Rusk-Thanat communiqué of 1962.

ships’ calling at Vietnam. In December 2013, U.S. Secretary
of State John Kerry visited Vietnam and announced support
of US$18 million in the f eld of maritime security. In
October 2014, the United States announced the lifting of its
embargo on providing lethal weapons related to maritime
security to Vietnam[32].
Vietnam and Russia elevated their bilateral
relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership in
2012, and continue to strengthen cooperation in the area
of national defense. In March 2013, Minister of Defence
Sergey Shoygu visited Vietnam, and the two sides agreed to
jointly construct vessel replenishment facilities along Cam
Ranh Bay. Furthermore, when President Vladimir Putin
visited Vietnam in November of the same year, he agreed
that Russia would provide support for training Vietnam’s
Ground Forces and Navy. In 2014, Russian IL-78 aerial
refueling tankers landed at Cam Ranh International
Airport for the f rst time for the refueling f ights for
Russia’s Tu-95MS strategic bombers[33]. As these examples
demonstrate, the two countries have been carrying out new
military cooperation. In recent years, the two countries
have also promoted cooperation in the energy sector, such
as nuclear power generation. Vietnam is nearly dependent
on Russia for its defense equipment.

See Part I, Chapter 1, Section 4-5-2 (Relations with Asian Countries)

Vietnam and China, under their comprehensive
strategic cooperation partnership relations, proactively
conduct exchanges among their senior government
off cials. However, the two countries have conf icting
assertions over issues such as sovereignty over the South
China Sea. In recent years, both countries have stepped up
their activities to assert their territorial sovereignty, and
have lodged protests against the other country’s activities
and assertions. In August 2014, Le Hong Anh, Standing
Secretary of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of


Vietnam (CPV), visited China as a special envoy of the
CPV General Secretary. During his talks with President
Xi Jinping, the two sides agreed to execute the basic
principles[34] agreed upon in 2011 with regard to the South
China Sea dispute. In October 2014, Minister of National
Defence Phung Quang Thanh visited China. During his
talks with Minister of National Defense Chang Wanquan,
both ministers signed an MOU on establishing a hotline
between the two defense ministries. Furthermore, in
April 2015, CPV General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong
visited China for the f rst time in three and a half years.
Following his talks with President Xi Jinping, the two sides
issued a joint statement[35] on strengthening exchanges and
cooperation between their military forces and managing
the differences in opinion to prevent their development into
disputes, among other matters.
Vietnam and India upgraded their relationship to a
strategic partnership in 2007 and have been deepening their
cooperative relationship in a broad range of areas, including
security and economy. In the area of defense cooperation, it
is noted that the Indian Armed Forces support the training
of Vietnam’s Navy submarine personnel and Air Force
pilots. In addition, Indian Navy vessels make friendly
visits to Vietnam. Furthermore, in September 2014, India
signed an MOU on a US$100 million credit offering for
Vietnam[36]. When Minister of National Defense Phung
Quang Thanh visited India in May 2015, the two sides
signed the Joint Vision Statement on Defence Cooperation
for the period 2015-2020[37]. Cooperation in the area of
energy between India and Vietnam is also deepening, with
a joint development program for oil and natural gas in the
South China Sea.

See Part I, Chapter 1, Section 6-4 (Trends concerning Sovereignty Over the
South China Sea)

See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1-4-6 ((2) Vietnam)


32 In 1984, the United States invoked an arms embargo against Vietnam on the grounds of its human rights issue. In 2007, the arms embargo was lifted excluding lethal weapons. Based on the latest
decision, Vietnam is reportedly considering the purchase of U.S.-made P-3 maritime patrol aircraft.

33 In March 2015, it was reported that U.S. Department of Defense authorities, while stating the relevant facts, requested Vietnam to prevent the recurrence of this activity. In addition, a senior offi cial
of the U.S. Pacifi c Command allegedly stated that the Russian military aircraft that received refueling from the aerial refueling tankers arriving from the Cam Ranh base conducted provocative fl ights.
In January 2015, the Russian Ministry of Defence announced that Russian aerial refueling tankers (IL-78) used Cam Ranh Bay in 2014, enabling the refueling of strategic fi ghters.

34 The agreement on basic principles was signed in October 2011 between then-President Hu Jintao and CPV General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong who was visiting China. The two countries agreed to
maintain friendly dialogue and negotiations for the settlement of maritime issues, strive to settle maritime disputes which are acceptable to both sides while respecting legal grounds, and hold regular
meetings as well as establish a hotline between the two governments.

35 The joint statement’s references to the military fi eld include maintaining high-level contacts and military and security dialogue between the two countries, strengthening friendly exchanges between
their border patrol forces, properly dealing with differences in opinion, exchanging military experiences with party and political tasks, deepening cooperation on personnel training, and continuing joint
patrols in the Gulf of Tonkin and vessel exchanges. In the joint statement, with regard to the South China Sea dispute, the two sides also affi rmed the importance of executing the Declaration on the
Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) and swiftly establishing the Code of the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (COC).

36 This was agreed upon in November 2013 when CPV General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong visited India and held talks with then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India. It is reported that the credit
will be used to purchase patrol vessels of the VPA.

37 The statement was agreed upon in May 2015, when Minister of National Defense Phung Quang Thanh of Vietnam visited India and held talks with Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar of India. While
the content of the Joint Vision Statement has not been disclosed, it is said to cover the period 2015-2020, with maritime security cooperation constituting the main pillar. On the same day, the two

**3** **Military Modernization in the Region**


In recent years, Southeast Asian countries have increased
their defense spending against the backdrop of economic
development and other reasons, and are modernizing their
military forces focusing on inducting equipment such
as submarines and f ghters including fourth-generation
modern f ghters. The underlying factors noted are increases
in defense spending, the relationship between Southeast
Asian countries in the sense that they react to neighboring
states’ development of military strength, response to the
expansion of China’s inf uence, and the inadequate role of
regional security organizations to nurture relationships of
trust[38]. Many Southeast Asian countries procure much of
their defense equipment from a wide range of countries. As
such, there are perceived diff culties in achieving consistent
operations and maintenance in the respective countries.
Indonesia has introduced a total of 16 Russian
Su-27 f ghters and Su-30 f ghters by 2013. In 2011, an
agreement was reached regarding the U.S. provision of 24
F-16 f ghters, three of which were delivered in July 2014.
In 2013, Indonesia agreed to purchase 8 AH-64 attack
helicopters. With the Republic of Korea (ROK), Indonesia
concluded an agreement in December 2011 to purchase
three 209-class submarines. The two countries started joint
development of the KF-X f ghter, and in October 2014,
concluded a basic agreement which sets forth the details of
their cost sharing and bilateral cooperation. Indonesia plans
to refurbish its F-5 f ghter and is in the process of selecting
its successor. In addition, it is building in Indonesia two
frigates based on the Dutch Sigma-class vessel.
In 2009, Malaysia introduced two Scorpène-class
submarines (jointly developed by France and Spain) as its
f rst submarines. In November 2014, Malaysia reportedly
concluded an agreement to purchase six corvettes from the
ROK. Furthermore, Malaysia announced a plan to build
six indigenous LCSs and started building one of them. It
also introduced 18 Russian-made Su-30 f ghters by 2009
and is selecting a successor to its Mig-29 f ghters that are
scheduled to be decommissioned in 2015.
The Philippines has taken steps in recent years to
modernize its defense equipment against the backdrop
of conf icts over territorial rights in the South China Sea.
As it does not currently own any submarines or f ghters,
the Philippines concluded an agreement with the ROK
to purchase 12 FA-50 light combat aircraft in 2014. As


for naval forces, the Philippines received two Hamiltonclass frigates from the United States in 2011 and 2012. In
June 2014, it was reported that the ROK would provide
decommissioned Pohang-class corvettes. By January 2015,
seven Italian AW109 multi-purpose helicopters tailored to
wide-ranging naval missions, such as maritime patrol, have
been delivered. In addition, the Philippines has announced
plans to procure equipment, such as attack helicopter,
long-range maritime patrol aircraft, transport vessel, and
amphibious vehicle.
Singapore has the largest defense budget among
Southeast Asian countries and is actively striving to
modernize its forces. By 2012, Singapore introduced
two Archer-class (Västergötland-class) submarines
from Sweden. In December 2013, Singapore concluded
an agreement to purchase two German 218SG-class
submarines, and announced a plan to build eight indigenous
patrol vessels. With regard to f ghters, Singapore inducted
U.S.-made F-15 f ghters and participates in the F-35 Joint
Strike Fighter (JSF) Program.
Thailand has an aircraft carrier but does not own
submarines. In July 2014, Thailand opened the Submarine
Squadron Headquarters, and has started the evaluation work
to procure new submarines. In September 2012, the Cabinet
approved a plan to introduce two frigates, and concluded
an agreement to purchase a ROK-made frigate for the f rst
frigate. In addition, by 2013, Thailand has introduced 12
Swedish JAS-39 Gripen f ghters.
In December 2009, Vietnam concluded a contract
to purchase six Russian Kilo-class submarines and
introduced three of them by December 2014. In 2013, it
was reported that Vietnam concluded a contract to purchase
two Dutch Sigma-class corvettes. Furthermore, in August
2014, it was agreed that Japan would supply six used vessels
to Vietnam, the f rst of which was delivered in February
2015. Vietnam reportedly concluded a contract to purchase
24 Russian Su-30 f ghters during the years 2009 through
2011, and concluded a contract to additionally purchase 12
of the same f ghter by 2013. Following the United States’
lifting of the embargo against lethal weapons related to
maritime security, attention will be paid to the trends in
the equipment that Vietnam introduces from the United
States, primarily as they relate to strengthening Vietnam’s
maritime defense capabilities.

**4** **Trends concerning Sovereignty Over the South China Sea**


In the South China Sea, there are territorial disputes between
ASEAN countries and China over such areas as the Spratly
Islands[39] and the Paracel Islands[40]. In addition, there has
been growing concern among the international community
over issues such as the freedom of navigation in the sea.
With a desire to promote the peaceful resolution of
maritime territorial disputes in the South China Sea, ASEAN
and China signed the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties
in the South China Sea (DOC)[41] in 2002. This declaration is
a political statement with reference to principles of dispute
resolution related to the South China Sea, but with no
legally binding obligations. At the ASEAN-China Foreign
Ministers’ Meeting held in July 2011, the Guidelines for the
Implementation of the DOC of Parties in the South China Sea
was adopted to pave the way for effective implementation
of the Declaration. Currently, the concerned countries have
conf rmed their commitment to the formulation of the Code
of the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (COC),
which will provide more specif c guidance than the DOC
and will have legally binding obligations. By October
2014, three rounds of off cial consultations have been held
for the formulation of the COC[42]. In the meantime, the
countries are increasing their activities in the South China
Sea in support of their territorial claims. China enacted
the Act on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone of
the People’s Republic of China in 1992, in which it made
clear claims to the territorial rights of the Spratly Islands
and the Paracel Islands. It attached the so-called “ninedotted line” map to a verbal note addressed to the United
Nations in 2009, in which it made claims to the parts of
the South China Sea that purportedly came under China’s
sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction. There were
objections to the ambiguity behind the justif cations to this
“nine-dotted line” under international law, and this has
given rise to territorial conf icts over the South China Sea
with Southeast Asian countries.
In recent years, Chinese naval vessels and government
vessels aff liated with maritime law enforcement agencies
have been operating around the Scarborough Shoal and the
Second Thomas Shoal, close to the Philippines, as well as


the James Shoal and the South Luconia Shoal areas close
to Malaysia. Furthermore, in June 2012, China announced
the establishment of Sansha City in Hainan Province,
which claims to have jurisdiction over the Spratly Islands,
the Paracel Islands, the Macclesf eld Bank, and their
surrounding waters. In November 2013, Hainan Province
amended its regulation on the implementation of China’s
f shing law to stipulate that foreign f shing vessels that wish
to carry out f shing activities in waters under the jurisdiction
of Hainan Province are required to obtain permission from
the relevant departments under China’s State Council.
From April to June 2012, government vessels of
Chinese maritime law enforcement agencies and Philippine
vessels, including Philippine Navy vessels, faced off against
each other in the sea area surrounding the Scarborough
Shoal. In June 2012, Vietnam adopted the Maritime Law
(effective January 2013), which asserts sovereignty over
the Spratly and the Paracel Islands. In March 2013, Chinese
vessels reportedly f red at Vietnamese f shing vessels.
Furthermore, according to reports, in May 2014, China’s
unilateral commencement of oil drilling in waters near the
Paracel Islands triggered confrontations between Chinese
and Vietnamese vessels, and many vessels sustained
damages due to collisions[43]. The countries involved have
reportedly resorted to the use of force on one another’s
vessels, including seizing vessels and f ring warning
shots[44], in this manner, and the concerned countries have
mutually lodged protests against these actions. More
recently, in January 2015, Vietnamese f shing vessels were
reportedly tracked by Chinese vessels, causing damages to
communication and other equipment. In February 2015,
the Philippine government delivered a letter of protest to
the Chinese government, saying that a Chinese authority
vessel crashed into a Philippine f shing vessel near the
Scarborough Shoal.
In May 2014, the Philippine government released
chronological photos showing China’s land reclamation at
Johnson South Reef and lodged a protest against China. In
addition, the Vietnamese government has lodged protests
claiming that China is building runways and conducting


39 The area surrounding the Spratly Islands is expected to have offshore resources such as oil and natural gas. In addition, the area is a maritime transport hub and is blessed with rich fishery resources.

40 China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei claim sovereignty over the Spratly Islands. China, Taiwan, and Vietnam claim sovereignty over the Paracel Islands.

41 It includes provisions that all concerned parties should resolve territorial disputes in a peaceful manner in accordance with the principles of international law, that the adoption of the Code of Conduct
will further promote peace and stability of the region, and that efforts should be made to this end.

42 An agreement was reached to work towards the establishment of a “wise men’s committee” consisting of experts and others to support the official consultations. In addition, in October 2014, an
agreement was reached on early harvest measures, such as setting up a hotline platform among the search and rescue agencies of China and ASEAN and conducting a tabletop exercise on search
and rescue.

43 In Vietnam, demonstrations and riots have broken out against China’s unilateral oil drilling activities, causing deaths and injuries.

44 It is reported that in 2010, Indonesia seized a Chinese fishing vessel, and in the same year, the Malaysia navy fleet and aircraft tracked a Chinese fi shing patrol ship. It has been reported that Chinese
authority ships and Chinese fishing boats cut the investigation cable of a Vietnamese resource exploration vessel in May 2011 and November 2012, respectively. It has also been reported that in
February 2011, a Chinese naval vessel fired warnings shots at a Philippine fishing boat. Moreover, reports also indicate that a Chinese authority ship in May 2011 and a Chinese naval vessel in
February 2012 fired upon a Vietnamese fishing boat in separate incidents. According to a spokesperson of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, in April 2015, a Chinese vessel fl ashed powerful lights
towards a Philippine Air Force aircraft that was conducting a routine patrol fl ight near the Subi Reef and requested the aircraft to withdraw from the area. In connection with this incident, in May 2015,
Philippine Secretary of National Defense Voltaire Gazmin reportedly stated that China acts like there is an air defense identifi cation zone (ADIZ), while revealing that China had twice before requested

other activities at Woody Island and Fiery Cross Reef[45]. In
January 2013, the Philippines f led an arbitration procedure
based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea concerning China’s claims and activities in the South
China Sea.

See Part I, Chapter 2, Section 3-3 (8 Southeast Asia)

In addition, in November 2013, a spokesperson of the
Chinese Ministry of National Defense declared that China
would establish other air defense identif cation zones
(ADIZ) in the future, in addition to the East China Sea
ADIZ that it established. In relation to this, in December of
the same year, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed
the view that China should refrain from taking unilateral
measures, including the establishment of ADIZs in Asia,
particularly in the airspace above the South China Sea.
The issues surrounding the South China Sea have been
discussed repeatedly at ASEAN-related meetings and other
fora, with a view to achieving their peaceful resolution.
However, as exemplif ed by the unprecedented situation
in which an ASEAN joint statement failed to be adopted
in the past, there have been instances of lack of consensus
among the member states. Nevertheless, there were also


instances in which ASEAN adopted a unif ed response.
For example, “serious concerns” over the confrontations
between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels in the South
China Sea were expressed at the ASEAN Summit and
Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in May 2014. Furthermore,
at both the ASEAN Foreign Minister’s Meeting in August
2014 and the Summit in November, members expressed
that they remained concerned over recent developments
which increased tensions in the South China Sea. At the
ASEAN Summit in April 2015, members expressed that
they “share the serious concerns” on the land reclamation
to be undertaken in the Spratly Islands.
The issues surrounding the South China Sea are a
matter of concern for the whole international community,
and are directly related to the peace and stability of the
Asia-Pacif c region. As such, attention will continue to be
paid to trends in the countries concerned, as well as the
direction of dialogues aimed at the resolution of the issues.

See Part I, Chapter 2, Section 3-1 (Trends Related to the “Principle of the
Freedom of the High Seas” in the East China Sea and South China Sea);

with Other Countries and Regions)


45 In addition to Woody Island and Fiery Cross Reef, China conducts land reclamation at Johnson South Reef, Gaven Reefs, Hughes Reef, Cuarteron Reef, Subi Reef, and Mischief Reef. Of the features
where land reclamation is being carried out, observers note that facilities deemed to be a runway and an apron are being constructed at Fiery Cross Reef. At Subi Reef, observers note that the largescale land reclamation is large enough to enable the construction of a second runway. On April 20, 2015, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines stated that China’s land reclamation
has “created tensions among the countries around the world.” On May 27, 2015, Philippine Secretary of National Defense Voltaire Gazmin, during his visit to Hawaii, held talks with U.S. Secretary of
Defense Ashton Carter. It is believed that the two sides shared the recognition that all countries involved should seek a peaceful resolution of disputes in the South China Sea and immediately halt

one Russian-built Akula-class nuclear-powered attack
submarine, INS Chakra, in April 2012 under a lease
arrangement. In December 2014, India commenced sea
trials of its f rst indigenous nuclear submarine INS Arihant.
Furthermore, in 2009, India concluded an agreement with
the United States to purchase eight P-8 patrol aircraft. By
November 2014, India has inducted six of these aircraft.
As for its air force, in addition to remodeling its existing
f ghters, India has been conducting a competition since
2007 to select its multirole f ghter (126 f ghters), and in
January 2012, decided on the French Rafale[6]. With Russia,
India has concluded an agreement in December 2012 to
purchase 42 additional Su-30 f ghters. India has also been
deepening military technological cooperation with Russia,
including the joint development of the Fifth Generation
Fighter Aircraft based on the PAK FA being developed
by Russia. With the United States, India has concluded
an agreement in 2010 to purchase ten C-17 transport
aircraft and has inducted nine of these aircraft by 2014. In
addition to aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines, India
undertakes the development and indigenous production
of tanks and light combat aircraft. However, delays in
their development present challenges for India’s domestic

**2** **Military Affairs**

India’s security environment is directly linked to its
neighboring countries and the regions of West Asia, Central
Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, and the Indian Ocean; and
India recognizes that strategic-economic factors impose
upon them an increasingly larger responsibility. In view
of the multifaceted security concerns and the global
dimensions of the challenges, India has strengthened
cooperative relations with other countries and has long
been actively participating in UN Peacekeeping Operations
(PKO). In order to respond rapidly and effectively to
diversif ed security issues, the government and defense
forces remain fully prepared to tackle all challenges.
Based on the nuclear doctrine of 2003, India adheres
to the following policies: minimum nuclear deterrence,
the no-f rst-use nuclear policy, no use against non-nuclear
weapon nations, and maintaining the unilateral moratorium
on nuclear tests that it announced immediately after the
nuclear test in 1998. India promotes the development and
deployment of various ballistic missiles. Launch tests
were successfully carried out of: “Prithvi 2” (range about
350 km) in January and November 2014; “Agni 1” (range
about 1,250 km) in April 2014; and “Agni 4” (range about
4,000 km) in December 2014. Furthermore, in January
2015, the military successfully conducted a test that
launched “Agni 5” (range about 5,000-8,000 km) for the
f rst time from a canister. In addition, it is reported that
India started developing “Agni 6” (range about 8,00010,000 km)[3]. It is deemed that the country aspires to
improve the performance of its ballistic missiles, including
the extension of their ranges. In regard to cruise missiles,
India jointly develops “BrahMos” (range about 300 km)
with Russia, deploying these to the army and navy. India is
also developing a ballistic missile defense system, and an
interception test was successfully carried out in April 2014.
In recent years, India has been injecting efforts into
modernizing its naval and air forces in particular. As a part
of these efforts, it is expanding procurement of equipment
from foreign countries as well as joint development
with them, and has emerged as the world’s largest arms
importer[4]. With respect to its naval capabilities, India has
introduced one British-built aircraft carrier, Viraat, and
in November 2013, the Russian-built aircraft carrier INS
Vikramaditya[5]. It is also building one domestic aircraft


The ranges of each missile are referenced from “Jane’s Strategic Weapon Systems (2013)” and other sources. It has been reported that: “Prithvi 2” is a mobile ballistic missile, liquid-fuelled; “Agni
3” is a mobile two-stage ballistic missile, solid-fuelled; “Agni 4” is a mobile two-stage ballistic missile, solid-fuelled; “Agni 5” is a mobile three-stage ballistic missile, solid-fuelled; “Agni 6” is a threestage ballistic missile, solid/liquid-fuelled; and “BrahMos” is a solid-fuelled ramjet supersonic cruise missile.

India has concluded an agreement to purchase 45 MiG-29 fi ghters from Russia to be operated from aircraft carriers. By February 2015, 23 of these aircraft have been inducted.

It is deemed that the negotiations are ongoing regarding the details of the agreement to purchase Rafale’s multirole fi ghter. In April 2015, Prime Minister Modi visited France, and during his talks with

to enhance technology cooperation by the U.S. Forces for
India’s Navy, as well as to hold consultations to extend the
U.S.-India military cooperation framework set to expire in
2015 by another ten years.
In January 2015, President Obama visited India
to attend its Republic Day celebrations as Chief Guest.
The leaders agreed that they would expand technology
cooperation to include co-development and co-production
of equipment. In addition, the leaders aff rmed that
they would deepen cooperation in the f eld of maritime
security, and agreed that cooperation between their navies
would be expanded, including upgrading their bilateral
naval exercise “Malabar” that is conducted between the
two countries. In such ways, their cooperation in the f eld
of security has expanded.

**(1) Relations with Pakistan**
India and Pakistan have disputes over the sovereignty of
Kashmir[7], and have had three armed conf icts of signif cant
scope. The territorial dispute over Kashmir has long been
in contention between India and Pakistan, with dialogues
repeatedly resuming and suspending. Dialogue between
the two countries was suspended due to the Mumbai terror
attack in 2008, but it resumed following the February
2011 talks by their Vice-Ministers of Foreign Affairs. In
2011, both countries aff rmed the importance of peacefully
settling all outstanding issues between the two countries
through dialogue. Pakistan then decided to grant India mostfavored nation status. Subsequently, Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif of Pakistan was invited to Prime Minister Modi’s
swearing-in ceremony in May 2014, and a summit meeting
was held. While both countries had demonstrated readiness
to improve their bilateral relations, a Vice Foreign Ministerlevel meeting between the two countries scheduled for
August 2014 was cancelled[8]. While the Vice Minister-level
meeting was held in Islamabad, Pakistan in March 2015,
it is unclear whether dialogue between the two countries
would take place continuously. Armed clashes between the
two militaries have repeatedly taken place in the Kahsmir
region. It is reported that the large-scale armed clashes
which took place in October 2014 left civilians dead and
injured. This has led both countries to protest against each
other, and the Kashmir issue still remains a concern for
both countries.


**(4) Relations with Russia**

See Part I, Chapter 1, Section 4-5-2 (Relations with Asian Countries)


**(2) Relations with the United States**
India is actively striving to strengthen bilateral relations
with the United States. The United States is also promoting
engagement with India in line with the expansion of
the relationship derived from the economic growth of
India. The two countries conduct joint exercises, such
as “Malabar”[9], on a regular basis. In addition, in recent
years, the United States has become one of India’s major
equipment procurement destinations[10]. In September 2014,

7 India asserts the accession of Kashmir to India, based on the Instrument of Accession document by which the ruler of Kashmir acceded to India at the time of Pakistan’s independence, and contends
that this matter should be resolved through bilateral negotiations on the basis of the 1972 Simla Agreement (an agreement on the peaceful resolution of disputes and the withdrawal of their military
forces that was reached following a summit meeting held in Simla in northern India). On the other hand, Pakistan declares that this should be decided through a referendum, in line with a 1948 UN
resolution. The two countries have taken a significantly different fundamental stance toward the resolution of the dispute.

8 In December 2014, Minister of State for External Affairs Vijay Kumar Singh attributed the cancellation of the meeting to the meeting between Pakistan’s High Commissioner and Kashmiri leaders of
organizations which seek Kashmir’s secession from India.

9 The “Malabar” was initially a bilateral naval exercise between the United States and India. Then, Japan, Australia, and Singapore joined “Malabar 07-2,” and Japan participated in “Malabar 09” and
“Malabar 14.”

10 According to SIPRI, “Trends in International Arms Transfers, 2014” (March, 2015), the share of India’s arms imports from the United States was 0.3% in 2008 and 26.8% in 2014. The United States

Minister, who holds up a policy of dialogue with Islamic
extremists. In February 2014, peace consultation with
Islamic extremists was conducted for the f rst time. However,
since then, these Islamic extremists committed a series of
terrorist attacks, and in June of the same year, the Pakistan
Armed Forces launched a military operation against these
Islamic extremists. In December 2014, following a school
attack in Peshawar in northwestern Pakistan by Islamic
insurgents[11], Prime Minister Sharif strongly condemned
the insurgents, revised the Constitution and developed the
National Action Plan that includes establishing a special
military tribunal to try terrorist suspects, and announced
that the Armed Forces would continue with and step up its
mop-up operation.


**1** **General Situation**

Wedged between the powerful South Asian nation of India
and politically-unstable Afghanistan, and sharing borders
with China and Iran, Pakistan is placed in a geopolitically
signif cant and complex position. In particular, Islamic
extremists conduct activities across the PakistanAfghanistan border, and Pakistan’s attitude towards the
war against terrorism draws much attention from the
international community.
While supporting the United States’ war against
terrorism in Afghanistan, the government of Pakistan
has been struggling as its domestic security situation has
worsened, with issues such as growing anti-U.S. sentiment
and retaliatory terrorism by Islamic extremists. As a result
of the 2013 general election conducted in May 2013 at
the House of Parliament, Nawaz Sharif was elected Prime


**2** **Military Affairs**


Pakistan claims that maintaining nuclear deterrence against
the nuclear threat posed by India is essential to ensure
national security and self-defense. In the past, the so-called
Khan network was involved in the proliferation of nuclearrelated materials and technologies[12].
Pakistan has been actively proceeding with the
development of ballistic missiles and cruise missiles
capable of carrying nuclear warheads, and has conducted a
number of test launches in recent years. In 2014 and 2015,
Pakistan conducted test launches of the ballistic missile
“Ghaznavi,” “Shaheen 3,” and “Ghauri” and cruise missile
“Raad.” It is deemed that Pakistan has steadily increased
the military capabilities of its ballistic and cruise missiles[13].
Pakistan is the world’s f fth largest importer of
weapons, importing most of its weapons from China and the
United States[14]. Pakistan concluded a contract to purchase
four Sword-class frigates from China, which have already
been delivered. Pakistan jointly develops the JF-17 f ghter
aircraft with China and has inducted 49 aircraft through
indigenous production. Pakistan has inducted 18 F-16C/D
f ghter jets by 2011 from the United States.

11 In December 2014, armed fi ghters of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke into and attacked a military-operated school in Peshawar in northwestern Pakistan, using explosives and fi ring
indiscriminately. According to reports, 148 people were killed including students, and more than 120 people were injured.

12 Pakistan is believed to have started its nuclear program in the 1970s and conducted its first nuclear test near the Changai District of the Balochistan Province in 1998. In 2004, it came to
light that nuclear-related technologies, including uranium enrichment technology, had been transferred to North Korea, Iran, and Libya by Dr. Khan and other scientists, who had led the nuclear
program in Pakistan.

13 Regarding missiles that Pakistan possesses, the following have been indicated:
“Nasr” (Hatf 9): a mobile, single-stage solid-fuelled ballistic missile with a range of about 60 km
“Ghaznavi” (Hatf 3): a mobile, single-stage solid-fuelled ballistic missile with a range of about 290 km
“Shaheen 1” (Hatf 4): a mobile, single-stage solid-fuelled ballistic missile with a range of about 750 km
“Ghauri” (Hatf 5): a mobile, single-stage liquid-fuelled ballistic missile with a range of about 1,300 km
“Shaheen 3” (Hatf 6): a mobile, two-stage solid-fuelled ballistic missile with a range of about 2,750 km
“Raad” (Hatf 8): a cruise missile with a range of about 350 km
“Babur” (Hatf 7): a cruise missile with a range of about 750 km

the f rst time in three years. This dialogue was held again in
January 2015. During his visit to Pakistan, Secretary Kerry
welcomed the mop-up operation conducted by Pakistan’s
Armed Forces against insurgents, and announced the
provision of about US$250 million to assist temporary
displaced persons (TDPs). Meanwhile, Pakistan urges
the United States to immediately end its drone attacks on
Islamic extremists in Pakistani territory, and the Pakistan
government has protested repeatedly[15]. Furthermore, at an
all-party conference organized by the leaders of the ruling
and opposition parties in September 2013, the government
adopted a resolution asserting that the U.S. drone attacks
were a clear violation of international law. The United
States, on the other hand, condemns Pakistan for providing
safe zones to Islamic extremists in Afghanistan, which
poses threats to the United States. Attention will be paid to
developments related to the relationship between the two
countries, including their stance on the war on terror.

See Part I, Chapter 1, Section 7-1-3 ((1) Relations with Pakistan)


**(2) Relations with the United States**
Besides supporting the activities of the U.S. Forces in
Afghanistan, Pakistan cooperates with the war on terror
by launching mop-up operations against Islamic extremists
in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area. Recognizing the
efforts of Pakistan, the United States designated it as a
“major non-NATO ally” in 2004.
The two countries conducted strategic dialogues since
2010, and the United States provided Pakistan with military
support. However, these were suspended after U.S.Pakistan relations deteriorated as a consequence of the
Osama Bin Laden mop-up operation conducted by the U.S.
Forces in the territory of Pakistan in May 2011. In October
2013, dialogue was resumed after summit meetings were
held between U.S. President Obama and Prime Minister

**Section 8 Europe**

**1** **General Situation**


With the end of the Cold War, while many European
countries now recognize that the threat of large-scale
invasion by other countries has disappeared, diverse security
challenges have emerged, such as outbreaks of regional
conf ict within and around Europe, the rise of terrorism, the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and
increasing numbers of cyberspace threats. With regard to
terrorism in particular, the outbreak of incidents of “homegrown” and “lone-wolf” terrorism domestically has made
counter-terrorism efforts an urgent task[1]. In addition, in
recent years, the increasingly severe f nancial situation has
had a great impact on the security and defense policy of
each country. Under these circumstances, the growing tense
situation in Ukraine has made it imperative that countries
reexamine their existing strategies and design new concepts


to deal with Russia’s attempts to change the status quo by
force or coercion and with “hybrid warfare.” To respond
to such challenges and situations, Europe has sought to
further strengthen and expand multilateral frameworks,
such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
and the European Union (EU)[2]. At the same time, it is
working to contribute to the security and stability of the
international community by proactively participating in
activities outside the European region. Moreover, initiatives
are made at the national level for reviewing security and
defense strategies, reforming national defense systems,
and strengthening bilateral[3] and multilateral[4] defense and
security cooperation.

For example, Belgium, France, and Denmark are reviewing their security arrangements and strengthening their immigration control, due to acts or attempted acts of terrorism that occurred in those
countries. See Part I, Chapter 2, Section 1.

NATO has continued expanding toward Central and Eastern Europe with the aim of stabilizing the entire European and Atlantic regions. Currently, three countries—Macedonia, Montenegro, and Bosnia
and Herzegovina—have been approved to participate in the Membership Action Plan (MAP), which is a program that provides support to future member states in their preparation to enter NATO
(conditionally for Bosnia and Herzegovina). The participation in the MAP of six other countries—Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Moldova—is currently undecided, as these
countries support initiatives for integration into the European and Atlantic regions through frameworks such as the Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP), which is a program offered to countries
that have the intent to deepen political cooperative relationships with NATO.

For example, the United Kingdom and France signed treaties relating to bilateral defense and security cooperation, and on the shared use of nuclear facilities, at a summit meeting held in November
2010. In addition, at a U.K.-France summit meeting held in January 2014, the Declaration on Security and Defence was adopted, and the two countries agreed on conducting joint development of
anti-ship missiles and joint research on unmanned combat air vehicles, as well as on aiming to begin deploying a Combined Joint Expeditionary Force by 2016. With regard to unmanned combat air
vehicles, in November 2014, the U.K. and French governments reached agreement on contracts related to the development of unmanned combat air systems.

For example, in September 2010, the four European countries of France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium established the European Air Transport Command (EATC) to jointly deploy transport

**2** **Enhancement of Multinational Security Frameworks**


Forces Initiative (CFI) was set up[10]. CFI is intended to
provide a framework for conducting joint exercises and
drills among member states. Furthermore, it is designed
to strengthen joint drills among member states and with
partner countries, enhance interoperability, and make use
of advanced technology. CFI is considered to be aimed
at maintaining NATO’s readiness and military capacity
by combining the concepts of Smart Defence and CFI in
reducing defense budgets in each country.
Following Russia’s “hybrid warfare” over Ukraine as
well as the frequent “abnormal f ights” of Russian Armed
Force aircraft over the European front, including the Baltic
states, NATO and member states reaff rmed the threat
posed by Russia. In April 2014, they suspended practical
cooperation with Russia and took other steps, including
expanding its Baltic air policing mission. Furthermore,
at the NATO Summit held in Wales in September 2014,
leaders adopted a joint declaration demanding Russia
to retract its “annexation” of Crimea and adopted the
Readiness Action Plan (RAP) for enhancing existing
readiness forces[11]. Meanwhile, differences are observed in
how member states regard Russia. While Nordic and Baltic
states geographically close to Russia strive to strengthen
their national defense systems, countries in Southern
Europe and other regions call on NATO to not have a bias
towards collective defense that prioritizes Eastern Europe
and attach importance also to tasks outside the NATO
region, such as North Africa.
With regard to ISIL, while no military action has
been taken under the NATO framework, the Wales Summit
Declaration strongly condemned ISIL’s violent acts and
aff rmed that NATO would activate its collective defense if
any Ally were attacked by ISIL.
The EU tries to enhance its initiatives in security


**1** **Security and Defense Policy of NATO/EU**

Founded for the core task of collective defense among
member countries, NATO has expanded the scope of its
activities to conf ict prevention and crisis management
since the end of the Cold War.
In the NATO Summit Meeting held in Lisbon in
November 2010, NATO adopted a new Strategic Concept[5]
for the f rst time in 11 years to propose a guideline for
the next decade for the creation of a more eff cient and
f exible alliance. The document created by NATO lists the
proliferation of WMDs and ballistic missiles, terrorism,
instability and conf ict beyond NATO borders, and cyber
attacks as examples of major threats, def ning three items as
the core tasks of NATO: (1) collective defense in accordance
with Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which forms
the basis of NATO; (2) management of developing crises
before they escalate into conf icts and to help consolidate
stability and reconstruction in post-conf ict situations; and
(3) cooperative security including active contribution to
arms control, non-proliferation, and disarmament.
In recent years, NATO has been promoting the concept
of Smart Defence[6] as the national defense budgets of
member states are declining and gaps in military capability
are widening among member states, in particular between
European countries and the United States[7]. This is the
concept with the objective of building greater security with
fewer resources through multinational coordination with
the following three pillars: (1) Prioritization: selection
of prioritized areas to be invested in[8]; (2) Specialization:
specialization in areas where members have strength[9];
and (3) Multinational cooperation: promotion of joint
procurement and joint operation of equipment. At the
Chicago NATO Summit held in May 2012, the Connected


5 The Strategic Concept is an official document defining the objectives, characteristics, and basic national security responsibilities of NATO. The document has so far been formulated seven times (1949,
1952, 1957, 1968, 1991, 1999, and 2010).

6 As regards concrete efforts undertaken under this concept, at the NATO Summit held in Chicago in May 2012, leaders declared that NATO gained an interim missile defense capability to defend the
people and the territory of NATO against ballistic missile attacks by linking together interceptor missiles and radars of the member states under NATO’s command and control. In addition, 13 member
states of NATO signed a procurement contract for fi ve Global Hawks (RQ-4), which will constitute the core of the Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) system that uses unmanned aircraft.

7 At present, the United States accounts for about 70% of the total defense spending of all NATO member states. NATO guidelines set forth that member states shall spend at least 2% of their GDP on
defense. Nonetheless, in 2013, only 4 (United States, United Kingdom, Greece, and Estonia) out of 28 member states fulfi lled this criterion.

8 At the NATO Summit held in Lisbon in November 2010, the allies committed to focus their investment on 11 prioritized areas, including missile defense, cyber defense, medical assistance, and
intelligence activities.

9 It indicates that every member state does not necessarily need to possess all defense capabilities, but that each nation specializes in areas where it has strength, and shares it among the allied nations.
As an example already in practice is that the Baltic states depend on air policing operations by NATO allies and make certain contributions to the Resolute Support Mission (RSM) in Afghanistan,
instead of abandoning the investment in procurement and maintenance of expensive aircraft.

10 As regards concrete specifi c efforts undertaken based on this concept, at the NATO Summit held in Wales in September 2014, leaders approved a Readiness Action Plan (RAP). It was unveiled to
respond to the impacts of Russia’s strategies as well as the threats emanating from the Middle East and North Africa. RAP presented that NATO forces would have continued presence in eastern
allies, that the response capabilities of the existing multinational NATO Response Force (NRF) would be enhanced signifi cantly, and that the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) that can be
mobilized in two to three days would be created. In addition, at the NATO Defense Ministers Meeting in February 2015, ministers decided that NRF would be expanded from about 13,000 troops to
about 30,000 troops and that VJTF would consist of one brigade (of around 5,000 troops). In April 2015, VJTF’s fi rst military exercises were conducted in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands.

under the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP)
and Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP)[12].
The f rst security strategy document adopted in 2003, “A
Secure Europe in a Better World,” states that the EU aims
to enhance its capabilities to deal with new threats, would
make a contribution to its security through involvement
in its immediate neighborhood, and would play a leading
role in building an international order based on effective
multilateralism by working with the United States, other
partner countries, and international organizations including
the United Nations.
Triggered by the reduction of defense expenditure
in EU countries and the capacity gap among members[13],
the concept of “pooling and sharing” has been promoted,
in which member states jointly manage and use more
military capacities. In specif c terms, cooperation has been
promoted in the areas of air-to-air refueling, unmanned
aerial vehicle, satellite communication, and cyber defense.
The EU intends to make sure all the initiatives within this
concept will complement, rather than interfere with, the
activities covered by the NATO framework such as the
Smart Defence initiative.
At the European Council Meeting (EU Summit) held
in December 2013, CSDP was taken up as the main topic
of discussion for the f rst time in f ve years, and a resolution
about strengthening CSDP was adopted. Following this, in
June 2014, the European Council adopted the EU Maritime
Security Strategy[14]. At the EU Foreign Affairs Council
meeting in November 2014, the EU Cyber Defence Policy
Framework[15] was adopted.
In response to the crisis in Ukraine, the EU has
condemned the military responses of Russia and
implemented economic sanctions against Russia[16]. In
addition, to support the economic and political reforms in
Ukraine, the EU continues its engagement in non-military
affairs, including the provision of large-scale f nancial
assistance to Ukraine[17].


To counter the threat of ISIL, the EU extends funds
to carry out humanitarian assistance for Syria and Iraq.
Additionally, the EU works with countries in regions such
as the Middle East and North Africa to provide capacitybuilding assistance in counter-terrorism measures, among
other activities.

**2** **NATO/EU’s Activities Outside the Region[18]**

Since August 2003, NATO had been leading the International
Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. Its
mission was completed in December 2014. In place of
this mission, since January 2015, NATO has been leading
the Resolute Support Mission (RSM), whose primary
tasks are to provide training, advice, and assistance to the
Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF).
The Kosovo Force (KFOR) has continued to implement its
missions within its framework, such as maintaining security
since June 1999 in Kosovo, which declared independence
in February 2008[19].
In 2003, the EU led peacekeeping operations for the
f rst time in Macedonia by using NATO’s equipment and


12 The EU, although it has a property of non-binding multilateral cooperation, introduced the CFSP, which covers all areas of foreign and security policy based on the Treaty of Maastricht, which took
effect in 1993. In June 1999, the European Council decided to implement the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) to offer peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance activities in conflict
areas, as a part of the CFSP framework. The Treaty of Lisbon, made effective in 2009, renamed the ESDP to CSDP and clearly positioned it as an integral part of the CFSP.

13 The European Defence Agency (EDA), an organization established to improve the EU’s defense capabilities, reports that the military operations in Libya and elsewhere revealed the EU’s lack of air-to-air
refueling capability and precision-guided weapons and its dependency on the United States.

14 See Part I, Chapter 2, Section 3-3-3

15 Its purpose is to implement the Cybersecurity Strategy that the European Commission released in February 2013. The Framework places focus on namely: (1) supporting the development of member
states’ cyber defense capabilities; (2) promotion of civil-military cooperation; and (3) improved education and training opportunities.

16 The EU takes measures, such as capital regulations and ban on exports of equipment and dual use goods, in addition to asset freezes and travel bans.

17 The EU will extend 11 billion euros of assistance between 2014 and 2020. In addition, in response to a request for assistance from the Ukrainian government, the EU has decided to provide additional
assistance of 1.8 billion euros between 2015 and 2016.

18 While NATO has mainly focused on leading military operations, the EU has undertaken a number of civilian missions. Meanwhile, the EU keeps the EU Battle Groups on standby on a rotating schedule
in order to lead peacekeeping missions when NATO is not involved (the number of countries on duty varies by the size of their forces). The division of roles between NATO and the EU is to be defi ned
on a case-by-case basis.

capabilities. Since then, it has been actively committed to
the operations in crisis management and maintenance of
peace and order[20] by, for example, sending troops to BosniaHerzegovina, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Chad,
and Central Africa. Since February 2013, the EU has been
implementing a training mission to support training Malian
troops and realignment in Mali, where Islamic guerrillas
and others pose serious threats. Also, in January 2014, the
EU decided to dispatch security forces to Central Africa,
where the situation has been of constant tumult. The forces
commenced operations in April of the same year.
In addition, NATO and the EU have actively been
engaged in anti-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia


and in the Gulf of Aden. Since October 2008, NATO has
deployed ships of the Standing NATO Maritime Group
(SNMG), comprised of the navies of member states, to
these waters for anti-piracy operations. In Operation Ocean
Shield which NATO has been conducting since August
2009, it has the task of carrying out anti-piracy operations
by ship, as well as helping requesting countries develop their
capacities to combat piracy. Since December 2008, the EU
has been engaged in the anti-piracy campaign, Operation
Atalanta, in these waters, its f rst maritime mission. The
vessels and aircraft dispatched from member states are
engaged in escorting ships and surveillance activities in
the waters[21].

then def ned four items as risks of the highest priority:
international terrorism; attacks upon cyberspace; major
accidents or natural hazards; and international military
crises[25]. The SDSR would decrease the number of military
personnel and major equipment, and review its procurement
plan due to increasing pressure to reduce the defense
budget. At the same time, it aims to convert forces into
specialized, f exible, and modernized war potential through
preferential allocation of resources to new threats, such as
attacks in cyberspace and terrorism[26]. Work is ongoing to
review the existing NSS and to formulate the next SDSR.
They are expected for release in 2015 or 2016.
In July 2012, “Army 2020,” an army reorganization
plan, was released. The plan presents that the United
Kingdom would promote the integration of Regulars and
Reserves in view of the completion of combat missions
in Afghanistan, assigning Reserves a wide range of tasks,
such as overseas engagements, United Nations missions,
and enduring stabilization operations. While the number of


**1** **The United Kingdom**


After the end of the Cold War, the United Kingdom, perceiving
that there is no direct military threat against the country, has
advanced national defense reform with particular focus on
improving its overseas deployment capability and readiness,
in order to deal with new threats such as international
terrorism and the proliferation of WMDs.
Against the backdrop of the fatigue of its military
organizations due to prolonged operations particularly
in Afghanistan, and the pressure to reduce its defense
budget[22] due to the deteriorating f nancial situation, the
Cameron administration, formed in May 2010, released the
National Security Strategy (NSS) and the Strategic Defence
and Security Review (SDSR)[23] in October 2010 under the
newly established National Security Council (NSC)[24].
The NSS evaluated the full range of potential risks,
which might materialize over a 5 to 20-year horizon,
from the perspective of their probability and impact; and


20 These are called Petersberg tasks. They consist of: 1) humanitarian assistance and rescue operations; 2) peacekeeping mission; and 3) tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including
peacemaking.

21 To tackle piracy in this area, the EU has undertaken “European Union Training Mission to Somalia” and “Regional Maritime Capacity Building Mission for the Horn of Africa and the Western Indian
Ocean” in addition to “Operation Atalanta.” Based on a comprehensive approach, the EU not only implements piracy countermeasures, but is also working to develop and strengthen its coastal policing
and judicial system capabilities.

22 “Spending Review 2010,” published by the Treasury Department in October 2010 following the NSS and SDSR, plans to reduce the defense budget by 8% in real terms by 2014-2015, including
saving at least 4.3 billion pounds for the country’s non-frontline activities costs, except for what is required for operations in Afghanistan.

23 The Cameron administration leveraged the new NSS to analyze the strategic background surrounding the United Kingdom and to define the strategic objectives of the country. In the SDSR, it defined
policies and measures required to achieve the goals specified by the NSS, so that the comprehensive national strategy related to defense and security could be formed. It also stipulates that a new
NSS and SDSR are to be produced and published every five years, based on periodical readjustments to be done by the NSC.

24 The NSC is chaired by the Prime Minister and attended by major ministers related to national security and, if required, by the Chief of the Defense Staff, heads of intelligence agencies, and other
senior officials. The newly-created National Security Adviser (NSA) coordinates the whole proceedings. The NSC will be responsible for coordinating responses to dangers the United Kingdom faces by
integrating at the highest level the work of the foreign, defense, energy, and international development departments, and all other arms of government contributing to national security; and proposing
high-level strategic guidelines to the departments involved.

25 Analyzing the strategic background in this way, the existing NSS defined two strategic objectives comprising: (1) ensuring a secure and resilient United Kingdom; and (2) shaping a stable world. In
addition, it specified eight National Security Tasks, including tackling the root causes of instability and working in cooperation with alliances and partnerships as required.

26 The SDSR has decided to reduce the Royal Navy, the Army, and the Royal Air Force personnel by 5,000, 7,000, and 5,000, respectively, by 2015. It also plans to reduce the holdings of main tanks
by 40%, among other items. According to Military Balance 2011 and 2015, the U.K. has gone ahead with the reductions, including the reduction of the Royal Navy, the Army, and the Royal Air Force

Since September 2014, the United Kingdom has

carries out ISR activities using unmanned aerial vehicles,
provides education and training to forces engaged in ground

important instrument of the strategic partnership between
the two sides of the Atlantic; and (3) a common framework
for military action in dealing with threats and crisis. On the
other hand, with regard to the EU, the White Paper clearly
stipulated France’s leadership role in strengthening defense
and security capabilities, and aimed to drive forward the
CSDP in a practical and realistic manner. Moreover, against
the background of f nancial constraints, the White Paper
stipulated that, in addition to the cuts announced previously,
the government would cut military jobs by 2019[29] and
achieve cost reductions via multilateral cooperation. In
December 2013, the Parliament enacted the 2014-2019
Military Programming Law, in order to implement plans
laid out in the White Paper for realizing a national security
strategy for the next 15 years. This law stipulated a larger
budget for equipment, the maintenance of defense industry
capabilities, among other items.
France has conducted airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq
since September 2014. Following the acts of terrorism in
France, it deployed aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle to
the Persian Gulf to enhance its posture in February 2015.
In addition, France provides education and training to the
Iraqi Security Forces and Peshmerga, as well as extends
humanitarian assistance to refugees, in alignment with the
efforts of the U.S.-led Global Coalition to Counter ISIL.

**2** **France**


Since the end of the Cold War, France has focused on
maintaining independence of its defense policies, while
having led initiatives to enhance the defense structure and
capability in Europe. It has worked on the development
of its military capacity by reducing military personnel
and integrating military bases, dealing with operational
requirements to strengthen its defense capability, as well
as enhancing its intelligence capabilities and modernizing
equipment required in the future.
In the White Paper on Defence and National Security
published in April 2013 for the f rst time in f ve years, it
was laid out that although the country does not face any
direct military threats through direct and clear conventional
war potential, there is growing diversity in the types of
threats it faces as a result of globalization. These include
international terrorism, cyber threats, organized crime,
and the proliferation of WMDs. It continued to position
(1) intelligence, (2) nuclear deterrence, (3) protection,
(4) prevention, and (5) deployment[28] as the f ve key
mechanisms of the national security strategy, and states
that France would use a combination of these mechanisms
to respond to changes in the strategic environment over
the coming 15 years. Regarding France’s foreign relations,
it positioned NATO’s functions as follows: (1) means
of securing collective defense of member states; (2) an


27 In the army reorganization plan “Army 2020,” it is stated that the Army’s Regular personnel would be reduced from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020, while the Reserve personnel would be increased
from 15,000 to 30,000 by 2018.

28 In its White Paper on Defence and National Security released in April 2013, France identifi ed the following regions as priority regions: (1) the periphery of Europe; (2) the Mediterranean basin; (3)
part of Africa (from Saharan Africa to Equatorial Africa); (4) the Persian Gulf; and (5) the Indian Ocean. In these regions, France will maintain independent or multinational operational capabilities. In
Saharan Africa, the French forces are singlehandedly engaged in a particularly large military operation called Operation Barkhane, which has its command center in Chad’s capital city of N’Djamena.

29 The White Paper on Defence and National Security presented that military personnel would be reduced by 24,000. On this basis, the government planned to cut 25,800 military jobs between 2015
and 2019. However, following the acts of terrorism against Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, that same month President Francois Hollande held a Defense Council meeting and decided to scrap the
loss of 7,500 jobs. In May 2015, the Council of Ministers decided on the 2015-2019 military programming proposal whose main components include: (1) the long-term deployment of 7,000 military

promotion of military collaboration standardization and
mutual operability within the NATO and EU framework is
essential, in addition to taking cross-government measures.
The amended Military Law, which was enacted in April
2011, stipulates the suspension of conscription for basic
military service and the reduction of total personnel from
250,000 to 185,000, while it also aims for the sustainable
deployment of military personnel and thereby, enable the
continuous deployment of up to 10,000 personnel.
Work on the next defense white paper, expected
for completion in 2014, has been postponed in order to
re-examine the crisis in Ukraine, the rise of ISIL, and the
equipment procurement of the Bundeswehr. In February
2015, Germany announced that it started working on the
white paper. It is expected to be released in summer 2016.
In Iraq, Germany provides education and training to the
Iraqi Security Forces and Peshmerga, supplies equipment
and ammunition, and extends f nancial assistance for
humanitarian assistance. It also conducts training of
Kurdish troops in Germany.


**3** **Germany**

While Germany has been implementing a large-scale
reduction of its military personnel since the end of the
Cold War, it has been gradually expanding the dispatch
of its federal forces overseas. At the same time, Germany
has advanced the reform of its defense forces to enable
them to execute multiple responsibilities encompassing
conf ict prevention and risk management in the context of
multilateral organizations, including NATO, the EU, and
the United Nations[30].
The Verteidigungspolitischen Richtlinien (VPR)
(Defense Policy Guidelines), formulated in 2011 for the f rst
time in eight years, states that the possibility of attacks on
Germany by conventional forces remains low, and that risks
and threats would come from failed states, international
terrorism, natural disasters, cyberattacks, and proliferation
of WMDs. It then indicates Germany’s active participation
in the prevention and containment of crisis and conf ict,
and takes cross-governmental measures. It also states that


30 Germany decreased its military personnel from more than 500,000 at the time of its reunification to 250,000 by 2010. In July 1994, the Federal Constitutional Court judged that dispatching the
federal forces to international missions implemented under multilateral frameworks such as the United Nations and NATO is constitutional, which has further prompted it to gradually expand the
dispatch of its federal forces to participate in various international operations, including security maintenance and reconstruction activities in the Balkan Peninsula and Afghanistan, and anti-piracy

##### 2


**Section 1 Trends in Regional Confl ict and International Terrorism**
**(With a Focus on the Middle East and Africa)**


**1** **General Situation**


In a global security environment, there is a growing risk that
unrest or a security problem in a single country or region
could immediately develop into a security challenge or
destabilizing factor for the entire international community.
The conf icts occurring in recent years in various
parts of the world are not necessarily of the same nature.
An array of problems is at the root of conf icts, including
ethnicity, religion, territory, and resources. The impacts
of climate change and other global issues have also been
suggested as causes of conf icts[1]. Conf icts can take diverse
forms, from armed conf icts, to the continuation of military
standoffs. Furthermore, human rights violations, refugees,
hunger, poverty, and other consequences of conf icts can
have impacts affecting not only the countries in the conf ict
but also a wider area. In many cases, areas where civil wars
or regional conf icts have created or expanded a governance
vacuum have become a hotbed of the activities of terrorist
organizations. Among them are organizations which
operate across national borders and regions, which continue
to pose imminent security challenges to the international
community. The presence of states with weak governance
has made it diff cult to tackle risks such as the explosive
outbreak and spread of infectious diseases.
In these circumstances, especially in states with
unstable political situations and weak governance, which are
often found in the Middle East and Africa, border control
is inadequate, and the cross-border movement of terrorist
organization members, weapons, as well as narcotics that are
a funding source for terrorist organizations present threats
to the region. Furthermore, this region has seen renewed
f ghting even after a temporary ceasef re is achieved pursuant
to a peace agreement or other arrangements between the
parties in conf ict. The “Arab Spring”[2], which grew into a
full-scale movement in 2011, encouraged transitions to
democratic systems in countries in the Middle East and
North Africa. However, political turmoil associated with


the change in government created clashes between tribes,
religions, and political parties, and these clashes have still
not ended in some countries. The underlying factors are
deemed to include public dissatisfaction, especially among
young people, with economic and social disparities as well
as with high unemployment rates. Furthermore, in developed
countries, such as the United States and European countries,
there has been a rise in young people who sympathize
with the extremism of international terrorist organizations,
including the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)[3] that
has gained strength in Iraq and Syria, against the backdrop
of dissatisfaction towards estrangement from society,
discrimination, poverty, and disparities. In an increasing
number of cases, these people have joined the activities of
international terrorist organizations as f ghters and conduct
“home-grown” and “lone-wolf”[4] terrorism activities in their
countries, which in turn have heightened the risk of terrorism
in developed countries. In countries, such as Mali, Central
African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Congo,
the people’s dissatisfaction with politics and economics
under their weak governance systems as well as clashes over
territories and resources have caused conf icts. The rapid and
vast outbreak of the Ebola virus disease in West Africa in
2014 threatened the stability of the affected countries and
spread the disease to other countries including the West,
shedding light on the seriousness of the risk posed by the
spread of infectious diseases.
It has become increasingly important for the
international community to examine the shape of tailored
international frameworks and involvement measures,
and seek out appropriate responses for addressing these
complicated and diverse destabilizing factors.
The end of the Cold War was accompanied by rising
expectations for peacekeeping efforts, and, as a result, many
U.N. peacekeeping operations (PKOs) were established.
Their missions has recently come to include a wide range


The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) released by the U.S. Department of Defense in March 2014 regards climate change as one of key factors that will shape the future security environment. It
claims that climate change may accelerate instability and conflict by causing water scarcity, sharp increases in food costs, and other effects. In addition, the Summary for Policymakers in the Working
Group II report on impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability of the Fifth Assessment Report which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published in the same month described that
climate change may indirectly increase the risk of conflict by exacerbating poverty and other causes of conflict.

The Arab Spring is a term generally used to refer to the series of democratization movements that were undertaken on a full-fledged basis in Middle Eastern and North African countries starting in early
2011, causing political regime changes in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya. In 2011, Tunisia held National Constituent Assembly elections for creating a new constitution, which was adopted by the assembly
in January 2014. In December, Beji Caid Essebsi took offi ce as President following the election results. Libya held General National Congress elections for the establishment of a new constitution in
July 2012, but its democratization process including formulation of a new constitution still faces a variety of challenges.

ISIL is an outgrowth of Al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI), an Al-Qaeda terrorist organization which was established in 2004 in Iraq.

of activities including those by civilians and police,
encompassing such traditional roles as the monitoring of a
ceasef re or military withdrawal as well as the monitoring
of disarmament, the reform of the security sector, the
monitoring of elections and administrative activities, and
humanitarian assistance (e.g. return of refugees to their
homeland). In this situation, the importance of the roles
related to the protection of civilians and peace-building
increases, leading to activities with greater authorization
granted by Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter[5]. At the same
time U.N. PKO, faces challenges including the availability
of required equipment, the protection of personnel safety,
and the improvement of troop capabilities[6].

See Fig. I-2-1-1 (List of Peacekeeping Operations)

In addition to the U.N. PKO framework, multinational
forces and regional organizations authorized by the
U.N. Security Council engage in conf ict prevention,


peacekeeping, and peace-building. In Africa, such regional
organizations as the African Union (AU)[7] roll out their
activities based on resolutions by the U.N. Security
Council and their activities are sometimes handed over to
U.N. PKO later. The international community also offers
recommendations and training assistance and supplies
equipment from a long-term perspective, prompting African
nations to help themselves so that they can enhance local
governance organizations and improve the capabilities of
their military and security organizations[8]. Furthermore,
the entire international community is undertaking various
efforts in response to the rise of ISIL, including the
adoption of a U.N. Security Council resolution to prevent
the international movement of terrorist f ghters, military
actions such as the United States-led Coalition’s airstrikes
on ISIL, and humanitarian assistance by partner countries
that support the counter-terrorism effort.

hand, opposed military action and asserted that Syria’s
chemical weapons be transferred to the control of
the international community. The Syrian government
accepted Russia’s proposal. In September 2013, following
negotiations between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry
and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov of Russia,
the United States and Russia agreed on a framework
which demanded that the Syrian government declare its
chemical weapons stockpiles as well as accept international
inspections, aimed at the complete destruction of Syria’s
chemical weapons. The Syrian government submitted a list
of its chemical weapons stockpile to the Organisation for
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and took
responses which were set out in the framework, including
accession to the Chemical Weapons Convention. Due
to these responses, military action by the United States
and other countries against the Assad administration was
averted. Pursuant to OPCW decisions and related U.N.
Security Council resolution, international efforts were


**1** **Situation in Syria and Iraq**


**(1) Political Turmoil and Chemical Weapons Issue in Syria**
In Syria, since March 2011, the government has mobilized
military and security forces in multiple cities as a result
of the outbreak of anti-government demonstrations across
the country calling for democratization and the resignation
of President Assad. The clashes between the military and
the opposition parties continue to take place throughout
the country[9].
Under these circumstances, in August 2013, chemical
weapons were used in the suburbs of Syria’s capital city
Damascus, which killed many civilians. Following this
attack, U.S. President Barack Obama who had stated
previously that the use of chemical weapons would cross a
red line, assessed that the Syrian government used chemical
weapons[10]. The President stated he decided that military
action should be taken against the Assad administration,
further heightening military tension. Russia, on the other


5 As of the end of March 2015, 16 U.N. PKOs have been established globally, involving about 107,000 military and police personnel and about 17,000 civilian personnel from 120 countries. Out of
these PKOs, there are 12 operations in the Middle East and Africa. Ten U.N. PKOs are granted robust authority by Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter. (See Fig. I-2-1-1)

6 “A New Partnership Agenda Charting a New Horizon For U.N. Peacekeeping” was published in July 2009 to evaluate major policy and strategic dilemmas faced by U.N. PKOs and discuss solutions
among stakeholders.

7 The world’s largest regional organization comprised of 54 countries and regions in Africa. It was established in July 2002 by reorganizing the Organization of African Unity (OAU) (established in May
1963). Its objectives include achieving the integration and solidarity of African nations and people, accelerating political, economic, and social integration of Africa, and promoting peace, security, and
stability in Africa.

8 For example, organizations such as the United Nations and the European Union are implementing initiatives in countries including Somalia and Mali.

9 According to an announcement by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in August 2014, the clashes in Syria killed more than 191,000 people. Some estimates have said that more than
310,000 people have been killed as of May 2015. Since the start of the Syrian civil war, over 10 million people have become refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs).

made to destroy Syria’s chemical weapons[11]. The work to
destroy the weapons, which was carried out on the U.S.
government’s transport vessel Cape Ray, was completed in
August 2014[12].
However, the United States, the European Union
(EU), and other countries are requesting President Assad
to step down and are imposing successive sanctions against
Syria, including an oil embargo. Although these countries
have expressed support for the Syrian National Coalition
established as an opposition party in November 2012, no
strides have been made in the dialogue between the Syrian
government and the opposition parties.
In January 2014, while the f rst direct peace talks
between the Assad administration and the opposition
parties were held under the mediation of the U.N., the
talks achieved no concrete progress. Although President
Assad won a landslide victory in the June 2014 presidential
election, the United States and European countries have
criticized that the reelection of President Assad interfered
with the settlement of the conf ict. In January 2015, peace
talks on Syria were convened for the f rst time in nearly
one year with the mediation of Russia. However, the Syrian
National Coalition and other groups did not participate, and
the talks merely conf rmed the basic principles and failed
to achieve concrete progress. In May 2015, individual
talks between Staffan de Mistura, U.N. SecretaryGeneral’s Special Envoy for Syria, and relevant countries
commenced in Geneva. While both the Assad government
and the opposition parties are participating to realize a
political settlement to the conf ict, the outcome of the talks
is uncertain.

**(2) The Rise of ISIL**
In Syria, opposition parties that do not join the Syria
National Coalition, ISIL and al-Nusrah Front which is
designated as a terrorist organization due to its relations
with Al-Qaeda, gained strength by making use of the
politically unstable situation. In this context, in April 2013,


ISIL announced unilaterally that it would absorb and merge
with al-Nusrah Front. Following protests from al-Nusrah
Front, the Al-Qaeda core conducted mediation. However,
ISIL did not comply with the mediation, and its relations
with the Al-Qaeda core have deteriorated[13].
Meanwhile, following the withdrawal of U.S. Forces in
December 2011, the security situation in Iraq deteriorated
rapidly against the backdrop of political feuds and
religious confrontations. In January 2014, ISIL, which had
increasingly gained strength from its stronghold in Syria,
seized the unstable situation in Iraq to begin invading areas
in western Iraq, and occupied Fallujah, a city west of the
capital city of Baghdad. In June 2014, ISIL took control of
the second largest city, Mosul, in northern Iraq. Following
this, ISIL’s leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, a self-proclaimed
“caliph”[14], unilaterally declared the establishment of
the “Islamic State” and has called on Islam followers
throughout the world to pledge their allegiance to him.

**(3) The Characteristics of ISIL**
ISIL, unlike traditional terrorist organizations, is said
to be characterized by its substantial funding, powerful
and accomplished military forces, and established
organizational structure[15]. In addition, it is deemed that
ISIL’s membership includes Ba’ath Party members from the
former Iraqi regime as well as former Iraqi military off cers,


11 In November 2013, OPCW decided with respect to Syrian chemical weapons: (1) for unfi lled munitions: destruction on Syrian territory not later than January 31, 2014; (2) for mustard agent and the
key binaries (chemical components) of sarin and VX: removal from Syrian territory not later than December 31, 2013; (3) for other chemicals: removal from Syrian territory not later than February 5,
2014; and (4) for the residual mustard agent in containers previously containing mustard agent: destruction not later than March 1, 2014; among other items. With respect to the schedule for the
destruction of chemical weapons outside Syrian territory, OPCW decided: (1) for mustard agent and the key binaries of sarin and VX: beginning of destruction as soon as possible with destruction not
later than March 31, 2014, and destruction of any resulting reaction mass by a date to be agreed by the Council, based on the Director-General’s recommendation; and (2) for all other chemicals:
beginning of destruction as soon as possible with completion of destruction not later than June 30, 2014; among other items. In February 2015, OPCW announced that the destruction of 98% of
Syria’s declared chemicals was completed.

12 See Part I, Chapter 2, Section 2-2 for the destruction of chemical weapons in Syria

13 On February 2, 2014, Al-Qaeda’s leader Ayman al Zawahiri released a statement on the Internet declaring that Al-Qaeda severed ties with ISIL: “ISIL is not a branch of the Al-Qaeda group...does not
have an organizational relationship with it and (Al-Qaeda) is not the group responsible for their actions.”

14 The term means “successor” in Arabic. After Prophet Muhammad died, the term has been used to refer to those who led the Islamic community. Since then, a number of the heads of hereditary
dynasties, including the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties, utilized this title.

15 According to a U.N. report, ISIL’s estimated revenue from crude oil ranges from US$846,000 to US$1,645,000 per day (approx. 100 to 200 million yen). The report notes that ISIL’s revenue sources
also include unilaterally-imposed levies, including ransom from kidnapping and taxation (U.N. Security Council Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee report [November 14, 2014]). Amid speculations that
revenue from crude oil is becoming no longer a major source of ISIL’s funding due to the Coalition’s airstrikes and fl uctuations in crude oil prices, some have indicated that ISIL has diversifi ed its
revenue sources by increasing the taxes levied on residents and companies in the areas under ISIL’s control. Some also suggest that ISIL earns profi ts from asset management made through its

along with numerous foreign f ghters. Having an adept
public relations strategy[16], about 25,000 people including
3,400 people from the West are said to be participating in
ISIL’s activities[17]. Since launching the invasion of Iraq,
ISIL has: utilized equipment seized from the Iraqi Security
Forces and other forces; has successively taken control of
key cities, oil f eld areas, and military facilities in Iraq and
Syria; and thereby, expanded its area of control.
ISIL gives priority to maintaining the areas under its
control. At the same time, ISIL encourages terrorist attacks
against the West and elsewhere. The risk of terrorist attacks
by ISIL f ghters who have returned to their countries from
conf ict areas, such as Iraq and Syria, is a cause for concern
among the states[18].

**(4) The International Response to ISIL**
In August 2014, ISIL launched an offensive against the
Kurdish Autonomous Region in northern Iraq, and made
advances towards Erbil where the U.S. Consulate and other
facilities are located. Based on this situation, the United
States and other countries[19] began airstrikes on ISIL in order
to protect U.S. citizens in Iraq, among other purposes[20].
In an address on the U.S. strategy for ISIL delivered in
September 2014, President Obama stated that the military
action would be extended to include Syria to degrade and
ultimately destroy ISIL. President Obama announced that


the United States would not only lead a broad coalition to
conduct airstrikes, but also provide military supports to
the Iraqi Security Forces f ghting a ground war and to the
moderate opposition party in Syria.
The Coalition’s military action in Iraq includes
offering education, training, and providing equipment[21],
as well as extending military supports, such as operation
assessments and advice, to the forces f ghting the ground
war, including the Iraqi Security Forces and the Kurdistan
regional government’s military organization known as
Peshmerga. At the same time, in coordination with its
own airstrikes and relevant forces, the Coalition works to
thwart the advancement of ISIL and recapture some of
the strategic areas[22]. However, the Iraqi Security Forces
face problems, such as weak command functions and low
morale[23], as well as shortage of personnel. Without foreign
support, it is said that the Iraqi Security Forces can neither
defend against external threats, nor sustain military action
domestically[24]. In contrast, the Peshmerga has experience
with the Iraq War. The Peshmerga is considered to have
relatively advanced training and a functioning chain of
command, and plays a critical role in the military action
against ISIL. In April 2015, with the support of Shiite
militias and others, the Iraqi Security Forces succeeded
in recapturing Tikrit, a key area that continues onto
Mosul. However, following the recapture, backlash from
local Sunnis has increased following the forage and
plundering by Shiite militias, signaling sectarian struggle.
Furthermore, ever since ISIL seized control of Ramadi
in western Iraq in May 2015, the United States has been
forced to review its strategy of prioritizing the recapture
of Mosul. In this regard, the Coalition and Iraqi forces
conduct seesaw offense and defense.
As regards the military action in Syria, in September
2014, the U.S. Forces and the Middle Eastern Coalition
members[25] conducted airstrikes on ISIL in Syria[26]. In
addition, starting on the same month, an intense battle was
raged between Kurdish forces and ISIL over Ayn al-Arab


16 ISIL uses the Internet and social media to recruit young people as fi ghters. According to a U.N. report in May 2015, the international community is called on to cooperate in efforts to address the issue
of women joining terrorist organizations. See Part I, Chapter 2, Section 1, Paragraph 3, “The Spread of International Terrorism.”

17 Munich Security Report 2015 (January 2015)

18 See Part I, Chapter 2, Section 1-3, “The Spread of International Terrorism.”

19 The United States has simultaneously announced airstrikes for humanitarian purposes, namely, to release the minority Yazidi sect who have been subject to ISIL’s persecution. According to the
Combined Joint Task Force, as of May 26, 2015, Coalition forces as a whole have executed over 4,100 airstrikes.

20 In addition to the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Jordan participate in the airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq.

21 In 2014, the United States provided over 1,500 Hellfi re missiles to the Iraqi government. In 2015, the United States provided 250 MRAP (including the distribution to the Kurdish Autonomous Region)
and several tens of thousands of small arms and ammunition, among other assets. In May 2015, the United States decided to provide 2,000 anti-tank rockets.

22 Thus far, the Iraqi forces, Peshmerga, and other forces have recaptured the following strategic areas from ISIL. In Iraq, the Mosul dam was recaptured in August 2014, the city Baiji in central Iraq in
November 2014, and Diyala province in central Iraq in January 2015. In Syria, Ayn al-Arab was recaptured in January 2015 and Tikrit in May 2015. In addition, the forces have recaptured 13,00017,000 km2 of the 55,000 km[2] area held by ISIL in Iraq (April 2015 U.S. Central Command announcement).

23 In May 2015, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter responded in an interview with CNN that “the Iraqi forces just showed no will to fi ght,” whereas U.S. Vice President Joe Biden stated that the
Iraqi forces have made “enormous sacrifi ce and (shown) bravery.”

24 U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, “Worldwide Threat Assessment 2015” (January 2015)

25 In the military action against ISIL, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Jordan conduct airstrikes in Syria, and Qatar provides supports to these countries.

The Reality of ISIL’s Governance and the Features
**Commentary**
of the New Terrorist Organization

ISIL continues to push its way in dynamic Way mainly in the Middle East and North Africa and rules a vast territory across Iraq and Syria,
self-proclaiming to be a “Caliphate.” ISIL controls the territory tactically through a carrot-and-stick approach as well as making use of
the opposition against Iraq’s central government and pro-Shiite parties. Under its rule, ISIL has reportedly repaired destroyed roads and
provided services such as electricity and food rations which had not adequately reached the whole population. Meanwhile, ISIL reportedly
keeps the people under strict control, with religious police implementing patrols and crackdowns. Anyone who engages in activities which
go against the religion, whether it be alcohol consumption or smoking, are subject to public execution through brutal methods, such as
gundown and beheading[1]. ISIL’s pre-modern brutal acts, including the restoration of slavery of ethnic minorities in northern Iraq, are
subject to strong condemnation from many Islamic scholars and religious authorities.
The international community recognizes ISIL’s capability to send out messages using the Internet as major threat. In the past,
AQAP[2] has disclosed bomb-making instructions in its magazine and has called on its followers to stage terrorist attacks in the West and
elsewhere. ISIL has made gains by sending out messages skillfully on social media using hash tags, along with circulating high-quality
videos that make use of digital technology and music, for advertising the organization, recruiting fi ghters, and encouraging terrorism.
Further still, ISIL undertakes a global marketing campaign, such as translating its messages into multiple languages and distributing its
magazine (DABIQ) on the Internet.
ISIL’s methods of terror attack can also be distinguished from other groups’. Past terrorist organizations have primarily used suicide
bombings and improvised explosive devices to attack shopping centers or other such facilities where there is minimum security and
civilians are gathered. ISIL, on the other hand, has a membership that includes many military offi cers from the former Hussein regime. This
is said to have enabled ISIL to stage systematic combat operations using heavy equipment like tanks that were seized from the Iraqi and
other forces. Contrary to past international terrorist organizations, ISIL, which has at their disposal, powerful military capability, abundant
fi nancing, tactical governance, and ability to manipulate the media, has taken control of vast territory and attracted many foreign fi ghters.
ISIL is indeed a new type of international terrorist organization.

(Kurdish name: Kobani), a city in northern Syria close
to the border with southern Turkey[27]. As a result of the
Coalition’s airstrikes and the Kurdish forces’ ground war,
Kurdish groups eliminated ISIL groups from Ayn al-Arab
in January 2015. However, in 2015, ISIL has closed in on
the nerve center of the Assad administration, occupying
a part of a Palestinian refugee camp in the capital city,
Damascus. In May 2015, ISIL took control of Palmyra in
central Syria. ISIL thus continues to gain strength in Syria.
Moderate opposition parties such as the Free Syrian Army
that are expected to engage in the ground war in Syria have
just started taking the Coalition’s training, and more time is


deemed necessary to make full-scale advances to recapture
the strategic areas.
ISIL has also been gaining strength in countries
other than Iraq and Syria[28]. Among these countries, in
Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt[29], and Libya[30], ISIL is deemed
to be working to establish bases mostly in areas where there
is insuff cient national governance, coordinating with local
terrorist organizations[31].
The announced outcomes of the Coalition’s military
action against ISIL led by the United States include the
fragmentation of ISIL’s command and control functions,
decline of morale of the organization’s members, decrease


27 In response to ISIL’s attacks, Peshmerga, the military organization of the Kurdistan regional government, arrived in Ayn al-Arab via Turkey. In addition, forces opposed to the Syrian regime, such as the
Free Syrian Army, reportedly participated in the operation against ISIL in Ayn al-Arab.

28 For example, in January 2015, ISIL announced that armed groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan swore allegiance to ISIL and that it would name this region ISIL Khorasan Province.

29 In Egypt, Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis operates actively in the Sinai Peninsula. See Part I, Chapter 2, Section 1-2-6 “Situation in Egypt.”

in crude oil revenues, and the deaths of many f ghters
including commanders. In this regard, the military action
is deemed to have prevented ISIL’s further advances and
made strides in recapturing some of the strategic areas.
However, the Iraqi Security Forces and the moderate
opposition parties that are f ghting the ground war have
inadequate capacity, both in quality and quantity, and
require long-term training. Without the mobilization
of large-scale ground war assets by the United States
and other countries, analysts note that the operation
could become protracted. In the United States, there
are estimates that at least three years will be needed to
ultimately eliminate ISIL from Iraq and Syria. The future
outlook related to ISIL hence remains uncertain[32].


as the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) for the support
mission in Afghanistan led by NATO forces in 2015 and
beyond. In November, the agreements were approved at both
the upper and lower houses of Afghanistan’s parliament.
In December 2014, ISAF’s combat mission had
been completed. In January 2015, the Resolute Support
Mission (RSM)[35] was launched, which primarily provides
education, training, and advice under the leadership of
NATO. Approximately 13,000 personnel participate in the
mission. The RSM, based in Kabul, carries out activities
in f ve locations in Afghanistan[36]. Additionally, the U.S.
Forces, while providing training to Afghan forces as
a member of NATO, implements Operation Freedom
Sentinel (OFS). In May 2014, U.S. President Obama
announced that the U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan
would be reduced to about 9,800 personnel by early 2015,
and that all troops would ultimately be withdrawn except
the security assistance component of the U.S. embassy
by the end of 2016. However, in December 2014, thenSecretary of Defense Hagel revised the initial plan, stating
that an additional 1,000 personnel or 10,800 personnel of
the U.S. Forces would be deployed in Afghanistan from the
start of 2015, due to delays in the deployment of troops
by NATO member states. Secretary Hagel announced
that there was no change to the future withdrawal plan. In
March 2015, President Ghani visited the United States. The
Joint Statement of President Ghani and President Obama
presented that based on Afghanistan’s request, the United
States would maintain its posture of 9,800 troops through
the end of 2015, retracting the initial plan to halve the U.S.
troop strength in the end of 2015.
With regard to the international community’s support
for Afghanistan, at the NATO Chicago Summit held in May
2012, commitment to Afghan security beyond the end of
2014 was reaff rmed. In addition, at the Tokyo Conference
on Afghanistan in July 2012, the international community,
including Japan, announced the provision of over US$16
billion in f nancial aid. Moreover, countries such as the
United States, the United Kingdom, and France concluded
a Strategic Partnership Agreement with Afghanistan[37],
which called for continued support beyond 2014.
The responsibilities for security in Afghanistan
have been transferred sequentially from ISAF to ANDSF
since 2011. Since January 2015, ANDSF has assumed
full responsibility for security in Afghanistan. Despite


**2** **Situation in Afghanistan**


In Afghanistan, following the so-called 9.11 terrorist
attacks in the United States, Operation Enduring Freedom
(OEF) that the U.S. Forces launched in November 2001
has been engaged in the mop-up operation of the Taliban
and other groups. Furthermore, the International Security
Assistance Force (ISAF) and the Afghan National Defense
and Security Forces (ANDSF) have conducted security
duties. Nevertheless, the security situation in many parts
of Afghanistan continues to warrant close attention. In
November 2014, a suicide bombing in the capital city of
Kabul caused damage to a U.K. embassy vehicle, killing or
injuring three people. The security situation in the eastern,
southern, and southwestern areas of Afghanistan which
border Pakistan also remains a cause for concern.
Although the Taliban’s attack capability is diminishing
because of the activities of the ISAF and ANDSF, the group
is presumed to have maintained capabilities for intermittent
attacks on city areas, while securing safe havens in
northwest Pakistan and other areas, and conduct terrorism
activities in Afghanistan astride the borders[33].
In September 2014, the Ghani administration was
inaugurated based on the results of the presidential elections
in Afghanistan in April and June 2014. Subsequently, the
agreements that the previous Karzai administration had
continued to postpone were signed, namely, the Bilateral
Security Agreement (BSA) between the United States and
Afghanistan, which sets forth the legal framework of the

32 U.S. Secretary of State Kerry underscored the achievements of the airstrikes, saying, “We are taking out Daesh’s fi ghters in the thousands thus far – single digits, but thousands. Their commanders –
50% of the top command has been eliminated. Hundreds of vehicles and tanks, which they captured, have been destroyed. Nearly 200 oil and gas facilities that they were using have been eliminated...
as well as more than a thousand fi ghting positions, checkpoints, building, barracks” (January 22, 2015, Press conference by U.S. State Secretary Kerry). U.S. Secretary of Defense Carter stated that
the United States cannot commit to completing the military action against ISIL in three years (March 11, 2015, U.S. Defense Secretary Carter’s testimony to the Senate).

the challenges raised with regard to the capabilities of
ANDSF, it is assessed to have some capacity to maintain
security in terms of establishing operational plans and
suppressing armed groups, as evidenced from the absence
of large-scale terrorist attacks and other events during the
presidential election in June 2014. In August 2014, the
Ministry of Defense established a new national military
strategy. The strategy def ned such priority goals as the
organizational strengthening of the Defense Ministry and
the national forces, and the increased professionalism of
the forces. In addition, to improve the literacy rate, which
has posed as a challenge, efforts are under way including
the implementation of various curriculums.
Afghanistan faces not only security problems but
also a plethora of challenges related to reconstruction,
including preventing corruption, enhancing the rule of
law, strengthening the crackdown on narcotics traff cking,
and promoting regional development. Ensuring peace
and stability in Afghanistan is a common challenge of
the international community, which requires continuing
engagement with the country.


at the strong urging of the United States. Nevertheless,
the peace talks had to be discontinued in March to April
2014 owing to various developments, including Israel’s
suspension of the release of Palestinian prisoners,
Palestine’s international treaty accession applications, and
the agreement reached between the PLO dominated by
the Fatah[39] and the Islamic fundamentalist organization
Hamas that has effective rule over Palestine and the Gaza
Strip[40] to form a national unity cabinet. In this context, in
June to July 2014, murders of Israeli and Palestinian boys
took place, heightening the tension on both sides. In July
2014, rockets were f red at Israeli territory from the Gaza
Strip intermittently. In response to the outbreak of clashes
on both sides, in August 2014, Israeli forces launched a
ground operation. These clashes are thought to have killed
at least 2,133 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip[41]. In the same
month, the two sides accepted Egypt’s request and agreed
to a ceasef re[42].
Meanwhile, in Europe, national parliaments have
begun to call for the recognition of a Palestinian state
since October 2014[43]. Furthermore, in January 2015, the
International Criminal Court (ICC)[44] released a statement
saying that upon the acceptance of Palestine’s application
to accede to the ICC in the same month, it opened a
preliminary examination into whether or not Palestine
conducted war crimes[45]. Israel has protested such moves by
the international community.
Israel has yet to sign peace treaties with Syria and
Lebanon. Israel and Syria disagree on the return of the
Golan Heights which Israel has occupied since the 1967
Arab-Israel War. The United Nations Disengagement
Observer Force (UNDOF) has been deployed in the
Golan Heights region to observe the implementation of
the ceasef re and military disengagement between the
two parties[46]. Concerning Israel and Lebanon, the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) increased
its presence following the 2006 clash between Israel and
Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim organization.


**3** **Situation of the Middle East Peace Efforts**


In the Middle East, there have been wars between Israel
and Arab countries four times since the foundation of Israel
in 1948. Between Israel and Palestine, the Oslo Agreement
concluded in 1993 marked the beginning of a peace process
through comprehensive negotiations. In 2003, the Israelis
and the Palestinians agreed on a “Roadmap” that laid out a
course leading to the establishment of a Middle East peace
initiative based on the principle of the peaceful coexistence
between the two nations. However, the Roadmap has yet
to be implemented. Subsequently, large-scale f ghting
occurred twice through 2012[38]. In both cases, a ceasef re
agreement was reached through the mediation of Egypt and
other parties.
In July 2013, Middle East peace talks between Israel
and Palestine resumed for the f rst time in nearly three years


38 Following rocket attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces launched a large-scale military action from the end of 2008 to early 2009 that included airstrikes on the Gaza Strip and the
mobilization of ground forces. In November 2012, Israeli forces again conducted airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

39 In these peace talks, Hamas, the dominant faction, conducted negotiations with Israel.

40 Hamas does not recognize Israel.

41 According to the U.N. Offi ce for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs report (August 2014).

42 The main components of the ceasefi re agreement are: (1) Opening of the crossings between the Gaza Strip and Israel; (2) Speedy entry of humanitarian assistance supplies, relief supplies, and
supplies necessary for reconstruction; (3) Fishing permissions from six nautical miles; and (4) Indirect negotiations between the two parties over other topics (e.g., construction of an airport and
seaport in the Gaza Strip, disarmament of Hamas) in one month’s time after ceasefi re is ensured. However, the consultations in (4) have remained at a standstill.

43 In Sweden, the United Kingdom, France, and Spain, actions were taken, such as the adoption of resolutions seeking the recognition of a Palestinian state.

44 The International Criminal Court is the fi rst permanent international criminal judicial body in history to prosecute and punish, based on international law, individuals who committed the most serious
crimes of concern to the whole international community (genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes of aggression).

45 In the preliminary examination, the ICC collects evidence on war crimes, conducts hearings with relevant stakeholders of both parties, among other activities. No deadlines for the preliminary
examination are provided in the ICC Rome Statute.

maintenance capabilities of the Libyan government as well
as to dispatch a military advisory team[51]. In December
2014, the U.S. Africa Command noted that an ISIL training
camp exists in eastern Libya and revealed that the U.S.
Forces were monitoring the camp. In January 2015, an
armed group thought to be aff liated with ISIL[52] attacked
an upscale hotel in the capital city of Tripoli, killing at least
13 people. In February 2015, an extremist organization
that has sworn allegiance to ISIL posted a video on the
Internet of what is believed to be the murder of 21 Egyptian
Coptic Christians. As a retaliatory measure, the Egyptian
government conducted airstrikes together with the Libyan
government. Amid this situation, many refugees from
North Africa including Libya have landed in Europe on
smugglers’ boats. Some have suggested that ISIL f ghters
have slipped in among these refugees. European countries
are thus faced with numerous issues, including the issue
of accepting many refugees, preventing the entry of ISIL
f ghters, cracking down on migrant smuggling boats, and
providing relief to passengers on migrant smuggling boats
that have capsized in the Mediterranean Sea.


**4** **Situation in Libya**

The anti-government demonstrations that erupted in
February 2011 spread nationwide, leading the Gaddaf
regime to crush the demonstrations by force. That same
month, the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution on
sanctions against Libya that included a total arms embargo[47],
and in March 2011, a resolution allowing for an array of
measures to establish a no-f y zone and to protect civilians[48].
Following the resolutions, a multinational force led by the
United States, United Kingdom, and France commenced
military action. In October 2011, the National Transitional
Council consisting of anti-Gaddaf forces announced the
death of Colonel Gaddaf and declared the liberation of all
of Libya. In July 2012, elections for a General National
Congress were held. However, progress has not been made
in the rehabilitation of the military and public security[49].
Militia and tribal leaders exert strong inf uence[50], and
while receiving their support, secular and Islamic groups
struggle for power. In March 2014, a no-conf dence motion
was passed against Prime Minister Zeidan. In June 2014,
elections for the Council of Representatives were held.
Nonetheless, confrontation between Islamic and secular
groups intensif ed. Consequently, Libya has become
fragmented with two assemblies existing in parallel – the
Islamic groups’ General National Congress based in the
capital city of Tripoli and the secular groups’ Council of
Representatives based in Tobruk in eastern Libya which has
the support of the United States and other countries.
Under these politically unstable circumstances,
Islamic extremist groups are said to be gaining strength
in Libya. In September 2012, an Islamic extremist group
attacked the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, killing four
Americans, including the Ambassador. In January 2014,
the U.S. Department of State designated Ansar al-Sharia,
an offshoot of Al-Qaeda that is deemed to have been
involved in this incident, as a terrorist organization. The
United States and NATO have announced their intentions
to provide military training to increase the security


**5** **Situation in Yemen**


Starting in February 2011, anti-government demonstrations
calling for the resignation of the long-time ruler President
Ali Abdullah Saleh gained traction in Yemen. In April
2011, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)[53] brokered
the GCC Initiative[54]. President Saleh signed the Initiative
in November 2011 in the face of increasing pressure from
the international community, including the United Nations.
Vice President Abdo Rabbo Mansour Hadi was elected
President following a presidential election in February
2012, and the transition of power was conducted peacefully.
President Hadi implemented the national dialogue
process. Nevertheless, from August 2014, demonstrations
led by the opposition insurgent group the Houthis[55]
occurred in the capital city of Sana’a[56]. The Houthis,
based in northern Yemen, have long and repeatedly clashed

49 According to The Military Balance 2011 and 2014, the troop strength has decreased from 76,000 before the Arab Spring to 7,000 as of 2014.

50 In the eastern coastal area, a militia organization seeking to expand autonomous rule occupied oil-related facilities for nearly a year (nine months).

51 In October 2013, NATO Secretary General Rasmussen announced the dispatch of a military advisory team to Libya. In November 2013, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that it would provide
training for 5,000-8,000 Libyan personnel in Bulgaria.

52 The ISIL branch in Tripoli issued a statement claiming responsibility for this incident.

53 The GCC was established in 1981 by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait. Headquartered in Saudi Arabia’s capital city of Riyadh, the GCC aims to effect
coordination, integration, and cooperation between the member states in all fi elds, including defense and economy.

54 The Initiative included clauses which provided that immunity would be granted to the President in exchange for the expeditious transfer of power to the Vice President.

55 The Houthis are followers of the Zaydi branch of Shiite Islam and are based in Saada governorate in northern Yemen. In 2004, the Houthis staged an armed uprising as an anti-government group,
and an armed confl ict broke out with the Yemeni military.

56 In 2007, the Southern Movement was formed to assert secession from the north. After President Saleh resigned as a consequence of the Arab Spring, the Movement has taken an anti-government

with the government over rising fuel prices. Initially, the
demonstrations remained peaceful. However, in September
2014, clashes broke out between the Houthi militia and
Yemeni public security forces, and this led to the Houthis’
occupation of key government buildings in the city.
Following the armed conf ict that occurred in January
2015, President Hadi and others submitted their letters of
resignation, and the situation intensif ed further. In February
2015, the Houthis forced the dissolution of the parliament
and announced the establishment of a transitional
national council and a presidential council. Based on the
circumstances, countries, especially Western nations,
began to close their embassies, citing the deterioration of
the security situation as the reason[57]. Later, President Hadi
withdrew his resignation and based his government in Aden
in southern Yemen. Meanwhile, the Houthis advanced
into the Red Sea’s coastal areas and key cities between
the capital city of Sana’a and Aden. The Houthis seized a
military base in Taiz and invaded Aden city. In response to
this situation, President Hadi’s faction requested the support
of Arab countries. Then, in March 2015, a Saudi Arabianled coalition launched airstrikes against the Houthis – the
so-called “Operation Decisive Storm.” Saudi Arabia claims
that this operation conducted airstrikes against the bases
of the Houthis and the Yemeni military that support the
Houthis, as well as destroyed ballistic missiles and other
assets. Nonetheless, there were casualties including civilian
casualties in Yemen and near the Saudi Arabian border,
allegedly attributed to their involvement in the exchange
of rocket f re and airstrikes, prompting the international
community to express strong concerns to both parties. In
April 2015, “Operation Renewal of Hope” was launched
with the aim of setting the conf ict through political
dialogue. In addition, the U.N. Security Council adopted
Resolution 2216, which set forth provisions on the Houthis’
withdrawal from the government institutions they occupied
and return of the weapons of the Yemeni military, as well
as an arms embargo and asset freezes, in an effort to bring
the situation to a close. Nevertheless, Saudi Arabia and
other countries, which have been attacked by the Houthis,
have continued to conduct airstrikes against the Houthis.


Although a f ve-day ceasef re was implemented for
humanitarian assistance purposes in May 2015, airstrikes
have continued following the end of the ceasef re. In that
same month, peace talks were scheduled to be held with the
participation of all parties but were postponed, citing lack
of preparation as the reason.
At the same time, Yemen is also the base of operations
of international terrorist organizations. In October 2010,
explosives were discovered in multiple air cargoes that
were headed for the United States. It was revealed that these
cargoes had been shipped from Yemen. These incidents are
deemed to have been perpetrated mainly by Al-Qaida in
the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) based in southern Yemen.
AQAP is considered to have been involved also in the
terrorism incidents in January 2015, including the assault
on the head off ce of a French weekly newspaper over
the caricature of Prophet Muhammad. In February 2015,
Islamic extremists reportedly overran a Yemeni military
base, amid the unstable political situation caused by the
Houthis’ seizure of power. While the United States has
launched a mop-up operation using drones against these
international terrorist organizations that are operating in
Yemen, it is feared that AQAP and other organizations
would further gain in strength due to the declining presence
of the United States in Yemen[58].


**6** **Situation in Egypt**


In January 2011, democratization movements triggered
by “the Arab Spring”[59] spread to Egypt, where large-scale
anti-government demonstrations occurred and President
Mubarak, who had controlled the country as a despotic
leader for 30 years, resigned. Mr. Mursi from the Muslim
Brotherhood[60], was elected as the new president through
the presidential election in June 2012, but large-scale
demonstrations demanding resignation of President Mursi
occurred in June 2013 due to an economic impasse and the
chasm between Islamic groups and liberal, secular groups,
which resulted in a large number of victims from clashes
between some demonstrators and groups supporting the
President. While this sort of disorder spread in the country,


57 At least ten countries including Japan have temporarily closed their embassies and evacuated their embassy personnel (further closures are possible).

58 The United States has temporarily closed its embassy in Yemen based on the unstable public security situation in Sana’a. In addition, the United States has withdrawn its personnel from Al Anad Air Base.

the national forces intervened in July 2013 and dismissed
President Mursi, establishing a provisional government by
temporarily setting the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
as President. In May 2014, a presidential election was
held in line with the roadmap drafted by the provisional
government, which addresses the comprehensive
democratization process for national reconciliation, and
former Defense Minister Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi was elected.
As the democratically-elected Egyptian administration
collapsed through the intervention of national forces, the
United States prompted the provisional government to
proceed further with democratization initiatives by freezing
some military assistance to Egypt in October 2013.
Meanwhile, in the Sinai Peninsula, terrorist attacks by
Islamic extremist groups have been a cause for concern.
Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis[61], which is said to have pledged
allegiance to ISIL, has staged attacks against the Egyptian
government, leading the Egyptian military forces to carry
out operations to gain control of the area.


assisted by the mediation of the international community
including the AU. The two countries signed a series of
agreements regarding security measures in the border area,
oil production, and other issues in September 2012 as well
as a document specifying an agreement implementation
schedule in March 2013.
The President of South Sudan dismissed the Vice
President in July 2013, bringing to the surface a political
conf ict between the two groups. In December of the same
year, f ghting broke out among the President’s security
forces in the capital city of Juba, which evolved into
clashes between the pro-President faction (government)
and pro-Vice President faction (anti-government group).
Subsequently, following an outbreak of clashes between
the South Sudanese government and the anti-government
group, f ghting and violent acts targeting specif c ethnic
groups spread to different areas, resulting in a large number
of casualties, refugees, and internally displaced persons
(IDPs). Under these circumstances, on December 24,
the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 2132
and decided to enhance the UNMISS by increasing the
maximum military personnel by 5,500. In addition,
the “Intergovernmental Authority on Development”
(IGAD)[65] assisted by the U.N. and the AU initiated efforts
to start dialogues among South Sudanese leaders and
enable reconciliation. The IGAD helped both parties to
sign an agreement in Ethiopia in January 2014 on ceasing
hostile activities in South Sudan. Even now, the IGAD
continues to conduct mediation to establish a unif ed
transitional government[66]. Furthermore, in May 2014, the
U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 2155, which
stipulated that the mandate of the UNMISS would be
restricted to the four areas of the protection of civilians,
monitoring and investigating human rights, creating
the conditions for delivery of humanitarian assistance,
and supporting the implementation of the Cessation of
Hostilities Agreement. In May 2015, the U.N. Security
Council adopted Resolution 2223 that extended the
mandate of the UNMISS by six months.
Since around 2003, the Darfur region in the west of
Sudan has experienced heightened conf icts between the


**7** **Situation in Sudan and South Sudan**


The North-South civil war that continued since 1983
between the government of Sudan, composed of Arab
Muslims in the north, and the anti-government group,
composed of African Christians in the south, concluded with
the establishment of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement
(CPA) in 2005 under the mediation of neighboring countries,
the United States, and others. As a result of a referendum in
accordance with the rules of the CPA in January 2011, the
Republic of South Sudan gained independence on July 9,
2011. On the same day, the United Nations Mission in the
Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS) was established based
on Resolution 1996 adopted by the U.N. Security Council
in order to support the establishment of an environment
contributing to maintaining peace and stability and helping
South Sudan to develop further[62]. After the independence
of this state, negotiations between Sudan and South Sudan
have been going on regarding issues, which include the
def nition of the national border (e.g. the treatment of the
Abyei area[63]) and the prof t allocation of oil production[64],


61 An Islamic extremist organization based in the Sinai Peninsula that aims to overthrow Israel. It is deemed that the organization intensifi ed its terrorism activities targeting Egyptian security authorities
following the collapse of the Morsi government in July 2013.

62 The initial mandate period was one year with up to 7,000 military personnel and up to 900 police personnel. Specifically, the mandate of UNMISS is as follows: (1) support for peace consolidation and
thereby fostering long-term state building and economic development; (2) support the government of the Republic of South Sudan in exercising its responsibilities for conflict prevention, mitigation,
and resolution and protect civilians; and (3) support the government of the Republic of South Sudan in developing its capacity to provide security, to establish rule of law, and to strengthen the security
and justice sectors.

63 The Abyei area was one of the bloodiest battlefields during the North-South civil war. Both the North and the South claim sovereignty over the area due to its abundant oil resources. Whether the area
belongs to the North or the South remains uncertain, as a referendum that will settle the territorial issue has not yet been held. In May 2011, immediately before the independence of South Sudan,
a battle began between the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA), which was a major military organization in southern Sudan. In June 2011, the Security Council
established under its Resolution 1990 the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) in the region.

64 A vast majority of oil wells are located in South Sudan, while most pipelines and ports for export are located in Sudan.

who are active off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf
of Aden. The international community is implementing a
series of initiatives to enhance the security capabilities of
Somalia based on the perception that instability of Somalia
triggers the piracy issues[70].
Somalia saw the end of transitional governance period
of the TFG as of August 2012 and convened a new federal
assembly. A new president was elected in September 2012
and a new cabinet was formed in November 2012. This
newly-integrated government established for the f rst time
in 21 years aims to stabilize the situation in the country.


**8** **Situation in Somalia**


**9** **Situation in Mali**


Somalia has been in a state of anarchy since its government
collapsed in 1991[67]. In 2005, the “Transitional Federal
Government” (TFG) was established based on the mediation
of neighboring countries, but f ghting was escalated with
such groups as the “Union of Islamic Courts” (UIC) denying
this framework. In 2006, Ethiopian forces intervened with
assistance from the United States and drove away the UIC. In
2007, the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM)[68]
was established based on the approval of United Nations.
On the other hand, Al-Qaeda-related extremist insurgents
derived from the UIC, “Al-Shabaab”[69], gained strength in
the central and southern parts of the country and resisted
the TFG. In response to this, neighboring countries
dispatched troops to the AMISOM and other organizations
and seized Kismayo, a major stronghold of Al-Shabaab,
in October 2012. In August 2014, AMISOM launched
Operation Indian Ocean and succeeded in recapturing some
of the cities in the central and southern areas which had
served as the bases of Al-Shabaab. In the following month,
Al-Shabaab‘s leader Godane was killed by the attacks of
the U.S. Forces. Meanwhile, Al-Shabaab frequently stages
terrorist attacks against AMISOM’s member states. In
particular, cross-border terrorist attacks against Kenya have
increased since 2014.
In addition, Somalia, especially the northeastern part


In Mali, an anti-government Tuareg[71] insurgent group,
the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad
(MNLA), triggered a riot in January 2012, joined by other
groups including “Ansar Dine”[72], an Islamic extremist
group. The MNLA conquered northern cities and declared
the independence of the northern region in April 2012.
Subsequently, Islamic extremist groups including Ansar
Dine that expelled the MNLA, “Movement for Unity and
Jihad in West Africa” (MUJAO), and “Al-Qaeda in the
Islamic Maghreb” (AQIM), governed the country based on
the sharia law, aggravating the humanitarian and security
situations in northern Mali.
In response to this situation, in December 2012,
the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 2085 and
approved the deployment of the African-led International
Support Mission to Mali (AFISMA)[73], whose tasks included
revitalizing the capabilities of Malian troops and security
organizations and helping Malian authorities. In January
2013, France dispatched its troops to the country based on a
request from the Malian provisional government following
the invasion of central and southern regions by terrorists
including Ansar Dine. Subsequently, the Malian provisional
government recaptured its major cities in the northern part
of the country, assisted by the deployment of AFISMA. In
April 2013, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution


67 “Somaliland” located in the Northwest declared its independence in 1991. “Puntland” located in the Northeast declared the establishment of an autonomous government in 1998.

Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali
(MINUSMA)[74], whose tasks include the stabilization
of densely-populated areas and the reconstruction of
national capabilities throughout Mali. Based on this
resolution, MINUSMA, which had its authority delegated
by AFISMA, became operational in July 2013. With the
support of MINUSMA, a presidential election was held in
a peaceful manner, and a new government was established
in September of the same year[75].
Later, large-scale clashes broke out between Malian
troops and MNLA in May 2014. However, in the same
month, a ceasef re agreement was established between the
two parties with the mediation of the AU. In July 2014,
with the mediation of the U.N., Algeria and other parties,
peace talks commenced between the Malian government
and the Tuareg insurgent group, including MNLA. Their
talks over the autonomy of the northern area are ongoing.
Nonetheless, with the Malian government losing most of
its governance over the northern area of Mali, AQIM and
other groups have conducted intermittent attacks against
MINUSMA units and the situation in the region has
destabilized.
In August 2014, French troops integrated and
reorganized its units in Mali, Chad, and Niger in order
to deal effectively with the expanding threat of terrorism
across the whole Sahel region, including Mali[76], and
launched Operation Barkhane covering the entire region.
French troops are currently working with MINUSMA and
the troops of the countries in the region to stabilize the
Sahel region, including northern Mali[77].


on their dissatisfaction over the execution status of an
agreement signed in 2008 with the government. In January
2013, the Economic Community of Central African States
(ECCAS)[79] and other organizations helped the Central
African Republic government and Seleka to reach a peace
agreement. However, Seleka recommenced their attacks
in March 2013 based on its assertion that the government
failed in conforming to the agreement, and conquered the
capital city of Bangui. Subsequently, the country’s security
and humanitarian situations were rapidly aggravated, as
murders and looting of citizens by multiple insurgent
groups, including Seleka and “Anti-balaka,” a mostly
Christian vigilante group established to counter Seleka,
became widespread. In July 2014, a ceasef re agreement
was concluded between Seleka and Anti-balaka. However,
the interim government has limited inf uence, and the
situation in the country remains unstable with clashes
continuing between Seleka and Anti-balaka.
Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council adopted
Resolution 2127 in December 2013 and approved the
dispatch of the African-led International Support Mission
to the Central African Republic (MISCA) led by the AU and
the enhancement of French troops supporting this mission.
This resolution also requested the authority of the Mission
for the consolidation of peace in Central African Republic
(MICOPAX), a mission implemented in the country by the
leadership of the ECCAS, to be transferred to the MISCA,
and suggested that the MISCA would eventually shift to
a U.N. PKO. In April 2014, the U.N. Security Council
adopted Resolution 2149 and decided to establish the
United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization
Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA),
whose tasks included protecting civilians[80]. In September
2014, MISCA was formally transitioned to MINUSCA.
Moreover, the EU decided to dispatch its security forces
in January 2014, and the forces commenced operations in
April of the same year[81]. Furthermore In January 2015, the
EU decided to dispatch a military advisory mission in the
form of succeeding the activities of the security forces.


**10** **Situation in the Central African Republic**


The Central African Republic has been facing political
turmoil since its independence in 1960, aff icted
by successive military coups and activities by antigovernment insurgents. In December 2012, Seleka[78],
an anti-government Islamic insurgent group, conquered
several cities in the northeastern part of the country, based


74 The initial mandate period of MINUSMA is one year from July 2013. The mission is implemented by a maximum of 11,200 military personnel and a maximum of 1,440 policing personnel. In case
MINUSMA is exposed to imminent danger, based on a request from the U.N. Secretary-General, French forces are given authorization to intervene for the purpose of assisting the mission.

75 In June 2013, the provisional government and MNLA reached an agreement on such issues as allowing the northern area to participate in the presidential election and approving the dispatch of Mali
troops to northern cities.

76 The Sahel region refers to the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. The countries in the Sahel region include Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad.

77 Operation Barkhane consists of a total of around 3,000 personnel. The Operation’s headquarters are in Chad, and it has bases in Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso. The operation is executed through the
swift deployment of units to various areas. In northern Mali, French troops collaborate with MINUSMA units, and in other areas, collaborate with the military forces of the countries in the region. The
Operation mainly conducts mop-ups of terrorists and joint patrol.

78 Seleka means “alliance” in the local language. The organization was created by combining two major anti-government groups and other anti-government groups in December 2012. Its stronghold is
located in the northeastern part of the country where diamond mines are concentrated.

79 The ECCAS was established in December 1981. Its member states are Angola, Gabon, Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, São Tomé and Principé, Equatorial
Guinea, Chad, the Central African Republic, and Burundi.

80 The initial mandate period was set to one year, with the maximum dispatch level set for 10,000 military personnel and 1,800 police personnel.

**3** **Trends in the Spread of International Terrorism**


While the command and control capabilities of Al-Qaeda’s
leadership have been declining, Al-Qaeda’s af¬f liates that
include “Al-Qaeda” in their name have reportedly gained
strength and are perpetrating terrorism from their bases
mainly in North Africa and the Middle East[86].
While being based mainly in the Middle East and
North Africa, organizations which are said to be af¬f liated
with Al-Qaeda and ISIL[87] as well as other Islamic
extremist groups are thought to have the capability to cross
insuf¬f ciently-controlled national borders and to conduct
terrorist attacks even in the areas outside of the countries
where they have bases of activity. The organizations have
allegedly acquired a large quantity of weapons which
proliferated when the Gadha¬f regime of Libya collapsed.
In particular, ISIL is said to have seized a vast quantity of
weapons, including advanced equipment, from troops such
as the Syrian forces and the Iraqi security forces during
their combat in Syria and Iraq.
Recent years have seen cases in which individuals
and groups that have no particular relations with Al-Qaeda
or ISIL but were inspired by their extremism become
perpetrators of terrorism, giving rise to concerns about the
threat of “home-grown” terrorism. European countries and
the United States share concern that their nationals would
conduct terrorist attacks upon experiencing combat in
conf ict-torn regions such as Iraq and Syria[88] and returning
to their countries, or upon becoming indoctrinated into
extremism and returning to their countries[89]. In recent
years, “lone-wolf” terrorism is also seen as a threat. Such
acts of terrorism are planned and executed by people acting
alone or in small groups. It is therefore diff cult to detect
their signs in advance and prevent their occurrence.
In connection with Japan, in early 2015, when there
was a terrorist incident involving the murder of Japanese
nationals in Syria[90], ISIL declared clearly that its acts
of terrorism would target Japanese nationals. In this
light, Japan is not in any way immune from the threat of
international terrorism.


**1** **Characteristics of Recent International Terrorism**

The objectives and capabilities of transnational terrorist
organizations are deemed to vary by organization[82]. As
a general trend, the advancement of globalization has
increased terrorist organizations’ use of social media
and other cyber space tools to share information and
conspire within their own organizations or with other
groups, as well as to acquire weapons and funds. Some of
these organizations are considered to have sophisticated
publicity strategies[83]. Furthermore, it has been suggested
that terrorist organizations may be perpetrators of cyber
attacks. In January 2015, a cyber attack was lodged against
the U.S. Central Command’s Twitter account, and an
Islamic extremist group is suspected have been involved in
the incident. These terrorist organizations move into and
establish bases of operations in states and regions with
weak or failed governance structures.
Among the various terrorist organizations, ISIL has
gained strength by seizing the opportunity of the confusion
in Syria and Iraq[84]. ISIL has an exceptionally large funding
source, powerful military capability which can stand
face-to-face with a nation, and de facto control of some
territory, making ISIL a particularly striking presence. ISIL
renounces the traditional state governance structure in the
region, and prioritizes the pursuit of its unique political and
religious order, including the establishment of an Islamic
community[85]. In this regard, ISIL has traits different from
terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaeda, which attaches
importance to the “global jihad,” including attacks against
U.S. and European mainland.
With regard to Al-Qaeda that is believed to have directed
the 9/11 attacks in 2001, Osama Bin Laden, the group’s
leader who was hiding in Pakistan, was killed in a U.S.
operation in May 2011. Some analysts have noted that in light
of the losses it has incurred, the Al-Qaeda core now places
importance on the survival of the organization. Nonetheless,
the possibility of Al-Qaeda attacks has not disappeared.


82 U.S. Department of State, “Country Reports on Terrorism 2012” (May 2013)

83 Issue 7 of Dabiq published by ISIL in February 2015 described the murder of two Japanese nationals and reiterated its calls for terrorist attacks targeting Japanese nationals and their interests. In
addition, Issue 1 of Inspire published by AQAP in July 2010 introduces easy directions for bomb-making.

84 According to the “Worldwide Threat Assessment 2015” released by U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in February 2015, more than 20,000 foreign fi ghters are estimated to have
gone to Syria from more than 90 countries.

85 Represented as “ummah” in Arabic. Its meaning is strongly associated with a community of members with ethnic or blood ties. Ummah is believed to be formed by hijrah (emigration). The fi rst ummah
was created by the over 70 people who emigrated with Muhammad and the group of over 70 people in Medina who helped them.

86 U.S. Director of National Intelligence, “Worldwide Threat Assessment” (January 2014)

87 According to the U.S. think tank Intel Center, as of May 2015, a total of 35 organizations have been confi rmed: Middle East and North Africa (21 organizations); Sub-Saharan Africa (3 organization);
South Asia (6 organizations); and Southeast Asia (5 organizations).

89 Remarks by U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security (February 7, 2014)

90 The number of people killed by each terrorist and extremist group in 2014 was the highest for ISIL (24%: 4,230 people), followed by Al-Qaeda-affi liated organizations (22%: 3,949 people). These two

The proliferation of the threat of terrorism has gained
momentum. The diversif cation of its perpetrators, coupled
with the growing complexity of regional conf icts, has
made it further diff cult to prevent their occurrence. For
this reason, international cooperation on counter-terrorism
measures has become even more important. Currently,
the international community as a whole is taking various
steps, including military actions as well as cutting off the
funding sources of terrorist organizations and preventing
the international movement of terrorist f ghters.


allegedly joined an Islamic extremist group in Syria
opened f re at the Jewish Museum in Belgium, killing four
people. In January 2015, French nationals with origins
in Algeria and elsewhere who are deemed to have been
inspired by Islamic extremism were involved in shooting
attacks, including at the head off ce of the French weekly
newspaper Charlie Hebdo in central Paris and a Jewish
grocery store[93]. Following this incident, the French
government has remained on high alert, deploying nearly
10,000 French forces personnel nationwide. In Denmark,
in February 2015, shootings occurred at an event titled
“Art, blasphemy and the freedom of expression” held at a
café in Copenhagen as well as near a Jewish synagogue,
killing two people.

**(2) Islamic Extremist Terrorism**
In the Middle East, Islamic extremists, such as ISIL which
has gained strength in Iraq and Syria as well as the Al-Qaedaaff liated organizations, continue to stage acts of terrorism.
In May 2015, multiple suicide bombings targeting Shiite
mosques occurred in eastern Saudi Arabia, after which ISIL
released a statement claiming responsibility for the attack.
In North Africa, it is deemed that ISIL-related
organizations and the Al-Qaeda-aff liated organizations
operate in Libya, Egypt, and Algeria. In Tunisia, in March
2015, a group thought to be an Islamic extremist organization
carried out a shooting attack at the Bardo National Museum
in Tunis, killing 21 foreign tourists and others, including
three Japanese nationals. In Algeria, in January 2013, an
Islamic extremist group that is believed to have seceded
from AQIM, which, until then had carried out kidnappings
targeting Algerian nationals and Westerners, conducted
shooting attacks at a natural gas plant in In Aménas in
southeastern Algeria, killing many people including ten
Japanese nationals. In June 2013, gunf re erupted between
the Algerian forces and armed groups near the border with
Mali and Libya. As these examples demonstrate, terrorism
remains a threat in Algeria. In Kenya, terrorist incidents
that Al-Shabaab is believed to be behind have taken place.
In September 2013, an armed group conducted a shooting


**2** **Trends in Global Terrorism**


**(1) “Home-Grown” and “Lone-Wolf” Terrorism**
In recent years, home-grown and lone-wolf terrorism
have become a growing concern in the West. In particular,
there has been a spate of terrorism incidents perpetrated
by people who are deemed to have been inspired by the
adept public relations strategies of extremist groups (e.g.,
solicitation via social media and websites) and people
who have returned to their countries from Syria and other
conf ict areas. Accordingly, countries are taking steps,
including strengthening border control[91] and exposing
plans of terrorist attacks prior to their execution.
In the Americas, in April 2013, an explosion occurred
at the venue of the Boston marathon in the United States,
killing three people and injuring many. In Canada, a male
convert to Islam, who is believed to have sympathized
with the extremism of ISIL, shot and killed a soldier of
the Canadian forces in front of the Parliament in Ottawa
in October 2014. In Australia, in December 2014, a man
of Iranian origin who is believed to have sympathized with
the extremism of ISIL took 18 people as hostages at a café
in central Sydney, resulting in the deaths of three people,
including the criminal, following gunf re between him and
local police off cers. In September 2014, the national level
of alert in Australia was elevated[92].
All of these incidents are considered to be “homegrown” or “lone-wolf” terrorism.
In Europe, in May 2014, a French national who


91 In September 2014, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 2178 on the issue of foreign terrorist fi ghters. The Resolution requested member states to make exits from their countries for the
purpose of executing acts of terrorism punishable under domestic laws. The Resolution also includes measures obligating member states to prevent entry or transit through their territories of any
individual about whom that state had credible information which demonstrates reasonable grounds for believing that the individual is attempting to enter or transit through its territory for the purpose of
participating in acts of terrorism. In addition, at the G7 Summit held in Germany in June 2015, the leaders reaffi rmed their commitment to effectively implement the established international framework
for the freezing of terrorists’ assets.

92 The Australian government assesses the terrorist threat to Australia on a scale of four levels – Extreme, High, Medium, and Low – and discloses the alert level for terrorism. As of March 2015, the
level of alert is raised to High (terrorist attack is likely).

93 Of the two brothers who were behind the shooting attack at the Charlie Hebdo head offi ce, one is known to have received training at an AQAP camp. In addition, AQAP released a statement saying
it had issued instructions directly to the brothers. While no clear relevance has been confi rmed, Amedy Coulibaly who was behind the shooting attack at a Jewish grocery store is believed to have

attack at an upscale shopping center in Nairobi, leaving 67
people dead. In April 2015, an armed group carried out a
shooting attack at a university in Garissa in northeastern
Kenya, leaving at least 148 people dead.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, Islamic extremists have gained
strength in countries such as Mali, Somalia[94], and Nigeria.
In particular, in Nigeria, Boko Haram, which aims to create
an Islamic state, has stepped up its activities since 2009,
repeatedly carrying out acts of terrorism in retaliation
against crackdowns by police and other authorities.
In April 2014, Boko Haram abducted over 200 female
students in Borno State in northeastern Nigeria. In response,
the international community took steps. For example
the United States dispatched drones and other assets to
support the search activities of the Nigerian government. In
addition, the U.N. Security Council Sanctions Committee
added Boko Haram to its sanctions list. Recently, Boko
Haram has reportedly repeated suicide bombings using
women and girls who are less likely to raise alarm.
Furthermore, Boko Haram has been expanding its activities
to areas outside of Nigeria, conducting a shooting attack
in a village along the Nigerian border in Diffa Region in
southeastern Niger in February 2015. In March 2015, Boko
Haram swore allegiance to ISIL and appears to be gaining
strength. However, neighboring countries are undertaking a

**4** **International Response to the Ebola Outbreak**


Since the Ebola virus was f rst discovered in Sudan and
the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976, multiple
outbreaks of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) have occurred
mainly in Central Africa, killing tens to hundreds of people.
In March 2014, multiple cases of EVD were conf rmed
in Guinea for the f rst time in West Africa, and the infection
spread to neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia. Factors
such as the weak health systems and people’s lack of
knowledge about sanitation in the affected countries[99],
combined with their burial practices and the inf ux of
infected people into capital cities contributed to the rising
number of deaths from EVD[100]. In August 2014, the World
Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public
health emergency of international concern. The spread of
infection has had adverse effects on the national economies
and societies of the main affected countries – Liberia, Sierra
Leone, and Guinea. Furthermore, the infection spread by
the movement of people through air travel and other means,


mop-up operation against Boko Haram, and consequently,
the area under its control has not rapidly expanded.
In South Asia, acts of terrorism have occurred
frequently from before. In particular, Pakistan has had a
spate of terrorism attacks targeted at religious facilities
and government agencies, which have been perpetrated
by organizations such as Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP)
and Al-Qaeda. In December 2014, TTP was involved in
a shooting incident at a military school in Peshawar in
northwestern Pakistan, which killed over 141 people. In
September 2014, Al-Qaeda’s leader Ayman al Zawahiri
announced the establishment of a new branch in India[95].
In addition, ISIL has reportedly unilaterally established
Khorasan Province in Afghanistan and Pakistan[96]. The
intensif cation of the acts of terrorism by Islamic extremists
is a cause for concern.
In Southeast Asia, while some progress has been
observed, including with the crackdown on terrorist
organizations[97], the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in the
Philippines has allegedly sworn allegiance and provided
funding to ISIL. In addition, young people from Indonesia
and other countries have reportedly gone to Iraq and Syria
as foreign f ghters and pose a new threat in the region[98].

East Regions)

with cases conf rmed not only in other African countries,
including Nigeria, Senegal, and Mali, but also in the United
States in September 2014, Spain in October, and the United
Kingdom in December. This unprecedented outbreak of
EVD is a pressing issue for the international community,
one in which a single country cannot deal with on its own.
Under these circumstances, in September 2014, the
U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 2177, which
requested U.N. member states to provide assistance to the
affected countries to contain EVD. In the same month, the
United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response
(UNMEER) was established and started conducting
activities in the f eld.
The international response also included the provision
of assistance by various military forces. In September 2014,
President Obama announced the deployment of U.S. Forces
to West Africa centered in Liberia in order to contain EVD. In
December 2014, the number of deployed U.S. units reached


94 In February 2015, Al-Shabaab called on Islamic followers in the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Canada to conduct attacks at shopping centers and business districts in these countries.
95 Al-Qaeda’s leader Ayman al Zawahiri has stated that the goal of the Al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) is to free Muslim followers who are oppressed in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka.

96 ISIL’s spokesperson Abu Mohammed al-Adnani announced that Hafi z Saeed Khan, former TTP commander, would be appointed governor of Khorasan Province.

97 It is pointed out that the terrorist organizations have weakened in the Philippines, such as the Islamic extremist terrorist organization ASG, which have been the foremost security concern in the country.
See Part I, Chapter 1, Section 6-2 for the situation in the Philippines.

98 In Indonesia, the government banned participation in ISIL in August 2014. Under the existing legal system, however, it is said that authorities do not have the authority to arrest ISIL supporters unless
there is evidence of their clear involvement in terrorism activities.

99 A WHO report cites underlying factors, including damaged public health infrastructures due to civil war, as well as the entry into society of young people with no education.

**Section 2 Transfer and Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction**


The transfer and proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction (WMDs), such as nuclear, biological and
chemical (NBC) weapons, and ballistic missiles that
deliver such weapons, have been recognized as a signif cant

**1** **Nuclear Weapons**


During the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962
raised awareness of the danger of a full-scale nuclear war
between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) that
took effect in 1970 prohibited countries other than those
that exploded a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive
device in or before 1966[1] from having nuclear weapons,
and provided that arms control and disarmament of nuclear
forces would be pursued through two-way negotiations[2].
The NPT is currently signed by 191 countries and
regions[3]. While some countries that had previously
possessed nuclear weapons became signatories of this
treaty as non-nuclear weapon states by abandoning these
weapons[4], India, Israel, and Pakistan still refuse to accede
to this treaty as non-nuclear weapon states. There are
other countries that have declared the development and
possession of nuclear weapons, such as North Korea, which
announced that it conducted nuclear tests in October 2006,
May 2009, and February 2013[5].
U.S. President Barack Obama’s speech in April 2009
in which he expressed his hopes for a world without nuclear
weapons demonstrated U.S. determination to take concrete
steps towards this world, specif cally: the reduction of the
role of nuclear weapons in U.S. national security while
maintaining nuclear deterrence; the signing of a new treaty
to replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty I (START I)
between the United States and Russia; and pursuit of


threat since the end of the Cold War. In particular, there
still remain strong concerns that non-state actors, including
terrorists, against which traditional deterrence works less
effectively, could acquire and use WMDs.

ratif cation of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty
(CTBT)[6] by the U.S. government. This in turn encouraged
the international community to take initiatives towards
nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
In April 2010, the presidents of the United States
and Russia signed the New Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty (New START) to replace START I, which was put
into effect in February 2011[7]. In addition, in June 2013,
President Obama made a speech in Berlin in which he
announced his intention to negotiate with Russia on the
reduction of the number of U.S. deployed strategic nuclear
weapons by up to one-third, among other cuts[8]. The United
Kingdom also stated in the Strategic Defense and Security
Review (SDSR) in October 2010 that the country would
decrease the number of its nuclear warheads.
In the area of “nuclear security” which addresses
terrorism activities that utilize nuclear and other radioactive
materials, in April 2010, the f rst Nuclear Security Summit
was held in Washington, D.C. The Summit adopted a
Communiqué stating that measures should be taken to
secure all vulnerable nuclear material in four years to
reduce the threat of nuclear terrorism, among other matters.
The second Nuclear Security Summit that was convened
in Seoul in March 2012 adopted the Seoul Communiqué,
which incorporates issues to be addressed by the
international community to achieve nuclear security, such
as the management, transportation, and illicit traff cking of


The United States, the former Soviet Union (now Russia), the United Kingdom, France, and China. France and China acceded to the NPT in 1992.

Article 6 of the NPT sets out the obligation of signatory countries to negotiate nuclear disarmament in good faith.

As of February 2015

South Africa, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus

After North Korea announced its withdrawal from the NPT in 1993, it pledged that it would remain a contracting state to the NPT. However, North Korea again declared its withdrawal from the NPT in
January 2003. In the Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks adopted in September 2005, North Korea pledged to return to the NPT at an early date. Nonetheless, North Korea subsequently announced
the implementation of three nuclear tests. North Korea’s nuclear tests constitute a major challenge to the NPT.

Adopted in 1996, this treaty bans all nuclear test explosions regardless of the location. Of the 44 nations that are required to ratify it for the treaty to enter into force, 8 nations have not yet ratifi ed
the treaty (United States, China, India, Pakistan, Iran, Israel, Egypt, and North Korea). Indonesia ratified the CTBT in February 2012. The United States participated in the Conference on Facilitating the
Entry into Force of the CTBT in September 2011, following on from 2009 which marked the first time in 10 years that the United States participated in the Conference.

The treaty stipulates that both countries would reduce the number of deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 and the number of deployed delivery vehicles to 700 by seven years following the treaty’s
entry into force. In April 2015, the United States reported that it had 1,597 deployed strategic nuclear warheads and 785 deployed delivery vehicles, while Russia reported that it had 1,582 deployed
strategic nuclear warheads and 515 deployed delivery vehicles. These numbers are as of March 1, 2015.

Regarding this proposal, Russia explained its position that all elements impacting strategic stability including missile defense, space weapons, and non-nuclear strategic weapons need to be taken

nuclear materials, as well as nuclear forensics[9]. The third
Nuclear Security Summit that was held in The Hague in
March 2014 adopted a Communiqué, which included
a statement that went so far as to say that the leaders
encourage countries to minimize their stocks of highly
enriched uranium and to keep their stockpile of separated
plutonium to the minimum level, both as consistent with
national requirements.
The fact that the international community has begun to

**2** **Biological and Chemical Weapons**


Biological and chemical weapons are easy to manufacture
at relatively low cost and are easy to disguise as most
materials, equipment, and technology needed to
manufacture these weapons can be used for both military
and civilian purposes. For example, water purif cation
equipment used to desalinate sea water can be exploited to
extract bacteria for the production of biological weapons,
and sodium cyanide used for the process of metal coating
can be abused for the production of chemical weapons[11].
Accordingly, biological and chemical weapons are
attractive to states and non-state actors, such as terrorists,
seeking asymmetric means of attack[12].
Biological weapons have the following characteristics:
(1) manufacturing is easy and inexpensive; (2) there
is usually an incubation period of a few days between
exposure and onset; (3) their use is hard to detect; (4) even
the threat of use can create great psychological effects; and
(5) they can cause mass casualties and injuries depending
on the circumstances of use and the type of weapon[13].
As has been pointed out, advancements in life
science could be misused or abused for the development
of biological weapons. In view of these concerns, in
November 2009, the United States established guidelines[14]
on responding to the proliferation of biological weapons
and their use by terrorists. The guidelines set out that the


make steady and major strides toward nuclear disarmament
and non-proliferation contributes to improving the
international security environment, and is a welcome
development. In contrast, China is deemed to have increased
its inventory of nuclear warheads as well as developed and
deployed their means of delivery[10], and thereby, continued
to enhance the capability of its nuclear forces. It has been
pointed out that initiatives for reducing nuclear weapons
involving China will be needed in the future.

United States would take measures to ensure the thorough
management of pathogens and toxins[15].
As for chemical weapons, Iraq repeatedly used
mustard gas, tabun, and sarin[16] in the Iran-Iraq War. In the
late 1980s, Iraq used chemical weapons to suppress Iraqi
Kurds[17]. It is believed that other chemical weapons[18] that
were used included VX, a highly toxic nerve agent, and
easy-to-manage binary rounds[19]. In August 2013, sarin
was used in the suburbs of Damascus, Syria, where Syrian
troops clashed with antigovernment groups[20]. The Syrian
government denied using chemical weapons, but entered
into the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) in line
with an agreement between the United States and Russia.
Subsequently, international efforts have been underway for
the overseas transfer of chemical agents and other measures
based on the decisions made by the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)[21] and a U.N.
Security Council resolution[22]. In August 2014, the operation
to destroy Syria’s chemical weapons on the U.S. Navy
transport vessel Cape Ray was completed[23]. Furthermore,
OPCW has indicated that ISIL[24], which is gaining strength
in Iraq and Syria, may have utilized chlorine gas against
Iraqi forces[25].
North Korea is an example of a country that is still
presumed to possess these chemical weapons and which

14 In November 2009, the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats was released. It presents guidelines on responding to the proliferation of biological weapons and their use by terrorists. In
the State of the Union Address in January 2010, President Obama said that the United States was launching a new initiative to respond promptly and effectively to bioterrorism and infectious diseases.

of the weapon or other action mixes the chemical materials in the warhead, causing a chemical reaction and thereby synthesis of the chemical agent. Binary rounds are easier to store and handle
than weapons containing chemical agents from the outset.

**3** **Ballistic Missiles**


Ballistic missiles enable the projection of heavy payloads
over long distances and can be used as a means of delivering
WMDs, such as nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.
Once launched, ballistic missiles follow an orbital f ight
trajectory and fall at a steep angle at high speed. As such,
effectively countering them requires a highly advanced
interceptor missile system.
The deployment of ballistic missiles in a region where
armed conf ict is under way runs the risk of intensifying
or expanding the conf ict. Additionally, it has the risk of
further heightening tension in a region where military
confrontation is ongoing, leading to the destabilization of
that region. Furthermore, ballistic missiles are used as a
means of attacking from a distance or threatening another
country that has superior conventional forces.


February 2004, have shown that the threat of the use of
WMDs by terrorists is real and that these weapons could
cause serious damage if used in cities.

In recent years, in addition to the threat of ballistic
missiles, analysts have pointed to the threat of cruise
missiles as a weapon which is comparatively easy for
terrorists and other non-state actors to acquire and which
has the potential for proliferation[26]. Because cruise missiles
are cheaper to produce compared to ballistic missiles and
are easy to maintain and train with, many countries either
produce or modify cruise missiles. At the same time, it
is said that cruise missiles have a higher degree of target
accuracy and that they are diff cult to detect while in
f ight[27]. Moreover, because they are smaller than ballistic
missiles, cruise missiles can be concealed on a ship to
secretly approach a target, and present a serious threat if
they carry WMDs in their warheads[28].


**4** **Growing Concerns about Transfer and Proliferation of WMDs and Other Technologies**


Even weapons that were purchased or developed for selfdefense purposes could easily be exported or transferred
once domestic manufacturing becomes successful. For
example, certain states that do not heed political risks have
transferred WMDs and related technologies to other states
that cannot afford to invest resources in conventional forces
and attempt to offset this with WMDs. Some of these states
that seek WMDs do not hesitate to put their land and people
at risk, and furthermore, due to their weak governance,
terrorist organizations are active in their countries.
Therefore, it is conceivable that in general, the possibility
of actual use of WMDs would increase.


In addition, since there is a concern that such
states may not be able to effectively manage the related
technology and materials, the high likelihood that chemical
or nuclear substances will be transferred or smuggled out
from these states has become a cause for concern. For
example, there is a danger that even terrorists who do not
possess related technologies would use a dirty bomb[29]
as a means of terrorist attack so long as they gain access
to radioactive materials. Nations across the world share
concerns regarding the acquisition and use of WMDs by
terrorists and other non-state actors[30].
The proliferation of WMDs and other related


26 In the July 2006 conflict between Israel and Lebanon, it is believed that Hezbollah used a cruise missile to attack an Israeli naval vessel. Israel announced in March 2011 that it had uncovered six
anti-ship cruise missiles among other items on cargo ships subject to inspection.

27 United States Congressional Research Service, “Cruise Missile Proliferation” (July 28, 2005)

28 The United States is concerned that the development and deployment of ballistic and cruise missiles by countries including China and Iran could pose a threat to U.S. forward-deployed forces.

29 Dirty bombs are intended to cause radioactive contamination by spreading radioactive materials.

30 With these concerns, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1540 in April 2004, which sets forth the decision that all U.N. member states would refrain from providing support to non-state
actors that attempt to develop, acquire, manufacture, possess, transport, transfer, or use WMDs and their means of delivery, as well as adopt and enforce laws that are appropriate and effective for

technologies has been noted in numerous instances.
For example, in February 2004, it came to light that
nuclear-related technologies, mainly uranium enrichment
technology, had been transferred to North Korea, Iran, and
Libya by Dr. A.Q. Khan and other scientists in Pakistan. It
has also been suggested that North Korea supported Syria’s
secret nuclear activities[31].
Furthermore, there has been signif cant transfer and
proliferation of ballistic missiles that serve as the means
of delivery of WMDs. The former Soviet Union and other
countries exported Scud-Bs to many countries and regions,
including Iraq, North Korea, and Afghanistan. China
and North Korea also exported DF-3 (CSS-2) and Scud
missiles, respectively. As a result, a considerable number
of countries now possess ballistic missiles. In addition,
Pakistan’s Ghauri and Iran’s Shahab-3 missiles are believed
to be based on North Korea’s Nodong missiles.
The international community’s uncompromising and

**5** **Iran’s Nuclear Issues**


Since the 1970s, Iran has been pursuing a nuclear power
plant construction project with cooperation from abroad,
claiming that its nuclear-related activities are for peaceful
purposes in accordance with the NPT. In 2002, however,
Iran’s covert construction of facilities including a largescale uranium enrichment plant was exposed by a group of
dissidents. Subsequent IAEA inspection revealed that Iran,
without notifying the IAEA, had been engaged for a long
time in uranium enrichment and other activities potentially
leading to the development of nuclear weapons. In
September 2005, the IAEA Board of Governors recognized
Iran’s breach of compliance with the NPT Safeguards
Agreement.
In September 2009, it was revealed that Iran had failed
to abide by the reporting duties based on the Safeguards
Agreement with the IAEA and was constructing a new


decisive stance against the transfer and proliferation of
WMDs and other technologies has put signif cant pressure
on countries engaged in related activities, leading some of
them to accept inspections by international organizations
or abandon their WMD and other programs altogether[32].
Meanwhile, it is pointed out that, in recent years, states
of proliferation concern have sustained their proliferation
activities by averting international monitoring, through
illicitly exporting WMDs and other technologies overseas
by falsifying documentation, diversifying transport routes,
and utilizing multiple front companies and intermediaries.
Furthermore, intangible transfer of technology has arisen as
a cause for concern. Namely, states of proliferation concern
have obtained advanced technologies which could be
adapted for the development and manufacturing of WMDs
and other technologies via their nationals – researchers and
students who have been dispatched to leading companies
and academic institutions in developed countries.

uranium enrichment plant near Qom in central Iran.
Moreover, in February 2010, Iran began enriching uranium
to increase the enrichment level from below 5% to up to
around 20%, saying that the reason was to supply fuel
to a research reactor for medical isotope production. In
December 2011, Iran started the enrichment process at the
above-mentioned new enrichment plant[33]. The IAEA has
expressed concerns that these Iranian nuclear activities
may have military dimensions including those related to
the development of a nuclear payload for a missile[34]. The
IAEA notes that it has been unable to obtain conf rmation
that the activities are for peaceful use purposes since
Iran has not permitted IAEA personnel to access military
facilities, which are suspected to have been involved in
the experiments using high explosives, and has not offered
other necessary cooperation to dispel these concerns.


31 DNI “Worldwide Threat Assessment” from January 2014 states, “North Korea’s assistance to Syria in the construction of a nuclear reactor (destroyed in 2007) illustrates the reach of the North’s
proliferation activities.” The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report of May 2011 states that the destroyed reactor was very likely a nuclear reactor that Syria should have declared to
the IAEA.

32 Extensive behind-the-scenes negotiations began in March 2003 between Libya and the United States and the United Kingdom. In December 2003, Libya agreed to dismantle all of its WMDs and to
allow an international organization to carry out inspections. Later, in August 2006, Libya ratified the IAEA Additional Protocol. Meanwhile, after the military activity against Libya by a multinational force,
in March 2011, North Korea denounced the military attacks against Libya, saying that attacking after disarmament was an “armed invasion.”

33 The IAEA Director General estimated in a report published in February 2014 that Iran had so far produced a total 447 kg of enriched uranium with a concentration of around 20%, out of which the
country had stored 160 kg in the form of uranium hexafluoride. Furthermore, the IAEA Report by the Director General released in May of the same year contend that in accordance with the first step
measures elaborated later, Iran diluted to less than 5%, or converted into oxide, a total of approximately 409 kg of uranium hexafluoride enriched up to 20%. Uranium 235 with a concentration of
20% or more is defined as highly enriched uranium, which is generally used for research purposes. If this substance is used for weapons, a concentration ratio is usually 90% or greater.

The international community expresses strong
concerns, saying that there lacks concrete proof of Iran’s
claim that it had no intent to develop nuclear weapons
and that all of its nuclear activities were for peaceful use
purposes. The international community has demanded that
Iran suspend all of its enrichment-related and reprocessing
activities through a series of U.N. Security Council
resolutions[35] and IAEA Board of Governors resolutions.
Regarding this issue, the United States and the
European Union (EU) have taken individual measures to
strengthen sanctions against Iran. In December 2011, the
United States enacted a bill that would prohibit foreign
f nancial institutions, which conduct signif cant transactions
with the Central Bank of Iran or other Iranian f nancial
institutions, from opening or maintaining bank accounts
in the United States. The EU started to ban imports of
Iranian crude oil and petrochemical products in January
2012. Iran, meanwhile, started negotiations with the IAEA
toward resolving pending problems. In April 2012, Iran
resumed talks with the EU3+3 (United Kingdom, France,
Germany, United States, China, and Russia) on its nuclear
program, but no major progress was made under the former
Ahmadinezhad administration.
However, with Hassan Rouhani winning the presidential
election in Iran in June 2013, the discussions with the
EU3+3 were advanced under the new administration with
the consent of the supreme leader, Ali Hosseini Khamenei.
This resulted in the announcement of the Joint Plan of
Action (JPOA) towards the comprehensive resolution of
nuclear issues in November 2013. The execution of the f rst
step measures of the JPOA commenced in January 2014[36].
In regard to this, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
of Israel has expressed strong opposition to the relaxation
of sanctions against Iran, stating in November 2013 that an
agreement allowing Iran to enrich uranium is a “historic
mistake.”
Although the aim was to reach an agreement on
the comprehensive measures including the f nal step by


July 20, 2014 – the last day of the six-month period for
the execution of the f rst step measures, signif cant gaps
between the two sides on core issues resulted in failure to
reach an agreement[37]. It was agreed that the negotiations
would be extended by four months to November 24, 2014.
In this process, the United States has expressed concerns
over the number of centrifuges in Iran’s possession[38], while
the Iranian side has presented its view that it needed to
signif cantly increase its uranium enrichment capabilities[39].
It is said that the scale of Iran’s permitted uranium
enrichment capacity has remained one of the core points of
contention in subsequent consultations. In November 2014,
the EU3+3 and Iran aff rmed that they would continue to
execute the JPOA on uranium enrichment agreed upon
in November 2013, and announced that the negotiations
to reach the f nal comprehensive agreement would be
re-extended through June 30, 2015. Subsequently, on April
2, 2015, the EU3+3 announced that the key parameters of
the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) were
agreed upon as an outcome of the consultations held in
Lausanne, Switzerland. It was agreed that work would
be under way to draft the JCPOA, including the technical
details, through June 30.

36 First step measures include the limited relaxation of sanctions by the EU3+3, provided that for six months, Iran: (1) retains half of its current inventory of enriched uranium with a concentration of
approximately 20% as oxide and dilutes the remaining half to less than 5%; (2) does not enrich uranium to a level of 5% or greater; (3) does not make any further advances of its activities conducted
in uranium enrichment facilities and heavy-water reactors; and (4) accepts enhanced monitoring by the IAEA and so on.

37 On July 18, 2014, a statement was released at the joint press conference held by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton and Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran saying
that, “While we have made tangible progress on some of the issues and have worked together on a text for a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, there are still signifi cant gaps on some core issues
which will require more time and effort.” On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry stated that, “On all these issues there is still work to do and differences to resolve, but we have made
real progress. Still, there are very real gaps on issues such as enrichment capacity at the Natanz enrichment facility. This issue is an absolutely critical component of any potential comprehensive
agreement.”

38 On July 15, 2014, Secretary of State Kerry stated, “We have made it crystal clear that the 19,000 (centrifuges) that are currently part of their program is too many...And so all I will say to you is that
we will continue to press.”

**Section 3 Maritime Trends**

Maritime security is of critical importance to Japan,
a maritime nation surrounded by sea. For example,
Japan relies on sea transport to import energy resources.
Accordingly, ensuring secure sea lanes is vital for the
survival of the nation. Securing the stable use of one of the


global commons, the “seas,” is a key security issue for the
international community. In recent years, maritime trends
in the countries concerned are drawing attention, including
their compliance with relevant international norms[1].

**1** **Trends Related to the “Principle of the Freedom of the High Seas” in the East China Sea and South China Sea**


On November 23, 2013, the Chinese government
announced that it established “the East China Sea Air
Defense Identif cation Zone (ADIZ)” including the
Senkaku Islands which China described as if they were a
part of China’s “territory,” that it obligated aircraft f ying in
the said zone to abide by the rules set forth by the Chinese
Ministry of National Defense, and that the PLA would
take “defensive emergency measures” in the case where
such aircraft does not follow the instructed procedures.
Japan is deeply concerned about such measures, which
are profoundly dangerous acts that unilaterally change the
status quo in the East China Sea, escalating the situation,
and that could cause unintended consequences in the East
China Sea. Furthermore, the measures unduly infringe
the freedom of overf ight over the high seas, which is the
general principle of international law. Japan is demanding
China to revoke any measures that could go against the
principle of freedom of overf ight over the high seas. The
United States, the Republic of Korea (ROK), Australia, and
the European Union (EU) have expressed concern about
China’s establishment of such zone.
The South China Sea has also seen many similar acts.
In March 2009, Chinese ships, including a naval vessel, a
maritime research ship of the SOA, a Bureau of Maritime
Fisheries’ patrol ship, and trawlers, approached a U.S. Navy
acoustic research ship operating in the South China Sea to
obstruct its operations. In addition, in December 2013, a


The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS) provides for the principles of “freedom of
navigation in the high seas” and “freedom of overf ight over
the high seas”[2]. Nevertheless, in the waters and airspace
in the periphery of Japan, especially the East China Sea
and the South China Sea, it has become increasingly
common for countries to unilaterally assert their rights or
take actions, based on their unique assertions which are
incompatible with the existing international law and order.
This has caused situations of undue infringement upon
such principles.
The East China Sea has recently seen numerous cases
of acts which go against the principles of freedom of
navigation in the high seas and freedom of overf ight over
the high seas. In March and April 2011 and in April 2012,
Chinese helicopters and other aircraft that appeared to
belong to the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) f ew close
to Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) destroyers
which were engaged in monitoring and surveillance in the
East China Sea. In January 2013, a Chinese naval vessel
directed f re-control radar at a JMSDF destroyer navigating
in the East China Sea and is suspected to have directed
f re-control radar at a helicopter carried onboard a JMSDF
destroyer. In May and June 2014, f ghters of the People’s
Liberation Army (PLA) of China f ew abnormally close to
aircraft of the JMSDF and of the Japan Air Self-Defense
Force which were f ying over the East China Sea.


For example, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) comprehensively sets forth the rights and obligations under international law related to the use and development of the
oceans and their regulations. UNCLOS was adopted in 1982 and entered into force in 1994 (Japan ratifi ed it in 1996).

Chinese naval vessel cut across the bow of a U.S. Navy
cruiser operating in the South China Sea at point blank
range. In August 2014, a Chinese f ghter is speculated to
have f own abnormally close to and obstructed a U.S. Navy
patrol aircraft over the South China Sea[3]. These cases go
against the principles of freedom of navigation in the high
seas and freedom of overf ight over the high seas, and are
dangerous acts that could cause unintended consequences[4].
In addition, friction between China and ASEAN
member states and other countries has surfaced over issues
including the sovereignty of islands and other features.
Against this backdrop, China, on the grounds of the so-called
“nine-dash line”[5] whose validity under international law
has been described as ambiguous, has asserted sovereignty
over the Spratly Islands, among other areas. On this basis,
China has proceeded with land reclamation and other
development work in some land features on a rapid and
massive scale, as well as obstructed f shing and other
vessels of countries approaching the features, etc. by f ring
warning shots and water cannons at the vessels. Contesting
states – the Philippines and Vietnam – as well as the United
States and other countries have expressed concern over
China’s assertive and dangerous acts that could cause
unintended consequences.
Despite these numerous acts that could pose risks

**2** **Trends in the Arctic Ocean**


The Arctic Ocean, which covers most of the Arctic
Region, borders Russia, the United States, Canada,
Denmark, and Norway[8].
In recent years, decreases in sea ice have increased
potential for the uses of the Northern Sea Route and the
exploration of natural resources. For these reasons, the
Arctic states have been more proactively promoting efforts
to acquire their interest in resource development and use
of the sea route. On the other hand, there exist unresolved
issues among the Arctic states over the demarcation of
maritime boundaries based on UNCLOS and extension of
the continental shelf. It is considered that some of these


to securing the stable use of oceans, in recent years
progress has been made on efforts to avert and prevent
unintended consequences in the sea. In April 2014,
navies of participating countries of the Western Pacif c
Naval Symposium (WPNS), including Japan, the United
States, and China, reached agreement on the Code for
Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES)[6]. CUES sets forth
a code of conduct for unexpected encounters by vessels
or aircraft of the navies of each country. In November
2014, the United States and China agreed on measures
pertaining to mutual notif cation of military activities, as
well as on rules of behavior to avert collisions in waters
and airspace in accordance with UNCLOS, CUES, and
other frameworks. In January 2015, the Fourth Joint
Working Group Consultation was held with a view to
implementing the “Maritime and Aerial Communication
Mechanism between Japan-China Defense Authorities”[7]
for averting incidental collisions between Japan and China.
It is strongly hoped that these initiatives designed to avert
and prevent unintended consequences in the seas and skies
will supplement the existing international law and order,
and that the countries concerned, including China, refrain
from unilateral actions that heighten tension and act on the
basis of the principle of the “rule of law.”

See Part I, Chapter 1, Section 3 (China); Part I, Chapter 1, Section 6
(Southeast Asia)

Arctic states including Russia are promoting efforts
to deploy new military capabilities for the purpose of
securing their interest and defending their territories.
Traditionally, the Arctic Region has been used for the
deployment of strategic nuclear forces and as their transit
route. In addition, due to the decrease of sea ice, surface
ships can navigate for longer periods of time and in wider
areas than before. In this regard, the region could be used
for deploying maritime forces or maneuvering military
forces using the maritime transport capabilities of military
forces in the future. The strategic importance of the region
is thus increasing.


Some analysts have noted that these incidents occur as many countries including the United States treat an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) the same as high seas based on UNCLOS from the
perspective of freedom of navigation, whereas China treats EEZ as being similar to territorial waters. It is considered that the United States respects the provisions of UNCLOS while it has not concluded
the convention.

According to the written testimony of U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacifi c Security Affairs David Shear before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations dated May 13, 2015, the
United States has enhanced its presence in and around the South China Sea to protect U.S. national interests in the South China Sea, such as peaceful resolution of disputes, freedom of navigation
in the high seas, and freedom of overfl ight over the high seas. For example, U.S. military forces are conducting port calls of naval vessels, carrying out ISR activities, and exercising with neighboring
countries. In addition, the U.S. Navy has announced that the littoral combat ship (LCS) USS Fort Worth, which has been rotationally deployed to Singapore since December 2014, conducted patrol in
waters near the Spratly Islands in May 2015, which marked the fi rst time an LCS operated in these waters.

See Part I, Chapter 1, Section 6-4 (Trends concerning Sovereignty Over the South China Sea)

CUES sets forth safety procedures and notifi cation methods for unplanned encounters at sea by the naval vessels and air force aircraft of participating countries of the WPNS. CUES is not legally
binding and does not supersede the annexes of the Convention on International Civil Aviation and other international treaties.

During the Fourth Joint Working Group Consultation, the two sides agreed to coordinate on the mechanism’s naming to “Maritime and Aerial Communication Mechanism” in order to clarify its coverage
of aircraft.

The Arctic Region is the area north of the latitude line of 66 degrees 33 minutes north latitude. There are eight countries in the Arctic Region – the fi ve countries that border the Arctic Ocean and
Finland, Sweden, and Iceland that do not border it. In 1996, the Arctic Council was established, which aims to promote cooperation, coordination, and interaction among the Arctic states, with the

**3** **Maritime Security Efforts of Countries**


With regard to oceans, not only for economic
development but also for the national security of each
country, it has become even more important to promote
appropriate rule-making and to make concerted efforts
by the international community to address risks and
ensure freedom of navigation while respecting such
rules. “Open and Stable Seas” constitute the basis for
peace and prosperity of the international community as
a whole. In this regard, each state has been tackling on
its own or with others various issues including piracy,
unidentified vessels, illegal dumping, contraband,
human smuggling, maritime disasters, and the removal
of hazardous substances, for maintaining the stability of
sea lanes of communication.


2014, President Barack Obama unveiled the “United States
Counter Piracy and Maritime Security Action Plan,” by
which he presented the guidelines to strengthen maritime
security as it relates to counter piracy. In accordance with
the National Strategy for Maritime Security established
in 2005[11], this Action Plan sets forth the policy for the
repression of piracy and related maritime crime. It then
outlines the guidelines for implementing tasks under
the leadership of an interagency policy committee,
covering the areas of prevention of attacks, response to
acts of maritime crime, and enhancing maritime security
and governance. In addition, the Action Plan sets out
frameworks for combating piracy and enhancing maritime
security off the Horn of Africa and in the Gulf of Guinea[12].
Furthermore, Furthermore, “A Cooperative Strategy for
21st Century Seapower,” jointly released by the U.S. Navy,
Marine Corps, and Coast Guard in March 2015, expresses
the view that U.S. forward naval presence is essential to
accomplishing missions including protecting the maritime
commons, and that by operating jointly with allies and
partners, naval forces can effectively address the threats to
maritime security.


**1** **United States**


The United States deems that its safety and economic
security depend upon the secure use of the world’s oceans,
and that the United States has a vital interest in maritime
security. Based on this recognition, the United States leads
the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)[9] to counter piracy
and advance maritime safety, including tackling terrorism
in waters surrounding the Middle East and Africa, such as
the Gulf of Aden, the Persian Gulf, and the Indian Ocean.
In waters surrounding Central America, the United States
conducts operations to counter illicit traff cking, primarily
drug traff cking with European and Western Hemisphere
countries[10]. The United States thus dispatches vessels to the
various sea areas of the world and takes actions to combat
piracy, organized crime, terrorism, and the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).
The U.S. National Security Strategy, released in
February 2015, states that the United States has an enduring
interest in freedom of navigation as well as the safety and
sustainability of the maritime environment, and that it
would therefore maintain the capability to ensure the free
f ow of commerce, to respond quickly to those in need, and
to deter those who might contemplate aggression. In June


**2** **NATO**


NATO has the Standing NATO Maritime Groups, which are
a multinational, integrated force made up of vessels from
member countries. Through the Groups’ routine exercises
and maintenance of rapid deployment capability, NATO
has provided deterrence in the sea to member countries. To
combat the threat of piracy, NATO has deployed vessels
of the Standing NATO Maritime Groups to off the coast
of Somalia and the Gulf of Aden to engage in counterpiracy activities. In Operation Ocean Shield that NATO
has been conducting since August 2009, NATO’s mission
is to carry out counter-piracy activities by boat, as well as
to help countries that requested it build up their capacities
to counter piracy. Furthermore, NATO identif es acts of
terrorism as a threat to its member countries. Following


9 CMF is a multinational force, which operates to promote maritime security, stability, and prosperity, under the U.S. Central Command. Forces from 30 countries participate in CMF, and the CMF
Commander concurrently serves as the Commander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet. CMF is comprised of three combined task forces: Combined Task Force 150 (CTF-150), which is tasked with maritime
security operations; Combined Task Force 151 (CTF-151) with counter piracy operations; and Combined Task Force 152 (CTF-152) with maritime security operations in the Persian Gulf. The Japan
Self-Defense Forces deploy units to CTF-151.

10 Fourteen European and Western Hemisphere countries, including the United States, conduct Operation Martillo to combat illicit traffi cking, including the traffi cking of narcotics, precursor chemicals,
bulk cash, and weapons, as well as organized crime along the sea areas surrounding Central America. From the U.S. Forces, Joint Interagency Task Force South under the U.S. Southern Command
carries out the operation. According to a report by the U.S. Southern Command to the House Armed Services Committee, the Operation’s accomplishments included the disruption of about 132 tons
of cocaine in FY2013.

11 A comprehensive national strategy for maritime security to integrate Department-level strategies related to maritime security and ensure their effective and effi cient implementation. This strategy
identifi es today’s threats to maritime security as: nation-state threats; terrorist threats; transnational criminal and piracy threats; environmental destruction; and illegal seaborne immigration. To
address these threats, the strategy states that the United States needs to enhance international cooperation, strengthen maritime intelligence capabilities, embed security into commercial practices,
integrate government and private sector efforts, and assure continuity of the marine transportation system.

12 Framework for Combating Piracy and Enhancing Maritime Security off the Horn of Africa: Recognizing that piracy off the coast of Somalia has grave impact on global maritime transport, this framework
states that the United States would promote measures, such as provision of persistent interdiction-capable presence at sea off the Horn of Africa, strengthening of international counter-piracy
frameworks, and appropriate law enforcement exercises.
Framework for Combating Piracy and Enhancing Maritime Security in the Gulf of Guinea: Recognizing that the Gulf of Guinea suffers from factors, including weak governance in neighboring countries,
lack of appropriate naval and law enforcement forces, and government corruption, which make the issue of piracy and maritime crime more complex and serious, this framework states that the United
States would promote measures, such as strengthening of regional maritime capacity through the provision of training and equipment, expansion of combined operations with African partners, and

among other areas. These efforts include: (1) deepening
cooperative relations with appropriate countries and
international actors, such as the EU and the United
Nations; and (2) developing fully capable, f exible, rapidly
deployable, interoperable, and sustainable maritime forces.
In addition, the Wales Summit Declaration adopted at the
NATO Summit in September 2014 states that NATO would
continue to intensify and expand its implementation of the
measures outlined in the Strategy, and further enhance the
Alliance’s effectiveness in the maritime domain.

**3** **EU**

With many of its member states facing the ocean, the EU
has high maritime traff c and economic activity in the sea.
To date, the EU has actively engaged in counter-piracy
activities off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden
in order to maintain maritime stability[13]. In June 2014,
the European Council adopted the “EU Maritime Security
Strategy,” for purposes including presenting the EU’s
framework for the development of the maritime policies
of EU member states and protecting the strategic maritime
interests of the countries. The Strategy construes piracy,
terrorism, the proliferation of WMDs, and restrictions to the
freedom of navigation as threats. It sets forth comprehensive,
cross-sectoral, coherent, and eff cient approaches to
maritime security, including: (1) Promote rules-based
good governance at sea; (2) Promote coordination amongst
member states and with other international organizations
and partners; and (3) Enhance the role of the EU as an
actor that conducts conf ict prevention, crisis response, and
management of maritime interests.


**4** **United Kingdom**

The United Kingdom is an island nation surrounded by
sea, and has a heritage of engaging actively in maritime
activities, including maritime trade. The United Kingdom
still possesses many overseas territories and has an
exclusive economic zone (EEZ) which extends about 25
times the U.K. terrestrial extent. Due to these factors, the
United Kingdom proactively deploys its forces to NATOand EU-led multinational forces[14] in order to ensure
the maritime security of the sea areas surrounding the
United Kingdom, including its overseas territories, and by
extension, the seas of its neighboring countries.
In May 2014, the U.K. government released “The UK
National Strategy for Maritime Security”[15]. The United
Kingdom considers that ensuring maritime security is


13 The EU has conducted the counter-piracy operation Operation Atalanta in this sea area, which became the EU’s fi rst maritime mission, since December 2008. Vessels and aircraft that countries deploy
escort ships, conduct patrols in these waters, among other activities.

14 The United Kingdom rotationally deploys forces to Operation Ocean Shield organized by NATO and Operation Atalanta organized by the EU. The headquarters of both operations are located at the
Northwood Maritime Command Headquarters in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom also deploys forces to CMF-led operations.

synonymous with the advancement and protection of the
United Kingdom’s national interests, at home and abroad.
Based on this recognition, the Strategy identif es objectives,
such as promoting a secure international maritime domain
and upholding international maritime norms, developing
the maritime governance capacity and capabilities of states
in areas of strategic maritime importance, and assuring the
security of vital maritime trade and energy transportation
routes. To these ends, the Strategy lists measures,
including: (1) attain a comprehensive understanding
of the maritime domain through the use of information
resources across departments and agencies, among other
means; (2) work closely with maritime partners through
championing regional initiatives as a proponent of freedom
of navigation; (3) share information with partners and
support capacity-building efforts in areas of strategic
importance; and (4) coordinate joint operations between
maritime departments and agencies and seek to procure
common equipment.


**6** **Australia**

Australia is a maritime nation surrounded by ocean, and
much of the country’s trade relies on sea transport[19]. Under
these circumstances, Australia’s security largely hinges on
regional maritime security.
In light of the above, Australia sets out the “IndoPacif c” concept and presents its commitment to
prioritizing the stability of this region in its Defence White
Paper published in 2013. In particular, in order to prevent
adversary forces from establishing a presence in Southeast
Asia and in other neighboring regions, and to maintain
stable sea lanes on which Australia depends, the Australian
Defence Force (ADF) carries out patrol activities in the
Indian Ocean, the South China Sea, and the South Pacif c
Ocean. In addition, the ADF provides patrol vessels to
South Pacif c countries[20] and mobilizes ADF assets to
guard the coasts.


**7** **China**

China also relies on sea transport for over 90% of its trade
cargo[21]. Accordingly, ensuring the security of China’s sea
lanes constitutes a critical part of the “basic safeguards for
ensuring sustainable economic and social development”[22],
one of China’s “core interests.” Therefore, as a member
of the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating
Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia
(ReCAAP)[23], China shares information and participates
in cooperative arrangements related to piracy in Southeast
Asia. Since December 2008, China has deployed naval
vessels to off the coast of Somalia and the Gulf of Aden
and has been involved in international efforts to repress
piracy. Through such activities, China has contributed to
ensuring maritime security.
Meanwhile, in the South China Sea, China and
ASEAN member states have conf icting assertions over
the sovereignty of such areas as the Spratly Islands[24]


**5** **France**


France, with its many overseas territories, is deemed to have
the second largest EEZ in the world. About 62% of this
EEZ is in the Pacif c region, and about 24% is in the Indian
Ocean. France attaches importance to its maritime strategy
in the Asia-Pacif c, identifying itself as “a sovereign power
and a player in the security of the Indian Ocean and the
Pacif c”[16]. The French Armed Forces station their units in
French territories, including Polynesia and New Caledonia,
and deploy frigates, landing ships, and other equipment.
“France and Security in the Asia-Pacif c,” which the
Ministry of Defense released in April 2014, underscores
that France is a maritime nation and has participated in
various regional cooperation forums on maritime issues[17]. It
then outlines France’s intention to build strong partnership
relations with Asia-Pacif c countries[18].


16 France identifi es itself as “a sovereign power and a player in the security of the Indian Ocean and the Pacifi c” in the French White Paper.

17 France has actively taken part in such forums as the IISS Asia Security Summit (Shangri-La Dialogue), the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium, and the South Pacifi c Defence Ministers’ Meeting.

18 For example, France and India have established a strategic partnership. They conduct joint exercises among their land, naval, and air forces, respectively, and have equipment cooperation. In addition,
France carries out close political dialogue with Malaysia and extends cooperation, including capacity-building support for the submarine unit of the Malaysian Armed Forces.

19 According to the Australian Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, between July 2012 and June 2013, Australia’s exports and imports transported by sea amounted to AUD 405.7
billion. According to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australia’s exports and imports of goods in 2012 totaled AUD 510.2 billion.

20 See Part I, Chapter 1, Section 5-3-4

21 According to the website of the Central People’s Government of China, over 90% of China’s export and import cargo, such as crude oil, iron ore, food, and container, are transported by sea.

and the Paracel Islands[25]. In recent years, the countries
concerned, including China, have stepped up their activities
to assert their sovereignty. Developments associated with
the freedom of navigation in the sea have been subject to
increasing international concern.


In January 2013, the Philippines instituted arbitral
proceedings pursuant to UNCLOS for the dispute between
the Philippines and China over its assertions and actions
in the South China Sea. In response, in February 2013,
China issued a notif cation to the Philippines stressing that
the issue be settled bilaterally and that China would not
agree to arbitral proceedings[27]. In December 2014, China
released a paper alleging that the arbitral tribunal does not
have jurisdiction over this case. That same month, Vietnam,
another contesting state, requested the arbitral tribunal to
take into consideration Vietnam’s assertions over the South
China Sea. In this regard, there has been a trend among
some countries concerned to work towards a peaceful
solution of the issue in accordance with international law.
In the Southeast Asia region, multilateral cooperation
has also made progress to deal with wide-ranging security
issues, including piracy and other transnational issues.
With regard to counter-piracy measures, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand conduct the Malacca
Strait Patrols[28]. In addition, efforts have been under way to
share information related to piracy and build a cooperation
arrangement in accordance with ReCAAP.

**1** **Outer Space and Security**


In major countries, military forces are actively
involved in outer space activities and utilize a variety of
satellites. There is no concept of national borders in outer
space, meaning that the utilization of satellites enables
the observation of, communication at, and positioning
on any area on Earth. Thus, major countries make efforts
to enhance the capabilities of a variety of satellites
and launch them for the purpose of enhancing C[4]ISR
functions[2]. Such satellites include image reconnaissance
satellites reconnoitering military facilities and targets,
satellites gathering radio wave information for military
communications, communication satellites for military

Southeast Asia is located at the crossroads of traff c, linking
the Pacif c and the Indian Oceans, such as the Straits of
Malacca and the South China Sea. This region, however,
has maritime security issues, including disputes over the
sovereignty of the South China Sea and piracy.
In 2002, ASEAN and China signed the Declaration
on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC)[26]
aimed at peacefully setting the issues over the South China
Sea. Currently, off cial consultations are held with a view
to establishing the Code of the Conduct of Parties in the
South China Sea (COC). The COC is deemed to contain
more specif c content than the DOC and be legally binding.
In addition, there have been developments related to settling
issues through arbitral proceedings set out in UNCLOS.

**Section 4 Outer Space and Security**


Nearly 60 years have passed since a satellite was launched
into outer space for the f rst time in the history of mankind.
In recent years, technology leveraging outer space has
been applied to various areas. No state is allowed to own
outer space, and it is freely available to all nations. Major
countries thus make proactive efforts to use outer space[1].
For example, meteorological and observation satellites
are used to observe weather as well as land and waters;
communication and broadcasting satellites are used for
the Internet and broadcasting; and positioning satellites
are used to navigate aircraft and ships. These satellites
have widely prevailed in social, economic, scientif c, and
other areas as essential infrastructure for the public and
private sectors.

and make its award, at the request of the other party to the dispute.

28 The Malacca Strait Patrols are comprised of: the Malacca Strait Sea Patrols which commenced in 2004 by the navies of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore to monitor piracy and other activities in
the Malacca-Singapore Strait (Thailand participated in 2008); aircraft patrol activities which commenced in 2005; and information sharing activities which commenced in 2006.

1 The Outer Space Treaty (The Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies) that came into force in
October 1967 defines such matters as the use of the Moon and other celestial bodies for peaceful purposes, the freedom in principle of exploration and use of outer space, and the prohibition of
ownership. However, no clear international agreement has been reached on the definition of outer space, though according to one of the concepts, outer space is considered space located 100 km
or further away from the Earth’s surface.

weapons systems.
On the other hand, in January 2007, China conducted an
Anti-Satellite (ASAT) test to destroy its aging satellite with
a missile launched from the Earth’s surface. The resulting
space debris[3] spread across the satellite’s orbit, which was
noted as a threat against space assets such as satellites
owned by countries. Since existing frameworks, including
the “Outer Space Treaty” that prescribes the exploration
and use of outer space, do not have provisions on avoiding
the destruction of space objects and actions triggering
debris, international efforts have been under way recently
for the creation of the “International Code of Conduct for
Outer Space Activities”[4] proposed by the European Union
(EU) and the guidelines for “Long-term Sustainability of


Outer Space Activities”[5] of the Scientif c and Technical
Subcommittee of the United Nations Committee on the
Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) which address
such matters. Moreover, countries are working on the Space
Situational Awareness (SSA)[6] by monitoring the impact of
accelerated solar activity on satellites, electronic equipment
on Earth and threats caused by meteors reaching the Earth,
in addition to threats posed by anti-satellite weapons and
space debris on space assets.
All of this shows that the risk to the stable use
of outer space has become one of the critical security
challenges countries face.

countries. Based on this understanding, the NSSS identif es
that the U.S. strategic objectives for outer space are to: (1)
strengthen safety, stability, and security in outer space;
(2) maintain and enhance the strategic national security
advantages afforded to the United States by outer space;
and (3) energize the space industrial base that supports U.S.
national security. To meet these objectives, the NSSS states
that the country will pursue the strategic approaches of
(1) promoting responsible, peaceful, and safe use of outer
space, (2) providing improved U.S. outer space capabilities,
(3) partnering with responsible nations, international
organizations, and commercial f rms, (4) preventing and
deterring aggression against space infrastructure that
supports U.S. national security, and (5) preparing to defeat
attacks and to operate in a degraded environment.
From an organizational perspective, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is
responsible for non-military space development in the
United States, while the U.S. Department of Defense
works on space development from a national security
perspective. Recently, NASA and the U.S. Air Force
announced cooperation in areas such as aircraft design
and materials development.
Major satellites used for military purposes include
satellites for image reconnaissance, early warning,
gathering radio wave information, communication, and
positioning, and their operations are wide-ranging.


**1** **United States**


The United States launched its f rst satellite, Explorer 1,
in January 1958, following the satellite launches by the
former Soviet Union. The country has since then proceeded
with a variety of space activities in f elds including military,
science, and resource exploration, such as launching the
world’s f rst reconnaissance satellite and landing on the
Moon. Today, the United States is the world’s leading
space power. Its activities cover a wide spectrum of areas
including military, social, and economic aspects, benef ting
the United States as well as the entire world[7]. In addition,
U.S. forces clearly recognize the importance of outer space
for their actions, and in this regard, actively utilize outer
space for security purposes.
In June 2010, the United States released the
“National Space Policy” that presents the country’s basic
guidelines for space policy, including its objectives and
principles. It specif ed guidelines on security space, civil
space, commercial space, and international cooperation,
among other sectors. In February 2011, the country also
released the “National Security Space Strategy” (NSSS)
as the security guideline regarding outer space, explaining
that the current and future outer space environment is
driven by three trends: (1) congestion caused by artif cial
objects including satellites; (2) contestation by potential
adversaries; and (3) increasing competition with other


Unnecessary artifacts orbiting around the Earth, including satellites no longer in use, upper stages of rockets, parts, and fragments.

In 2008, the EU formulated a draft and started bilateral discussions with major countries. Discussions have been made multilateral since 2012 and have been ongoing with a view towards its adoption.

In 2007, the chairperson of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (U.N. COPUOS) proposed to discuss “the long-term sustainability of outer space activities” in relation to
civil space activities, for the purpose of defining risk reduction for long-term sustainable activities and equal access to outer space. Based on this proposal, the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee
of U.N. COPUOS set up a working group, which carries out ongoing discussions for establishing the guidelines.

In May 2014, Gen. William L. Shelton, Commander of the U.S. Air Force Space Command, stated, “Currently, we track more than 23,000 objects in space—10 centimeters in size and larger. However,
our sensors cannot see the estimated 500,000 pieces of debris between 1 and 10 centimeters in size,” and contends that space monitoring capabilities need to be strengthened.

Russian Aerospace Defense Force[9] conducts actual space
activities for military purposes, manages facilities for
launching satellites, among other activities.
Major satellites launched by Russia are satellites for
image reconnaissance, early warning, gathering radio wave
information, communication, positioning, and others, all
of which are presumed to be used for security purposes.
Currently, Russia is developing a new Angara carrier
rocket[10], along with building a new launch site in Vostochny
in the Far East[11].


**2** **Russia**

Russia’s space activities have been continuing since
the former Soviet Union era. The former Soviet Union
successively launched multiple satellites after it launched
the f rst satellite in the history of mankind, “Sputnik 1,”
in October 1957, and had the largest number of launched
satellites in the world by the end of the collapse of the
former Soviet Union. The satellites included many military
satellites, which enabled the country to compete against
the United States for military expansion in outer space.
Russia’s space activities have declined since the former
Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. However, the country has
recently started to expand its activities once again against
the backdrop of its economic recovery.
Regarding the country’s trends in security, the
“National Security Strategy of the Russian Federation until
2020,” approved in May 2009, states that threats to Russia’s
military security include the policies of developed countries
aiming for the militarization of outer space and interference
with Russia’s space control systems. “The Military Doctrine
of the Russian Federation,” a document created in February
2010 to specif cally def ne the principles of the “National
Security Strategy” in the military f eld[8], says that securing
supremacy in outer space is one of the decisive factors
in achieving the objectives of its armed forces. It also
states that the tasks of the armed forces include providing
timely warning to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of
the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation of an air or
space attack and deploying and maintaining space systems
supporting the activities of the Russian armed forces. In
addition, it refers to the need to establish air-space defense
organizations.
From an organizational perspective, the Russian Federal
Space Agency (FSA, commonly called “Roscosmos”)
works on space activities related to Russia’s scientif c and
economic areas, while the Russian Ministry of Defense
is involved in space activities for security purposes. The


**3** **Europe**


Regarding European outer space activities, France
succeeded in launching its own satellite for the f rst time
in 1965, following the former Soviet Union and the United
States, and the United Kingdom succeeded in launching its
own satellite for the f rst time in 1971. Italy and Germany
used rockets developed by the United States to own
satellites in December 1964 and July 1965, respectively.
On the other hand, the European Space Agency (ESA)[12]
Convention signed in May 1975 established the ESA,
which launched a satellite in 1979.
In Europe, the EU, the ESA, and European countries
are promoting their own unique space activities and are
helping each other to implement space activities[13].
The ESA signed a “framework agreement” with the
EU in May 2004 to specify that they will collaborate to
proceed with space development and hold regular ministerlevel council meetings. The joint council meeting held by
the ESA and the EU in May 2007 approved the “European
Space Policy” to improve synergy effects between civil and
defense space activities, implement space activities based
on coordinated efforts among member states, and ensure an
internationally-competitive space industry.
The ESA has thus far focused on Earth observation
satellites used mainly for civil purposes, among others,
based on the contribution of funds made by ESA member


8 “The Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation” was revised in December 2014.

9 Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, announced that the “Aerospace Force” would be formed in 2015 by merging the Aerospace Defense Force with the Air Force.

10 In July 2014, the fi rst launch of Angara-1.2PP was conducted successfully. In December 2014, Angara-A5 successfully put a dummy satellite into orbit for the fi rst time. The Angara rocket is
considered the fi rst large rocket that Russia developed following the collapse of the Soviet Union. It is expected that the rocket will be launching commercial satellites and satellites for military purposes
into orbit.

11 The new launch site is being built to replace the Russian-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Russia aims to complete the site by 2020.

12 The ESA was established in May 1975 based on the ESA Convention targeting to establish a single European space organization focusing on the peaceful use of space research, technology, and
application areas. The organization was formally established in October 1980.

states. France also provided a launch site for rockets to
the ESA.
On the other hand, European countries including
France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom have
their own outer space policy and space development
organizations to launch their unique reconnaissance,
communication, and other satellites for security purposes.
It is thought that in the future, “Galileo,” a satellite
positioning system planned by the EU and the ESA;
“Copernicus,” a global-level environment and security
monitoring program; and the Multinational Space-based
Imaging System (MUSIS)[14], a reconnaissance satellite
project implemented by the European Defence Agency[15],
will be utilized for security in Europe.


by China in December 2011, clarif es the country’s major
challenges, policies, and international cooperation projects
for the coming f ve years and emphasizes the peaceful use
of space.
With regard to the organizational setup, the State
Administration for Science, Technology and Industry
for National Defense, under the Ministry of Industry
and Information Technology of the State Council,
oversees industries related to space, nuclear technology,
aviation, ships, and weapons. The China National Space
Administration enforces the administrative control of the
space area for civil and commercial purposes and represents
the Chinese Government externally.
At the same time, it is presumed that China also uses
space for information gathering, communication, and
navigationn[19] for military purposes. The Air Force has
recently indicated that it would actively pursue the use
of spacen[20]. Furthermore, “China’s National Defense in
2010,” a national defense white paper published by China in
March 2011, specif es that the country protects its security
interests in outer space in addition to its marine interests
and electromagnetic space. The white paper also states that
China will develop its defense industrial technology for its
peaceful use in the f elds of aviation and spacef ight.
In addition, China is developing new models of its
“Long March” carrier rocket series[21], and is building a
new launch site in Wenchang, Hainan Province which will
become China’s fourth launch center[22]. The launch center
under construction faces the ocean contrary to China’s
other launch sites and is located furthest south. In this
regard, some observers note that the launch site allows
launches to be conducted with a high degree of freedom[23].
Carrier rockets are developed and manufactured by
Chinese state-owned enterprises, which are thought to be
also developing and manufacturing ballistic missiles. It is
expected that China will pursue space development through
close collaboration between the public sector, military, and
private sector.


**4** **China**


China began work on space development in the 1950s. In
April 1970, the county launched its f rst satellite “Dong
Fang Hong I,” mounted on the transportation rocket “Long
March 1,” using technology enhanced through its missile
development.
China has thus far conducted manned spacef ight and
launched satellites orbiting around the Moon. According to
some observers, China’s space development is intended to
enhance national prestige and develop space resources.
China’s space development is also referred to in
“China’s Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social
Development”[16] that is reviewed every f ve years. The
latest “12th Five-Year Plan” mentions enhanced militarycivilian collaboration in the aviation and space area. In
addition, “the National Medium- and Long-Term Program
for Science and Technology Development” published by
the State Council positions manned spacef ight[17], moon
exploration[18], and high-resolution Earth observation
systems as specif c critical projects in the aerospace area.
Along with these medium- and long-term plans, “China’s

Helios 2 (a French military reconnaissance satellite), Pleiades (a French Earth imaging satellite used for military and civilian purposes), SAR-Lupe (a German group of military radar satellites), and
COSMO-SkyMed (an Italian constellation of Earth observation satellites).

15 The EDA was established in 2004 to improve Europe’s defense capabilities for crisis management purposes and to execute and maintain security and defense policies.

16 The latest plan is the 12th Five-Year Plan covering the period between 2011 and 2015 (published in March 2011).

17 China recently launched “Tiangong-1,” a space laboratory, in September 2011 and succeeded in docking it with an unmanned spacecraft, “Shenzhou 8,” in November 2011 and with the manned
spacecraft “Shenzhou 9” and “Shenzhou 10” in June 2012 and June 2013, respectively. In this regard, China is considered to have acquired the technologies needed for its space station
construction project.

18 The State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense landed the lunar explorer “Chang’e-3” on the moon in December 2013.

19 By December 2012, the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System offi cially started its services covering most of the Asia-Pacifi c region. It is reported that the BeiDou system has already started to be
mounted on navy vessels, government vessels belonging to maritime law enforcement agencies, fi shing boats, among other vessels. BeiDou offers not only positioning services but also interactive
short message features. It is suggested that these features make it possible to centrally capture and share, in real time, the position and other data related to vessels of other countries that Chinese
navy vessels have detected, and improve information gathering capabilities on the ocean and other areas.

20 In April 2014, Xi Jinping, Chairman of the Central Military Commission, inspected an Air Force agency and made reference to building an air force that “integrates air and space capabilities and
balances offensive and defensive operations.”

21 China is developing Long March-5 (for launching large satellites), Long March-6 (for launching small satellites), and Long March-7 (for launching “Shenzhou”). It is deemed that China also has plans
to develop Long March-9 (for launching ultra-large satellites) and Long March-11 (for launching small satellites).

22 In September 2014, China announced that the launch center was already ready for launching vehicles. It is deemed that the facility under construction will be able to launch larger rockets (e.g., Long
March-5) than the launch sites in China’s inland areas.

23 The launch center enables discarded stages of the rocket, such as the fi rst stage rocket, to fall into sea rather than into Chinese or other countries’ territories. It is thus suggested that the launch
center eliminates the restrictions on launches. In addition, latitudes close to the equator at which a rocket can take advantage of the force of the Earth’s rotation are generally considered favorable

China also continues to develop anti-satellite weapons.
In January 2007, the country conducted a test to destroy one
of its satellites using ballistic missile technology. In July
2014, China conducted a test not involving the destruction
of a satellite[24]. Additionally, the country is allegedly
developing equipment that uses laser beams to interfere
with satellite capabilities.


to launch positioning satellites, implement planetary
explorations, and conduct manned spacef ight[27]. In
September 2014, India’s f rst Mars orbiter was successfully
inserted into Mars orbit.


**6** **Republic of Korea**


The Republic of Korea (ROK) is considered to have started
full-scale space development by creating the f rst “Midand Long-Term Basic Plan for Space Development (19962015)” in 1996. The country has recently been promoting
space development projects in accordance with the Space
Development Promotion Act (enacted in May 2005)[28]. In
January 2013, the country succeeded in launching “Naro
(KSLV-1),” a rocket developed through a technology
cooperation agreement signed with Russia. In November
2013, the country created three key plans, including
the “Mid- and Long-Term Plan for Space Development
(2014-2040)”[29], which plans to move up the f rst launch
of rockets manufactured by the ROK to June 2020; the
“Space Technology Industrialization Strategy,” which
prompts the whole industry to lead space development;
and the “Modif cation of Korean-made rocket development
plan,” which leverages Korean-made rockets and develops
planetary and space exploration satellites and high orbit
satellites on its own.
On the security front, the ROK’s Defense White Paper
published in December 2012 states that the ROK would
secure a space surveillance system and other mechanisms
for developing the Air Force into an aerospace force, and
establish a Satellite Surveillance Control Group in order to
secure air and space operational capabilities.
On the organizational front, the ROK has the National
Space Committee, which deliberates major issues related
to space development under the leadership of the President;
and the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, which leads
research and development as an implementation agency.
Furthermore, the Korea Agency for Defense Development
is engaged in the development and use of various satellites.
Major satellites launched by the country include image
reconnaissance and communication satellites launched
using foreign rockets.


**5** **India**


India’s space development promotes space programs
aimed at social and economic development in line with
the 5-year national plan. The country’s latest 12th FiveYear Plan[25] focuses on non-military projects including
communication, positioning, Earth observation (e.g.,
disaster monitoring, resource exploration, and weather
observation), transportation systems, space science, and
spinoff promotions.
The Indian Space Commission (ISC) determines the
country’s space policy under the leadership of the Prime
Minister and assumes responsibility for preparing space
development budgets and implementing space development
programs. The Department of Space, managed by the ISC,
oversees the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO),
which implements space development policy, develops and
launches rockets, and develops and manufactures satellites.
India reportedly launches remote sensing[26] satellites
also for security purposes. In addition, the country plans


24 The February 2015 “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence notes that in July 2014, China conducted a non-destructive ASAT test. In addition, it states that China

**Section 5 Trends in Cyberspace**

**1** **Cyberspace and Security**


Owing to the advancement of information and
communications technology (ICT) in recent years,
information and communication networks such as the
Internet have become essential components across all
facets of life. Meanwhile, cyber attacks[1] against critical
infrastructures, namely, information and communication
networks, have the potential to seriously impact the lives
of individuals.
As regards the types of cyber attacks, they include
functional interference, data falsif cation, and data
theft caused by unauthorized access to information and
communication networks or through the transmission
of viruses via e-mail, as well as functional impairment
of the networks through simultaneous transmission of
large quantities of data. Internet-related technologies
are constantly evolving, with cyber attacks growing
more sophisticated and complicated by the day. The
characteristics of cyber attacks[2] include the following.
1) Diversity: Diversity of attackers, methods, purposes, and
circumstances of attacks
2) Anonymity: Easiness for attackers to hide or disguise
their identity
3) Stealth: Diff culty of detecting the presence of attacks or
even recognizing the occurrence of damage
4) Offensive dominance: Easiness to obtain means of


attack and diff culty of completely eliminating software
vulnerabilities
5) The diff culties of deterrence: Limited deterrence effects
gained through the threat of retaliatory attacks and
defense measures
For military forces, information and communications
form the foundation of command and control, which
extend from central command to ground-level forces. In
this regard, ICT advancements are further enhancing the
dependence of units on information and communication
networks. Furthermore, military forces rely on various
social infrastructures, including electricity, to execute their
missions. Accordingly, cyber attacks against such social
infrastructures could become a major impediment to their
missions. For this reason, cyber attacks are regarded as an
asymmetrical strategy capable of mitigating the strengths of
adversaries by exploiting the weaknesses of an adversary’s
forces. It is believed that many foreign military forces are
developing offensive capabilities in cyberspace. In addition,
it is said that the information and communication networks
of countries are being compromised for the purpose of
gathering intelligence.
As such, cyber security has become one of the most
important security issues for countries.

**2** **Threats in Cyberspace**


People’s Liberation Army (PLA), intelligence and security
agencies, private hackers’ groups, and companies have
been involved[4]. China is presumed to be strongly interested
in cyberspace[5]. It has been pointed out that the PLA has
organized and is training a cyber unit, and that the PLA
and security agencies are hiring IT companies’ employees


Under such circumstances, cyber attacks have frequently
been carried out against the information and communication
networks of government organizations and military forces
of various countries[3].
With regard to some of those attacks, it has been
pointed out that Chinese organizations, including the


The targets of cyber attacks are wide-ranging. Beginning with large targets, they range from: global-level targets, including interstate targets; state-level targets, including nations and government
institutions; societal-level targets, including local communities; sectoral-level targets, including business communities and infrastructure; industry-level targets, including companies and groups; and
down to minimum-level target of individuals. As such, it is said that measures to counter cyber attacks need to be optimal relative to the size of the target.

Ministry of Defense Japan, “Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace,” September 2012.

According to a statement made by the Chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security (November 2014), the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)
reports that the number of cyber attacks against the U.S. government in 2013 was 46,605. Furthermore, US-CERT responded to a total of 228,700 cyber attacks, including those against federal
agencies and companies, which was more than double the number in 2009. In addition, the February 2015 “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence states
that cyber espionage targets the U.S. government, military, and companies on a daily basis. The report presents the view that “attackers” include: (1) nation states with highly sophisticated
cyber programs (such as Russia or China); (2) nations with lesser technical capabilities but possibly more disruptive intent (such as Iran or North Korea); (3) profi t-motivated criminals; and
(4) ideologically motivated hackers or extremists.

The annual report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission of November 2014 states that the Chinese government has conducted large-scale cyber espionage against the United
States since at least the mid-2000s, and that China has compromised a range of U.S. networks, including those of the Department of Defense, defense contractors, and private enterprises. In addition,
the U.S. Department of Defense’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” of June 2014 states that the PLA continues to invest in
offensive cyber capabilities.

In a report delivered at the 18th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), then-CCP General Secretary Hu Jintao remarked that China would give serious consideration to maritime,

and hackers[6]. For example, a report published in February
2013 by a U.S. information security company concluded
that a unit belonging to the PLA had carried out cyber
attacks on companies in the United States and other
countries since 2006[7]. In May 2014, the U.S. Department
of Justice announced that it indicted off cers in Unit
61398, the Chinese PLA’s cyber attack unit, and others
for conducting cyber attacks against U.S. companies[8]. In
July 2014, the Canadian government stated that it was a
victim of cyber attacks by China, referring to China by
name for the f rst time[9].
In October 2014, the White House’s unclassif ed
information system was hacked. Russian involvement
in this incident has been suggested[10]. It has been pointed
out that the Russian military, intelligence and security
agencies, and other organizations are involved in cyber
attacks[11]. Furthermore, the Russian military is presumed
to be considering the creation of a cyber command and
recruiting hackers[12].
In March 2013, cyber attacks hit broadcasting stations
and f nancial institutions in the Republic of Korea (ROK).
In June and July 2013, cyber attacks hit the ROK President’s
Off ce, government agencies, broadcasting stations, and


newspaper companies. The ROK government has stated that
the tactics used in these incidents were the same as those
used in past cyber attacks by North Korea[13]. Furthermore,
from November to December 2014, a U.S. f lm company
was hit with cyber attacks. In December 2014, the U.S.
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that there
was suff cient evidence to conclude that the North Korean
government was responsible for these cyber attacks[14].
It has been pointed out that North Korean government
organizations are involved in such cyber attacks[15] and that
North Korea is training personnel on a national scale[16].
Stuxnet, an advanced malware with a complex
structure, was discovered in June 2010[17], followed by
discoveries of the advanced malware on multiple occasions.
Cyber attacks on the information and communication
networks of governments and militaries[18], as well as on
critical infrastructure signif cantly affect national security.
As there have been allegations of involvement of government
organizations, Japan must continue to pay close attention to
developments related to threats in cyberspace.
In September 2011, computers at Japanese private
companies producing defense equipment were found
to be infected with malware. According to the National


6 An annual report released in 2009 by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission stated that the PLA was hiring personnel with specialized skills in computers from private companies
and the academia, established an information warfare militia, and was conducting exercises using cyberspace. The report also stated that the PLA may be hiring personnel from the hacker community.

7 “APT 1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units,” released in February 2013 by Mandiant, a U.S. information security company, concluded that the most active cyber attack group targeting
the United States and other countries was Unit 61398 under the PLA General Staff Department Third Department.

8 On May 19, 2014, James Comey, FBI Director, stated that, “For too long, the Chinese government has blatantly sought to use cyber-espionage to obtain economic advantage for its state-owned
industries.” On the same day, the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that the United States “fabricated facts” and that China has decided to suspend the activities of
the Cyber Working Group established under the framework of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue.

9 According to a Canadian government release dated July 2014.

10 In October 2014, the Washington Post reported that hackers with alleged Russian government involvement conducted the cyber attack.

11 “Cyberwarfare: An Analysis of the Means and Motivations of Selected Nation States,” released in November 2004 by Dartmouth College’s Institute for Security, Technology, and Society (currently the
Institute for Security, Technology, and Society), pointed out the possible involvement of the Russian military, intelligence, and security agencies in cyber attacks.

12 In 2013, the online version of the Russian newspaper Izvestia quoted a senior Russian military official saying that the Minister of Defense had issued an order for preparing to establish a cyber
command. In October 2012, the Voice of Russia reported that the Russian Ministry of Defense had started recruiting hackers.

13 The ROK Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (MSIP) announced in its press releases in April and July 2013 the result of an investigation made by the joint response team of public-privatemilitary collaboration (composed of 18 organizations including the MSIP, the Ministry of National Defense, the National Intelligence Service, and domestic security companies). MSIP is a central
government agency overseeing administration related to science and technology policies and ICT. This agency was established in March 2013 by transferring science and technology tasks handled
by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, and part of the tasks handled by the Korea Communications Commission and the Ministry of Knowledge Economy.

14 The FBI presented the following three items as evidence. (1) The malware used in this cyber attack was similar to malware that North Korean actors previously used. (2) North Korean Internet protocol
(IP) addresses were hardcoded into the data deletion malware. (3) The tools used in the attack had similarities to a cyber attack in March 2013 against ROK broadcasting stations and fi nancial
institutions, which was carried out by North Korea.

15 In November 2013, ROK media outlets reported that the ROK National Intelligence Service made revelations about North Korean cyber warfare capabilities in the national audit of the Information
Committee of the National Assembly, and that Kim Jong-un, First Chairman of the National Defense Commission of North Korea, stated that, “Cyber attacks are omnipotent swords with their power
paralleled with nuclear power and missiles.” In the U.S. Department of Defense’s “2013 Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the Democratic People’s Republic
of Korea” published in March 2014, it is stated that North Korea probably has a military offensive cyber operations capability. The 2014 Defense White Paper published by the ROK in January 2015
notes that North Korea has concentrated on boosting its cyber unit to nearly 6,000 personnel.

16 For example, a North Korean defector association in the ROK, “NK Intellectual Solidarity,” held a seminar entitled “Emergency seminar on cyber terrorism by North Korea 2011” in June 2011, and
presented material entitled “North Korea’s cyber terrorism capabilities,” explaining that North Korean organizations conducting cyber attacks were supported by government agencies employing
superior human resources from all over the country, giving them special training to develop their cyber attack capabilities.

17 Stuxnet was the first virus program confirmed to target control systems with specific software and hardware incorporated. It is also pointed out that it has abilities to access targeted systems without
being detected and to steal information or alter systems. The discovery of various malware has also been reported: “Duqu,” discovered in October 2011; “Flame” in May 2012; “Gauss” in June 2012;
and “Shamoon” in August 2012.

18 CyberBerkut, a Ukrainian pro-Russian group, carried out cyber attacks against multiple websites of NATO in March 2014 and against the websites of the German government and the German
parliament, the Bundestag, in January 2015. In October 2014, in the midst of the large-scale demonstrations led by the pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong, the international hacker group
“Anonymous” declared that it would conduct cyber attacks against the Chinese and Hong Kong governments. Multiple websites of both governments were hit with cyber attacks. Furthermore, in
January 2015, the hacker “Cyber Caliphate,” which appears to endorse Islamic extremism, is alleged to have made fraudulent posts on the offi cial Twitter account of the U.S. Central Command, in
addition to hacking nearly 20,000 websites, including the websites of French domestic forces and private companies. As these examples demonstrate, hacker groups have carried out numerous

Police Agency, after the Japanese government made a
cabinet decision concerning the acquisition of three of the
islands of the Senkaku Islands in September 2012, cyber
attacks occurred and caused damage to at least 19 websites
of Japanese courts, administrative organizations, and
university hospitals for several days.
In addition, supply chain risks, such as companies
supplying products embedded with deliberately and
illegally altered programs, have been also pointed out[19].

**3** **Initiatives against Cyber Attacks**


Given these growing threats in cyberspace, various
initiatives are under way at the overall government level
and the ministry level, including defense ministries[20].
Analysts have raised a number of issues that need to
be dealt with to allow for an effective response to cyber
attacks, which have become a new security challenge in
recent years. For instance, there is no broad consensus on
norms related to the conduct of states in cyberspace as well
as on international cooperation. Based on this awareness
of the issues, there has been a movement to establish some
codes of conduct in cyberspace pursuant to international
consensus[21]. It has been suggested, however, that countries
have conf icting assertions, with countries such as the
United States, European countries, and Japan calling for
maintaining free and unrestricted cyberspace, while many
countries such as Russia, China, and emerging countries
call for strengthening the national control of cyberspace.

See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 1-6 (Response to Cyber Attacks)


**1** **The United States**

The International Strategy for Cyberspace released in May
2011 outlines the U.S. vision for the future of cyberspace,
and sets an agenda for partnership with other nations and
people to realize this vision. The Strategy also points out
seven policy priorities. These priorities are the economy,
protection of national networks, law enforcement, military,
Internet governance, international capacity development,
and Internet freedom.
In the United States, the Department of Homeland
Security is responsible for protecting Federal government
networks and critical infrastructure against cyber attacks,
and the Department’s Off ce of Cybersecurity and
Communications (CS&C) works to protect the networks of
government agencies.
In the National Security Strategy (NSS) which was
released in February 2015, the United States identif es
cyber attacks as one of today’s major threats. As
regards the Department of Defense’s (DoD) efforts, the
Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) published in March
2014 describes that cyber threats, which pose risks to
U.S. national interests, are composed of the activities of
a variety of actors, including individuals, organizations,
and countries, and that unauthorized access to the DoD and
industry networks and infrastructure threatens the critical
infrastructure of the United States, its allies, and partners.
Based on this understanding, the report designated the


19 In October 2012, the U.S. House Information Special Committee published an investigation report, entitled “Investigative Report on the U.S. National Security Issues Posed by Chinese
Telecommunications Companies Huawei and ZTE.” The report advised that products manufactured by Huawei Technologies and Zhong Xing Telecommunication Equipment (ZTE) (major Chinese
communications equipment manufacturers) should not be used, due to their threats to national security based on strong concerns over China’s cyber attack capabilities and intentions targeting critical
U.S. infrastructure, as well as opaque relations between Chinese major IT companies and the central government, the CCP, and the PLA augmenting supply chain risks. A similar move has been taken
by other countries, including France, Australia, Canada, India, and Taiwan. Some countries, including the United Kingdom and the ROK, have issued warnings.

20 Generally, the trends at the governmental level are thought to include the following: (1) organizations related to cyber security that are spread over multiple departments and agencies are being
integrated, and their operational units are being centralized; (2) policy and research units are being enhanced by establishing specialized posts, creating new research divisions and enhancing such
functions; (3) the roles of intelligence agencies in responding to cyber attacks are being expanded; and (4) more emphasis is being given to international cooperation. At the level of the defense
ministry, various measures have been taken, such as establishing a new agency to supervise cyberspace military operations and positioning the effort to deal with cyber attacks as an important
strategic objective.

21 The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Cyber Issues has continued to hold consultations since 2004, with the participation of experts from a total of 15 countries (a total of 20
countries since the July 2014 meeting), including Japan, the United States, Russia, and China. The GGE’s June 2013 report to the U.N. General Assembly recommends that international law, and in


-----

cyber warfare capabilities of the U.S. Forces as a critical
element to be maintained for the defense of the homeland,
and spells out that the United States continues to retain
and develop the required human resources and enhance
cyber forces.
With regard to cyber threats, “The DoD Cyber
Strategy” released in April 2015 expresses the view that
the United States faces serious cyber threats, noting that
state[22] and non-state actors intend to carry out destructive
cyber attacks against U.S. networks, as well as steal U.S.
military technology information. In this light, the DoD has
set out the following three primary missions in cyberspace:
(1) Defend the DoD networks, systems, and information;
(2) Defend the United States and its interests against
cyber attacks of signif cant consequence; and (3) Provide
integrated cyber capabilities to support military operations.
Furthermore, the DoD states that the aforementioned
cyber capabilities include cyber operations to disrupt an
adversary’s military-related systems. In order to execute
these missions in cyber space, the DoD presents the
following f ve strategic concepts: (1) Build and maintain
ready forces and capabilities to conduct cyberspace
operations; (2) Defend the DoD information network and
data, and mitigate risks to DoD missions; (3) Establish
arrangements to defend the United States and its interests
from cyber attacks of signif cant consequence through
collaboration with relevant departments and companies;
(4) Use cyber options to control conf ict; and (5) Build
close cooperative relations with allies and partners.
From an organizational perspective, U.S. Cyber
Command, a sub-unif ed command of U.S. Strategic
Command, oversees the cyber forces of the U.S. Army,
Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, and manages operations
in cyber space. Cyber Command has expanded along with
the expansion of its missions, and has already established
the “Cyber Protection Force” that operates and defends the
information infrastructure of the DoD. In addition, Cyber
Command has created the “Cyber National Mission Force”
to support U.S. defense against national-level threats,


and the “Cyber Combat Mission Force” that supports the
operations conducted by the Unif ed Command on the
cyber front. These three forces are collectively referred
to as the “Cyber Mission Force.” Multiple teams are
thought to belong to these three forces, with over ten teams
currently in operation. Furthermore, Cyber Command has
stated that 133 teams consisting of 6,200 personnel would
be created by September 2018, using National Guard and
reserve personnel[23].


**2** **NATO**


The new NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization)
Policy on Cyber Defence, and its action plan, which
were adopted in June 2011: (1) clarify the political and
operational mechanisms of NATO’s response to cyber
attacks; (2) clarify that NATO would provide assistance to
member states to develop their cyber defense, and provide
assistance to member states if they are subject to cyber
attacks; and (3) set out principles on cooperation with
partners. Furthermore, at the NATO Summit in September
2014, agreement was reached that NATO’s collective
defense applies to cyber attacks against member states.
As for its organization, the North Atlantic Council
(NAC) provides political oversight on policies and
operations concerned with NATO’s cyber defense. In
addition, the Emerging Security Challenges Division
formulates policy and action plans concerning cyber
defense. Furthermore, the NATO Cooperative Cyber
Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE) was authorized
to serve as NATO’s cyber defense-related research and
training institution. CCD COE organizes the International
Conference on Cyber Conf ict annually, as well as carries
out other activities, including commissioning experts to
compile the Tallinn Manual[24].
Since 2008, NATO has been conducting cyber
defense exercises on an annual basis to boost cyber
defense capabilities.


22 “The DoD Cyber Strategy” states that Russia and China have acquired advanced cyber capabilities and strategies. It goes on to say that Russian activities are carried out stealthily and their intentions
are diffi cult to discern. The Strategy notes that China steals intellectual property to benefi t Chinese companies. Furthermore, it states that while Iran and North Korea do not have developed cyber
capabilities, they have displayed an overt level of hostile intent towards the United States and U.S. interests.

23 Based on a statement made in April 2015 by the U.S. Cyber Command Commander to the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services.

24 In June 2013, the NATO Defense Ministers’ Meeting placed cyber attacks at the top of the agenda for the first time. They agreed to establish an emergency response team and to implement a cyber

**3** **The United Kingdom**

In November 2011, the United Kingdom announced a new
Cyber Security Strategy, which set goals for the period until
2015 and specif ed action plans for capability enhancement,
establishment of norms, cooperation with other countries,
and personnel training.
In terms of organization, the Off ce of Cyber Security
and Information Assurance (OCSIA) was established
within the Cabinet Off ce to form and coordinate cyber
security strategy for the overall government, as well as
the Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC) under the
Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) to
monitor cyberspace. The Defence Cyber Operations Group
(DCOG), which unif es cyber activities within the Ministry
of Defence, was established in April 2012 as a provisional
measure. It is scheduled to acquire full operational
capability by March 2015[25].
In January 2015, Prime Minister David Cameron and
President Barack Obama agreed to strengthen cooperation
in the area of cyber defense[26]. In such ways, the United
Kingdom is working to deepen its collaboration with
other countries.


**4** **Australia**

In January 2013, Australia published its f rst National
Security Strategy, which positions integrated cyber policies
and operations as one of the top national security priorities.
In terms of organization, the Cyber Policy Group
(CPG), which coordinates and supervises the cyber
security policies of the whole government, was established
under the Cyber Policy Coordinator (CPC). The Australian
Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) of the Australian Signals
Directorate (ASD) responds to major cybersecurity issues
on governmental agencies and critical infrastructures[27].


**5** **Republic of Korea**

The ROK formulated the National Cyber Security Master
Plan in August 2011, which clarif es the supervisory functions
of the National Intelligence Service[28] in responding to cyber
attacks. It places particular emphasis on strengthening the
following f ve areas: prevention, detection, response[29],
systems, and security base. In the national defense sector,
the Cyberspace Command was established in January 2010
to carry out planning, implementation, training, and research
and development for its cyberspace operations, and currently
serves as the division under the direct control of the Ministry
of National Defense[30].


**Section 6  Trends Concerning Military Science and Technology as**
**well as Defense Production and Technological Bases**


**1** **Military Science and Technological Trends**


Recent developments in science and technology, as
represented by the dramatic advancement of Information and
Communication Technology (ICT), has impacted a variety
of areas, triggering signif cant and revolutionary changes in
many areas such as economy, society, and lifestyle.
The military is no exception. Developed countries,
including the United States, consider that transformations
driven by advances in ICT can dramatically improve
combat and other capabilities, and therefore, continue to
pursue a variety of ICT research and policies.
For example, if information on enemy forces


collected using information-gathering systems, including
reconnaissance satellites and unmanned aircraft, is shared
on a network, command and control can be exercised
immediately, even from remote headquarters. By extension,
offensive power can be directed swiftly, precisely, and
f exibly against targets.
Major countries with sophisticated and modernized
military forces, including the United States, engage
in research and development related to improving the
destructive capabilities of weapons, precision guidance
technology, information-related technology including

**3** **The United Kingdom**

In November 2011, the United Kingdom announced a new
Cyber Security Strategy, which set goals for the period until
2015 and specif ed action plans for capability enhancement,
establishment of norms, cooperation with other countries,
and personnel training.
In terms of organization, the Off ce of Cyber Security
and Information Assurance (OCSIA) was established
within the Cabinet Off ce to form and coordinate cyber
security strategy for the overall government, as well as
the Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC) under the
Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) to
monitor cyberspace. The Defence Cyber Operations Group
(DCOG), which unif es cyber activities within the Ministry
of Defence, was established in April 2012 as a provisional
measure. It is scheduled to acquire full operational
capability by March 2015[25].
In January 2015, Prime Minister David Cameron and
President Barack Obama agreed to strengthen cooperation
in the area of cyber defense[26]. In such ways, the United
Kingdom is working to deepen its collaboration with
other countries.


**4** **Australia**

In January 2013, Australia published its f rst National
Security Strategy, which positions integrated cyber policies
and operations as one of the top national security priorities.
In terms of organization, the Cyber Policy Group
(CPG), which coordinates and supervises the cyber
security policies of the whole government, was established
under the Cyber Policy Coordinator (CPC). The Australian
Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) of the Australian Signals
Directorate (ASD) responds to major cybersecurity issues
on governmental agencies and critical infrastructures[27].


**5** **Republic of Korea**

The ROK formulated the National Cyber Security Master
Plan in August 2011, which clarif es the supervisory functions
of the National Intelligence Service[28] in responding to cyber
attacks. It places particular emphasis on strengthening the
following f ve areas: prevention, detection, response[29],
systems, and security base. In the national defense sector,
the Cyberspace Command was established in January 2010
to carry out planning, implementation, training, and research
and development for its cyberspace operations, and currently
serves as the division under the direct control of the Ministry
of National Defense[30].


**Section 6  Trends Concerning Military Science and Technology as**
**well as Defense Production and Technological Bases**


**1** **Military Science and Technological Trends**


Recent developments in science and technology, as
represented by the dramatic advancement of Information and
Communication Technology (ICT), has impacted a variety
of areas, triggering signif cant and revolutionary changes in
many areas such as economy, society, and lifestyle.
The military is no exception. Developed countries,
including the United States, consider that transformations
driven by advances in ICT can dramatically improve
combat and other capabilities, and therefore, continue to
pursue a variety of ICT research and policies.
For example, if information on enemy forces


collected using information-gathering systems, including
reconnaissance satellites and unmanned aircraft, is shared
on a network, command and control can be exercised
immediately, even from remote headquarters. By extension,
offensive power can be directed swiftly, precisely, and
f exibly against targets.
Major countries with sophisticated and modernized
military forces, including the United States, engage
in research and development related to improving the
destructive capabilities of weapons, precision guidance
technology, information-related technology including

C[4]ISR, and unmanned technology (e.g. drones[1]) to be able
to carry out more precise and effective attacks. To this end,
these countries also place emphasis on R&D activities
related to stealth technology for reducing the risk of attrition
of military power as a result of increased preemptive attacks
due to improvements in stealth capacity, and as a result
of improved survivability, and nanotechnology used for
parts and materials related to these technologies. Recently,
reports have been published of successful tests of railguns[2]
and high energy laser weapons[3] that are expected to provide
effective f repower compared to existing weapons, such as
artillery, in terms of their cost per f ring, range, precision,
promptness, among other aspects. Furthermore, there
have been reports about the development of high speed
strike weapons (HSSW) that can strike even long-range
targets with conventional weapons, quickly and with
pinpoint accuracy[4]. The Quadrennial Defense Review
(QDR), published by the U.S. Department of Defense in
March 2014, states that the proliferation of state-of-the-art
technologies[5] will transform the mode of warfare.
Recent advancements in military science and
technology[6] are also largely attributed to the advancement
of civil technology. In recent years, as the capabilities of
existing equipment are improved and new equipment is
developed, spin-on and dual-use technology[7] based on civil
technology have been leveraged frequently. In particular,
ICT-related civil technology has been applied to a variety
of equipments on a larger scale.


On the other hand, it is expected that countries having
diff culty possessing high-tech forces for technological
and economic reasons as well as non-state actors including
terrorist organizations will carry out research and
development on weapons and other equipment that will
enable them to gain superiority in f ghting against countries
with state-of-the-art technology, and illegitimately obtain
technology through ICT or other means. In short, these
countries and organizations tend to focus on asymmetrical
means of attack that can be developed or obtained with
relatively low cost, enabling them to attack their opponents’
vulnerability without using conventional military
capabilities. These asymmetrical means of attack include
weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear, chemical,
and biological weapons; ballistic missiles; terrorist attacks;
and cyber attacks.
As asymmetrical means of attack may spread
throughout the world, the research and development of
technology[8] that responds to these asymmetrical threats is
also recognized as an important challenge.

Electromagnetic railgun under development at the U.S. Offi ce of Naval Research (ONR) [ONR]


Drones for military use which have been developed include unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), unmanned maritime vehicle (UMV), unmanned surface vehicle (USV), and
unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV). It is suggested that these drones could shift from human-operated types to fully autonomous types, as known as Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS). In
May 2014, an informal meeting of the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) discussed for the fi rst time the humanitarian, legal, and other issues related to the operation
of LAWS that automatically kill an enemy without human judgment. These issues were again discussed at a meeting of the high contracting parties to the Convention in November 2014.

A railgun is a weapon that fi res bullets by using the magnetic fi eld generated from electric energy instead of gunpowder. The U.S. Forces have developed a railgun with a range of about 370km, or
about ten times that of the existing 5-inch (127mm) ammunition. A single railgun shot reportedly costs 1/20th to 1/60th the price of a missile.

The U.S. Forces are developing laser weapons to defend against small boats and strengthen low-altitude air defense capabilities, including defense against drones. From September to November
2014, a laser was test fi red onboard the USS Ponce. Observers suggest that high energy laser weapons systems would be miniaturized, with a view to placing the weapons also on light mobility
vehicles. The cost of a laser shot is reported to be less than US$1.

The goal of the HSSW is to considerably shorten the time required for attack with a conventional weapon. The HSSW is deemed to travel at a low trajectory that is clearly different from the trajectory
of ballistic missiles. According to observers, the United States and China are developing HSSWs.

The QDR describes that such technologies include “counter-stealth technology” that used to require large budgets, “automated and autonomous systems as well as robotics” that already have
a wide range of commercial and military applications, “low-cost three-dimensional printers” that could revolutionize weapons manufacturing and logistics related to warfare, and “biotechnology
breakthroughs” that could make new ways of developing weapons of mass destruction possible. The report notes that it remains unclear how these technologies will manifest on the battlefield.

In November 2014, then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel unveiled the Defense Innovation Initiative (as known as the “Third Offset Strategy”). This initiative is designed to offset an enemy’s
military superiority, such as A2/AD, with cutting-edge technology and operational concepts in which the United States has superiority. See Part I, Chapter 1, Section 1-1-4.

In the field of military technology, “spin-on” generally means applying civil technology to military technology, “spin-off” means the reverse, and “dual-use technology” means technology available for
use in both areas.

**2** **Trends Concerning Defense Production and Technological Bases**


Recently, Western countries in particular have continued to
face diff culties in signif cantly increasing defense budgets.
On the other hand, the sophistication of military science
and technology and the greater complexity of equipment,
as explained in 1 above, have escalated development and
production costs and raised unit prices for procurement,
resulting in a reduced number of procured units. Under
these circumstances, many countries are working on a
variety of initiatives in order to maintain and enhance their
national defense production and technological bases.
Western countries have set a target to increase
competitiveness through realignment of their defense
industry, based on the aforementioned situation related
to national defense budgets. The United States has seen
repeated mergers and integrations among domestic
corporations, while Europe has experienced cross-border
mergers and integrations of the defense industry, especially
in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy[9].
In response to escalating development and production
costs, Western countries are also promoting joint
development and production and technological cooperation
related to defense equipment among their allies and partners.
This move can be attributed to such factors as (1) splitting
development and production costs, (2) expanding demands
in all countries participating in joint development and
production, (3) mutual complementarity of technologies,
and (4) raising domestic technology levels by obtaining the
latest technology.
Furthermore, an international logistic support system
called “Autonomic Logistics Global Sustainment” (ALGS)
was adopted for the maintenance of the F-35 f ghter
aircraft, with the aircraft having been developed through
international collaboration. This system enables all F-35
user countries to share its parts and components globally.
The establishment of such international frameworks for
logistic support and the progress of international joint
development and production need to be observed closely.

See Part III, Chapter 2, Section 4 (Defense Equipment and Technology
Cooperation)

Countries have been exporting defense equipment
overseas since the Cold War era, and even in recent years,
many countries have been promoting a policy of overseas
exporting. As defense equipment has faced a dramatic


increase in its development and production costs, countries
aim to maintain and strengthen their domestic defense
industry by expanding demands in foreign markets
through overseas exports. Furthermore, it is considered
that countries leverage exports as a diplomatic tool
for expanding their inf uence in the export destination
countries. In addition, countries such as China and the
Republic of Korea have established the infrastructure
required to manufacture weapons through their past
imports of defense equipment and their improved
capabilities in science and technology, enabling them to
attain the status of an export country of affordable defense
equipment and to increase their export volumes.
In recent years, defense equipment exports to the
Asia-Pacif c region have increased. The underlying factors
suggested include the economic growth of the AsiaPacif c region, the greater inf uence of China, disputes
over territorial sovereignty, and addressing the enhanced
military capabilities of neighboring countries.

**Chapter** **Basic Concepts of Japan’s Security and Defense**
##### 1


**Section 1 Measures to Ensure Japan’s Security**


The independent state of a nation must be protected in order
for it to determine its own direction in politics, economy,
and society, as well as maintaining its culture, tradition, and
sense of values. However, peace, safety, and independence
cannot be secured by simply wishing for them. The
essence of national security can be found in creating an
international environment that is stable and predictable,
while preventing the emergence of threats before they occur,
through diplomacy. The reality of the current international
community suggests that it is not necessarily possible to
prevent invasions from the outside by employing only
nonmilitary means such as diplomatic efforts, and in the
event that the nation were to be invaded it would not be
able to remove such a threat. Defense capabilities are the
nation’s ultimate guarantee of security, expressing its will
and capacity to eliminate foreign invasions, and they cannot
be replaced by any other means.
For this reason, Japan is striving to develop appropriate
defense capabilities to protect the life and properties of its
nationals and to defend the territorial land, sea, and airspace
of Japan. At the same time, it is
strengthening the Japan–U.S.
Alliance[1] with the United States,
which shares basic values
and interests with Japan. The
peace and security of Japan is
ensured through developing


seamless defense measures by coupling Japan’s own defense
capabilities with the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
In addition, Japan also works domestically to enrich the
backbone of the people, which is characterized by ensuring
stable lives of the people and protecting the country,
while also working to establish a security foundation by
implementing various measures in such sectors as the
economy and education so as not to allow the chance of
an invasion.
Moreover, from the perspective of improving the
security environment surrounding Japan and preventing the
emergence of threats to Japan, the importance of the role
played by defense capabilities is increasing in cooperative
efforts as a member of the Asia-Pacif c region and the
international community.
Upon recognizing the role of defense capabilities,
Japan aims to ensure national security as well as bringing
peace and safety to the Asia-Pacif c region, and eventually
to the entire world through making its utmost efforts in a
variety of f elds.

**Section 2 Constitution and the Basis of Defense Policy**


**1** **Constitution and the Right of Self-Defense**


Since the end of World War II, Japan made a decision not
to repeat the ravages of war and has worked hard, aiming
to build a peace-loving nation. The Japanese people desire
lasting peace, and the principle of pacif sm is enshrined
in the Constitution, of which Article 9 prescribes the
renunciation of war, the possession of war potential, and
the right of belligerency by the state. Of course, since Japan
is an independent nation, these provisions do not deny
Japan’s inherent right of self-defense as a sovereign state.


Since the right of self-defense is not denied, the Japanese
Government interprets this to mean that the Constitution
allows Japan to possess the minimum level of armed force
needed to exercise that right. Therefore, Japan, under the
Constitution, maintains the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) as
an armed organization, holding its exclusively national
defense-oriented policy as its basic strategy of defense, and
continues to keep it equipped and ready for operations.

**2** **The Government’s View on Article 9 of the Constitution**


maintain its peace and security and to ensure its survival.
Such measures for self-defense are permitted only when
they are inevitable for dealing with imminent unlawful
situations where the people’s right to life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness is fundamentally overturned due to an
armed attack by a foreign country, and for safeguarding these
rights of the people. Hence, “use of force” to the minimum
extent necessary to that end is permitted. This is the basis, or
so-called the basic logic, of the view consistently expressed
by the Government to date with regard to “use of force”
exceptionally permitted under Article 9 of the Constitution,
and clearly shown in the document “Relationship between
the Right of Collective Self-Defense and the Constitution”
submitted by the Government to the Committee on Audit of
the House of Councillors on October 14, 1972.
This basic logic must be maintained under Article 9 of
the Constitution.
To date, the Government has considered that “use
of force” under this basic logic is permitted only when
an “armed attack” against Japan occurs. However, in
light of the situation in which the security environment
surrounding Japan has been fundamentally transformed
and continuously evolving by shifts in the global power
balance, the rapid progress of technological innovation,
and threats such as weapons of mass destruction, etc., in
the future, even an armed attack occurring against a foreign
country could actually threaten Japan’s survival, depending
on its purpose, scale and manner, etc.
Japan, as a matter of course, will make the utmost
diplomatic efforts, should a dispute occur, for its peaceful
settlement and take all necessary responses in accordance
with the existing domestic laws and regulations developed
based upon the constitutional interpretation to date. It is
still required, however, to make all necessary preparations
in order to ensure Japan’s survival and protect its people.
Under such recognition and as a result of careful
examination in light of the current security environment,
it has been concluded that not only when an armed attack
against Japan occurs but also when an armed attack against


**1** **Permitted Self-Defense Capability**


Under the Constitution, Japan is permitted to possess the
minimum necessary level of self-defense capability. The
specif c limit is subject to change relative to the prevailing
international situation, the level of military technologies, and
various other factors, and it is discussed and decided through
annual budget deliberations and other factors by the Diet on
behalf of the people. Whether such capability constitutes a
“war potential” that is prohibited by Article 9, Paragraph 2
of the Constitution must be considered within the context
of Japan’s overall military strength. Therefore, whether
the SDF should be allowed to possess certain armaments
depends on whether such possession would cause its total
military strength to exceed the constitutional limit.
The possession of armaments deemed to be offensive
weapons designed to be used only for the mass destruction
of another country, which would, by def nition, exceed the
minimum necessary level, is not permissible under any
circumstances. For example, the SDF is not allowed to
possess intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), longrange strategic bombers, or attack aircraft carriers.

**2** **Measures for Self-Defense Permitted under**
**Article 9 of the Constitution**


In the cabinet decision (described in the next section) made
on July 1 2014, measures for self-defense permitted under
Article 9 of the Constitution were def ned as follows;
The language of Article 9 of the Constitution appears
to prohibit “use of force” in international relations in all
forms. However, when considered in light of “the right (of
the people) to live in peace” as recognized in the Preamble
of the Constitution and the purpose of Article 13 of the
Constitution which stipulates, “their (all the people’s) right
to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” shall be the
supreme consideration in governmental affairs, Article 9 of
the Constitution cannot possibly be interpreted to prohibit
Japan from taking measures of self defense necessary to


-----

a foreign country that is in a close relationship with Japan
occurs and as a result threatens Japan’s survival and poses
a clear danger to fundamentally overturn people’s right to
life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, and when there is no
other appropriate means available to repel the attack and
ensure Japan’s survival and protect its people, use of force
to the minimum extent necessary should be interpreted
to be permitted under the Constitution as measures for
self-defense in accordance with the basic logic of the
Government’s view to date.
As a matter of course, Japan’s “use of force” must be
carried out while observing international law. At the same
time, a legal basis in international law and constitutional
interpretation need to be understood separately. In certain
situations, the aforementioned “use of force” permitted
under the Constitution is, under international law, based
on the right of collective self-defense. The Government
has reached a conclusion that although this “use of force”
includes those which are triggered by an armed attack
occurring against a foreign country, they are permitted
under the Constitution only when they are taken as
measures for self-defense which are inevitable for ensuring
Japan’s survival and protecting its people, in other words,
for defending Japan.

See Fig. II-1-2-1 (“Three new conditions” for the “use of force” as measures
for self-defense permitted under Article 9 of the Constitution)

Fig. II-1-2-1 “Three new conditions” for the “use of force” as measures for self-defense permitted under Article 9 of the Constitution

threatens Japan’s survival and poses a clear danger to fundamentally overturn people’s right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.
H When there is no appropriate means available to repel the attack and ensure Japan’s survival and protect its people.
H Use of force to the minimum extent necessary.

**3** **Basic policy**


Under the Constitution, Japan will eff ciently build a
highly effective and joint defense force in line with the
basic principles of maintaining an exclusively defenseoriented policy and not becoming a military power that
poses a threat to other countries, while f rmly maintaining
the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements and adhering to the
principle of civilian control of the military, observing the
Three Non-Nuclear Principles.


**3** **Geographic Boundaries within which the Right**
**of Self-Defense may be Exercised**

The use of the minimum necessary force to defend Japan
under the right of self-defense is not necessarily conf ned to
the geographic boundaries of Japanese territory, territorial
waters, and airspace. However, it is diff cult to give a
general def nition of the actual extent to which it may be
used, as this would vary with the situation.
Nevertheless, the Government interprets that, as
a general rule, the Constitution does not permit armed
troops to be dispatched to the land, sea, or airspace of
other countries with the aim of using force; such overseas
deployment of troops would exceed the def nition of the
minimum necessary level of self-defense.


**4** **Right of Belligerency**

Article 9, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution prescribes
that “the right of belligerency of the state will not be
recognized.” However, the “right of belligerency” does not
mean the right to engage in battle; rather, it is a general
term for various rights that a belligerent nation has
under international law, including the authority to inf ict
casualties and damage upon the enemy’s military force and
to occupy enemy territory. On the other hand, Japan may of
course use the minimum level of force necessary to defend
itself. For example, if Japan inf icts casualties and damage
upon the enemy’s military force in exercising its right of
self-defense, this is conceptually distinguished from the
exercise of the right of belligerency, even though those
actions do not appear to be different. Occupation of enemy
territory, however, would exceed the minimum necessary
level of self-defense and is not permissible.


**1** **Exclusively Defense-Oriented Policy**

The exclusively defense-oriented policy means that
defensive force is used only in the event of an attack, that the
extent of the use of defensive force is kept to the minimum
necessary for self-defense, and that the defense capabilities
to be possessed and maintained by Japan are limited to the
minimum necessary for self-defense. The policy including
these matters refers to the posture of a passive defense
strategy in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution.


-----

Prime Minister and other Ministers of State who constitute
the Cabinet be civilians. The Prime Minister, on behalf of
the whole Cabinet, holds the authority of supreme command
and supervision of the SDF. The Minister of Defense, who is
exclusively in charge of national defense, exercises general
control and supervision over the SDF duties. In addition,
the National Security Council of Japan under the Cabinet
deliberates important matters on national security.
At the Ministry of Defense, the Minister of Defense
is responsible for issues concerning national defense, and
as the head of the Ministry of Defense also controls and
manages the SDF. The Minister of Defense is assisted in
policy planning and political affairs by the State Minister
of Defense, Parliamentary Vice-Ministers (two) and the
Senior Adviser to the Minister of Defense[4].
In addition, Special Advisers to the Minister of Defense
provide the Minister of Defense with advice on important
issues under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense
based on their expertise and experience. The Defense
Council consisting of political appointees, civilian off cials
and uniformed SDF personnel of the Ministry of Defense
deliberates on basic principles concerning administrative
affairs under the Ministry’s jurisdiction. Through these
ways, the Ministry of Defense aims to further enhance the
operation of the civilian control system.
As mentioned above, the civilian control system is well
established. However, it is necessary to continue making
operational efforts in both political and administrative
aspects, along with a deep interest in defense taken by the
people, to ensure the system achieves good results.


**2** **Not Becoming a Military Power**

There is no established def nition for the concept of a
military power. For Japan, however, not becoming a military
power that could threaten other countries means that Japan
will not possess and maintain a military capability strong
enough to pose a threat to other countries, beyond the
minimum necessary for self-defense.


**3** **Three Non-Nuclear Principles**

The Three Non-Nuclear Principles refers to those of not
possessing nuclear weapons, not producing them, and not
allowing them to be brought into Japan. Japan adheres to
the Three Non-Nuclear Principles as a f xed line of national
policy.
Japan is also prohibited from manufacturing and
possessing nuclear weapons under the Atomic Energy
Basic Law[1]. In addition, Japan ratif ed the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and as a nonnuclear weapons state, has an obligation not to manufacture
and acquire nuclear weapons[2].


**4** **Securing Civilian Control**

Civilian control refers to the priority of politics to the
military or democratic political control of military strength
in a democratic state. Japan has, by giving serious ref ection
to the regrettable state of affairs that happened until the end
of World War II, adopted the following strict civilian control
system that is entirely different from the one under the former
Constitution[3]. Civilian control aims
to ensure that the SDF is maintained
and operated in accordance with the
will of the people.
The Diet, which represents
Japanese nationals, makes legislative
and budgetary decisions on such
matters as the allotted number
of the SDF personnel and main
organizations of the MOD and
the SDF. It also issues approval
for defense operations of the
SDF. The function of national
defense, as a general administrative
function, entirely falls under the
executive power of the Cabinet.
The Constitution requires that the


Minister of Defense Nakatani inspecting the honor guard ceremony carried out by the Special Guard of Honor

Article 2 of the Atomic Energy Basic Law states that “The research, development and utilization of atomic energy shall be limited to peaceful purposes, aimed at ensuring safety and performed
independently under democratic management.”

Article 2 of the NPT states that “Each non-nuclear weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes....not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices...”

The Cabinet’s control over military matters was limited.

As a part of the Reform of National Public Offi cers’ Systems, the position of Senior Adviser was newly established in each ministry, for which one offi cial may be assigned, when particularly necessary.

As the security environment surrounding Japan is becoming
increasingly severe, Prime Minister Abe resumed the
Advisory Panel on Reconstruction of the Legal Basis for
Security[1] in February 2013. The Panel was instructed to
reexamine the legal basis for security, what Japan should
do in order to maintain the peace and security of Japan,
including for the most effective operation of the Japan-U.S.
security arrangements, taking into account the changes over
the past four and a half years as well as potential changes in
the security environment in the future. Following a total of
seven meetings, in May 2014, the report was submitted to
Prime Minister Abe.
Following the Panel’s report and in accordance
with the basic orientation for the ways in which further
deliberation will take place as presented by Prime Minister
Abe, discussions had been held in the ruling parties and
examination had also been conducted by the Government.
Following this, in July 2014, a cabinet decision was made
on “Development of Seamless Security Legislation to
Ensure Japan’s Survival and Protect its People.” This
cabinet decision shows the basic policy for the development
of new security legislation, and has a historical signif cance
in further ensuring peace and security of Japan through
enhancing the deterrence and making more proactive
contributions to peace and stability of the region and the
international community.


**3** **Deliberation of Legislation Development**


In making the cabinet decision, Prime Minister Abe provided
the instruction that work must be undertaken immediately
for the development of security legislation. Based on the
instructions, a legislation drafting team was launched under
the National Security Secretariat in the Cabinet Secretariat.
In addition to this, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF
established “The Study Committee on the Development
of Security Legislation” with the Minister of Defense as
its Chairman, in order to f rmly fulf ll the role expected by
the Japanese nationals, and also conducted the deliberation
towards the development of security legislation.
The deliberations in the Government were conducted
based on the discussions in the ruling parties. A total of
25 meetings were held for discussions in the ruling parties
since May 2014, and in the course of these discussions,
the “basic direction for the development of security
legislation” was presented on March 20, 2015. Based on
further discussions in the ruling parties, the Government
conducted its own deliberations and, on May 14, 2015,
made cabinet decisions on two bills, the Bill for the
Development of Legislation for Peace and Security[2] and
the International Peace Support Bill[3]. The two bills were
submitted them to the 189th ordinary session of the Diet on
May 15. On May 19, the House of Representatives decided
to establish a Special Committee on Legislation for Peace
and Security of Japan and the International Community for
deliberation on these bills.

See Appendix 3 (Matrix of the Legislation for Peace and Security)


**2** **Outline of the Cabinet Decision**

The cabinet decision states that it is necessary to develop
domestic legislation that enables seamless responses in
order to resolutely secure the lives and peaceful livelihood
of its people under any situation and contribute even more
proactively to the peace and stability of the international
community under the policy of “Proactive Contribution to
Peace” based on the principle of international cooperation.
The decision also sets the basic policies, as shown in
Reference 6, regarding response to an infringement that
does not amount to an armed attack, further contributions


The Panel submitted its report to then Prime Minister Fukuda in June 2008. The report submitted in June 2008 examined four cases ((1) Defense of U.S. vessels on the high seas; (2) Interception of
ballistic missiles that may be on their way to the U.S.; (3) Use of weapons in international peace operations; and (4) Logistic support for the operations of other countries participating in the same PKO).
In this report, it was proposed the view that the previous offi cial interpretation of Article 9 of the Constitution was becoming no longer applicable in light of the radically changing international situation
and the international status of Japan, and that Article 9 of the Constitution should be interpreted as it would not prohibit either the right of individual self-defense, the right of collective self-defense
and participation in the United Nation’s Collective Security measures.

Bill for Partial Amendments to the Self-Defense Forces Law and Other Existing Laws for Ensuring Peace and Security of Japan and the International Community.

|1. Response to an Infringement that Does Not Amount to an Armed Attack H Under the basic policy that relevant agencies including the police and Japan Coast Guard are to respond in close cooperation in accordance with their respective duties and authorities, the Government will further strengthen necessary measures in all areas, including enhancing the respective agency’s response capabilities and strengthening collaboration among agencies. In cases of responding to a situation where police forces are not present nearby or police agencies cannot respond immediately, the Government will consider measures for issuing orders swiftly and accelerating procedures for public security operations or maritime security operations. H The Government will develop legislation that enables the SDF to carry out very passive and limited “use of weapons” to the minimum extent necessary to protect weapons and other equipment of the units of the United States Armed Forces, if they are, in cooperation with the SDF, currently engaged in activities that contribute to the defense of Japan (including joint exercises), in line with the provisions of Article 95 of the SDF Act, premised on request or consent by the United States.|Col2|Legislation Development|

|2. Further Contributions to the Peace and Stability of the International Community A. So-called Logistics Support and “Ittaika with the Use of Force” (*1) H The Government takes the recognition that Japan’s support activities such as supply and transportation conducted at a place which is not “the scene where combat activities are actually being conducted” by a foreign country are not regarded as “ittaika with the use of force” by that country. From the viewpoint of the following positions which is based on that recognition, the Government will proceed with developing legislation which enables necessary support activities for the armed forces of foreign countries engaging in activities for ensuring Japan’s security or for the peace and stability of the international community. H Japan does not conduct support activities in “the scene where combat activities are actually being conducted” by armed forces of a foreign country to which Japan provides support. H Japan will immediately pause or cease support activities if the place where Japan is conducting support activities becomes “the scene where combat operations are actually being conducted” due to changes of the situation. B. Use of Weapons Associated with International Peace Cooperation Activities The Government will proceed with developing legislation based on the following positions in order to enable the SDF’s use of weapons associated with so-called “kaketsuke-keigo” and the “use of weapons for the defense of mandate” in international peace cooperation activities that do not invoke “use of force” including U.N. peacekeeping operations as well as police-like activities that do not invoke “use of force” including the rescuing of Japanese nationals with a consent from the territorial State. H As for U.N. peacekeeping operations, etc., under the framework of the Five Principles for PKOs, “a quasi-state organization” (*2) other than parties to the confl ict who have given consent of acceptance is, in principle, not expected to appear as an adversary. H When the SDF units conduct police-like activities that do not involve “use of force” including the rescuing of Japanese nationals in a foreign country based on the consent of the territorial State’s Government, it is natural that the activities be conducted in the area within which the consent of the territorial State’s Government is valid, i.e. the area within which its authority is maintained. This means that no “quasi-state organization” exists in that area. H The Cabinet will make a decision on whether the consent of acceptance is stably maintained or the area within which the consent of the territorial State’s Government is valid, etc. based on deliberations etc. at the National Security Council.|||

|3. Measures for Self-Defense Permitted under Article 9 of the Constitution H The Government believes that not only when an armed attack against Japan occurs but also when an armed attack against a foreign country that is in a close relationship with Japan occurs and as a result threatens Japan’s survival and poses a clear danger to fundamentally overturn people’s right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, and when there is no other appropriate means available to repel the attack and ensure Japan’s survival and protect its people, use of force to the minimum extent necessary should be interpreted to be permitted under the Constitution as measures for self-defense in accordance with the basic logic of the Government’s view to date. H The aforementioned “use of force” permitted under the Constitution is, under international law, based on the right of collective self-defense. Although this “use of force” includes those which are triggered by an armed attack occurring against a foreign country, they are permitted under the Constitution only when they are taken as measures for self-defense which are inevitable for ensuring Japan’s survival and protecting its people, in other words for defending Japan. H The Government will stipulate in the draft legislation that the prior approval of the Diet is in principle required upon issuing orders for operations to the SDF for carrying out “use of force” permitted under the Constitution when an armed attack occurs not against Japan but against a foreign country, in the same manner as the procedures related to defense operations stipulated in the current laws and regulations.|||

Fig. II -1-3-1 Outline of the Cabinet Decision


Notes: 1. As for Japan’s support activities, however, legal frameworks limiting the area of such activities to “rear area” or so-called “non-combat area,” etc. have been established in past legislations to
ensure that the issue of “ittaika with the use of force” (forming an “integral part” of the use of force) does not arise, in relation to Article 9 of the Constitution. This is intended to avoid Japan
from being legally evaluated as carrying out by itself the “use of force” which is not permitted under the Constitution because its support activities would form an “integral part” of the use of
force (“ittaika with the use of force”) by other countries.
2. Use of weapons associated with so-called “kaketsuke-keigo” (coming to the aid of geographically distant units or personnel under attack) or “use of weapons for the purpose of the execution
of missions” could constitute the “use of force” prohibited by Article 9 of the Constitution, if such use of weapons is directed against “a state or a quasi-state organization.”

national and local governments in the event of an armed
attack situation. Moreover, in preparation for the outbreak
of armed attacks, a framework is being developed which
allows relevant organizations (designated government
institutions, local governments and designated public
institutions[11]) to implement response measures in a
coordinated and cooperative fashion based on individual
legislations dealing with military emergencies such as the
Civil Protection Act, thereby the whole nation can fully
prepare for armed attack situations.

of the country, and to maintain the security of the country
and its people.


**(3) Initiatives for Civil Protection**
A. Basic Guidelines for Civil Protection and the Roles of the
Ministry of Defense and the SDF
In March 2005, the Government established the Basic
Guidelines for Civil Protection (hereinafter the “Basic
Guidelines”), based on Article 32 of the Civil Protection
Act. The Basic Guidelines presumes four types of armed
attack situations, including amphibious landing invasion,
guerilla or special operations forces unit attacks, ballistic
missile attacks, and air attacks, and prescribes matters
requiring attention to implement civil protection measures


12 An emergency response situation (a situation arising due to actions that may kill or injure many people which uses methods equivalent to those used in an armed attack situation, or a situation where
it is recognized that the relevant actions represent a clear and present threat that necessitate an emergency response by the state). Alternatively, a contingency situation other than an armed attack


-----

in response to each of them.
The MOD and the SDF established the Civil Protection
Plan based on the Civil Protection Act and the Basic Policy.
The Plan included measures to be implemented in full force
by the SDF to terminate armed attacks, which is a primary
mission of the SDF. In addition, the Plan described civil
protection measures to be implemented within a feasible
range, relating to support for evacuation and rescue, and
responses to armed attack disasters.
In the event of an armed attack situation and an
emergency situation, the SDF has the authority to conduct
such activities as protection and support of residents,
including rescuing evacuees, and emergency recovery as a
civil protection measure and emergency response protection
measure based on the provision for civil protection.

by the National and Local Governments (FY 2014))

(b) Coordination with Local Governments in Peacetime
During peacetime, the MOD and the SDF closely
coordinate with local governments. The Provincial
Liaison & Coordination Division has been posted within
the GSDF Regional Army Headquarters to achieve effective
implementation for civil protection measures through
close coordination. To strengthen functions relating to
coordination and cooperation with local governments, etc.,
a Civil Protection and Disaster Countermeasures Liaison
Coordination Off cer post was established in each SDF
Provincial Cooperation Off ce.
Civil Protection Councils were established in prefectures
and municipalities as institutions to gather opinions from a
wide range of citizens, and members of the Ground, Maritime
or Air Self-Defense Force were assigned to be council
members. In addition, in some cases, retired SDF personnel
are employed by local governments as crisis management
supervisors to facilitate cooperation with the MOD and the
SDF and help to conceive and implement disaster response
plans and training programs as experts on civil protection.

**Ship Inspection Operations Act**


The Law Concerning Measures to Ensure Peace and
Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding
Japan establishes the measures (response measures)[13]
that Japan will implement in response to situations in
areas surrounding Japan and the actual implementation
procedures. The Ship Inspection Operations Act provides
for the types, measures, and other matters of ship inspection
operations implemented by Japan in response to situations
in areas surrounding Japan.
H The Prime Minister, facing a situation in areas
surrounding Japan and deeming it necessary to adopt
measures including such SDF activities as rear area
support[14], rear area search and rescue operations, and
ship inspection operations, must request a Cabinet
decision on such measures and on a draft basic plan of
response measures. The Prime Minister must obtain prior
approval, or ex post facto approval in case of emergency,
from the Diet in order for the SDF to conduct response
measures. Furthermore, the Prime Minister reports to


B. Activities by the MOD and the SDF to Facilitate the Civil
Protection Measures
(a) Participation in Training for Civil Protection
In order to appropriately and promptly implement civil
protection measures in armed attack situations, it is
essential to jointly coordinate matters related to the
implementation of civil protection measures in peacetime
with other ministries and agencies, local governments, and
other relevant organizations.

decision or approved a revision, or when the response
measures have been completed.
H In accordance with the basic plan, the Minister of Defense
will draw up an implementation guideline (including
designation of implementation areas), obtain approval for
the guideline from the Prime Minister, and give the SDF
orders to conduct rear area support, rear area search and
rescue activities, and ship inspection operations.
H Heads of relevant administrative organizations will
implement response measures and may request the
heads of local governments to provide the necessary
cooperation for the organizations to exercise their
authorities in accordance with relevant laws and
regulations and the basic plan. In addition, the heads of
relevant administrative organizations may ask persons
other than those from the national government to
cooperate as necessary in accordance with relevant laws
and regulations and the basic plan[15].

**(1) Rear Area Support**
Rear area support means support measures, including the
provision of goods, services, and conveniences, given by
Japan in rear areas to the U.S. Forces conducting activities
that contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty in situations in areas surrounding
Japan. As rear area support, the SDF provides goods and
services, including supplies, transportation, repair and
maintenance, medical activities, communications, airport
and seaport, and base services.


**(3) Ship Inspection Operations**
Ship inspection operations mean operations conducted by
Japan in situations in areas surrounding Japan to inspect and
conf rm the cargo and destination of ships (excluding warships
and others[17]) and to request, if necessary, a change of sea
route, or destination port or place, for the purpose of strictly
enforcing the regulatory measures concerning trade or other
economic activities to which Japan is a party. These activities
are conducted based on the U.N. Security Council Resolution
or the consent of the f ag state[18] in the territorial waters of
Japan or in the surrounding high seas (including the EEZ[19])[20].

**3** **Outline of the International Peace Cooperation Act**


The purpose of the Act on Cooperation with United Nations
Peacekeeping Operations and Other Operations, enacted in
1992, is to set forth a framework for the implementation
of International Peace Cooperation Assignments, with a
view to extending appropriate and prompt cooperation
for (1) U.N. peacekeeping operations[21], (2) humanitarian
international relief operations[22], and (3) international
election observation operations, and to take measures to
extend Contributions in Kind for those operations, thereby
enabling active contribution by Japan to international peace
efforts centering upon the United Nations.
The law stipulates a set of basic guidelines (so-called
f ve principles for participation) for Japan’s participation in
a U.N. peacekeeping force.

See Fig. II-1-3-19 (Basic Policy on Japan’s Participation in U.N. Peacekeeping

**Section 1 Outline of the National Security Strategy**


**1** **National Security Council**


The National Security Council[1] that deliberates Japan’s
basic foreign and defense policies with regard to national
security such as the National Security Strategy (NSS)
is established within the Cabinet, and the MOD and
other related administrative organs provide the National
Security Council with data and information pertaining to
national security in a timely manner. The National Security
Secretariat established within the Cabinet Secretary
provides constant support to the National Security Council,
and some MOD members, including uniformed SDF
personnel, are working at additional posts at the National


Security Secretariat.
Moreover, in December 2014, the Act on the protection
of Specially Designated Secrets (SDS)[2] came into effect,
resulting in development of common governmental
rules for the protection of secrets and more effective and
eff cient National Security Council deliberations. It is
also expected that the Act would enhance the reliability
of Japan’s management of highly classif ed information
related to national security and promote the further sharing
of information among countries concerned.

**1** **Japan’s National Security Policy Framework**


The NSS represents Japan’s f rst-ever basic policy on
national security with a focus on diplomatic affairs and
defense policy. The NSS def nes approaches that Japan
should follow based on a long-term view of its national
interests. It replaces the Basic Policy on National Defense,
which had served as the basis for Japan’s defense policies
theretofore. The National Defense Program Guidelines
(NDPG), which was established based on the NSS,


Established based on the Act of Partial Revision of the Establishment of the Security Council (enacted in November 2013)

In order to protect information, in particular highly classifi ed information, on Japan’s defense and foreign affairs, and prevent designated harmful activities (e.g. counter-intelligence) and terrorism,
the act stipulates: (1) designation of SDS by the heads of administrative organs; (2) security clearance for personnel that handle SDS in their duties; (3) establishment of a framework for providing or

achieve the defense capability targets def ned in the NDPG.
The f scal year budget is drawn on the MTDP substantiated
as projects, and the necessary expenses for each f scal year
will be appropriated based on relevant situations.
To date, the NDPG has contained mention of nationwide basic security policies focusing on defense policy to
a certain extent. The NSS carries with it great meaning as
the def nitive statement of the Government’s basic policy
on national security, with a focus on diplomatic affairs and
defense policy.

rules and universal values, such as freedom, democracy,
respect for human rights, and the rule of law.
In order to safeguard these national interests and
to fulf ll Japan’s responsibilities in the international
community, Japan will work to achieve the following
national security objectives.
H Strengthen the deterrence necessary for maintaining
Japan’s peace and security and for ensuring its survival,
thus deterring threats from directly reaching Japan, and
defeating such threats and minimizing damage if by
chance such threats should reach Japan.
H Improve the security environment of the Asia-Pacif c
region and prevent the emergence of and reduce direct
threats to Japan, through strengthening the JapanU.S. Alliance, enhancing the trust and cooperative
relationships between Japan and its partners within and
outside the Asia Pacif c region, and promoting practical
security cooperation.
H Improve the global security environment and build a
peaceful, stable and prosperous international community
by strengthening the international order based on
universal values and rules, and by playing a leading role
in the settlement of disputes.

**(2) Security Environment Surrounding Japan and**
**National Security Challenges**

a. Global Security Environment and Challenges
While China, India, and other developing nations rise, the
U.S. has clarif ed its policy to shift its policy emphasis
towards the Asia-Pacif c region, and as such the balance
between countries is changing. Rapid advancements in
globalization and technological innovation have increased
the relative inf uence of non-state-actors, and at the same
time, they have led to an increase in terrorism and criminal
threats from non-state actors.
Issues including the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction (WMD) by North Korea, Iran, and other
countries and regions are major threats to Japan and the
international community
In addition, acts of terrorism have injured Japanese
nationals and damaged Japan’s national interests. This
means that Japan and its people are directly exposed to the
threat of international terrorism at home and abroad.
With regard to global commons, the risks of free access
to and utilization of global commons such as seas, outer
space, and cyberspace being hindered are becoming more
and more serious. These risks include unilateral attempts to
change the current status quo of the maritime aspect of the
global commons by force, threat of anti-satellite weapons,
and cyber attacks.
Global issues that cannot be dealt with by a single
country, including poverty and humanitarian crises
are emerging as critical and urgent issues of human
security. Additionally, there is a growing risk that one
country’s economic crisis can expand to involve the
entire global economy

**(1) Fundamental Principle of National Security**
a. Principles Japan Upholds – Proactive Contribution to
Peace based on the Principle of International Cooperation
Japan is committed to continuing the path it has followed
to date as a peace-loving nation and, as a major player in
international politics and business, it also seeks its own
security as well as peace and security in the Asia-Pacif c
region from its stance as a proactive contributor to peace
based on the principle of international cooperation. Japan will
contribute more proactively than ever before to the peace,
security and prosperity of the international community.
b. Japan’s National Interests and National Security Objectives
In achieving the aforementioned fundamental principle of
national security by implementation of concrete policies,
the following national interests need to be clearly def ned.
H To maintain its sovereignty and independence; to defend
its territorial integrity, to ensure the safety of life, person
and properties of its nationals, and to ensure its survival
while maintaining its own peace and security grounded
in freedom and democracy and preserving its rich culture
and tradition;
H To achieve the prosperity of Japan and its nationals
through economic development, thereby consolidating
its peace and security; and
H To maintain and protect international order based on

Fig. II-2-1-3 Outline of Japan’s Strategic Approach to National Security


**1. Strengthening and Expanding Japan’s Capabilities and Roles**

❍ Advance vibrant diplomacy in order for Japan to play a more proactive role in achieving peace, stability and prosperity for the international community and to realize an
international order and security environment desirable for Japan.
H Effi ciently develop a highly effective and joint defense force, and operate with fl exibility and readiness based on joint operations; build in peacetime a comprehensive
architecture for responding seamlessly to an array of situations; reinforce structure prioritizing important functions from a joint and comprehensive perspective of the SDF,
which plays a central role in the above initiatives; closely cooperate with the U.S. with regard to extended deterrence in response to the threat of nuclear weapons, and
Japan’s own initiatives, including ballistic missile defense (BMD) and the protection of its people.
H Enhance capabilities of law enforcement agencies responsible for territorial patrols and reinforce maritime surveillance capabilities; strengthen coordination among
relevant ministries and agencies; carry out constant review on issues that are relevant to ensuring the security of Japan’s territories, and take effective measures.
H As a maritime state, play a leading role in maintaining and developing “Open and Stable Seas” (*1); strengthen Japan’s maritime surveillance capabilities, including the
use of outer space; provide assistance to coastal states along sea lanes from the Middle East to the surrounding waters of Japan that are critical to Japan due to its
dependence on maritime transport, in order to enhance their maritime security capabilities; strengthen cooperation with partners that share the same strategic interests.
H Reinforce Japan’s national capabilities for protection of cyber space and response to cyber attacks; in peacetime, strengthen public-private partnerships; consider
expansion of the pool of human resources in the security fi eld; strengthen international cooperation and promote cyber defense cooperation.

analysis of intelligence relating to the state of international terrorism.
H Fundamentally strengthen Japan’s information-collecting capabilities from a diverse range of sources; utilize geospatial intelligence which combines various types of
intelligence; promote comprehensive analysis of intelligence by developing highly-skilled intelligence experts.
H While giving due consideration to the roles that the Three Principles of Arms Exports have played thus far, defi ne clear principles on the overseas transfer of arms suited to
the new security environment (*2).
H Enhance and reinforce the functions of information-gathering satellites; make effective use of satellites in areas such as SDF unit operation and collection, and analysis of
information; enhance a system for space situational awareness; promote utilization of outer space in a manner that contributes to national security.
H Strengthen Japan’s technological capabilities including dual use technologies; grasp science and technology trends in peacetime, and make effective use of technology in
the area of national security by combining the efforts of industry, academia, and the government.

**2. Strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance**

H Revise the Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation; work closely with the U.S. on operational cooperation and policy coordination; enhance the deterrence and
response capability of the Japan-U.S. Alliance by strengthening cooperation in a wide range of areas, including BMD, maritime affairs, outer space, cyber space, and
large-scale disaster response operations.
H Implement measures to reduce the cost burden of the U.S. Forces in Japan; steadily implement measures on the realignment of the U.S. Forces in Japan in order to
reduce impacts placed on local communities, including in Okinawa, while continually maintaining and enhancing the deterrence of the Japan-U.S. Alliance.

**3. Strengthening Diplomacy and Security Cooperation with Japan’s Partners for Peace and Stability in the International Community**

H The ROK, Australia, ASEAN menber states, and India: Strengthen cooperative relations with these countries with which Japan shares universal values and strategic interests.
H China: Construct and strengthen a Mutually Benefi cial Relationship Based on Common Strategic Interests; encourage China to play a responsible and constructive role for
the sake of regional peace, security and prosperity; fi rmly but in a calm manner respond to China’s attempts to change the current status quo by coercion.

b. National Security Environment and Challenges in the
Asia-Pacif c Region
Against the backdrop of the existence of various political
systems, the concentration of nation states that possess
large-scale military force, including nuclear weapons,
and the insuff ciently legislated regional cooperation
frameworks on national security, so-called “gray-zone”
situations, that is, neither pure peacetime nor contingencies
over sovereignty of the territory or vested interests, are
likely to arise, and this risks further aggravation of the
situation.
North Korea has enhanced the capability of its WMDs
including nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles as well
as repeatedly carried out provocative military actions,
increasing tension in the region.
While there is an expectation for China to share and


comply with international norms, and play a more active
and cooperative role for regional and global issues, it has
been rapidly strengthening and expanding its military
capabilities without suff cient transparency, taken actions
that can be regarded as attempts to change the current status
quo in the seas including the East China Sea and South China
Sea, and rapidly expanded and intensif ed its activities in
the seas and airspace around Japan. In addition, there is a
mutual existence of stability and potential instability in the
relationship between the sides of the Taiwan Strait.

**(3) Japan’s Strategic Approach to National Security**
Japan should take a strategic approach centering on diplomatic
policy and defense policy as shown in the reference.

See Fig. II-2-1-3 (Outline of Japan’s Strategic Approach to National Security)


**Section 2 Outline of the National Defense Program Guidelines**


**1** **Basic Approach – Building a Dynamic Joint Defense Force**


The NDPG calls for the building of a Dynamic Joint
Defense Force as the cornerstone for the protection of
Japan’s peace and security.
Amid the increasingly severe security environment
surrounding Japan, the number and the duration of situations,
including so-called “gray-zone” situations, that is, neither
pure peacetime nor contingencies over sovereignty of
the territory or vested interests, which require the SDF’s
commitment are both increasing. Therefore, it is essential
to regularly conduct persistent intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance (ISR) activities and swiftly build a
response posture in accordance with the development of
the situation to prevent further escalation of a situation. In
dealing with such situations, it is also essential to minimize
the damage by dealing with situations by effective response
through achieving necessary maritime supremacy[1] and
air superiority[2]. Among these situations, the quality and
quantity of the defense force underpinning the SDF
activities were not necessarily suff cient.
The NDPG, being fully mindful of these needs, calls
for the enhancement of deterrence and response capability
by pursuing further joint operations, improving the missioncapable rate of equipment and its employment to conduct
activities, as well as developing defense capabilities

1 See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 1 (Effective Deterrence and Response)


adequate both in quality and quantity that underpin various
activities. To this end, Japan has conducted capability
assessments based on joint operations in relation to the
SDF’s total functions and capabilities, in order to identify the
functions and capabilities that should be comprehensively
prioritized. The NDPG carries great signif cance as it has
made it possible to adapt to an ever-changing security
environment surrounding Japan, and realize a more
prioritized and eff cient defense capability build-up, based
on the results of these capability assessments.
Additionally, it requires the build-up of the most
effective operational posture, by further strengthening a
wide-ranging logistical support foundation. Specif cally,
the new NDPG calls for the strengthening of various f elds
as the basic foundations for the SDF such as training
and exercise, operational infrastructure, personnel and
education, medical, defense production and technological
bases, eff cient acquisition of equipment, research and
development, collaboration with local communities,
boosting of communication capabilities, enhancement
of the intellectual base, and promotion of reform of the
Ministry of Defense.

there is a growing risk that unrest in the global security
environment or a security problem in a single country
or region could immediately expand among the entire
international community. Moreover, there are shifts in
the balance of power due to the further development of
countries such as China and India and the relative change
of inf uence of the U.S., along with an increase in the
number of so-called “gray-zone” situations, that is, neither
pure peacetime nor contingencies, and cases of undue
infringement upon freedom of the high seas. In addition,
securing the stable use of outer space and cyberspace is
becoming a signif cant challenge.


**2** **The Security Environment in the Asia-Pacifi c Region**

While countries are enhancing and strengthening their
cooperative relationships, gray-zone situations tend to
linger, raising concerns that they may develop into more
serious situations.
North Korea has deployed a massive military force
and continues to maintain and strengthen its asymmetrical
military capabilities. Furthermore, North Korea has also
repeatedly taken actions that heightened tension in the
region. In particular, with regard to nuclear and missile
development, North Korea is planning to make technological
improvements to extend the range and increase the accuracy
of its ballistic missiles. The possibility cannot be ruled out
that it has successfully miniaturized nuclear weapons for
warheads and equipped them on ballistic missiles. As such,
this issue poses a serious and imminent threat to Japan’s
security, coupled with its provocative rhetoric and behavior
such as suggesting a missile attack on Japan.
As for China, while it is greatly expected to play
an active role in a more cooperative manner, its military
trends have caused security concerns for the Asia-Pacif c
region and the international community. The trends include
continuous increases in its defense expenditures at a high


**3** **Japan’s Geographical Characteristics**


As Japan is a maritime state, securing the safety of
maritime and air traff c through strengthening an “Open
and Stable Seas” order constitutes the basis of peace and
prosperity. Japan also faces security vulnerabilities such
as frequent natural disasters, concentration of population,
and a large number of nuclear power plants in coastal
areas. In the event of another massive earthquake like the
Great East Japan Earthquake, its impact may spread to
the international community. It is increasingly necessary
to take every possible measure to prepare for future huge
earthquakes such as a Nankai Trough earthquake.


**4** **Issues to be Tackled by Japan**


As various security challenges and destabilizing factors
are emerging and becoming more tangible and acute,
the security environment surrounding Japan has become
increasingly severe, and it is diff cult for a single country
to deal with them on its own. Therefore, it is increasingly
necessary that countries which share interests in responding
to shared security and other challenges cooperate and
actively respond to maintain regional and global stability.

**3** **Japan’s Basic Defense Policy**


oriented policy, not becoming a military power that poses
a threat to other countries, while adhering to the principle
of civilian control of the military and observing the Three
Non-Nuclear Principles.
Additionally, with regard to the threat of nuclear
weapons, the extended deterrence provided by the U.S.
is indispensable. Japan will closely cooperate with the
U.S., and take appropriate responses through its own
efforts. In addition, Japan will play a constructive and
active role in international nuclear disarmament and
non proliferation efforts


**1** **Basic policy**

In light of the National Security Strategy, Japan will build a
comprehensive defense architecture, and actively promote
bilateral and multilateral security cooperation with other
countries while strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance,
thereby seeking to establish an infrastructure necessary for
fully exercising its defense capabilities.
Under the Constitution, Japan will eff ciently build
a highly effective and joint defense force in line with the
basic principles of maintaining an exclusively defense


-----

strengthen and expand the Japan-U.S. cooperative
relationship over a broad range of f elds, including
intelligence, and defense equipment and technology.

**(3) Steady Implementation of Measures Relating to the**
**Stationing of the U.S. forces in Japan**

Japan will provide stable support for the smooth and
effective stationing of the U.S. Forces in Japan. At the
same time, efforts will be made to steadily implement the
realignment of the U.S. Forces in Japan and mitigate the
impact on Okinawa and other local communities while
maintaining the deterrence provided by the U.S. Forces.


**2** **Japan’s Own Efforts**

Given the increasingly severe security environment, Japan
will eff ciently develop a highly effective joint defense
force and make efforts to employ it with a high level of
f exibility and readiness based on joint operations. In
the event of various situations, Japan will appropriately
and promptly make decisions and seamlessly respond to
situations as they unfold, in a whole-of-the-government
approach, in coordination with local governments, private
sectors, and others.
Furthermore, Japan will continue to develop various
systems to respond to a variety of disasters and protect
its people, and will enhance the capability to ensure the
safety of Japanese nationals in foreign countries in an
emergency situation.
In order to take such approaches appropriately, Japan
will increase the effectiveness of its situation and disaster
response posture by systemizing various related plans and
expanding the use of simulations, comprehensive training,
and exercises.
Furthermore, Japan will make efforts to build up a
Dynamic Joint Defense Force as mentioned above, in addition
to the establishment of a comprehensive defense architecture.


**4** **Active Promotion of Security Cooperation**

**(1) Cooperation in the Asia-Pacifi c Region**
Japan will promote a variety of cooperative initiatives
in a multi-layered manner to ease the atmosphere of
confrontation and the sense of curiosity toward one another
in the Asia-Pacif c region. In particular, with regard to the
Republic of Korea (ROK), Australia and India, Japan will
make efforts to improve cooperation and interoperability.
Japan will also endeavor to promote dialogue and exchanges
with China and Russia.
Additionally, with regard to capacity building
assistance, Japan will promote and carry it out in full
coordination with diplomatic policy initiatives, including
Off cial Development Assistance (ODA), and Japan will
expand the range of countries receiving support as well as
its scope.
Furthermore, in multilateral security cooperation and
dialogue, Japan, in cooperation with the U.S. and Australia,
will proactively contribute to building cooperative
relationships in the region, and Japan will actively
participate in multilateral joint training and exercises.


**3** **Strengthening of the Japan-U.S. Alliance**

The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, together with
Japan’s own efforts, constitute the cornerstone for Japan’s
national security. Also, the Japan-U.S. Alliance functions as
public goods that contribute to the stability and prosperity
not only of Japan, but also of the Asia-Pacif c region and
the world at large. From this perspective, Japan will place
emphasis on the following efforts:


**(1) Strengthening Deterrence and Response**
**Capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance**

Japan will continue revising the Guidelines for Japan-U.S.
Defense Cooperation[3]. In addition, Japan will promote joint
training and exercises, joint Intelligence, Surveillance, and
Reconnaissance (ISR) activities and the joint/shared use of
facilities and areas. Japan will also tighten the Japan-U.S.
operational cooperation and policy coordination.

**(2) Strengthening and Expanding Cooperation in a**
**Broad Range of Fields**

The Japan-U.S. Alliance will strengthen cooperation not
only in the f elds of anti-piracy efforts, capacity building
assistance, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief,
peacekeeping and counter terrorism, but also in maritime
affairs, outer space and cyberspace. As for disaster response,
Japan will further strengthen its cooperation between the
SDF and the U.S. Forces. In addition, Japan will constantly


**(2) Cooperation with the International Community**
It is very diff cult for a single country to respond to global
security challenges on its own. Moreover, as the roles of
military forces have diversif ed, such forces play an important
role in building peace and promoting conf dence-building.
Therefore, Japan will continue and strengthen various
initiatives concerning arms control, disarmament, nonproliferation and capacity building assistance on a regular
basis in cooperation with the international community.
Specif cally Japan will strengthen its cooperation with the
European Union (EU), North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in
Europe (OSCE), along with the United Kingdom, France and
other European countries. Furthermore, Japan will actively
promote various international peace cooperation activities in
a multi-layered manner, and in particular, will continue to
actively conduct activities utilizing the SDF’s capabilities.

**4** **Future Defense Forces**


various potential contingencies, the SDF will prioritize the
development of capacities to ensure maritime supremacy
and air superiority, which is the prerequisite for effective
deterrence and response in various situations, including
defense posture buildup in the southwestern region.
Furthermore, the SDF will emphasize the establishment
of rapid deployment capabilities with a consideration to
establishing a wide-ranging logistical support foundation.
At the same time, in terms of preparation for an
invasion such as the landing of large-scale ground forces,
the SDF will possess the minimum necessary level of
expertise and skills, and thereby further promote efforts to
achieve even greater eff ciency and rationalization.

**(2) Functions and Capabilities to be Emphasized**
The SDF will selectively strengthen the following functions
and capabilities in particular, paying attention to enhance
joint functions with interoperability with the U.S. forces.
H ISR capabilities
Japan will implement extensive persistent ISR in the
surrounding seas and airspace, and adopt a f exible
approach for boosting its ISR posture according to the
developments of situations.
H Intelligence capabilities
Japan will strengthen its system for collecting
intelligence, processing information, and analyzing
and sharing the collected information, so that the SDF
can promptly detect signs of various situations and take
other actions. In doing so, the SDF will seek to enhance
its various information collection capabilities, including
HUMINT, OSINT, SIGINT, and IMINT, as well as
persistent ISR capabilities using unmanned aerial
vehicles. Also, the SDF will strengthen its geospatial
intelligence capabilities to establish a framework for
the securing and nurturing of personnel in information
gathering and analysis.
H Transport capability
In order to swiftly deploy and move necessary units, the
SDF will strengthen its integrated transport capacity,
while seeking collaboration with the civilian transport
sector on a regular basis.
H Command and control, and information and
communication capabilities
In order to establish a command and control system
that can manage units nationwide in a mobile, joint and
integrated manner, a new central headquarters to control
all regional armies will be established within the Ground
Self-Defense Force (GSDF), among other measures.
The SDF will also strive to enhance and strengthen
its capabilities for supporting communications
infrastructure on remote islands and data link functions


**1** **Role of the Defense Forces**

**(1) Effective Deterrent of and Response to Various**
**Situations**

Japan will achieve intelligence superiority[4] through
persistent ISR activities in an extensive surrounding area to
detect any signs of development at an early stage. Through
such activities, Japan will clearly express its resolve not
to tolerate any change of the status quo by force, thereby
preventing various situations from occurring.
At the same time, Japan will swiftly and seamlessly
respond to situations from an early stage, including gray
zone situations, and establish the necessary posture to
continuously address a protracted situation. Moreover,
Japan will implement an effective response tailored to each
situation, even in cases when multiple events occur in a
consecutive or concurrent manner.
In particular, the following points will be emphasized:
(1) ensuring security of the sea and airspace surrounding
Japan; (2) response to an attack on remote islands;
(3) response to ballistic missile attacks; (4) responses in outer
space and cyberspace; and (5) responses to major disasters.


**(2) Stabilization of the Asia-Pacifi c Region and**
**Improvement of the Global Security Environment**

Through persistent ISR in the area surrounding Japan, and
the timely and appropriate implementation of training,
exercises, and various other activities, Japan will ensure the
stability of the security environment in the region. Moreover,
by working in partnership with its allies and partners, Japan
will promote multi-tiered initiatives, including bilateral
and multilateral defense cooperation and exchange, joint
training and exercises, and capacity building assistance.
In order to respond appropriately to global security
issues, Japan will strengthen various initiatives focused
on arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation, as
well as actively promote international peace cooperation
activities, anti-piracy initiatives and capacity building
assistance. Japan will attach importance to the following in
particular: (1) holding training and exercises; (2) promoting
defense cooperation and exchange; (3) promoting capacity
building assistance; (4) ensuring maritime security;
(5) implementing international peace cooperation activities;
and (6) cooperating with efforts to promote arms control,
disarmament, and non-proliferation.


**2** **Priorities in Strengthening Architecture of the SDF**


**(1) Basic Approach**
Based on the results of the capability assessments conducted
based on the standpoint of joint operations in relation to


-----

among the three services, along with other capabilities.
H Response to an attack on remote islands
The SDF will strengthen its engagement capability for
the ensuring of maritime supremacy and air superiority,
which is the prerequisite for an effective response. The
SDF will strengthen the integrated capabilities to seek to
interdict any attack on Japan’s remote islands, and newly
develop suff cient amphibious operations capability,
which enables the SDF to land, recapture, and secure
without delay in the case of an invasion of any remote
islands. Furthermore, the SDF will enhance its logistical
support capabilities, so that its units can swiftly and
continuously respond in the event of a situation in the
southwestern region. In addition, the SDF will also
examine the desirable air defense posture in remote
islands in the Pacif c.
H Response to ballistic missile attacks
To counter North Korea’s improved ballistic
missile capability, Japan will pursue comprehensive
improvement of its response capability against ballistic
missiles. With regard to the BMD system, Japan will
enhance readiness, simultaneous engagement capability,
and sustainable response capability to strengthen the
capability to protect the entire territory. Based on
appropriate role and mission sharing between Japan
and the U.S., in order to strengthen the deterrent of the
Japan-U.S. Alliance as a whole through enhancement
of Japan’s own deterrent and response capability, Japan
will study a potential form of response capability to
address the means of ballistic missile launches and
related facilities, and take necessary means.
H Response in outer space and cyberspace
While strengthening information collection capability
using satellites, and reinforcing command, control and
telecommunications capabilities, the SDF will enhance
the survivability of satellites through such initiatives as
space situational awareness.
As for cyberspace, Japan will enhance integrated
persistent surveillance and response capabilities as well
as continuously strengthen and secure personnel with
expertise and the latest equipment.
H Responses to major disasters, etc.
The SDF will develop a response posture sustainable for
long-term operation, through swift transportation and
deployment of appropriately sized units.
H Responses focused on international peace cooperation
activities and other similar activities
The SDF will strengthen protective capabilities to
ensure the safety of personnel and units. The SDF
will also work on enhancing transport and deployment
capability, information communication capability, and
on strengthening logistics and medical service structure.


Furthermore, the SDF will enhance intelligence gathering
capability as well as its education, training and personnel
management systems.

**3** **Architecture of Each Service of the Self-Defense**
**Forces**

**(1) Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF)**
In order to respond swiftly to an attack on offshore
islands and various other situations, the GSDF will
maintain rapidly deployable basic operational units (rapid
deployment divisions, rapid deployment brigades, and an
armored division) furnished with advanced mobility and
ISR capabilities. In addition, the GSDF will maintain
mobile operating units capable of effectively performing
amphibious and other operations. The GSDF will maintain
half of these rapidly deployable basic operational units in
Hokkaido, given its excellent training environment.
The GSDF will implement rationalization and
streamlining with a particular focus on tanks/howitzers and
rockets, and review the organization and equipment of units.
The number of GSDF personnel will be maintained at
around 159,000, which was the same level as at the end of
FY2013, in order to ensure suff cient personnel availability
to respond to major disasters or other situations.


**(2) Maritime Self-Defense Forces (MSDF)**
The MSDF will increase the number of destroyers to 54
(14 escort divisions) by using new destroyers that offer
improved response capabilities for various missions and
have more compact designs, and will maintain ship-based
patrol helicopter units in order to secure the defense of
surrounding waters and ensure the safety of maritime
traff c. Furthermore, two Aegis-equipped destroyers[5] will
be added, bringing the f eet to eight.
Furthermore, in order to effectively carry out regular
information gathering and warning and surveillance
activities, as well as patrolling of surrounding waters[6] and
defense operations, the MSDF will maintain an augmented
submarine f eet and patrol aircraft units.

**(3) Air Self-Defense Forces (ASDF)**
The ASDF will maintain air warning and control units in
order to provide persistent ISR in most air space over Japan
and the surrounding areas. By consolidating warning and
control operations at air defense command centers, the
ASDF will gradually change warning groups into warning
squadrons as well as establish one new squadron in the air
warning unit[7].
As for Fighter Aircraft Units, the 13th squadron will
be newly established, and Air Reconnaissance Unit will be
abolished. In addition, one squadron will be added to the


Destroyers equipped with the Aegis Weapon System that uses high performance computers to automatically process series of operations such as target search, detection, identifi cation and attack.

Aerial Refueling/Transport Unit, making it a two-squadron
architecture.
Furthermore, the ASDF will maintain surface-to-air
guided missile units providing multi-layered defense for
Japan against ballistic missile attacks, together with the
Aegis destroyers, as well as protecting key areas in tandem
with the surface-to-air guided missile units of the GSDF.

Largest reform since the establishment
**Commentary**
of the Ground Self-Defense Force

The Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) is making efforts to achieve a truly
grand reform in order to build a Dynamic Joint Defense Force based on
the 2013 NDPG. The aim is to respond fl exibly to the increasingly severe
security environment, and establish a ground defense force that can respond
to situations seamlessly and dynamically. In order to realize this, the GSDF
particularly puts weight on response to attacks on remote islands, which is
comprised of the following three levels: regular “deployment of units”; “rapid
deployment” of units necessary to interdict any invasion; and “recapturing”
in case any remote islands are invaded. The “deployment of units” is to
deploy coast observation units and area security units in the southwestern
region; “rapid deployment” is to transform about half of the divisions and GSDF personnel taking part in amphibious training
brigades deployed across Japan into rapid deployment divisions and
brigades that are furnished with advanced mobility and ISR capabilities; and for “recapturing,” new establishment of an amphibious rapid
deployment brigade that is able to conduct suffi cient amphibious operations. Mobile combat vehicles (MCVs), amphibious vehicles, Osprey
(V-22), and other equipment will be introduced for the operation of these units.
Moreover, with a view to integrating the operation of GSDF units across Japan, and improving joint operation with the Maritime
Self-Defense Force (MSDF) and Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) as well as the effectiveness of Japan-U.S. joint training with U.S. Forces,
the Ground Central Command will be established as a new integrated headquarters that controls the operation of the fi ve regional armies
of the GSDF (The headquarters of the Ground Central Command will be newly established in JGSDF Camp Asaka in FY2017). In addition,
education, training, and research functions will be unifi ed, and a system to integrate these three functions swiftly in an inter-related manner
to enable continuous reform into the future will be established.
Unprecedentedly large-scale transfers of GSDF personnel across Japan will be necessary to realize these efforts. As a whole, this
major reform is so grand and extensive that it not only includes organizational and institutional reforms but also a reform of the mentality
of each GSDF personnel, including the personal preparedness of each member. As such, the GSDF is making concerted efforts as a whole
to realize the largest reform since its establishment.

**Section 4 Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology**


**1** **Purpose of Establishment of the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology**


Japan has dealt with arms exports in a careful manner, in
accordance with the Three Principles of Arms Exports
and their related policy guidelines. On the other hand, in
individual cases, such as the joint development of BMD
by Japan and the U.S., it has taken separate measures by
issuing Chief Cabinet Secretary’s statements, where arms
exports are dealt with outside the Three Principles.
Amidst this situation, in December 2011, the
Statement by the Chief Cabinet Secretary on Guidelines for
Overseas Transfer of Defense Equipment, etc. put in place
exemptions from the Three Principles of Arms Exports
based on the premise of strict control[1], with regard to cases
related to peace contribution and international cooperation;
and cases regarding international joint development and
production of defense equipment, etc. that contributes to
Japan’s security.
However, when Japan endeavored to arrange the
participation of companies within Japan in the international
logistics support systems for the manufacture of the F-35,


in December 2013, and when 10 thousand rounds of
ammunition owned by GSDF forces engaged in activities
as a part of South Sudan PKO (United Nations Mission in
the Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS)) were provided
to the U.N. based on a request by the U.N. since it was
not possible to apply Guidelines for Overseas Transfer of
Defense Equipment, etc. for these cases, the measures were
taken by issuing Chief Cabinet Secretary’s statements not
to rely on the Three Principles on Arms Export, etc.
Given these circumstances, based on the National
Security Strategy, in April 2014, the Government decided
upon the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment
and Technology[2] and implementation guidelines. These
clarify the concrete standards, procedures and limitation
better than ever and state them clearly with transparency
both internally and externally.
Based on the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology, the Ministry of Defense and
Self-Defense Forces, in addition to contributing even more

While maintaining the deterrence of the U.S. Forces,
Japan will steadily implement specif c measures including
the realignment of the U.S. Forces in Japan and SACO


(Special Action Committee on Okinawa) related programs
to mitigate the impact on local communities, including
those in Okinawa.


**Section 4 Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology**


**1** **Purpose of Establishment of the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology**


Japan has dealt with arms exports in a careful manner, in
accordance with the Three Principles of Arms Exports
and their related policy guidelines. On the other hand, in
individual cases, such as the joint development of BMD
by Japan and the U.S., it has taken separate measures by
issuing Chief Cabinet Secretary’s statements, where arms
exports are dealt with outside the Three Principles.
Amidst this situation, in December 2011, the
Statement by the Chief Cabinet Secretary on Guidelines for
Overseas Transfer of Defense Equipment, etc. put in place
exemptions from the Three Principles of Arms Exports
based on the premise of strict control[1], with regard to cases
related to peace contribution and international cooperation;
and cases regarding international joint development and
production of defense equipment, etc. that contributes to
Japan’s security.
However, when Japan endeavored to arrange the
participation of companies within Japan in the international
logistics support systems for the manufacture of the F-35,


in December 2013, and when 10 thousand rounds of
ammunition owned by GSDF forces engaged in activities
as a part of South Sudan PKO (United Nations Mission in
the Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS)) were provided
to the U.N. based on a request by the U.N. since it was
not possible to apply Guidelines for Overseas Transfer of
Defense Equipment, etc. for these cases, the measures were
taken by issuing Chief Cabinet Secretary’s statements not
to rely on the Three Principles on Arms Export, etc.
Given these circumstances, based on the National
Security Strategy, in April 2014, the Government decided
upon the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment
and Technology[2] and implementation guidelines. These
clarify the concrete standards, procedures and limitation
better than ever and state them clearly with transparency
both internally and externally.
Based on the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology, the Ministry of Defense and
Self-Defense Forces, in addition to contributing even more

Overseas transfer of defense equipment and technology
will be permitted only in cases where appropriate control
is ensured. More concretely, the Government will in
principle oblige the Government of the recipient country
to gain its prior consent regarding extra-purpose use and
transfer to third parties. However, in cases where it is
judged appropriate for the proactive advancement of peace
contribution and international cooperation, cases involving
participation in the international systems for sharing parts,
and cases where parts are delivered to a licenser, appropriate
control may be ensured with the conf rmation of the control
system at the destination.


The cases where transfers may be permitted are limited
to such cases as shown in the reference. The Government
will conduct strict examination on the appropriateness of
the destination and end user, and the extent the overseas
transfer of such equipment and technology will raise
concern for Japan’s security. At the same time, standards
of examinations and procedures will be clarif ed and made
transparent, strict examination systems of the Government
as a whole including deliberations at the National Security
Council are decided to be established. In addition, the

**Chapter** **Strengthening of the Japan-U.S. Alliance**
##### 3


Based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements, together with Japan’s own efforts,
constitute the cornerstone for Japan’s security. The JapanU.S. Alliance centered on bilateral security arrangements
functions as public goods that contribute to the stability and
prosperity, not only of Japan but also of the Asia-Pacif c
region and the world at large. As the security environment
surrounding Japan becomes increasingly severe, and the
United States, at the same time, maintains and strengthens
its engagement and presence in the Asia-Pacif c region,
it has become more important than ever to strengthen the


Japan-U.S. Alliance for the security of Japan.
The military presence of U.S. Forces in Japan
not only contributes to the defense of Japan, but also
functions as deterrence and response capabilities to address
contingencies in the Asia-Pacif c region, and serves as a
core element of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. On
the other hand, since the stationing of U.S. Forces in Japan
impacts the living environment of local residents, efforts
that correspond to the actual situation of each region must
be made to mitigate the impact on regions such as Okinawa.


**Section 1 Signifi cance of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements**


**1** **Maintenance of Japan’s Peace and Security**


In the current international community, a watertight
defense system capable of responding to every
contingency, ranging from all types of armed attacks
including the use of nuclear weapons to coercion or
intimidation by military power, is necessary to secure
the peace, security, and sovereignty of the nation. It is
impossible even for the United States to guarantee its
security on its own. Therefore, it would be practically
impossible for Japan to ensure its national security
solely through its unilateral efforts given its population,
land, and economy. Moreover, such a strategy would not
necessarily contribute to regional stability.
Consequently, Japan has maintained its peace and
security, centered on the Security Arrangements with the
world’s dominant military power, the United States, with
which it shares basic values such as democracy, the rule of
law, respect for human rights, and a capitalist economy as
well as an interest in maintaining the peace and security of
the world, and has strong economic ties.

**2** **Maintenance of Peace and Stability in the Region Surrounding Japan**


Article 6 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty states that
contributing to the security of Japan, and the maintenance
of international peace and security in the Far East is the
purpose of the use of facilities and areas by the U.S. Forces
in Japan. This provision is based on the recognition that the
security of Japan is closely tied to the peace and security of
the Far East region to which Japan belongs.
In the regions surrounding Japan, there are many
states and the like with massive military power, including
some states that retain nuclear weapons or continue
nuclear development. In addition to issues or tension
caused by changes in the balance of power, situations that
we call “gray zones” over sovereignty of the territory or


Specif cally, as well as providing facilities and areas
for the U.S. Forces, based on Article 6 of the Japan-U.S.
Security Treaty, Article 5 of that treaty stipulates that Japan
and the United States will take bilateral action in the event
of an armed attack against Japan. The U.S. obligation to
defend Japan in the event of an armed attack means that
if a country plans to attack Japan, the attacker must be
prepared to confront not only the defense capability of
the SDF, but also the overwhelming military strength of
the United States when planning such an act. As a result,
the opposing nation becomes aware that they will suffer
grievously if they carry out an invasion, and such desires
are stopped at the planning stage. In other words, this
serves to deter attacks.
Japan intends to effectively utilize the deterrence
power of the U.S. military in addition to maintaining
adequate Japanese defense forces in order to create a
seamless posture and secure Japan’s peace and security.

vested interests are likely to arise, and this risks further
aggravation of the situation. In such a security environment,
the military presence of the U.S. Forces in Japan provides
deterrence against unexpected contingencies caused by
various security issues or unstable factors, providing a
great sense of security to the nations in the region and
thus fulf lling a role as public goods. Also, the close
bonds of cooperation based on the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements constitute the foundation of the United
States’ commitment to the peace and stability of the region
surrounding Japan. These arrangements, complemented
by the alliances established between the United States
and other countries in the region such as South Korea


-----

Australia, Thailand and the Philippines and also by the indispensable role in maintaining the peace and stability
friendly relations developed with other countries, play an of the Asia-Pacif c region.


**3** **Further Stabilization of the International Security Environment**


The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements are the foundation
for a comprehensive and friendly cooperative relationship
between Japan and the United States, not only in defense
but also in a wide range of areas, including politics, the
economy, and society. The Japan-U.S. Alliance, with these
security arrangements at its core, also forms the basis for
Japan’s foreign policy. It contributes to Japan’s ability
to implement positive measures to maintain the peace
and security of the international community, including
promoting multinational security dialogue and cooperation,
and cooperation with the United Nations.
Currently, we are confronted with global security
challenges that are extremely diff cult for any single
country to tackle alone, including the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles,
international terrorism, and acts of piracy, as well as new
risks concerning stable access to the seas, space, and
cyberspace, and it is important for countries involved to
regularly work together in peacetime. The strong bonds


forged between Japan and the United States are also
playing an important role in the efforts implemented by
Japan to effectively respond to such challenges.
In particular, under the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements, the SDF and the U.S. Forces are working
together in peacetime in a variety of areas to strengthen
their cooperation. This kind of close coordination forms the
foundation for various forms of international collaboration,
such as antipiracy, undertaken by the SDF and the U.S.
Forces, and leads to the heightened operational effectiveness
of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
The peace and prosperity of the international
community are closely linked to those of Japan.
Accordingly, by cooperating with the United States, which
possesses preeminent international operational capabilities,
Japan is able to advance measures to further stabilize the
global security environment. This in turn is enhancing the
security and prosperity of Japan.


**Section 2 Overview of the Revision of the Guidelines**


It is necessary for both Japan and the United States to discuss
and decide the roles each will fulf ll in case of an armed
attack against Japan or other situation in advance, with a
view to responding rapidly to such an event. The Guidelines
for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation (Guidelines) and the
various policies for ensuring their effectiveness provide
a framework pertaining to role-sharing between Japan


and the United States. Based on that framework and the
changing security environment surrounding Japan, both
Japan and the United States continuously studied bilateral
cooperation plans for the two countries, held consultations
on them, and worked on the revision of the Guidelines to
adapt to the current situations.


**1** **Background to the Revision of the Guidelines**


**1** **Background to the Formulation of the Guidelines**

The 1978 Guidelines were formulated with a focus on an
armed attack on Japan against the backdrop of the Cold War,
which was still ongoing then. The subsequent Guidelines
were developed in 1997 in light of changes in the security
environment, such as the end of the Cold War. The 1997
Guidelines expanded cooperation to responses in situations
in areas surrounding Japan. The 1997 Guidelines def ne the
roles of Japan and the United States, and the cooperation of
the two countries under three categories: (1) in peacetime,
(2) in response to an armed attack against Japan, and (3) in
situations in areas surrounding Japan. They also stipulated
that they would review the Guidelines in a timely and
appropriate manner.


**2** **Background to the Revision**


More than 17 years have passed since the formulation of
the 1997 Guidelines. During these years, various issues
and destabilizing factors have emerged, and become
more visible and aggravated in the security environment
surrounding Japan; such as more active military activities of
neighboring countries, new threats including international
terrorist organizations and risks against stable use of global
commons such as oceans, space and cyberspace. In addition,
the activities of the SDF have expanded to a global scale, as
exemplif ed by antipiracy activities, PKO, and international
disaster relief activities. As a result, it had become necessary
for the manner of Japan-U.S. defense cooperation to be
adapted to these changes in the security environment and the
expansion of the SDF’s activities and missions.

environment Prime Minister Abe directed then Minister

**3** **Further Stabilization of the International Security Environment**


The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements are the foundation
for a comprehensive and friendly cooperative relationship
between Japan and the United States, not only in defense
but also in a wide range of areas, including politics, the
economy, and society. The Japan-U.S. Alliance, with these
security arrangements at its core, also forms the basis for
Japan’s foreign policy. It contributes to Japan’s ability
to implement positive measures to maintain the peace
and security of the international community, including
promoting multinational security dialogue and cooperation,
and cooperation with the United Nations.
Currently, we are confronted with global security
challenges that are extremely diff cult for any single
country to tackle alone, including the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles,
international terrorism, and acts of piracy, as well as new
risks concerning stable access to the seas, space, and
cyberspace, and it is important for countries involved to

of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
The peace and prosperity of the international

Japan is able to advance measures to further stabilize the
global security environment. This in turn is enhancing the
security and prosperity of Japan.

revision of the Guidelines and other matters. In addition,
at the Japan-U.S. Summit held in February 2013, Prime
Minister Abe stated to U.S. President Obama that, “in
response to the changing security environment, Japan
would like to start reviewing the Guidelines through
discussions on the two countries’ views of the roles,
missions and capabilities (RMC).”


responsive and to enable seamless bilateral cooperation
in all situations;
5) Describing appropriate role-sharing of bilateral defense
cooperation based on the enhancement of mutual
capabilities;
6) Evaluating the concepts that guide bilateral defense
cooperation in contingencies to ensure effective,
eff cient, and seamless Alliance response in a dynamic
security environment that includes challenges in
emerging strategic domains such as space and
cyberspace; and
7) Exploring additional ways in which we can strengthen
the Alliance in the future to meet shared objectives.
Based on the Joint Statement of the “2+2” Meeting
in October 2013 and in line with approaches indicated in
the 2013 National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG)
and the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) of the
United States, Japan and the United States conducted
extensive work on the revision of the 1997 Guidelines. On
October 8, 2014, based on the agreement reached at the
Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting held on July 11,
2014, the two governments announced “The Interim
Report on the Revision of the Guidelines for Japan-U.S.
Defense Cooperation.” In addition, on December 19,
2014, the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) (“2+2”
Meeting), recognizing the signif cance of ensuring
consistency between the revision of the Guidelines and
Japan’s legislative process, decided to further deepen the
discussions to work toward f nalizing the revision of the
Guidelines during the f rst half of 2015, taking into account
the progress of Japan’s legislative process.

the approach of the 1997 Guidelines.
H In order to ensure Japan’s peace and security under any
circumstances, from peacetime to contingencies, and
to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous AsiaPacif c region and beyond, bilateral security and defense
cooperation will emphasize:
– seamless, robust, f exible, and effective bilateral
responses;
– synergy across the two governments’ national security
policies;
– a whole-of-government Alliance approach;
– cooperation with regional and other partners, as well
as international organizations; and
– the global nature of the Japan-U.S. Alliance
H The two governments will maintain their individual
defense postures based on their national security policies.
The United States will continue to extend deterrence to
Japan through the full range of capabilities, including
U.S. nuclear forces. The United States also will continue
to forward deploy combat-ready forces in the AsiaPacif c region and maintain the ability to reinforce those
forces rapidly


**3** **Background to the Revision**


Against the background described above, at the JapanU.S. SCC (“2+2” Meeting) in October 2013, the Ministers
directed the Subcommittee for Defense Cooperation (SDC)
to draft recommended changes to the 1997 Guidelines, and
this task was to be completed by the end of 2014.
The Joint Statement of the “2+2” Meeting identif ed
the following seven objectives of the review of the 1997
Guidelines:
1) Ensuring the Alliance’s capacity to respond to an
armed attack against Japan, as a core aspect of JapanU.S. defense cooperation;
2) Expanding the scope of cooperation, to ref ect the global
nature of the Japan-U.S. Alliance, encompassing such
areas as counterterrorism, counter-piracy, peacekeeping,
capacity building, humanitarian assistance/disaster
relief, and equipment and technology enhancement;
3) Promoting deeper security cooperation with other
regional partners to advance shared objectives and values;
4) Enhancing Alliance mechanisms for consultation and
coordination to make them more f exible, timely, and

**2** **Content of the New Guidelines**

As a result of the intensive bilateral work on the revision
of the Guidelines, the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative
Committee (SCC) approved the new Guidelines
recommended by the Subcommittee for Defense
Cooperation (SDC) at the “2+2” Meeting held on April
27, 2015, thereby accomplishing the objectives outlined by
the Ministers in October 2013. The new Guidelines, which
replace the 1997 Guidelines, update the general framework
and policy direction for the roles and missions of the two
countries and manifest a strategic vision for a more robust
Alliance and greater shared responsibilities by modernizing
the Alliance and enhancing its deterrence and response
capabilities in all phases, from peacetime to contingencies.

See Part II, Chapter 3, Section 3-2-2 (“2+2” Meeting (April 27, 2015));
Reference 18 (The Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation
(April 27, 2015))


**1** **Defense Cooperation and the Aim of the Guidelines**

The new Guidelines newly specif ed the matters to be
emphasized in security and defense cooperation. The
objectives of the new Guidelines are retained in line with


-----

H The Guidelines provide the general framework and policy
direction for the roles and missions of Japan and the United
States, as well as ways of cooperation and coordination.
H The Guidelines promote domestic and international
understanding of the signif cance of the Japan-U.S. Alliance.


**(2) Enhanced Operational Coordination**
The two governments recognize the importance of
collocating operational coordination functions. The
Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed
Forces will exchange personnel to ensure robust
information sharing, to facilitate coordination and to
support international activities.

**(3) Bilateral Planning**
In peacetime, the two governments will develop and update
bilateral plans through Bilateral Planning Mechanism.
Bilateral plans are to be ref ected appropriately in the plans
of both governments.


**2** **Basic Premises and Principles**


The basic premises and principles maintain the approaches
of the 1997 Guidelines as described below:
H The rights and obligations under the Japan-U.S.
Security Treaty and its related arrangements will remain
unchanged.
H All actions and activities undertaken under the Guidelines
will be consistent with international law.
H All actions and activities undertaken by Japan and
the United States will be in accordance with their
respective constitutions, laws and regulations then in
effect, and basic positions on national security policy.
Japan will conduct actions and activities in accordance
with its basic positions, such as the maintenance of its
exclusively national defense-oriented policy and its
three non-nuclear principles.
H The Guidelines do not obligate either government to take
legislative, budgetary, administrative, or other measures,
nor do the Guidelines create legal rights or obligations for
either government. Since the objective of the Guidelines,
however, is to establish an effective framework for
bilateral cooperation, the two governments are expected
to ref ect in an appropriate way the results of these
efforts, based on their own judgment, in their specif c
policies and measures.


**4** **Seamlessly Ensuring Japan’s Peace and Security**

This section presents the direction of achieving seamless
cooperation, from peacetime to contingencies, in order
to ensure Japan’s peace and security, the core of the
Guidelines.
H The two governments will take measures to seamlessly
ensure Japan’s peace and security in all phases from
peacetime to contingencies, including situations when
an armed attack against Japan is not involved. In this
context, the two governments also will promote further
cooperation with partners.
H The two governments will utilize the Alliance Coordination
Mechanism where appropriate for assessment of the
situation, sharing of information, as well as f exible
deterrent options and actions aimed at de-escalation of
the situation. The two governments also will coordinate
strategic messaging through appropriate channels.


**(1) Cooperative Measures from Peacetime**
As described below, this section specif es ways of
cooperation from peacetime to strengthen the deterrence
and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance.
H The two governments will promote cooperation across
a wide range of areas, including through diplomatic
efforts, to strengthen the deterrence and capabilities of
the Japan-U.S. Alliance.
H The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed
Forces will enhance interoperability, readiness, and
vigilance to prepare for all possible situations. To these
ends, the two governments will take measures, including,
but not limited to, the following:
a. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance
The Self-Defense Forces and the United States
Armed Forces will conduct intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance (ISR) activities based on the
capabilities and availability of their respective assets.
This will include conducting bilateral ISR activities
in a mutually supportive manner to ensure persistent
coverage of developments that could affect Japan’s peace
and security


**3** **Strengthened Alliance Coordination**


Effective bilateral cooperation under the Guidelines will
require the two governments to conduct close, consultative
dialogue and sound policy and operational coordination
from peacetime to contingencies. For this purpose,
the two governments will establish a new, standing
Alliance Coordination Mechanism, enhance operational
coordination, and strengthen bilateral planning.

**(1) Alliance Coordination Mechanism**
In order to address seamlessly and effectively any situation
that affects Japan’s peace and security or any other situation
that may require an Alliance response, the two governments
will utilize the Alliance Coordination Mechanism, and will
strengthen policy and operational coordination related to
activities conducted by the Self-Defense Forces and the
United States Armed Forces in all phases from peacetime
to contingencies. The two governments will establish
necessary procedures and infrastructure (including facilities
as well as information and communication systems) and
conduct regular training and exercises


-----

b. Air and Missile Defense
The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed
Forces will maintain and strengthen deterrence and their

**Section 3 Initiatives to Build the Foundation for Strengthening the Alliance**


**1** **Background to the Strengthening of the Alliance**


Since the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty in
1960, Japan and the United States have built a robust alliance
based on democratic ideals, respect for human rights, the
rule of law and common interests. During the Cold War
era, the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements ensured the
safety of Japan as a country with a liberal ideology. It also
contributed to peace and stability in the region.
Following the end of the Cold War, the leaders of
Japan and the United States announced the Japan-U.S.
Joint Declaration on Security in 1996, reaff rming the
importance of the Japan-U.S. Alliance in light of the state
of affairs in the Asia-Pacif c region following the Cold War.
Upon the Declaration, the f nal report was compiled at the
Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) at the end
of that year, and as part of the promotion of cooperative
relations presented in the Declaration, at the “2+2” Meeting
held in the following year (1997), the aforementioned 1997
Guidelines were approved.
Afterwards, in light of further changes to the security
environment due to the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, following
the “2+2” Meeting in December 2002, Japan and the United
States held working-level and other consultations as part of
bilateral strategic dialogue on security from the perspective
of how to make the Japan-U.S. Alliance’s capacity more
effective to adapt to changing times. As a result of a number
of these Japan-U.S. consultations, the direction of the
Japan-U.S. Alliance was arranged in three stages. These
stages are: conf rmation of common strategic objectives to
both countries, including enhancing peace and stability in
the Asia-Pacif c region (f rst stage) in February 2005; the
announcement of the results of the examination of the roles,
missions, and capabilities of Japan and the United States
for accomplishing the common strategic objectives (second
stage) in October 2005; and the formulation of the United
States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment Implementation,
a program for implementing specif c measures for the
realignment of the U.S. Forces in Japan, in May 2006.


See Reference 19 (United States–Japan Roadmap for Realignment
Implementation)

Furthermore, Japan and the United States at the
“2+2” Meeting in May 2007 reconf rmed and updated
their common strategic objectives. In February 2009,
the two countries signed the Agreement between the
Government of Japan and the Government of the United
States of America concerning the Implementation of the
Relocation of III Marine Expeditionary Force personnel
and their dependents from Okinawa to Guam (the Guam
International Agreement), which entered into force in May
2009.
In the Joint Statement of the “2+2” Meeting in June
2011, the two countries revalidated and updated their
common strategic objectives set forth in the Joint Statements
of the previous “2+2” Meetings, including maintenance
of maritime security domain by defending the principle
of freedom of navigation and maintenance of bilateral
cooperation with respect to protection of and access to
space and cyberspace, and covered a diverse range of areas
regarding the strengthening of alliance security and defense
cooperation, including an expansion of information sharing
and joint intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(ISR) activities.
In the Joint Statement of the “2+2” Meeting in
April 2012, Japan and the United States announced that
they decided to adjust the plans outlined in the United
States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment Implementation
(Realignment Roadmap) of May 2006, considering
signif cant progress on the realignment of the U.S. Forces
stationed in Japan since the Joint Statement of the “2+2”
Meeting in June 2011 as well as the security environment
in the Asia-Pacif c region.

Stages of Japan-U.S. Consultations

**2** **Policy Consultations between Japan and the United States**


**1** **Initiatives including the “2+2” Meeting**

Japan and the United States have maintained close
coordination at multiple levels, including the summitlevel and ministerial level, and have continually
strengthened and expanded cooperative relations for
the peace, stability and prosperity of not only the two
countries but also the entire international community,
including the Asia-Pacific region.
Close policy consultations on security are conducted
through diplomatic channels as well as between off cials
in charge of defense and foreign affairs at multiple levels
in the Governments of Japan and the United States
through meetings such as the Japan-United States Security
Consultative Committee (SCC) (“2+2” Meeting), the
Security Subcommittee (SSC) and the Subcommittee
for Defense Cooperation (SDC). As the framework for
ministerial consultations among the top off cials in charge
of defense and foreign affairs of the two countries, the
Security Consultative Committee (SCC) (“2+2” Meeting)
represents such policy consultations. The SCC functions as
an important consultative panel to discuss issues related to
Japan-U.S. cooperation in the area of security.

See Fig. II-3-3-3 (Major Consultations on Policies Held between Japanese
and U.S. Government Offi cials concerning Japan-U.S. Security Issues)

In addition, the Ministry of Defense organizes
Japan-U.S. defense ministerial meetings between the
Japanese Defense Minister and the U.S. Secretary
of Defense as necessary where discussions are made
with a focus on the defense policies of the respective
governments and defense cooperation. Furthermore, the
Japanese Parliamentary Senior Vice-Minister of Defense
and the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense work together,
and MOD officials, including the Administrative ViceMinister of Defense, the Chief of Staff of the Joint
Staff, the Vice-Minister of Defense for International
Affairs, and Chiefs of Staff of SDFs, have working level
meetings when necessary and exchange information with
the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and others under
the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. Furthermore, in
recent years, the Chief of Staff of the Joint Staff of the
SDF and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff held
the strategic dialogue in April 2014 for the first time
ever. The importance of these opportunities has been
further increased as Japan-U.S. defense cooperation has
been enhanced.
The sharing of information and views at every
opportunity and level between Japan and the United States
is undoubtedly conducive to the increased credibility of
the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, and results in the
further enhancement of close collaboration between the
two countries. Therefore, the MOD is proactively engaging
in these initiatives.

The outline of the Joint Statement of the “2+2”
Meeting is as follows:
a. Overview
(a) The Japan-U.S. Alliance and the New Guidelines
H The Ministers announced the approval and release
of new, revised “Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense
Cooperation” (the Guidelines).
H The new Guidelines update the roles and missions of the
two countries and promote a more balanced and effective
Alliance to meet the emerging security challenges of the
21st century.
H Both countries aff rmed that the Japan-U.S. Alliance,
strengthened by the new Guidelines and the two
countries’ respective security and defense policies,
continues to serve as the cornerstone of peace and
security in the Asia-Pacif c region as well as a platform
for promoting a more peaceful and stable international
security environment.
(b) The United States continues to implement its rebalance
to focus on the Asia Pacifc region


H As articulated in its 2015 National Security Strategy, the
United States is actively implementing its rebalance to
focus on the Asia-Pacif c region.
H The ironclad U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan,
through the full range of U.S. military capabilities,
including nuclear and conventional, is central to this.
H In this context, the Ministers reaff rmed the indispensable
role of the Japan-U.S. Alliance in promoting regional
peace, security, and prosperity.
(c) Japan’s Security Policy
H As Japan continues its policy of “Proactive Contribution
to Peace,” based on the principle of international
cooperation, the United States welcomes and supports
Japan’s recent momentous achievements.
H Among these are: the cabinet decision by the
Government of Japan on July 1, 2014, for developing
seamless security legislation; the creation of its
National Security Council; the Three Principles on
Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology; the
Act on the Protection of Specially Designated Secrets;
the Basic Act on Cybersecurity; and the new Basic Plan
on Space Policy


-----

(d) Recognition of the Regional Situation
The Ministers also reaff rmed that the Senkaku Islands are

and that they oppose any unilateral action that seeks to
undermine Japan’s administration of these islands.
b. The New Guidelines
H Both countries approved the new Guidelines
recommended by the Subcommittee for Defense
Cooperation (SDC). This accomplished the objectives
of the revision of the Guidelines as outlined by the
Ministers in October 2013.
H Recognizing the signif cance of ensuring consistency
between the new Guidelines and Japan’s efforts to
develop seamless security legislation, the Ministers
acknowledged that such legislation would make bilateral
efforts under the new Guidelines more effective. The
United States welcomes and supports the ongoing efforts
to develop the legislation, which is to ref ect Japan’s
policy of “Proactive Contributions to Peace” and its July
2014 cabinet decision.
H The Ministers conf rmed their intention to start bilateral
work under the new Guidelines. In this context, the SCC
directed the SDC to implement the new Guidelines,
including establishing the standing Alliance Coordination
Mechanism and upgrading the Bilateral Planning
Mechanism, thereby strengthening bilateral planning.
H The Ministers also expressed their intention to expeditiously
negotiate an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement
to operationalize the mutual logistics cooperation
envisioned by the new Guidelines.
c. Bilateral Security and Defense Cooperation
H The Ministers noted with satisfaction ongoing progress
in strengthening the Alliance’s deterrence and response
capabilities in a variety of areas.

-  The Ministers confi rmed the strategic importance
of deploying the most modern and advanced U.S.
capabilities to Japan (i.e., welcomed the U.S. plans to
deploy U.S. Navy P-8 maritime patrol aircraft; U.S.
Air Force Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicles; the
USS Green Bay, an upgraded amphibious transport
ship; and U.S. Marine Corps F-35B aircraft).

space-related issues among the defense authorities.

-  cooperation on cyberspace issues, including cooperation
through the whole-of-government Japan-U.S. Cyber
Dialogue and the Cyber Defense Policy Working Group.

-  enhanced Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance
(ISR) cooperation, including the rotational deployment of
U.S. Air Force Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicles.

-  strengthened defense equipment cooperation, as
ref ected by Japan’s Three Principles on Transfer of
Defense Equipment and Technology, the F-35 regional
maintenance location (regional depot), the Japan-U.S.
Systems and Technology Forum (S&TF) and others.

-  continued progress in information security
measures through the Bilateral Information Security
Consultations, including the implementation of the Act
on the Protection of Specially Designated Secrets and
the enhancement of information security cooperation.
H The Ministers expressed their intention to start
consultations on future arrangements to provide an
appropriate level of host-nation support for U.S. forces
in Japan.
H Both countries aff rmed their intent to consider at the
earliest opportunity an appropriate bilateral consultation
framework that would enhance the eff ciency and
effectiveness of Alliance management processes.
d. Regional and International Cooperation
H Recognizing the Japan-U.S. Alliance as the cornerstone
of peace and security in the Asia-Pacif c region, as
well as a platform for promoting a more peaceful and
stable international security environment, the Ministers
highlighted recent progress in the following areas:

-  Increased cooperation in Humanitarian Assistance/
Disaster Relief operations, as observed in the response
to the November 2013 typhoon in the Philippines;

-  Continued close coordination on partner capacity
building, particularly in Southeast Asia, including
maritime security capacity building endeavors; and

-  Expanded trilateral and multilateral cooperation,
particularly with key partners such as the Republic of
Korea (ROK) and Australia, as well as the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations. Japan and the United States
leverage a trilateral information sharing arrangement
with the ROK for expanded cooperation into the future
concerning the nuclear and missile threats posed
by North Korea. The Ministers also aff rmed their
intention to pursue closer cooperation with Australia


The Extended Deterrence Dialogue is designed for a frank exchange of views on ways to ensure the Japan-U.S. Alliance’s deterrence capability as part of Japan-U.S. security and defense cooperation,
and functions as a forum for Japan, which is being provided with the U.S. deterrence capability, to deepen its understanding of the U.S. deterrence policy and to make policy adjustments necessary

effectiveness of the new Guidelines by establishing the new
Alliance Coordination Mechanism, developing bilateral
plans, and expediting negotiations on the Acquisition and
Cross-Servicing Agreement.
Both parties welcomed the fact that the Cyber Defense
Policy Working Group had successfully compiled the
results of its discussions and agreed to further enhance
bilateral cooperation in cyber space.

make utmost efforts to realize the return of Marine Corps
Air Station (MCAS) Futenma and the relocation of MCAS
Futenma to Camp Schwab as soon as possible. The Minister
also stated that the relocation to Camp Schwab is the only
solution to avoid continued use of MCAS Futenma. In
addition, Minister Nakatani explained the importance of
mitigating the impact of the U.S. Forces on Okinawa and
requested cooperation from the United States. Secretary
Carter stated that the United States would continue efforts
to cooperate with Japan to mitigate the impact.
d. Osprey
Minister Nakatani stated that the Government of Japan has
been explaining to its people that the deployment of the
CV-22 Osprey to Japan starting in 2017 would enhance
the deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S.
Alliance and contribute to the stability of the Asia-Pacif c
region. The Minister also referred to the accident involving
an Osprey in Hawaii[2] and requested the U.S. side to offer
additional information to ensure the safety of the aircraft,
including information on this accident. Secretary Carter
stated that the United States would provide necessary
information to Japan and make all possible efforts to ensure
safe operation of Osprey, including the MV-22 already

**3** **Major Initiatives for Strengthening the Alliance**


The new Guidelines def ne that the two countries will
work on a variety of measures, including intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) activities, air and
missile defense, maritime security, and joint training
and exercises, and cooperate in response to a large-scale
disaster in Japan in order to “seamlessly ensure Japan’s
peace and security.” The Guidelines also require both
countries to work on “Cooperation for Regional and Global
Peace and Security,” through cooperation in international
activities and trilateral and multilateral cooperation; to
cooperate for “Space and Cyberspace Cooperation” which
are emerging as new strategic domains; and to develop and
enhance “Bilateral Enterprise” through defense equipment
and technology cooperation for further improving the
effectiveness of bilateral cooperation. Many of these
items are incorporated into the National Defense Program
Guidelines to “strengthen the Alliance’s deterrence and
response capabilities” and to “strengthen and expand
cooperation in a variety of areas ”


ASEAN response.

See Part II, Chapter 3, Section 2-2 (Content of the New Guidelines);
Reference 18 (The Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation
(April 27, 2015))

**1** **Cooperative Measures from Peacetime to**
**Seamlessly Ensure Japan’s Peace and Security**


**(1) Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance**
**(ISR) Activities**

With regard to joint ISR activities, from the perspective
that it is important to implement ISR activities in a broad
Asia-Pacif c region in cooperation between Japan and
the U.S. to enhance the eff ciency and effectiveness of
the activities between both countries, the two countries
set up the Defense ISR Working Group in February 2013
consisting of director-level defense off cials from Japan
and the U.S., which is further deepening the cooperation
between the two countries as well as expanding bilateral
exercises and training.
The expansion of these ISR activities will function as

deterrence capabilities, and will also ensure information
superiority over other nations and enable the establishment
of a seamless cooperation structure in all phases from
peacetime to contingencies.

**(2) Missile defense**
Regarding the response to ballistic missiles, bilateral
response capabilities have improved, through such measures
as operational information sharing and the establishment
of the guidelines for responding to an attack. Accordingly,
Japan and the U.S. closely cooperated and coordinated
in responding to the missile launches carried out by
North Korea respectively in April 2009, and April and
December 2012, which were purported to be “satellites.”
Also, in the systems and technology f eld, the cooperative
development of a new ballistic missile defense (BMD)
interceptor with enhanced capabilities (SM-3 Block IIA)
is steadily in progress.


have vast experience in actual f ghting, are invaluable and
greatly contribute to improving the JSDF’s capabilities.
In addition, holding bilateral exercises at effective times,
places, and scales demonstrates the unif ed commitment
and capabilities of Japan and the United States, which has
a deterrent effect. In light of these perspectives, the MOD
and the SDF are continuing their initiatives to enrich the
contents of bilateral training and exercises.

See Reference 24 (Record of Japan-U.S. Bilateral Exercises in FY2014)

Joint training and exercises have been expanded not only
within Japan but also to the United States by dispatching
SDF units, and continuous efforts are being made to improve
interoperability and bilateral response capabilities at the
military service and unit levels, including participation
in exercises including the Japan-U.S. Bilateral Regional
Army command post exercises, special anti-submarine
exercises, and Japan-U.S. Bilateral Fighter combat
training. Expanding joint training and exercises increases
cooperative activities in peacetime, thereby improving the
readiness and operational capability of units as well as
interoperability between the SDF and the U.S. Forces.
Since FY1985, mostly on an annual basis, command
post exercise and f eld training exercise have been conducted
alternately as the Japan-U.S. Bilateral Joint Exercise; the
f eld training post exercise held in November 2014 was the
12th of its kind. In recent years the U.S. Forces stationed
in Japan have also participated in disaster drills organized
by local governments, thereby deepening cooperation with
relevant institutions and local governments.


**(3) Maritime Security**
The new Guidelines will allow Japan and the United States
to develop and enhance the sharing of maritime surveillance
information from peacetime and to cooperate where
appropriate for the maintenance and enhancement of the
presence of Japan and the United States through ISR as well
as training and exercises. The Maritime Self-Defense Force
and the United States Navy plan to maintain and enhance
both countries’ presence in the Western Pacif c through
multiple joint training and exercises, including a bilateral
special anti-submarine training held in February 2014.

**(4) Joint Training and Exercises**
Such joint training and exercises in peacetime not only
contribute greatly to maintaining and enhancing the JapanU.S. joint response capabilities by deepening mutual
understanding of tactics and other aspects, enhancing
mutual communication, and improving interoperability,
but also are effective for improving tactical skills on each
side. In particular, the knowledge and techniques that
the Japanese side can learn from the U.S. Forces, which


**(5) Logistics support**

Japan-U.S. cooperation is also being steadily promoted
through logistical support based on the Acquisition and
Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA)[3] signed in 1996,
as a result of increased opportunities for cooperation
between the two countries. The Agreement is designed to
positively contribute to the smooth and effective operation
under the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and to initiatives for
international peace taken under the leadership of the United


GSDF personnel and the U.S. military personnel at a casualty
evacuation training using the MV-22 Osprey

Nations. Its scope of application includes various occasions
such as bilateral training and exercises in peacetime,
disaster relief activities, U.N. peacekeeping operations,
international disaster relief activities, situations in areas
surrounding Japan, and armed attack situations. If either the
JSDF or the U.S. Forces require the other party to provide
supplies or services, this Agreement in principle allows the
party to do so[4].
In addition, the Joint Statement of the “2+2” Meeting
in April 2015 demonstrated the intention to expeditiously
work on a negotiation on the Acquisition and CrossServicing Agreement to operationalize the mutual logistics
cooperation envisioned by the new Guidelines. The
negotiations are underway between the two countries.

See Fig. II-3-3-4 (Scope of the Japan-U.S. Acquisition and Cross-Servicing
Agreement (ACSA)); Part II, Chapter 3, Section 3-2-2 (“2+2” Meeting
(April 27, 2015))

**(6) Joint/Shared Use**
Expanding joint/shared use of facilities and areas increases
bases for the SDF’s activities such as maneuver areas, ports,
and airf elds, which in turn enhances the diversity and
eff ciency of Japan-U.S. bilateral training and expands the
scope and raises the frequency of such activities as ISR. The
SDF have only a limited number of facilities in Okinawa,
including Naha Air Base, and most of them are located in
urban areas, which results in operational limitations. The
joint/shared use of USFJ facilities and areas in Okinawa
will greatly improve the SDF’s training environment in
Okinawa, and facilitate implementation of joint exercises
and interoperability between the SDF and the U.S. Forces.
It will improve readiness and contribute to maintaining
the safety of local people in the case of a disaster. While
taking the JSDF defense posture in the regions including
Southwestern Islands and relations with local communities
into account, Japan and the U.S. are proactively engaged
in deliberations, and specif c initiatives are steadily
progressing. For example, the GSDF has been using Camp
Hansen since March 2008 for exercises. Moreover the
relocation of the ASDF Air Defense Command to Yokota


in April 2012 and the relocation of the GSDF Central
Readiness Force Headquarters to Zama in March 2013
were carried out. In addition, in December 2013, the MSDF
conducted the training on the sea and training utilizing
facilities in Guam and its surrounding area in cooperation
with the U.S. Navy. The development of training ranges in
Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands (Tinian Island,
Pagan Island, etc.) for shared use by the SDF and the U.S.
Forces is under consideration.

**2** **Cooperation in Response to a Large-scale**
**Disaster in Japan**


In the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake, 2011,
the SDF and the U.S. Forces demonstrated their high joint
response capabilities based on the strong ties they had
developed. The success of the joint response between the
U.S. Forces and the SDF through “Operation Tomodachi”
was the result of Japan-U.S. Bilateral Training and Exercises
over many years, and will lead to the Alliance being
deepened further in the future. “Operation Tomodachi”
involved the deployment of a large-scale force, at its peak
including troops of approximately 16,000 personnel,
around 15 ships, and around 140 aircraft; resulting in relief
activities that were unprecedented in scale, contributing
greatly to Japan’s restoration and reconstruction. Not only

SDF and U.S. Forces personnel collaboratively engaged in disaster relief activities


The categories of supplies and services as provided under the Agreement include: food; water; billeting; transportation (including airlift); petroleum, oils, and lubricants; clothing; communications;
medical services; base support; storage; use of facilities; training services; spare parts and components; repair and maintenance; airport and seaport services; and ammunition (only in armed attack

those affected but numerous Japanese at large were f lled
with a deepened sense of appreciation and trust for the U.S.
Forces in Japan.
The main factors behind the success of the joint JapanU.S. response to the Great East Japan Earthquake were
the cooperation between the two countries that has been
taking place even in peacetime, the swift and thorough
implementation of coordination between them, and the
presence of the U.S. Forces in Japan. In addition, the
success of these endeavors was also due not only to the
ongoing policy discussions and bilateral exercises carried
out between the two countries in peacetime, but also to the
fact that the stationing of the U.S. Forces in Japan means that
their troops here are well-acquainted with the geography
and culture of the country. On the other hand, some issues
have emerged; such as clarifying the roles, missions and
capabilities of Japan and the United States in the event of a
disaster within Japan, as well as stipulating more concrete
joint guidelines to facilitate greater participation by the
U.S. Forces in disaster prevention drills, and examining
mechanisms for the sharing of information and more
effective coordination mechanism.
In addition, the December 2013 Response Plan for a
Massive Earthquake in the Nankai Trough listed the JapanU.S. Joint Response Plan and the two countries conducted
a bilateral joint comprehensive disaster prevention training
in Kochi Prefecture in February 2014 to prepare for an
earthquake in the Nankai Trough. The U.S. Forces in Japan
(USFJ) also participated in the Wakayama Prefecture
Tsunami Disaster Readiness Practical Training (October
2014) and “Michinoku ALERT 2014” (November 2014),
a disaster relief exercise by the GSDF Tohoku Headquarters.
This shows how the JSDF and USFJ have been enhancing
their cooperation for disaster readiness at home and abroad.

fundamental rules such as freedom of navigation, ensured
safety, and the rule of law (e.g. peaceful dispute resolution
based on international laws). The two countries have been
working closely together on various multilateral maritime
security cooperation initiatives supported by such countries
as those around sea lanes, including the International
Minesweeping Exercise in the Persian Gulf hosted by
the United States from October to November in 2014, the
PSI Maritime Interdiction Training hosted by the United
States in August 2014, and the participation in CTF 151 for
responding to pirates.

See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 2-1 (Ensuring Maritime Security); Part III,
Chapter 3, Section 2-3-2 (International Initiatives Aimed at
Nonproliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction)

**(2) Trilateral and Multilateral Training and Exercises**
The new Guidelines will enable Japan and the Unites States
to promote and enhance trilateral and multilateral security
and defense cooperation. Thus, the JSDF are participating
in trilateral (e.g. Japan-U.S.-Australia, Japan-U.S.-India,
and Japan-U.S.-ROK) and multilateral training, in addition
to bilateral training and exercises between Japan and the
United States.


**4** **Cooperation on Space and Cyberspace**


**(1) Cooperation on Space**
With regard to cooperation on space, based on the agreement
made by the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting in November
2009 to promote cooperation in areas of space security as
part of initiatives to deepen the Japan-U.S. Alliance, the
two countries have periodically been working together to
discuss how they should cooperate in the future by allowing
related ministries and agencies to hold the 1st Japan-U.S.
Space Security Dialogue in September 2010.
Furthermore, the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting in
April 2012 decided to deepen the space-based partnership
for civil and security purposes and to create a whole-ofgovernment comprehensive dialogue on space, enabling a
variety of related ministries and agencies to hold the 1st
whole-of-government Japan-U.S. Comprehensive Dialogue
on Space in March 2013. The two countries have been
sharing information on their respective space policies and
discussing plans for future cooperation on a regular basis.
Moreover, based on the instructions given by the
Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting on April 8, 2015,
the two countries established the Space Cooperation
Working Group (SCWG) to further promote the
cooperation among bilateral defense authorities in the
area of space. Going forward, Japan and the United States
will leverage this working group to deepen discussion in
a wide variety of areas, including (1) promoting space
policy dialogue, (2) reinforcing information sharing,
(3) working together to develop and ensure experts, and
(4) implementing tabletop exercises.


**(1) Cooperation in International Activities**
Japan is conducting activities in close cooperation with
the U.S. through activities pursuant to the former AntiTerrorism Special Measures Act, international disaster
relief activities and international peace-keeping operations
in the Philippines and Haiti, and anti-piracy operations
in the Gulf of Aden. Japan and the United States worked
closely together at local multilateral coordination centers
to respond to the typhoon disaster that hit the Philippines in
November 2013. To respond to the outbreak of Ebola virus
disease, Japan started to dispatch liaison off cers to the U.S.
Africa Command in October 2014 for close cooperation,
coordinating efforts and collecting information with related
countries including the United States.
As for maritime security, both Japan and the United
States are making efforts as maritime nations to maintain
and develop “the open and stable ocean” based on

**(2) Cooperation on Cyberspace**

Concerning cooperation on cyberspace, the Cyber
Defense Policy Working Group (CDPWG) was established
in October 2013 as a framework between the MOD and DoD
to discuss a broad range of professional and concrete issues,
including the sharing of information at the policy level,
human resources development, and technical cooperation.
The two countries plan to accelerate discussions based on
the new Guidelines released in April 2015 and the CDPWG
Joint Statement published in May 2015[5].

technologies, including military technologies related to
joint technological research on BMD. Japan and the United
States consult with each other at forum such as the Systems
and Technology Forum (S&TF) and conduct cooperative
research and development regarding the specif c projects
agreed upon at the forum.

See Reference 25 (Japan-U.S. Joint Research and Development Projects)

Part III, Chapter 2 explains initiatives for the common
maintenance infrastructure for the 24 Osprey deployed by
the U.S. Marine Corps at MCAS Futenma and the Osprey
planned to be deployed by the GSDF[8] as well as initiatives
for the on-site maintenance locations for the F-35A
deployed by the ASDF.

See Part III, Chapter 2, Section 4-1 (Deepening Relationships with the United
States regarding Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation)


**(1) Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation**
Japan proactively promotes cooperation in defense
equipment and technology while bearing in mind the
maintenance of the technological and production bases
and the mutual cooperation principle based on the JapanU.S. Security Treaty and the Mutual Defense Assistance
Agreement between Japan and the United States of America.
In view of the progress in technology cooperation
between Japan and the United States, the improvement
of technological level, and other factors, Japan decided
to transfer its military technology to the United States
regardless of the Three Principles on Arms Exports
and related guidelines. In 1983, Japan established the
Exchange of Notes concerning the Transfer of Military
Technologies to the United States of America[6]. In 2006,
the Exchange of Notes concerning the Transfer of Arms
and Military Technologies to the United States of America[7]
was established to replace the foregoing Exchange of
Notes. Under these frameworks, Japan decided to provide


**(2) Education and Research Exchange**
The new Guidelines recognize the importance of intellectual
cooperation relating to security and defense, and the two
governments will deepen exchanges between members
of relevant organizations, and strengthen communication
between each side’s research and educational institutions.
To this end, the JSDF and the MOD have been working
on education and research exchange by accepting students
from abroad and holding bilateral and multilateral seminars
with the United States so that security and defense personnel
can share knowledge and enhance cooperation.

**Section 4 Stationing of the U.S. Forces in Japan**


Realignment of the U.S. Forces in Japan is extremely
important in mitigating the impact on local communities,
such as those in Okinawa, while maintaining the deterrence
capabilities of the U.S. Forces. The Ministry of Defense

**1** **Stationing of the U.S. Forces in Japan**


**1** **Signifi cance of the Presence of U.S. Forces**
**in Japan**


(MOD) will advance the U.S. Forces realignment and
other initiatives while making continuous efforts to gain
the understanding and cooperation of local communities
accommodating USFJ facilities and areas.

As mentioned in Part II, Chapter 3, Section 1-1, the U.S.
Forces in Japan serve as deterrence against aggression
towards Japan. Further, the realization of a stable U.S.
military presence is necessary for a swift Japan-U.S. joint
response based on Article 5 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty
in the event of an armed attack on Japan. Additionally, the
actions of the U.S. Forces in Japan in the defense of Japan
will be assisted by the timely reinforcement of other U.S.
Forces, and the U.S. Forces in Japan will serve as the basis
of such support.
In order for the U.S. Forces in Japan to carry out the
abovementioned role, it is necessary that all the services of
the U.S. Forces, including those in Japan, are functionally
integrated. For instance, the U.S. Forces hold a primarily
offensive power as a “spear” when responding to armed
aggression to Japan in cooperation with the SDF. When


For the Japan-U.S. Alliance, based on the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements, to adequately function as a
deterrence that contributes to Japan’s defense as well as
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacif c region, it is necessary
to secure the presence of the U.S. military in Japan, and to
maintain a posture in Japan and the surrounding areas in
peacetime that enables the U.S. Forces in Japan to respond
swiftly and expeditiously to emergencies.
For this purpose, based on the Japan-U.S. Security
Treaty, Japan allows the stationing of the U.S. Forces in
Japan, which is a core part of the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements.

the U.S. Forces function as an offensive power, it can
be expected that the U.S. Navy, Air Force, and Marines
stationed in Japan work in an integrated manner to fully
exert their functions.
In addition, while Article 5 of the Japan-U.S. Security
Treaty stipulates the obligation of the United States to
defend Japan, Article 6 allows for the use by the United
States of facilities and areas in Japan for maintaining the
security of Japan and international peace and security in
the Far East, and overall Japan-U.S. obligations are kept
in balance.

departments on base, and sales staff at welfare/recreational
facilities. They perform functions essential for the smooth
operations of the USFJ, and support its activities.
The Government of Japan hires these employees in
accordance with the provisions of the SOFA. The MOD
supports the stationing of the U.S. Forces in Japan by
performing administrative work for personnel management,
payment of wages, health care, and welfare, etc.


**3** **Host Nation Support (HNS)**


HNS plays an important role to ensure the smooth and
effective implementation of the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements. Due to soaring prices and wages in Japan
since the mid-1970s, and changes in the international
economy, the Government of Japan began to bear labor
costs such as welfare costs in FY1978. Then in FY1979,
Japan began to bear the Facilities Improvement Program
(FIP) respectively.
Furthermore, as labor costs soared due to changes
in economic conditions that affected both countries, the
employment stability of the employees was adversely
inf uenced, and there was even concern that it would affect
the activities of the U.S. Forces in Japan. Therefore in 1987
the governments of Japan and the United States agreed on
a special measure in Article 24 of the SOFA (the Special
Measures Agreement)[4] as a provisional measure for an
exception to the cost principle in the SOFA.
Based on this agreement, the Government of Japan
started to bear labor costs of eight categories such as the
adjustment allowance (currently replaced by the regional
allowance). As the Special Measures Agreement (SMA)
was revised later on, the costs borne by the Government of
Japan expanded to cover labor costs for base pay, etc., and
utilities costs from FY1991. The f nancial responsibility of
the Japanese Government was further expanded to cover
training relocation costs from FY1996.
Japan has been reviewing HNS with careful
consideration to its own diff cult f nancial situation. The
amount of Japan’s HNS budget peaked in FY1999 (annual
expenditure base), and has since been declining.
According to the comprehensive review conducted in
2010, the Japanese and U.S. Governments agreed that the
overall expense borne by Japan to support the stationing
of the U.S. Forces in Japan during the period in which the
SMA is in effect (for f ve years from FY2011 to FY2015),
was determined to be maintained at the same level as FY
2010 (approximately 188.1 billion yen).


The Status of Forces Agreement[1] (SOFA) stipulates
matters pertaining to USFJ facilities and areas and the
status of the U.S. Forces in Japan, including provisions
of facilities and areas for use by the U.S. Forces (USFJ
facilities and areas), and satisfying the labor requirements
of the U.S. Forces in Japan.

**(1) Provision of USFJ Facilities and Areas**
Japan provides USFJ facilities and areas for the U.S. Forces
under the provisions of the SOFA, in accordance with
agreements reached through the Joint Committee between
the governments of Japan and the United States.
The Government of Japan has entered into agreements
and concluded lease contracts with owners of private and
public lands on which these facilities and areas exist in
order to ensure the stable use of USFJ facilities and areas.
However, should the Government be unable to obtain
the approval of landowners, it will acquire title under the
Act on Special Measures for USFJ Land Release[2], while
compensating the landowners for any loss they may have
suffered in the process[3].


**(2) Satisfying Labor Requirements of the USFJ**
The USFJ require manpower (labor) to maintain its forces,
and the SOFA stipulates that the requirements of the USFJ
shall be satisf ed with the assistance of the Government
of Japan.
As of the end of FY2014, approximately 25,200 USFJ
local employees (hereinafter referred to as the “employees”)
work at USFJ facilities and areas throughout Japan, working
as off ce workers at headquarters, engineers at maintenance/
supply facilities, members of security guards and f re

Notes: 1. Training relocation costs under the Special Measures Agreement extend either into the cost sharing for the stationing of USFJ or the SACO-related costs and the realignment-related costs.
2. The SACO-related costs refer to the cost for implementing the contents of the SACO Final Report to reduce the impact on people in Okinawa, while the realignment-related costs refers to the
cost relating to a step to contribute to reducing the impact on local communities as part of the realignment initiatives. Since the cost-sharing for the stationing of USFJ is Japan’s voluntary
effort to bear some costs in light of the importance of ensuring the smooth and effective implementation of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, its nature is different from the SACO-related
costs and the realignment-related costs, and is categorized separately.
3. The costs related to the stationing of USFJ include the MOD-related budget, other ministry-related budgets (base subsidy, etc.: ¥38.8 billion, FY2014 Budget) and the estimated costs of
government-owned land provided for use as USFJ facilities (¥166.5 billion, FY2014 Estimated Costs).

**4** **Contents of the Special Measures Agreement**
**(SMA)**

The key points of the SMA that took effect in April 2011
are as follows:
(1) Effective period: Five years
(2) Cost sharing: Japan shall bear all or part of labor
costs, utilities costs, and the costs incurred in training
relocation. With regard to training relocation costs, on
top of the additional costs incurred on domestic training
relocations, costs incurred in training relocation to areas
under the administration of the U.S. government, such
as Guam, have also been added.

-  Operational Guidelines (specifi ed in the Exchange of
Notes concerning the SMA)
Labor costs: The upper limit of the number of workers
to be funded by Japan will be reduced from 23,055 to
22,625[5]. The adjustment will be phased in over the new
SMA period.
Utilities costs: The upper limit for utilities costs is set
at 24.9 billion yen for each f scal year. At the same time,
the share of costs to be borne by Japan is reduced from
the current 76% (approximate) to 72% (approximate). The


In addition to the costs of stationing the U.S. Forces in Japan,
the various costs associated with the U.S. Forces in Japan
include costs for implementing the stipulations of the Special
Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) Final Report for
mitigating the impact on the people of Okinawa, as well
as costs for implementing measures that will contribute to
mitigating the impact on local communities associated with
the initiatives for the realignment of the U.S. Armed Forces.

true sense as well as to allow them to perform to the best of
their capabilities. Our national land is narrow with limited
plains and there are many cases where USFJ facilities and
areas are located close to urban and business areas. In such
areas, factors including the existence of those facilities
and areas, and the takeoffs and landings of the U.S.
Forces aircraft, have considerable impact on the residents’
living environment and local development. It is therefore

realities of each area in mind.

in the Asia-Pacif c region in recent years. As a result, the
Governments of Japan and the United States decided to
delink both the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps personnel
from Okinawa to Guam and resulting land returns south
of Kadena Air Base from the progress on the Futenma
Replacement Facility (FRF).

**6** **USFJ Facilities and Areas and the Local**
**Communities**

For USFJ facilities and areas to fully exert their capabilities,
it is vital to gain cooperation and understanding from the
local communities. Meanwhile, the social conditions in the
surrounding areas have changed signif cantly, including for
example, through their urbanization over the past several
decades. In light of such changes, it is necessary to reduce
the impact of the facilities and areas as much as possible in
order to gain acceptance and support from the public in a


Fig. II-3-4-3 shows the progress of the realignment of the
U.S. Forces in Japan, as set forth in “the United States-Japan
Roadmap for Realignment Implementation of May 2006”
(Roadmap) described in Part II, Chapter 3, Section 3-1.
As to the USFJ realignment, in the meantime, the
governments of Japan and the United States have conducted
full-f edged bilateral discussions concerning the plan for
the realignment, in view of factors including the following:
1) The necessity of implementing measures to promptly
and steadily enable visible mitigation of the impact on
Okinawa;
2) The necessity of coordinating the realignment package
and strategic rebalance to the Asia-Pacif c region, which
was set out in the U.S. Defense Strategic Guidance
released in January 2012; and
3) The fact that a reduction in the cost associated with the
relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps to Guam has been
demanded by the U.S. Congress.
The achievements thereof have been announced as part
of the “2+2” Joint Statements and through other means.

**(April 27, 2012)**


**2** **Achievements in the “2+2” Joint Statement**
**(October 3, 2013)**

The Joint Statement of the “2+2” in October 2013 cited the
achievements in bilateral consultations on the realignment
of the U.S. Forces in Japan since the release of the Joint
Statement of the “2+2” Meeting in April 2012. Japan
and the United States renewed their strong determination
to complete the relocation of MCAS Futenma to Camp
Schwab, and agreed to continue to consult on other possible
measures while implementing the previous agreements
as early as possible and steadily from the perspective of
mitigating the impact on Okinawa.

See Reference 22 (Joint Statement of the Security Consultative Committee
(October 3, 2013))


**3** **Achievements in the “2+2” Joint Statement**
**(April 27, 2015)**

The Joint Statement of the “2+2” Meeting in April 2015
cited the achievements in bilateral consultations on the
realignment of the U.S. Forces in Japan since the release of
the Joint Statement of the “2+2” Meeting in October 2013.
The Ministers reaff rmed the two governments’ continued
commitment to implement the existing arrangements on
the USFJ realignment as soon as possible, while ensuring
operational capability, including training capability,
throughout the process. The Ministers underscored their
commitment to maintaining a robust and f exible force
posture that enhances deterrence by strengthening the
capacity to respond effectively to future challenges and
threat, while also mitigating the impact of US Forces on local
communities The following are sections pertaining to the


This “2+2” Joint Statement stated that, in light of important
progress made in regard to the plan for USFJ realignment
since the “2+2” Joint Statement in June 2011, it had been
decided to adjust the plans outlined in the 2006 Roadmap.
Originally, the 2006 Roadmap stated that, among
the III Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEF) stationed
in Okinawa, the main focus of the relocation to Guam
would be the command elements, but the U.S. decided
to alter the composition of the units. As a result, the U.S.
government decided to continue to retain the U.S. Forces
in Okinawa, and deploy Marine Air-Ground Task Forces
(MAGTF)—consisting of command, ground, aviation and
logistic support elements—in Japan, Guam, and Hawaii, as
well as in Australia as a rotational unit. This ref ects the
U.S. review of the composition of the units of the U.S.
Marine Corps following the evolving security environment

the commitment to the continued relocation of aviation
training, including to locations outside Okinawa
Prefecture, through efforts such as the development of
training areas and facilities.

-  Reconfi rmed that the plan to construct the FRF in the
Camp Schwab Henokosaki area and adjacent waters is
the only solution that addresses operational, political,
f nancial, and strategic issues as the only way to avoid
the continued use of MCAS Futenma.

-  Reaffi rmed the unwavering commitment of Japan and

**3** **Stationing of the U.S. Forces in Okinawa**


In comparison to areas such as the U.S. mainland, Hawaii,
and Guam, Okinawa is located closer to East Asia. Its
location is extremely important from the perspective of
security, being roughly in the center of the Southwestern
Islands and close to Japan’s sea lanes. Thus, the stationing
of the U.S. Forces in Okinawa—including the U.S. Marine
Corps, which is in charge of f rst response for a variety
of contingencies and is capable of high mobility and
rapid response—with the above-mentioned geographical
characteristics, further ensures the effectiveness of
the Japan-U.S. Alliance, strengthens deterrence, and
contributes greatly not only to the security of Japan but also
to the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacif c region.
On the other hand, Okinawa has many USFJ facilities
and areas such as airbases, exercise f elds, logistics
facilities. As of January 2015, approximately 74% of USFJ
facilities and areas (for exclusive use) are concentrated in
Okinawa Prefecture, occupying approximately 10% of the
land area of the prefecture and 18% of the main island of
Okinawa. Therefore, it is necessary to make utmost efforts
to mitigate the impact on Okinawa, while also considering
the above-mentioned security standpoints.

See Fig. II-3-4-4 (The Geopolitical Positioning of Okinawa and the
Signifi cance of the U.S. Marine Corps Stationed in Okinawa)


continually work on the implementation of the plan, and
anticipated the update of the plan by the spring of 2016.

-  Emphasized the on-time return of the West Futenma
Housing Area within Camp Zukeran on March 31,
2015. This is the most important of all land returns to
Japan based on the consolidation plan.
H Guam

-  Confi rmed that the two governments are steadily
implementing the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps
personnel from Okinawa to locations outside
Japan, including Guam, based on the revised Guam
International Agreement.
H Initiatives for Protecting the Environment

-  Reaffi rmed their commitment to enhancing
cooperation for protecting the environment.

-  Confi rmed the signifi cance of making further efforts
in environmental matters.

-  Welcomed the progress of a supplementary Agreement
on Cooperation in the Field of Environmental
Stewardship and conf rmed their intention to
continually negotiate documents of this agreement as
expeditiously as possible.

See Reference 23 (Joint Statement of the Security Consultative Committee
(April 27, 2015))

**1** **Initiatives for Realignment, Consolidation, and**
**Reduction of USFJ Facilities and Areas in Okinawa**


When Okinawa was returned to Japan in 1972, the
Government of Japan provided 83 facilities and areas
covering approximately 278 km[2] for exclusive use by
the U.S. Forces under the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.
However, their concentration in Okinawa has led to strong
calls for their realignment, consolidation and reduction on
the grounds that they seriously affect the lives of people in
Okinawa Prefecture.
Both countries have continued their initiatives to
realign, consolidate, and reduce USFJ facilities and areas,
and, in relation to the so-called 23 issues, it was agreed
in 1990 that both sides would proceed with the required
adjustments and procedures for the return of land. Most
recently, approximately 55 ha out of 162 ha of Camp Hansen
(part of a slope at the East China sea side) was returned
on June 30, 2014. Moreover, regarding the so-called Three
Okinawa Issues such as the return of Naha Port[7], it was
agreed in 1995 that initiatives would be made to resolve
these issues.

See Reference 27 (Outline of 23 Issues)

Subsequently, in response to an unfortunate incident
that occurred in 1995, as well as the refusal of the then
Governor of Okinawa to sign land lease renewal documents

under the Act on Special Measures for USFJ Land Release,
the Government of Japan decided to devote even greater
initiatives towards realignment, consolidation, and
reduction, believing that the impact should be shared by the
whole nation. In order to hold consultations on issues related
to USFJ facilities and areas in Okinawa, the Government
of Japan established the Okinawa Action Council between
the central government and Okinawa Prefecture, and the
Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) between
Japan and the United States, and the so-called SACO Final
Report was compiled in 1996.

roughly 43 km[2].

**3** **History and Progress of the U.S. Forces**
**Realignment in Okinawa**


As for initiatives relating to realignment of the U.S. Forces
based on the Roadmap, measures have been taken to
mitigate the impact on the local communities in Okinawa
Prefecture while maintaining deterrence capabilities.

**(1) Relocation and Return of MCAS Futenma**
The Government of Japan believes that it is imperative
not to allow MCAS Futenma to remain indef nitely at its
current location, which is in the vicinity of houses and
schools in the center of Ginowan City, Okinawa Prefecture.
This is a fundamental idea shared between the Government
of Japan and the people of Okinawa.
As for the relocation of MCAS Futenma, the
Government of Japan has not changed its stance that the
current plan to construct the FRF in the Camp Schwab


**2** **SACO Final Report and Progress**


The SACO Final Report stipulates the return of land, the
adjustment of training and operational procedures, the
implementation of noise abatement initiatives, and the
improvement of operational procedures regarding the
Status of Forces Agreement, and also refers to the related
facilities and areas covered. The land to be returned based
on the SACO Final Report represents approximately 21%
(about 50 km[2]) of USFJ facilities and areas in Okinawa
at that time, exceeding the amount of land returned
during the period between the reversion of Okinawa and

of external aircraft in cases of emergency will also be
transferred to mainland Japan.
(b) Land-f ll Area
The area required for the land reclamation to build the
FRF is less than one-third of MCAS Futenma and the new
facility will be equipped with signif cantly shorter runways.
(c) Flight Routes
Two runways will be constructed in a V-shape, which
enables the f ight path for both takeoff and landing to be
located over the sea, in line with the requests of the local
community. In MCAS Futenma, f ight paths used daily for
training and other purposes are located over residential areas,
whereas f ight paths in the FRF will be changed to over the
sea, thereby reducing noise and risks. For example, there
will be zero households requiring such insulation around
the FRF, while more than 10,000 households are located
in areas requiring housing noise insulation near MCAS
Futenma. This means that the noise levels experienced by
all households will comply with the environment criteria
applied to exclusive housing areas. In the case that an
aircraft encounters any contingency, safety on the ground
can be ensured by diverting the aircraft offshore.
b. The Necessity of Relocating the Futenma Replacement
Facility within Okinawa Prefecture
The U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa consists of air, ground,
logistics, and command elements. The interaction of those
elements in highly mobile and responsive operations of
the U.S. Marine Corps is indispensable, so it has been
determined that the FRF needs to be located within Okinawa
Prefecture so that rotary-wing aircraft stationed at MCAS
Futenma will be located near the elements with which they
train, operate, or otherwise work on a regular basis.
c. Background Concerning the Futenma Replacement Facility
Considering the occurrence of the U.S. Forces helicopter
crash in Ginowan City in August 2004, bilateral discussions
on realignment have been made toward realizing the

Henokosaki area and adjacent waters is the only solution to
avoid the continued use of MCAS Futenma.
Japan plans to make further efforts to achieve the
replacement and return of MCAS Futenma as early as
possible and to mitigate the impact on Okinawa in a speedy
manner. The return of MCAS Futenma is expected to
eliminate danger in the area and to contribute to the further
growth of Okinawa, including Ginowan City, through the
reuse of the area (approximately 481 ha with a land area
100 times larger than Tokyo Dome).
a. Relocation of MCAS Futenma and Mitigation of the
Impact on Okinawa
The relocation of MCAS Futenma holds more signif cance
than merely moving the facility from one location to
another. Rather, it also contributes greatly to mitigating the
impact on Okinawa. As such, the Government will work as
one to implement this initiative.
(a) Distribution of Functions Offered by MCAS Futenma
MCAS Futenma fulf lls the following functions relating to
the aviation capabilities of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed
in Okinawa:
H Operation of the Osprey and other aircraft
H Operation of air refueling aircraft
H Accepting a large number of transient aircraft in cases of
emergency
Of these three functions, only “operation of the Osprey
and other aircraft” will be relocated to Camp Schwab. All
15 KC-130 air refueling aircraft were relocated to MCAS
Iwakuni (in Yamaguchi Prefecture) in August 2014.
This marked the completion of a task that has remained
unresolved for 18 years since the SACO Final Report in
1996, enabling a vast majority of f xed-wing aircraft located
in MCAS Futenma to be moved outside Okinawa Prefecture.
This move also led to the relocation of approximately 870
USFJ personnel, civilian employees, and dependents. The
function of providing a base for accepting a large number


-----

relocation and return of MCAS Futenma at the earliest
possible date in order to resolve the unease of the residents
living in the vicinity.
In the SCC document compiled in October 2005, the
initiative to “locate the FRF in an ‘L’-shaped conf guration
that combines the shoreline areas of Camp Schwab
and adjacent water areas of Oura Bay” was approved.
Then, based on negotiation and agreement with the local
municipalities including Nago City, it was decided to
stipulate in the Roadmap that the FRF be located in a
conf guration that “combines Henokosaki and adjacent
water areas of Oura and Henoko Bays.” In regard to
construction of this replacement facility, “a Memorandum
of Basic Understanding” was exchanged between the
Governor of Okinawa Prefecture and then Minister of State
for Defense in May 2006.
After the change of government in September 2009,
the Exploratory Committee for Okinawa Base Issues was
established. After reviews conducted by the Committee,
both Governments, at the “2+2” Meeting held in May 2010,
conf rmed the intention to locate the FRF in the Camp
Schwab Henokosaki area and the adjacent waters, and also
agreed to take concrete measures to mitigate the impact on
Okinawa.
Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting held in June 2011,
it was decided that the runway would take a “V” shape, and
the Ministers conf rmed their commitment to complete the
relocation project at the earliest possible date after 2014 in
order to avoid the indef nite use of MCAS Futenma and to
remove the risks as early as possible.
During the deliberation process which led to these
conclusions, f rst of all, it was determined that, from a
security perspective, the deterrence of the U.S. Forces,
including that of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Okinawa
that is crucially located for the security of Japan, cannot be
lessened while there remains instability and uncertainty in
the East Asian security environment. Furthermore, concern
was expressed that the functions of the U.S. Marine Corps
would be weakened if the helicopter units stationed at
MCAS Futenma were to be detached from the other Marine
units stationed in Okinawa and moved abroad or out of the
prefecture. Therefore, it was concluded that the FRF had to
be within Okinawa Prefecture.
At the “2+2” Meetings in October 2013 and April
2015, which followed the “2+2” Meeting of April 2012, the
Governments of Japan and the United States also conf rmed
that the plan to construct the FRF at Camp Schwab
Henokosaki area and adjacent waters is the only solution
that avoids the continued use of MCAS Futenma.

d. Completion of Environmental Impact Assessment
Procedures
After the MOD sent the environmental impact
assessment scoping document in 2007 to the Governor of
Okinawa Prefecture and other parties, the MOD worked on
revising its document based on the opinions provided by the
Governor. Finally, the MOD completed the environmental
impact assessment procedures by sending the revised
assessment document to related parties including the
governor in December 2012, while making the assessment
document publicly viewable. Throughout these procedures,
the MOD received a total of 1,561 opinions from the
Governor of Okinawa Prefecture on six occasions, made all
the required revisions, and ref ected them in the content of
the environmental assessment. In this way, the MOD had
taken steps to comply with relevant laws, ask opinions and
ideas from Okinawa Prefecture over a suff cient period of
time, and ref ect them in the assessment.
e. Promotion of the Futenma Replacement Facility
Construction Project.
In relation to this project, the land-f ll request on public
waters was submitted in March 2013 and was approved by
the Governor of Okinawa Prefecture in December 2013. In
the meantime, the Governor sent a total of 260 questions
to the Okinawa Defense Bureau on four occasions and the
MOD responded appropriately to these questions and spent
suff cient time working on the procedures. Based on the
approval from the Governor, the offshore boring survey
started on August 14, 2014 and the project has been steadily
underway for the land-f ll work and the bank reinforcement.
This project is composed of land-f ll work on public waters
and the installation of an air base and other facilities. The
notif cation of the start of construction for the latter was
submitted to Okinawa Prefecture on June 30, 2014 and the
work was kicked off on July 1, 2014.

**(2) Force Reductions and Relocation to Guam**
In conjunction with the realignment of the U.S. Marine
Corps in the Asia-Pacif c region, the “2+2” Meeting in June
2011 and other agreements prescribe that approximately
8,000 personnel of the III MEF and approximately 9,000
dependents will be relocated from Okinawa to Guam at the
earliest possible date after 2014.
Regarding the costs of the relocation, the two sides
reached an agreement that, of the estimated $10.27 billion
(in U.S. f scal year 2008 dollars) cost of the facilities and
infrastructure development costs, Japan would provide
$6.09 billion, including $2.8 billion in direct cash
contribution, while the U.S. would fund the remaining
$4.18 billion. In February 2009, the Japanese Government
and the U.S. Government signed “the Agreement between

ensures actions taken by Japan and the United States, such
as Japan’s long-term funding for projects to which Japan
provides direct cash contributions (so-called Mamizu
projects). As part of the measures based on this Agreement,
the Japanese government has provided cash contributions
to the U.S. Government in relation to the Mamizu projects
since FY2009[8].
Subsequently, in the “2+2” Joint Statement of April
2012, the unit composition and the number of personnel to
be relocated to Guam were revised. More specif cally, with
the revision, Marine Air-Ground Task Forces (MAGTF) are
to be stationed and deployed in Guam, approximately 9,000
personnel are to be relocated to locations outside of Japan,
the authorized strength of the U.S. Marine Corps forces in
Guam is to be around 5,000 personnel and the end-state for
the presence of the U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa is to be
consistent with the levels envisioned in the Roadmap.
In this Joint Statement, the preliminary cost estimate
by the U.S. Government for the relocation is $8.6 billion
(in U.S. f scal year 2012 dollars). With regard to Japan’s
f nancial commitment, it was reaff rmed that it was to be
the direct cash contribution of up to $2.8 billion (in U.S.
f scal year 2008 dollars) as stipulated in Article 1 of the
Guam International Agreement. It was also conf rmed that
Japan’s equity investment and loans for family housing
projects and infrastructure projects would not be utilized.
Moreover, it was stipulated that any funds that had already
been transferred to the U.S. Government under the Guam
International Agreement would be counted as part of the
Japanese contribution. Furthermore, as a new initiative,
a portion of the direct cash contribution of $ 2.8 billion
mentioned above would be used to develop training areas
in Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands as shared use facilities for Japan and the U.S. In
addition, it was agreed that the remaining costs and any
additional costs would be borne by the U.S., and that the two
governments were to complete a bilateral cost breakdown.
At the “2+2” Meeting in October 2013, the Ministers
conf rmed that the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps personnel
from Okinawa contributes to sustaining the forward
presence of the U.S. Forces and promoting the development
of Guam as the strategic hub, while also mitigating the
impact on Okinawa. On that occasion, a Protocol amending
the Guam International Agreement, which forms the basis
for the bilateral cooperation necessary to achieve these
goals of the relocation, was signed. The amendment, which
is in line with the “2+2” Joint Statement of 2012, conf rmed
the delinking of the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps units
from Okinawa to Guam from progress on the FRF, and
added provisions concerning the development of training
areas in Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern


Mariana Islands and the shared use of these training areas
by the U.S. Forces and the SDF. The limit on Japanese cash
contributions remains unchanged at $2.8 billion (in U.S.
f scal year 2008 dollars). Both countries also completed the
process of creating a detailed breakdown of required costs.
Under the relocation plan described in the 2012 “2+2”
Joint Statement, U.S. Marine Corps units are to begin to
relocate from Okinawa to Guam in the f rst half of the 2020s.
The plan is considered to promote the implementation of
the consolidation plan on returning the land areas south of
Kadena Air Base published in April 2013.
Furthermore, the National Defense Authorization Act
for Fiscal Year 2015[9] was stipulated in December 2014,
which lifted the restriction on the use of funds by the
U.S. Congress. The Supplemental Environmental Impact
Statement (SEIS), conducted based on the revision of
operations due to the plan adjustment, is to be completed in
2015, subsequently enabling full-scale relocation work in
Guam. As for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands Joint Military Training Environmental Impact
Statement (CJMT-EIS), the draft was released in April
2015, and it is planned to be completed in 2016.

See Reference 31 (Agreement between the Government of Japan and
the Government of the United States of America Concerning the
Implementation of the Relocation of III Marine Expeditionary Force
Personnel and Their Dependents from Okinawa to Guam); Reference
32 (Protocol amending the Agreement between the Government of
Japan and the Government of the United States of America Concerning
the Implementation of the Relocation of III Marine Expeditionary Force
Personnel and Their Dependents from Okinawa to Guam)

**(3) Return of Land Areas South of Kadena Air Base**
At the SCC Joint Statement in April 2012, it was decided
to delink the progress on the FRF from both the relocation
of the III MEF personnel from Okinawa to Guam, and
resulting land returns south of Kadena. In addition,
with regard to the land to be returned, it was agreed to
conduct consultations focusing on three stages, namely
1) land eligible for immediate return; 2) land eligible for
return once the relocation of functions is completed; and
3) land eligible for return after the relocation abroad. The
return of all these types of land will enable the return of
approximately 70% of USFJ facilities located in densely
populated areas in the central and southern parts of the
main island of Okinawa.
Since the change of administration at the end of 2012,
Japan and the United States have continued consultation
under the basic policy of the Abe administration to dedicate
all its strength to mitigate the impact of the U.S. Forces on
Okinawa communities. Japan strongly requested an early
return of lands south of Kadena, including Makiminato
Service Area (Camp Kinser). As a result of bilateral


As for Japan’s Mamizu projects, Japan provided cash contributions of approximately 109.4 billion yen to the U.S. side by using the budgets from FY2009 to FY2014.

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 repealed a provision that imposed the restriction on the use of funds provided by the U.S. and Japanese governments for the Guam
Relocation project, which had been included in the acts since the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, and states that the total costs for the Guam relocation project may not exceed

Notes: 1. The times and years are based on the best case scenario concerning the return of specifi c facilities/areas after the completion of necessary measures and procedures to be taken by the
Governments of Japan and the United States. The periods may become delayed due to such factors as the progress of the preparation for relocation in Okinawa by the Government of Japan
and the U.S. Government’s efforts for relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps to outside Japan. Furthermore, the times and fi scal years in parentheses do not include the time necessary for
relocation of the Marine Corps from Japan because, though the conditions for returning the areas include its relocation to outside of Japan, the plan for the relocation is yet to be decided.
Consequently, the times of return of these areas may be changed depending on the progress of the relocation of the Marine Corps from Japan.
2. The area of each area is an approximate fi gure and may be slightly modifi ed based on the results of future surveys, etc.
3. Studies will be made in the process of developing a master plan to determine the feasibility of additional land returns.
*JC: Japan-U.S. Joint Committee


coordination, both countries announced the consolidation
plan in April 2013, which stipulated the return schedule,
including the specif c years of return.
In the consolidation plan, both sides conf rmed that
they will implement the plan as early as possible. The
Government of Japan needs to continue to work with all its
strength so that lands south of Kadena would be returned
at the earliest possible date. Furthermore, following the
announcement of the consolidation plan, the consultations
have been held since April 2013, involving Ginowan City,
Ginowan City Military Land Owners Association, Okinawa
Prefecture, Okinawa Defense Bureau, and Okinawa General
Bureau[10], and the MOD has also been providing necessary
cooperation. Efforts have been made to enable the early
return of land areas, including the land areas that are to
be returned as soon as required procedures are completed
(shown in red in Fig. II-3-4-8), since the announcement of
the consolidation plan in April 2013, creating a path for
the return of all four eligible land areas. This allowed the
return of the north entrance of Makiminato Service Area
(approximately 1 ha) in August 2013 and West Futenma


Housing Area within Camp Zukeran, approximately 51 ha,
at the end of March 2015.
The Government of Japan will take every opportunity
to hold consultations with the United States for the prompt
development by the United States of a master plan for
the return of land in the remaining areas, and support its
development. So far, the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee
has agreed on master plans for the Torii Communication
Station which would be the relocation point of U.S. Army
warehouses located in Camp Kinser, and Chibana Area
of Kadena Ammunition Storage Area. All-out initiatives
are being continuously made to steadily implement the
consolidation plan and mitigate the impact on Okinawa as
early as possible, and also to realize the respective returns
of land in the shortest possible time for more visible
mitigation of the impact on Okinawa.

are provided and the safety of f ight operation was
reconf rmed. Additionally, in order to conf rm its safety,
a Japanese analysis and assessment team was set up to
validate the contents of the accident investigations of the
U.S. government, based on Japan’s own viewpoints and
knowledge. The team examined the investigation results
and conf rmed that these accidents were caused largely by
human factors and that there were no safety problems with
the aircraft itself.
Furthermore, in relation to the f ight operations of the
MV-22, the two governments conf rmed that measures would
be taken to address these human factors in light of the lessons
learned from the accidents and agreed to implement specif c
measures to ensure the safety of MV-22 operations in Japan
through the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee and other occasions.
Based on the above results, considering that the safety
of MV-22 operations in Japan is fully conf rmed, f ight
operations of the MV-22 Osprey resumed in Japan.
The Government of Japan has conf rmed, from
information obtained from the United States, that the CV-22
and the MV-22 offer the same propulsion system and have
a basically similar structure and that the United States will
ensure complete safety in operating the CV-22 in Japan as
in the case of the MV-22. Based on this, Japan believes that
the safety of the CV-22 in Japan will be ensured just like
that of the MV-22.
Furthermore, in order to ensure that full consideration
is given to local residents and that the Joint Committee
agreement is properly implemented for f ight operations of
the MV-22 and the CV-22, the Government of Japan has
been continuously engaging with the U.S. side through
various opportunities, including the Japan-U.S. Defense
Ministerial Meetings.

See Fig. II-3-4-9 (Chronology of Osprey Deployment by the U.S. Forces)

**(4) Usability of Osprey Deployed by the U.S. Forces in**
**Case of Disaster**

In the aftermath of the devastating typhoon that hit the
central Philippines in November 2013, 14 MV-22 aircraft,
deployed in Okinawa, were dispatched for humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief activities to support “Operation
Damayan.” The MV-22s were deployed promptly to affected
areas that were diff cult to access, and they transported
several hundred isolated victims and about six tons of relief
materials in a day. In April 2014, the MV-22, deployed in
Okinawa, was dispatched for rescue activities in the wake
of an accidental sinking of a passenger ship off the coast of
Jindo in the Republic of Korea.
Furthermore, in response to the large earthquake that
hit Nepal in April 2015, four MV-22 aircraft, deployed
in Okinawa, were dispatched to the country to transport
personnel and supplies.
In contrast, the MV-22 was used in Japan to conduct
training for transporting victims to an MSDF escort vessel and
other locations on such occasions as “Wakayama Prefecture
Tsunami Disaster Readiness Practical Training” (October


**4** **Osprey Deployment by the U.S. Forces in Japan**

**(1) MV-22 Osprey Deployment in Okinawa**
The Osprey is an aircraft that combines the vertical takeoff/
landing and hovering functions of rotary-wing aircraft on
one hand and the speed and range of f xed-wing aircraft on
the other. As the primary air unit of the U.S. Marine Corps,
the MV-22 Osprey that have been developed for the U.S.
Marine Corps play an important role in engaging in a broad
range of activities, including transportation of personnel
and goods.
The U.S. Marine Corps is in the process of replacing
aged rotary-wing airplanes (CH-46) with MV-22s, which
have superior basic performance. In September 2013, all
the 24 CH-46s deployed at MCAS Futenma were replaced
by MV-22s.
The MV-22 is a highly capable aircraft compared with
the CH-46; it can f y faster, can carry more payload, and has
a longer range. Its deployment to Okinawa will strengthen
the deterrence of the U.S. Forces in Japan as a whole and
greatly contribute to the peace and stability of the region.


**(2) CV-22 Osprey Deployment to Yokota Air Base**
On May 11, 2015 (same day U.S. time), the United States
notif ed Japan of its plan to deploy CV-22 Osprey aircraft to
Yokota Air Base starting in the latter half of 2017, followed
by the announcement of this plan by the U.S. Department
of Defense on May 12 (May 11 U.S. time). The United
States plans to deploy the f rst three aircraft in the latter
half of 2017 and complete the deployment of a total of 10
aircraft by 2021.
The CV-22 aircraft deployed to Yokota Air Base
handles tasks for transporting personnel and supplies for
Special Operation Forces of the U.S. Forces to deal with
crises and emergencies in the Asia-Pacif c region, including
humanitarian assistance and natural disasters. The CV-22
and the MV-22 are two different models, but both models
offer the same propulsion system and have a fundamentally
similar structure.
As Japan faces increasingly tougher security e
nvironments, the deployment of high-performance CV-22 as
part of the rebalancing strategy and enhancement of readiness
posture of the United States will enhance the deterrence
and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance and
contribute to the stability of the Asia-Pacif c region.
The Government of Japan will continue to respond to
local communities in a sincere manner in order to obtain
their understanding and cooperation.

**(3) Safety of the Osprey**
After the crash of an MV-22 in Morocco in April 2012 and
the crash of a CV-22 in Florida in June 2012, concerns
about its safety have grown among Japanese people. In
response, the Government of Japan and the Government of
the United States agreed to refrain from any f ight operation
in Japan until the results of the accident investigation

Like the MV-22, the CV-22 can conduct humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief activities, including search and
rescue missions, both immediately and over a large range,
in the case of a large-scale disaster. As such, it is expected
that the superior capabilities of the Osprey deployed by the
U.S. Forces can be showcased in a variety of operations in
the future as well.

**5** **Consultation Structure for Mitigating the Impact**
**on Okinawa**

Today, a number of USFJ facilities and areas still remain in
Okinawa because of the U.S. occupation of Okinawa and
the slower returning progress of USFJ facilities and areas
compared to other areas of Japan even after the occupation
ended. In order to mitigate the concentrated impact on
Okinawa, the Government of Japan has been implementing
initiatives toward the realization of the SACO Final Report
and the Roadmap. The MOD is committed to further
mitigating the impact on Okinawa through the Okinawa
Policy Council, its subcommittee and other means[11], while
listening to the opinions of the local residents.
At the Okinawa Policy Council Meeting on December
17, 2013, the Governor of Okinawa presented several
requests, including cessation of the operation of MCAS
Futenma within f ve years and its early return, the
re-deployment of about 12 MV-22 Osprey aircraft to bases
outside of Okinawa, and the total return of Makiminato
Service Area within seven years.
The Japanese government as a whole is addressing
the mitigation of the impact on Okinawa by establishing
the Council for Promoting the Mitigation of the Impact
of MCAS Futenma on Okinawa, consisting of the Chief
Cabinet Secretary, the Minister of State for Okinawa, the
Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Defense, the
Governor of Okinawa and the Mayor of Ginowan. The MOD
also created the Committee for Promoting the Mitigation
of the Impact of Bases on Okinawa headed by the State
Minister of Defense on January 22, 2014 to continually
work on the reduction of the impact on Okinawa.
In addition to discussions based on this framework,
Japan has advanced discussions with the United States to
mitigate the impact on Okinawa. Both countries shared


the view to continue efforts to relocate aviation training,
including that of MV-22s, to locations outside Okinawa
Prefecture and Japan and to continue and enhance initiatives
to accelerate the process of returning land areas south of
Kadena (particularly Makiminato Service Area), enabling
the two countries to announce these matters through a joint
press release on October 20, 2014.
The Japanese Government has continually been
working on Japan-U.S. joint exercises using the MV-22
and cooperating with local communities to allow the use of
Saga Airport by the U.S. Marine Corps in order to develop
the training infrastructure and locations for the MV-22.
In addition, efforts are underway to realize the return
of Makiminato Service Area. To accelerate this process,
Japan has helped the U.S. Forces to develop a master plan
related to the return of this area.

See Part II, Chapter 3, Section 4-6 (Measures to Mitigate the Impacts of
USFJ Facilities and Areas)

**6** **Initiatives for the Use of Lands Previously**
**Provided for Use by the Stationed Forces**


For the return of lands in Okinawa provided for use by the
USFJ (hereinafter, “USFJ Land”), the “Act on Special
Measures Concerning Promotion of Effective and
Appropriate Use of the Lands in Okinawa Prefecture
Previously Provided for Use by the Stationed Forces”
stipulates various measures concerning the USFJ Land
agreed to be returned. Mainly, the MOD: (1) conducts
mediation in relation to access for surveys, etc. to be
implemented by prefectural governments and local
municipalities on the USFJ Land which are agreed to
be returned; (2) conducts measures applying to all the
returned lands to remove impediments for use such as soil

caused by the activities of the stationed forces, before
handing over the land to the owners of former USFJ Land;
and (3) provides f nancial benef ts to alleviate the impact
on the owners of the returned lands and to promote use of
the land.
The MOD will continue its initiatives to promote
the effective and appropriate use of returned lands by
coordinating and cooperating with related ministries, the
prefectural government and local municipalities.

In regions other than Okinawa, the MOD is implementing
measures to secure the stable presence of the U.S. Forces
by maintaining its deterrence abilities and trying to mitigate
the impact on local communities.

responses to various contingencies, the JGSDF Central
Readiness Force Headquarters, which unilaterally controls
JGSDF mobile operation units and specialized units, was
relocated from JGSDF Camp Asaka (in Saitama Prefecture)
to Camp Zama, where the headquarters of U.S. Army Japan
(USARJ) are located, at the end of FY2012. In accordance
with the transformation of USARJ headquarters, a mission
command training center and other support facilities were
constructed within the U.S. Forces Sagami General Depot
(SGD, in Kanagawa Prefecture) using U.S. funding. In
addition, measures will be implemented for more effective
and eff cient use of Camp Zama and the SGD, including
partial release of facilities and areas. The partial release of
land (approximately 17 ha) at SGD was approved by the
Joint Committee in June 2008, while the partial release of
land (approximately 5.4 ha) at Camp Zama, and the shared
use of a portion of land at SGD (approximately 35 ha) with
Sagamihara City were approved in October 2011 and June
2012, respectively, by the Joint Committee.
Of all these land areas, a portion of land at SGD


Due to the strong desire from local public bodies and other
organizations, the return of six facilities and areas (including
Kami Seya Communication Station in Yokohama City),
as well as the construction of approximately 700 housing
units for the U.S. Forces families in the Yokohama area of
the “Ikego Housing Area and Navy Annex” were agreed in
October 2004 by the Joint Committee. Subsequently, both
countries held consultations regarding the review of the
number of housing units to be constructed and the return of
part of the land in the Zushi area currently used by the US
Forces Japan as “Ikego Housing Area and Navy Annex.”
As a result, the Joint Committee in September 2010 agreed
that the number of housing units to be constructed would
be around 400 as an interim measure to facilitate the
relocation of the Negishi Housing Area and that ongoing
discussions regarding the return of part of the land in the
abovementioned Zushi area would be held. As a stopgap
measure until the land is returned, the Joint Committee
added that use of the land would be shared with Zushi City,
once the requirements are fulf lled.
Up to now, three facilities and areas (Fukaya
Communication Site, Koshiba POL Depot, and Tomioka
Storage Area) have been returned and part of the land in the
Zushi area of the Ikego Housing Area has been designated
for shared use. The Joint Committee in April 2014 also
set the goal of returning the Kami Seya Communication
Station at the end of June 2015. In addition, the Joint
Committee agreed to change the number of housing units to
be constructed in the Yokohama area of the Ikego Housing
Area from approximately 400 to 171.

**(2) Yokota Air Base and Airspace**
a. Establishment of the Bilateral Joint Operations
Coordination Center (BJOCC)
Enhancement of coordination between the headquarters
of both countries, combined with the transition to joint
operational posture, is highly important to ensure a response
of f exibility and readiness of the SDF and the U.S. Forces.
The headquarters of the U.S. Forces in Japan located at
Yokota Air Base, and Tokyo plays an important role in the
various mechanisms under the Guidelines. Therefore, along
with the relocation of ASDF Air Defense Command HQ as
mentioned below, the BJOCC[12] was established at Yokota
Air Base and commenced operations at the end of FY2011.

See Part II, Chapter 3, Section 2 (Overview of the Revision of the Guidelines)

b. Relocation of ASDF Air Defense Command HQ
In the case of air defense and BMD, only a short time
is available for response. Therefore, it is important for
the SDF and the U.S. Forces to immediately share the
necessary information. Thus, at the end of FY2011, the
ASDF Air Defense Command HQ and its relevant units
were relocated to Yokota Air Base where the U.S. 5th Air
Force Headquarters is located. This arrangement and the
establishment of the above-mentioned BJOCC have made it
possible to enhance coordination between the headquarters
of the SDF and the U.S. Forces, including the sharing of
information concerning air defense and BMD.
c. Yokota Airspace
To facilitate the operations of civilian airplanes in Yokota
airspace, where the U.S. Forces conduct radar approach
control, measures have been taken since 2006 to temporarily
transfer the responsibility for air traff c control of portions
of Yokota airspace to the Japanese authorities, to deploy
ASDF off cers at the Yokota Radar Approach Control
(Yokota RAPCON), and to reduce the airspace by about
40% (i.e. the release of air traff c control from USFJ).
d. Civilian-Military Dual Use of Yokota Air Base
At the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting held in 2003, it was
agreed that the joint civilian-military use of Yokota Air
Base would be studied, and a Liaison Conference was
then established as a working panel attended by relevant
government ministries and agencies and the Tokyo
Metropolitan Government. The governments of Japan and
the United States are conducting a study on the specif c
conditions and modalities, with the understanding that both
countries will not compromise the military operations and
safety of Yokota Air Base.


**(3) Deployment of U.S. Aircraft Carrier to Yokosuka**
**Naval Base**

The presence of the U.S. Pacif c Fleet plays an important
role in ensuring maritime security in the Asia-Pacif c region
as well as regional peace and stability. The U.S. aircraft
carrier provides the core capability of the Fleet.
The aircraft carrier USS George Washington, which has
been forward deployed in Yokosuka (Kanagawa Prefecture)
until May 2015, will proceed to the United States for fuel
exchange, and in its place, the nuclear-powered aircraft
carrier[13] USS Ronald Reagan will be forward deployed.
The U.S. Navy aff rms that it will continue to ensure
that all of its nuclear-powered vessels (including USS
George Washington) adhere to the relevant safety policies.
For example, the nuclear reactor will normally be shut down
while the aircraft carrier is anchored, and repairing and
refueling will not be carried out in Japan. The Government
of Japan intends to continue taking all possible measures to
ensure safety.

**(4) Measures relating to Atsugi Air Facility and MCAS**
**Iwakuni**

a. Relocation of Carrier-Based Aircraft
Atsugi Air Facility (in Kanagawa Prefecture) is currently
used as a base for carrier-based aircraft. Since Atsugi Air
Facility is located at the center of an urban district, the noise
of carrier jets taking off and landing in particular has been
a problem for a long time. It is necessary to resolve such
problems as soon as possible in order to stably maintain the
operations of aircraft carriers.
On the other hand, after the completion of the runway
relocation project[14] at MCAS Iwakuni (the relocation of the
runway approximately 1,000 meters offshore), safe aircraft
operations would become possible with less impact on the
living environment of the surrounding communities.
Taking these factors into consideration, CVW-5
squadrons are to be relocated from Atsugi Air Facility
to MCAS Iwakuni. In order to mitigate impacts of
the increased operations at MCAS Iwakuni due to the
projected relocation, related measures will be taken,
including: (1) conducting the relocation after the runway
is moved offshore, (2) relocation of MSDF EP-3, etc. from
MCAS Iwakuni to Atsugi Air Facility, (3) deployment of
KC-130 (to be relocated from MCAS Futenma to MCAS
Iwakuni) on a regular rotational basis to MSDF Kanoya
Base (in Kagoshima Prefecture) and Guam for training
and operations, and (4) relocation of U.S. Marine Corps
CH-53D helicopters from MCAS Iwakuni to Guam.
Due to these measures, the area requiring residential
noise-abatement work (so-called f rst category area) will

and U.S. headquarters.

13 Nuclear-powered aircraft carriers do not need to replenish their fuel and they are able to maintain the high speeds necessary for the operation of aircraft, giving them excellent combat and operational
capabilities.

decrease from approximately 1,600 ha to 500 ha.
Subsequently, at the “2+2” held in October 2013, it
was acknowledged that the relocation of CVW-5 from
Atsugi Air Facility to MCAS Iwakuni should be completed
by around 2017. In addition, with regard to the relocation
of MSDF EP-3, etc. to Atsugi Air Facility as stated in
(2) above, upon the request of local public entities in
the vicinity of MCAS Iwakuni, it was aff rmed that, as a
result of Japan-U.S. deliberation including defense posture
review, MSDF EP-3, etc. would remain at MCAS Iwakuni.
With regard to the regular deployment of KC-130 on a
rotational basis to MSDF Kanoya Base and Guam as stated
in (3) above, consultations are being held between Japan
and the United States pertaining to training and operations
at MSDF Kanoya Base.
In addition, concerning the relocation of U.S. Marine
Corps CH-53D helicopters from MCAS Iwakuni to
Guam as stated in (4) above, Japan and the United States
conf rmed that based on the Roadmap, etc. the unit, which
has been temporarily dispatched to the Middle East from
MCAS Iwakuni, will be relocated to the mainland of the
United States without returning to MCAS Iwakuni and then
relocated to Guam.
In order to construct family housing and sports
facilities, etc. required for the relocation of carrier-based
aircraft to MCAS Iwakuni, site development work is
currently being undertaken in the Atagoyama area.
b. Field-Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP)
The 2006 Roadmap prescribes that a bilateral framework
to conduct a study on a permanent FCLP facility is to be
established with the goal of selecting a permanent site at
the earliest possible date. At the “2+2” Meeting of June
2011, it was conf rmed that the Government of Japan will
explain to local authorities that Mageshima is considered
to be the candidate site for a new SDF facility. This SDF
facility would be used to support operations in response to
a variety of situations including large-scale disasters as well
as regular exercises and other activities, including use by
the U.S. Forces as a permanent site for FCLP. In addition,
the 2005 SCC document conf rmed that the U.S. Forces
will continue to conduct FCLP at Iwo-To in accordance
with existing temporary arrangements until a permanent
FCLP training facility is identif ed.
c. Resumption of Civil Aviation Operations at MCAS Iwakuni
Considering that the local public entities, etc., including
Yamaguchi Prefecture and Iwakuni City, had been working
together to request the resumption of civil aviation
operations, it was agreed in 2005 that civil aviation
operations of four round trips per day would be allowed as
long as such operations do not compromise U.S. military
operational requirements.
It was then agreed in the Roadmap that “portions of the
future civilian air facility will be accommodated at MCAS


Iwakuni.” Based on this agreement, Iwakuni Kintaikyo
Airport was opened in 2012, resuming regular f ights of
civil aviation aircraft after 48 years.

**(5) Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)**
Japan and the United States are set to continue close
coordination on BMD as the two countries improve their
respective BMD capabilities. In June 2006, an AN/TPY-2
radar (so-called “X-Band Radar”) system was deployed to
the U.S. Shariki Communication Site[15]. Also in October
2006, U.S. Army Patriot PAC-3 units (Patriot Advanced
Capability) were deployed to Kadena Air Base and Kadena
Ammunition Storage Area.
At the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting in February
2013, both sides agreed on the necessity of the additional
deployment of TPY-2 radar in Japan to further enhance
BMD capabilities and completed the deployment to the U.S.
Kyogamisaki Communication Site (in Kyoto Prefecture) in
December 2014.
Moreover, at the Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial
Meeting in April 2014, the U.S. Secretary of Defense stated
that the United States would deploy additional Aegis ships
with BMD capabilities to Japan. The U.S. notif ed Japan
in October 2014 that the country would deploy additional
Aegis ships with BMD capabilities to Yokosuka Naval Base
in August 2015 and July 2017 and replace an Aegis ship
already deployed to Yokosuka Naval Base with one that has
BMD capabilities.

**(6) Training Relocation**
Based on the decision that U.S. aircraft from three USFJ
facilities—Kadena, Misawa (in Aomori Prefecture) and
MCAS Iwakuni—would participate for the time being in
bilateral training with ASDF at ASDF facilities, training

relocation has been underway since 2007[16]. The MOD
has been improving its infrastructure, as required, for the
training relocation.
In addition to assisting USFJ, the MOD and the SDF
are conducting efforts to ensure the safety and security
of the local community, such as the establishment of a
liaison off ce, facilitated communication with related
government agencies, and response to requirements from
the local community. These efforts have been contributing
to successful training relocation.
In January 2011, at the Joint Committee, based on
the “2+2” Joint Statement in 2010, both governments
agreed to include Guam as a new training relocation site
and to expand the scale of training. Moreover, at the Joint
Committee in October 2011, they agreed on details for
training sites. After that, training was relocated to Guam

**5** **Initiatives for Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of the U.S. Forces in Japan**


In order to smoothly implement the realignment of the U.S.
Forces in Japan based on the Roadmap, the “Act on Special
Measures on Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of
United States Forces in Japan (USFJ Realignment Special
Measures Act)” was enacted in August 2007. Realignment
grants, Special Subsidy Rates for Public Projects, etc. and
other systems were established based on the law.
During a period of time before and after the
implementation of realignment (10 years in principle),
realignment grants[17] will be awarded to help cover the
expenses of projects[18] which contribute to increasing the
convenience of the lives of residents of local municipalities
affected by the realignment[19], and to stimulate local


and other locations for the f rst time, leading to a series of
training conducted at relocation sites.
Furthermore, in March 2014, both governments
agreed to add air-to-ground training using the Misawa
Air-to-Ground Range through the Joint Committee. The
addition of air-to-ground training contributes to enhancing
interoperability between the two countries, and also
to relocating part of air-to-ground training originally
conducted at Tori Shima Range, etc. with U.S. Forces
aircraft f ying to Kadena Air Base. Thus, this training
relocation will help noise abatement around Kadena Air
Base, thereby contributing to the mitigation of the impact of
U.S. Forces training activities in Okinawa. This agreement
resulted in air-to-ground training using the Misawa Air-toGround Range in June 2014.

industries. To this end, they will be awarded in accordance
with progress made in the steps of U.S. Forces realignment,
after the Defense Minister designates the specif ed defense
facilities and neighboring municipalities affected by
realignment. As of April 2015, 16 defense facilities in 41
municipalities are eligible to receive the grant.
In addition, under U.S. Forces realignment, some
USFJ facilities and areas will be returned, and the U.S.
Marine Corps in Okinawa will be relocated to Guam. Since
this may affect the employment of USFJ local employees,
the Government of Japan will take measures to include
education and skills training, which is to help retain their
employment.


16 USFJ aircraft conduct bilateral exercises at JASDF facilities in order to improve interoperability and reduce the impact of training activities on the areas surrounding USFJ air bases.

17 Approximately 13 billion yen in the FY2015 budget

18 Under the Realignment Special Measures Act, changes in the composition of units of those naval vessels that conduct operations integrally with US air wings subject to realignment (replacement of
the aircraft carrier at Yokosuka Naval Base with a nuclear aircraft carrier) will be treated in the same way as the realignment of the U.S. Forces in Japan.

19 The scope of specifi c projects includes 14 projects identifi ed by Article 2 of the enforcement ordinance of the Act on Special Measures on Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of United States


-----

**6** **Measures to Mitigate the Impacts of USFJ Facilities and Areas**


As for the implementation of the FRF project, it was
determined to take maximum environmental conservation
measures in order to avoid or mitigate impacts on the
environment as much as possible. Such measures include
consideration and implementation of measures to improve
environmental conditions to make them suitable for sea
turtles to come onto land and lay eggs, the transplanting
of corals and seaweeds, periodic checking for the habitats
of dugongs using aircraft and underwater recording
devices, and the use of rubble[22] for land-f ll material,
which is produced regardless of the project; it was also
determined to engage in other enhanced initiatives such as
follow-up surveys. In order to implement these measures,
an environmental monitoring committee was established to
ask for advice and guidance by specialists and experts, as
was considered when approval was given by the Governor
of Okinawa Prefecture for the reclamation. In addition,
where necessary, environmental conservation measures
will be improved and the range of surveys will be expanded
to make sure all possible measures will be taken.


**1** **Initiatives to Conserve the Environments around**
**USFJ Facilities and Areas**

At the “2+2” meeting in September 2000, based on the
recognition that environmental conservation is important,
the governments of both nations agreed to make it a common
objective to ensure the health and safety of residents in the
vicinity of USFJ facilities and areas, U.S. Forces personnel,
their families and other such parties, and made the “Joint
Statement of Environmental Principles[20].” To follow up
on this announcement, Japan-U.S. consultation has been
enhanced. Specif cally, the MOD has been working with
relevant ministries and agencies to enhance cooperation
for regular reviews of the Japan Environmental Governing
Standards (JEGS)[21], exchange information on the
environment, and deal with environmental pollution.
Additionally, at the “2+2” meeting in May 2010, from
the perspective of shared responsibility for environmental
conservation, Japan and the United States instructed their
staffs to discuss the possibility of taking a “Green Alliance”
approach for the U.S. Forces facilities and areas in Japan,
and the adoption of renewable energy for U.S. bases under
development in Japan as one of the elements of HNS was
reviewed, along with other issues. The result was ref ected
in the comprehensive review of HNS as described in Part II,
Chapter 3, Section 4-1-3.
In December 2013, the governments of both Japan
and the U.S. announced the “Joint Announcement on a
Framework Regarding Environmental Stewardship at
U.S. Armed Forces Facilities and Areas in Japan.” The
governments engaged in discussions aimed at the creation
of a framework for increased initiatives in managing the
environment associated with USFJ facilities and areas,
and announced in October 2014 that both parties reached
a substantial agreement that would supplement the SOFA
through a joint press release. This supplemental agreement
is part of a more comprehensive framework for recognizing
the signif cance of environmental protection and fulf lls
the bilateral goal def ned by the press release in December
2013. Both countries expect to compile a series of related
technical documents in the future to complete this entire
framework.

See Part II, Chapter 3, Section 4-1-3 (Host Nation Support (HNS))


**2** **Other Measures**


Japan is engaged in measures for the improvement of the
living environment in regions surrounding USFJ facilities
and areas. It also provides municipalities with base grants[23]
which have alternate features in terms of municipal tax on
real estate.

See Part III, Chapter 4, Section 1-4 (Measures to Promote Harmony
between Defense Facilities and Surrounding Areas)

Moreover, in the vicinities of USFJ facilities and areas,
incidents and accidents caused by U.S. Forces personnel
and others have affected local areas and their residents,
so the Government of Japan has requested USFJ to take
effective measures for the prevention of recurrence, such
as educating military personnel and others, and enforcing
strict discipline among them. The Government of Japan is
cooperating with USFJ in these preventive measures; at the
same time it has taken measures for prompt and appropriate
compensation for the damage caused by the incidents and
accidents.
The U.S. side has put in place its guidelines for offduty action (liberty policy), including measures such as

*See “Location of Principal SDF Units” at the end of the book.

Defense Council in which deliberations concerning general
policies related to the MOD take place. Furthermore, there
are an Administrative Vice-Minister of Defense, who
organizes and supervises the administrative affairs of each
bureau and organization to support the Minister of Defense,
and a Vice-Minister of Defense for International Affairs,
who is responsible for the overall coordination of duties
such as those related to international affairs.
Moreover, the Internal Bureau, Joint Staff Off ce,
Ground Staff Off ce, Maritime Staff Off ce and Air Staff
Off ce have been established in the MOD. The Internal
Bureau is responsible for basic politics relating to the
duties of the SDF. The Director-General of the Minister’s
Secretariat and the Directors-General of each Bureau
within the Internal Bureau shall, in accordance with their
respective responsibilities, support the Minister of Defense
with regard to the instructions and authorization, etc. that
the Minister issues to the Chief of Joint Staff and the Chiefs


of the Ground Staff, Maritime Staff and Air Staff. The Joint
Staff is a staff organization for the Minister of Defense
concerning the operation of the SDF. The Chief of Joint
Staff provides centralized support on the operation of the
SDF for the Minister of Defense from a military expert’s
perspective. The Ground Staff, Maritime Staff and Air
Staff are the staff organizations for the Minister of Defense
concerning their respective services except operations of
the SDF, with the Chiefs of Staff for the GSDF, the MSDF
and the ASDF acting as the top-ranking expert advisers to
the Minister of Defense regarding these services. In this
manner, MOD has ensured that the support for the Minister
from a policy perspective and the support for the Minister
from a military expert’s perspective shall be provided in a
well-balanced manner like the two wheels on a spoke, so to
speak, in order for the Minister of Defense to appropriately
make decisions. The provisions of the Act for Partial
Revision of the Ministry of Defense Establishment Act


-----

etc. that was enacted on June 10, 2015[2] make this existing
concept regarding the support system for the Minister of
Defense even more explicit with regard to Article 12 of the
Ministry of Defense Establishment Act[3].
As shall be explained below, the new establishment of
the Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency and the
reorganization of the Joint Staff will be conducted as part
of reform.

**3** **Base of Defense Administration in Regional Areas**


The MOD has Regional Defense Bureaus in eight locations


across the country (Sapporo City, Sendai City, Saitama
City, Yokohama City, Osaka City, Hiroshima City, Fukuoka
City, and Kadena Town) as its local branch off ces in charge
of comprehensive defense administration.
In addition to implementing measures to alleviate the
burden on local communities hosting the U.S. bases in
Japan and inspecting equipment, Regional Defense Bureaus
carry out various activities to obtain the understanding and
cooperation of both local public entities and local residents
toward MOD and SDF activities.

See Part III, Chapter 4, Section 1 (Collaboration with Local Communities)

**2** **Joint Operations System of the Self-Defense Forces**


See Fig. II-4-1-3 (Operational System of the SDF and Roles of the Chief
of Joint Staff and the Chiefs of Staff of the Ground, Maritime, and Air
Self-Defense Forces)


In order to rapidly and effectively fulf ll the duties of
the SDF, the MOD and the SDF have adopted the joint
operation system in which the GSDF, the MSDF, and the
ASDF are operated integrally. The MOD and the SDF are
making efforts to strengthen the foundation of the joint
operations as well as to enhance the functions of the Joint
Staff in light of the current security environment.


**2** **Establishment of Foundation to Enhance**
**the Joint Operations Structure**

Within the joint operations structure, communication
of accurate commands and prompt information sharing
between the units in the GSDF, the MSDF and the ASDF
are crucial. The MOD and the SDF are required to maintain
a command and control function utilizing an advanced
communications network and a system for sharing
intelligence in order to strengthen the joint operational
foundation. Thus, the MOD and the SDF continue to
develop a wide-ranging and f exible communications
system that uses advanced communications technology
available both within and outside Japan.
At the unit level, they are required to create plans to be
able to respond to various situations, while at the same time
they are also required to maintain conditions to be ready
for executing duties through joint training and other means.
For this purpose, personnel from other SDF branches are
stationed at major command headquarters under normal
circumstances, and the number of such staff personnel will
be increased as necessary.
Based on the achievement to date, topics such as the
improvement of education and training, the SDF Headquarter
structure, and the human resources development, and
standardization of equipment will continue to be reviewed,
aiming for a more effective joint operations system, and
necessary measures will be taken to realize this.


**1** **Outline of Joint Operations System**


**(1) Role of the Chief of Staff**
a. The Chief of Staff, Joint Staff develops a joint operations
concept for SDF operations, and centrally supports the
Minister of Defense on SDF operations from a military
expert’s perspective.
b. The Minister’s commands concerning the operations of
the SDF shall be delivered through the Chief of Staff,
Joint Staff and orders concerning operations of the
SDF shall be executed by the Chief of Joint Staff. In
doing this, the Minister’s commands and orders shall
be delivered through the Chief of Joint Staff not only in
cases where a joint task force[4] is organized, but also in
cases where a single SDF unit is employed to respond.

**(2) Relationship between Chief of Staff, Joint Staff, and**
**Other Chiefs of Staff**

The Joint Staff Off ce undertakes functions relating to the
operation of the SDF, while the Ground, Maritime and Air
Staff Off ces undertake functions for unit maintenance,
such as personnel affairs, building-up defense capability,
and education and training.


“The Director-General of the Minister’s Secretariat, the directors-general of the bureaus and the Director-General of the Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency shall support the Minister of
Defense concerning their work so that, conjointly with the support from the Chief of Joint Staff and the Chief of the Ground Staff, Chief of the Maritime Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff (hereinafter
referred to as “Chiefs of Staff”) concerning the services pursuant to the provision of Article 9, paragraph (2) of the Self-Defense Forces Act, the work of MOD shall be performed in compliance with
laws and regulations and appropriately in order to achieve the mission of Article 3.”

The Government has made remarks regarding civilian control and the role of the civilian officials in the Internal Bureau during the Diet deliberations on the Amendment Act, stating; “Civilian control means
the priority of politics to the military in democratic countries. Civilian control in our country consists of control by the Diet, control by the Cabinet (including the National Security Council), and control within
the MOD. Control within the MOD means that the Minister of Defense, a civilian, manages, operates, and controls the SDF. In addition to support from political appointees such as the State Minister of
Defense and Parliamentary Vice-Ministers of Defense, support from civilian officials in the Internal Bureau also plays an important role in aiding the exercise of civilian control by the Minister of Defense.
Regarding civilian control, the role of civilian offi cials in the Internal Bureau in civilian control is to support the Minister of Defense, and there is no relationship in which civilian offi cials of the Internal
Bureau issue commands to units.”

This applies to the case in which a special unit is organized to carry out a specifi c duty, or the required troops are placed partly under the authority of a commander outside of their usual command

**Section 2  Background of the Reform of the Ministry of Defense**


**1** **Background of the Reform**


In response to the frequent incidence of scandals within the
Ministry of Defense (MOD) and the SDF, the “Council for
Reforming the Ministry of Defense” was established in the
Prime Minister’s Off ce in 2007, and a report was compiled
in 2008. In accordance with the basic directions stipulated
in this report, the MOD made various initiatives aimed at
the MOD reform, including thorough adherence to rules and
regulations, and the establishment of operational management
that prioritizes the execution of duties, with the aim of total
optimization; additionally, in 2009, the establishment of the
Defense Council under law, the abolition of the post of the
Director of Defense and new establishment of the Special
Adviser to the Minister of Defense was implemented in order
to strengthen support for the Minister of Defense and ensure
thorough civilian control. Furthermore, the FY2010 budget
request made in August of the same year incorporated an
organizational reform proposal which included unif cation


of defense capabilities build-up departments in the MOD
central organization into the Internal Bureau, and unif cation
of the operational departments into the Joint Staff. However,
the request in the FY2010 budget request in October of the
same year was passed over in order to review the MOD
reform from the Democratic Party of Japan’s perspective,
which came to administrative power in September of the
same year.
The subsequent change in administration to the
Liberal Democratic Party and Komeito in December
2012 promulgated the release of the “Direction by the
Minister of Defense on the MOD Reform” and the
establishment of the “Committee for the Deliberations
on the MOD Reform (referred to as “Committee”
hereinafter),” whose chairperson was the State Minister
of Defense in February 2013, in order to accelerate the
deliberations on the MOD reform.

use in joint operation. In combination with this, equipment
acquisition will be streamlined and optimized by means
of equipment management throughout its lifecycle, and
also organizational reform will be conducted in order to
contribute to the overall optimization of defense capabilities.

**(3) Make Accurate Decisions More Swiftly (Joint Operation)**
In order to ensure the accuracy of and swift decisionmaking related to the SDF operations, a review of the
organization will be conducted so that affairs concerning
actual operations will be unif ed into the Joint Staff.


**2** **Basic Concept and Direction of Reform**

It was determined that full-f edged reform would be
undertaken, taking into due account the matters specif ed
in previous considerations, and considering the following
situational changes such as: the increasing severity of the
security environment surrounding Japan; recognition of the
lessons learned relating to the unit operation in the Great
East Japan Earthquake and elsewhere; and the changes in
the policy environment, including the establishment of the
National Security Council.


**(1) Removal of Barriers Between Civilian Offi cial and**
**Uniformed Personnel**

In order to foster a sense of unity among civilian off cials
and uniformed personnel, permanent posts will be
established for uniformed personnel in the Internal Bureau
and for civilian off cials in each of the Staff Off ces and
major commands.

**(2) From Partial to Total Optimization**

It is important to establish a series of truly effective
reforms by avoiding stagnation and confusion in
operations, and seeking changes in the mentality of both
civilian off cials and uniformed personnel through steady
and phased implementation while Internal Bureau and Staff
Off ces equally support the Minister of Defense.


**Section 3  Specifi c Ministry of Defense Reform Initiatives**

Bureau, while permanent posts for civilian off cials were
established in the Joint Staff and the major commands of
each branch of the SDF.


In response to the diversifying security challenges and
rapidly increasing volume of work related to international
affairs, a Vice-Minister of Defense for International

**Chapter** **Building a Dynamic Joint Defense Force**
##### 1


The National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG)
calls for the building of a Dynamic Joint Defense Force,
which emphasizes soft and hard aspects of readiness,
sustainability, resiliency and connectivity, reinforced by
advanced technology and capability for C31 (Command,
Control, Communications and Intelligence), with a
consideration to establish a wide range of infrastructure to
support operations by the Self-Defense Forces (SDF). This
Dynamic Joint Defense Force must be proactively built
while adequately managing the progress of the various
measures laid out in the NDPG and the Medium Term
Defense Program (MTDP).
The MOD and SDF are striving to develop a
Dynamic Joint Defense Force that includes the build-up
of defense capabilities in order to respond seamlessly
and dynamically to intelligence gathering and warning/
surveillance activities in peacetime, “gray-zone” situations,
and complex situations wherein various contingencies arise
consecutively or simultaneously.
With this in mind, based on the order of the Minister of
Defense issued in December 2013, the Ministry of Defense
established the Dynamic Joint Defense Force Committee,
chaired by the Parliamentary Senior Vice-Minister of
Defense, and has been carrying out these reviews.


The Dynamic Joint Defense Force Committee, under
the direction of the Minister of Defense, carries out essential
initiatives for proactively developing the Dynamic Joint
Defense Force, while assessing and verifying the progress
of various measures laid out in the NDPG and the MTDP.
This Committee is to be closely coordinated with various
frameworks, including existing committees within the
Ministry of Defense, namely the Cyber Policy Review
Committee, Comprehensive Acquisition Reform Committee,
and Ministry of Defense Reform Review Committee.

**Section 1 Effective Deterrence and Response**


In order to respond to a variety of situations in a timely and
appropriate manner, and to assure the protection of the lives
and property of the people as well as territorial land, water
and airspace, it is necessary to make efforts to prevent
the occurrence of a variety of situations before they arise
by building a comprehensive defense architecture. At the
same time, if a situation does arise, it is required to respond


seamlessly to the situations as they unfold.
To that end, it is important to ensure intelligence
superiority[1] through continuous surveillance over a wide
region in peacetime encompassing the surroundings of Japan.
If a situation does arise, ensuring maritime supremacy[2] and
air superiority[3] in our sea and airspace in a timely manner is
important to respond effectively and minimize the damage.

Japan is composed of a little over 6,800 islands, and is
surrounded by a wide region of sea, which includes the
sixth largest Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the world.
The SDF is engaged in persistent intelligence gathering
and warning and surveillance in Japan’s territorial waters
and airspace in peacetime, as well as the surrounding sea
and airspace.

**(1) Basic Concept**
The SDF persistently engages in warning and surveillance
activities in the waters and airspace surrounding Japan in
peacetime so that it can respond to various contingencies
immediately and seamlessly.

**(2) Response by the MOD and the SDF**
The MSDF patrols the waters surrounding Hokkaido, the Sea
of Japan, and the East China Sea in peacetime, using P-3C
patrol aircraft and other aircraft to monitor the numerous
vessels that sail through those waters. The ASDF uses radar
sites at 28 locations nationwide, E-2C early warning aircraft,
and E-767 early warning and control aircraft, amongst
others, to carry out warning and surveillance activities
over Japan and its surrounding airspace 24 hours a day. It
also conducts surveillance in major channels, to monitor
MSDF guard posts, GSDF coastal surveillance units, and so
forth. Furthermore, warning and surveillance activities are
carried out with the f exible use of destroyers and aircraft as
required. Thus, the JSDF maintains a defense and security
system that enables it to respond quickly to situations in
areas surrounding Japan.

See Fig. III-1-1-2 (Conceptual Image of Warning and Surveillance of the
Sea Areas and Airspace Surrounding Japan)

In 2014, there were seven incidents of activity by
Chinese Navy vessels involving the passage through the
southwestern islands, and also another incident of such
activities conf rmed in waters south of Okinawa. It is
expected that the areas of activity by Chinese Navy vessels
will continue to expand and their activities will become
more activated.
Moreover, since the Japanese government’s acquisition
of the ownership of the Senkaku Islands in September 2012,
Chinese governmental ships have intermittently intruded
into Japanese territorial waters. In recent years, activities
by Chinese Navy vessels and Chinese government ships are
rapidly expanding and becoming more activated.
Due to such a state of affairs, the MOD and the SDF
are working to strengthen the collaboration with relevant
government ministries and agencies, for example by
routinely sharing information obtained through warning
and surveillance activities with the Japan Coast Guard
in peacetime

**2** **Warnings and Emergency Takeoffs (Scrambles) in**
**Preparation against Intrusion of Territorial Airspace**


**(1) Basic Concept**
Under international law, nations have complete and exclusive
sovereignty over their airspace. Scrambling against intruding
aircraft is conducted as an act to exercise the right of policing
intended to maintain public order. Unlike measures taken
on land or in the seas, this measure can be taken only by
the SDF. Therefore, the ASDF is primarily responsible for
conducting actions against intruding aircraft based on Article
84 of the SDF Act.

See Reference 11 (Main Operations of the Self-Defense Forces), Reference
12 (Statutory Provisions about the Use of Armed Force and Weapons
by SDF Personnel)

**(2) Response by the MOD and the SDF**
The ASDF detects and identif es aircraft f ying in the
Japanese territorial and adjacent airspace using warning
and control radar, the E-767 early-warning and control
system, and E-2C early-warning aircraft. If any aircraft
suspected of intruding into Japan’s territorial airspace is
detected, f ghters and other aircraft scramble to approach
them to conf rm the situation and monitor the aircraft as
necessary. In the event that a territorial airspace intrusion
does occur, responses such as warning to withdraw will
be issued.
On December 13, 2012, a f xed-wing aircraft (Y-12)
of the Chinese State Oceanic Administration intruded into
Japan’s territorial airspace in the vicinity of Uotsuri-jima,
which is part of the Senkaku Islands In addition on August


-----

22, 2013, a TU-95 bomber of the Russian Air Force intruded
into Japanese airspace in the vicinity of Okinoshima,
Fukuoka Prefecture. Moreover, September 9 of the same
year, an incident where a presumably unmanned aircraft
of unidentif ed nationality f ew over the East China Sea.
The ASDF urgently scrambled f ghters in response to
these incidents.
In FY2014, the ASDF aircraft scrambled 943 times[4],
a signif cant increase by 133 in comparison with the
previous f scal year. This is the second largest number
since 1958 when the ASDF started taking strict antiterritory intrusion measures.

See Fig. III-1-1-4 (Number and Breakdown of Scrambles since the Cold
War)

Scrambles Responded)

Even after the establishment of the “East China Sea Air
Defense Identif cation Zone” by China in November 2013,
the MOD and the SDF have been implementing warning
and surveillance activities and other activities as before
in the East China Sea, including the zone in question, and
have continued to take all initiatives necessary to engage
in warning and surveillance in both the sea and airspace
around Japan. The MOD and the SDF have also decided
to engage in strict airspace anti-intrusion measures in
accordance with international law and the SDF Act.

See Fig. III-1-1-7 (Air Defense Identifi cation Zone (ADIZ) of Japan and
those of Neighboring Countries)

See Part I, Chapter 1, Section 3 (Defense Policies of Other Countries and
Regions: China)

See Reference 11 (Main Operations of the Self-Defense Forces), Reference
12 (Statutory Provisions about the Use of Armed Force and Weapons
by SDF Personnel)

**3** **Response to Submarines Submerged in Japan’s**
**Territorial Waters**


**(1) Basic Concept**
With respect to foreign national submarines navigating
underwater in Japan’s territorial waters[5], an order for
maritime security operations will be issued promptly. The
submarine will be requested to navigate on the surface of
the water and show its f ag, in accordance with international
law, and in the event that the submarine does not comply
with the request, it will be requested by the SDF to leave
Japanese territorial waters.

See Reference 11 (Main Operations of the Self-Defense Forces), Reference
12 (Statutory Provisions about the Use of Armed Force and Weapons
by SDF Personnel)

**(2) Response by the MOD and the SDF**
The MSDF is maintaining and enhancing capabilities for:
expressing its intention not to permit any navigation that
violates international law; and responding in shallow water

areas by detecting, identifying, and tracking foreign national
submarines navigating underwater in the territorial waters of
Japan. In November 2004, the MSDF observed a submerged
Chinese nuclear-powered submarine navigating underwater
in Japanese territorial waters around the Sakishima Islands.
In response to this incident, the MSDF issued an order for
maritime security operations, and MSDF vessels and aircraft
continued to track the submarine until it entered the high seas.
In May 2013 and March 2014, although there was no
intrusion into the territorial waters of Japan, the MSDF
P-3C observed submarines navigating underwater in the
contiguous water zone. Although international law does
not forbid foreign submarines navigating underwater in
the contiguous zone of coastal nations, Japan maintains a
stance of properly dealing with such activities


**4** **Response to Armed Special Operations Vessels**


**(1) Basic Concept**
The Japan Coast Guard, as a police organization, is primarily
responsible for responding to suspicious armed special
operations vessels (unidentif ed vessels). However, in the
event that it is deemed extremely diff cult or impossible for
the Japan Coast Guard to respond to a situation, an order
for maritime security operations will be issued promptly
and the SDF will respond to the situation in cooperation
with the Japan Coast Guard.

See Reference 11 (Main Operations of the Self-Defense Forces), Reference
12 (Statutory Provisions about the Use of Armed Force and Weapons
by SDF Personnel)

In light of the lessons learned from the incident involving
an unidentif ed vessel off Noto Peninsula in 1999, the incident
involving an unidentif ed vessel in the sea southwest of Kyushu
in 2001, and other similar incidents, the Japanese government
has been taking all necessary precautionary measures while
the MOD and the SDF have strengthened cooperation with
other relevant ministries and agencies.

**(2) Response by the MOD and the SDF**
The MSDF is taking the following steps: (1) deployment of
missile boats; (2) establishment of the MSDF Special Boarding
Unit[6]; (3) equipment of destroyers with machine guns;


(4) furnishing forcible maritime interdiction equipment
(f at-nose shells)[7]; (5) improving the suff ciency ratio
of essential military vessel personnel; and (6) enhancing
equipment for the Vessel Boarding Inspection Team.
In addition, the MOD and the Japan Coast Guard
regularly carry out joint exercises, etc. Based on the
“Manual on Joint Strategies concerning Unidentif ed
Vessels,” which was prepared jointly by the then Defense
Agency (now the Ministry of Defense) and the Japan Coast
Guard in 1999, the MSDF and the Japan Coast Guard are
strengthening cooperation between the two organizations.

attacks. If, by any chance, islands are captured without any
signs detected in advance, the enemy will be brought under
control by ground f re from aircraft and vessels, and then
tactical operations will be implemented to regain the islands
by the landing of SDF forces and taking other initiatives.
It is particularly important in the defense of Japan’s remote
islands to obtain and secure maritime and air superiority.
Furthermore, a clear response will be taken to attacks
using ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and so forth.

See Reference 11 (Main Operations of the Self-Defense Forces), Reference
12 (Statutory Provisions about the Use of Armed Force and Weapons
by SDF Personnel)

See Fig. III-1-1-8 (Conceptual Image of Defending Japan’s Offshore Islands)[8]


**1** **Basic Concept**

Japan possesses a number of remote islands. In order
to respond to attacks on these islands, it is important
to position units and so forth in accordance with the
security environment, and also to detect signs at an early
stage through persistent intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (ISR) conducted by the SDF in peacetime.
If signs of attack are detected in advance, troops will be
expeditiously deployed and concentrated in an area expected
to be attacked ahead of the deployment of enemy units, and
try, through the joint operation involving all the SDF forces
(the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF), to deter and remove enemy


A special unit of the MSDF was newly established in March 2001 to deter expected resistance, and disarm suspicious vessels in the event of vessel boarding inspections under maritime security
operations.

The fl at front edge of the destroyer prevents a non-bursting shell from scattering when launched from the 76-mm gun equipped on the ship.

During FY2015, the MOD is to acquire V-22 Osprey and AAV7 amphibious vehicles as equipment necessary to enhance rapid deployment and response capabilities in dealing with attacks to Japan’s

Furthermore, in order to secure capabilities for swift
and large-scale transportation and deployment of units,
initiatives are underway to enhance rapid deployment
capabilities through: the improvement of Osumi class
transport LST (Landing Ship, Tank); overseas research to
review the role of multipurpose vessels; and the introduction
of V-22 Ospreys.
In particular, for the operation of V-22 Ospreys, the
MOD determined that the Ariake Saga Airport was the best
airf eld to be used as the deployment site for V-22 Ospreys
due to positional relationships with relevant units in joint


**2** **Initiatives of the MOD and the SDF**

In the southwest region, there are many remote islands
that are vacuum regions for SDF deployment. Thus, the
GSDF will newly form a coast observation unit in Yonaguni
and deploy an area security unit in charge of the initial
responses within the remote islands area in the southwest
region. The GSDF will also establish an “Amphibious
Rapid Deployment Brigade (provisional name)” equipped
with a full function for amphibious operations. In addition,
the MSDF will acquire f xed-wing patrol aircraft (P-1)
and other equipment. The ASDF will deploy two f ghter
squadrons at Naha Air Base and establish the 9th Air Wing.
Through these initiatives, the MOD and SDF will continue

operations, the length of the runway, and the geographic
environment that can reduce burdens borne by the local
community. Along with other topics such as the training
relocation of the US Marine Corps, the MOD and the SDF
hope to gain understanding from the local community
through providing in-depth explanations[9].
In addition, the SDF conducts various training to
improve the joint operation capabilities of the GSDF, MSDF,
and ASDF, and also training exercises with the U.S. Forces
aimed at establishing mutual coordination procedures. In


January through March of 2015, the GSDF and US Marine
Corps conducted a f eld training exercise (Iron Fist) in
California, which was f rst started in 2006, and worked to
improve amphibious operational capabilities. In August
2015, the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF is to participate in a
joint exercise that has been held on the western coast of the
United States, called “Dawn Blitz.” As a Japan-U.S. bilateral
training excercises overseas (Dawn Blitz 15), they are to
practice a series of tactical activities related to collaborating
with the U.S. Forces, and response to island invasions.


Enhancement of the Air Defense Posture in the Southwestern
**Commentary**
Region – Establishment of a New Air Wing

In recent years, Japan’s neighboring countries have been expanding and intensifying their activities in the sea and airspace around
Japan. In particular, China has intruded into Japanese territorial waters intermittently and has violated Japan’s territorial airspace. At the
same time, China has also been engaging in dangerous activities, which could cause unexpected situations, including infringement of the
freedom of fl ight over the high seas such as the establishment of the “East China Sea Air Defense Identifi cation Zone” based on its own
unilateral assertion.
Currently, scrambles against aircraft in the Southwestern Composite Air Division are conducted solely by the 204th fi ghter squadron,
which belongs to the ASDF 83rd Air Wing (Naha Air base). However, not only has the number of scrambles been steadily increasing, but
also, the airspace that must be covered by the 204th fi ghter squadron is quite extensive.
In light of these circumstances, in order to enhance the air defense posture in the southwestern region, the ASDF will transfer the
304th fi ghter squadron of the 8th Air Wing (Tsuiki Air Base) to Naha Air Base in JFY2015.
Along with this, the 83rd Air Wing will be abolished, and a new “9th Air Wing” will be established.
This establishment of the new Air Wing would be the fi rst time in nearly 50 years since 1964 when the 8th Air Wing was newly formed.
Establishment of the new 9th Air Wing will enhance the air defense posture in the southwestern region and will enable the ASDF to
obtain and secure air superiority, which is the basis for realizing effective deterrence and response in various situations.

**3** **Response to Ballistic Missile Attacks**


Japan began developing the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)
system in FY2004 to be fully prepared for the response
against ballistic missile attacks. Necessary amendments
were subsequently made to the SDF Act in 2005, and in
the same year, the Security Council and Cabinet decided to
begin Japan-U.S. cooperative development of an advanced
ballistic missile interceptor. To date, Japan has steadily
built up its own multi-tier defense system against ballistic
missile attacks, by such means as installing ballistic missile
defense capability to the Aegis-equipped destroyers[10] and
deploying the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3)[11].

See Reference 50 (History of Efforts for BMD Development in Japan)


On the other hand, if ballistic missiles are launched towards
Japan, and the situation is not acknowledged as an armed
attack, the Minister of Defense can order the SDF units
to take measures to destroy the ballistic missiles with
suff cient consideration taken to (1) carrying out prompt
and appropriate response and (2) ensuring civilian control.
As a response against ballistic missiles or other objects,
the Joint Task Force-BMD is formed, with the Commander
of the Air Defense Command serving as its Commander,
and various postures for effective defense are to be taken
under a unif ed command through JADGE. Furthermore,
the GSDF will play a leading role in dealing with damage
caused by the impact of ballistic missiles.

See Fig. III-1-1-9 (Build-up and Operational Concept of BMD)

**(2) Response by the MOD and the SDF**
In March 2009, the MOD and the SDF, in response to North
Korea’s advance notif cation for an intended launch of an
“experimental communication satellite” received through
the International Maritime Organization (IMO), organized
the Joint Task Force-BMD and transmitted launch
information collected from Shared Early Warning (SEW)[13]
and the various SDF radar units[14] to the Prime Minister’s
Off ce and other agencies, while carrying out information
gathering to identify any damage caused by this incident.
In March 2012, the MOD and the SDF, responding
to North Korea’s advance notif cation for an intended
launch of an “earth observation satellite” received through
the IMO, deployed Aegis destroyers equipped with SM-3
missiles to the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea, and
Patriot PAC-3 units on the islands of Okinawa Prefecture
and within the Tokyo metropolitan area, while dispatching
the GSDF units to the Southwestern Islands in case any
debris were to fall from the sky.
In December, the MOD and the SDF, in response to
North Korea’s announcement regarding a launch of a
“satellite,” took all possible measures including the
deployment of Aegis destroyers equipped with SM-3 missiles.
North Korea repeatedly engaged in a variety of
provocative acts, including an implication of missile launches
in the f rst half of 2013, while it launched ballistic missiles
on March 3 and 26, June 29, July 9, 13 and 26, 2014, and on
March 2, 2015. Under such circumstances, the MOD and the
SDF took every necessary measure to protect the lives and
properties of the nation in any potential situation.

See Part I, Chapter 1, Section 2-1 (North Korea)


**1** **Japan’s Ballistic Missile Defense**


**(1) Basic Concept**
Japan’s BMD is an effective multi-tier defense system with
the upper tier interception by Aegis-equipped destroyers
and the lower tier by Patriot PAC-3, both interconnected
and coordinated by the Japan Aerospace Defense Ground
Environment (JADGE).
In case ballistic missiles or other objects[12] are launched
against Japan as an armed attack, it will be dealt with by
issuing a defense operation order for armed attack situations.

PAC-3 missile test launch


10 See Part II, Chapter 2, Section 2, Footnote 5

11 The Patriot PAC-3 system is one of the air defense systems for countering airborne threats. Unlike the conventional type of anti-aircraft PAC-2 missiles, which mainly target the interception of aircraft,
the PAC-3 missiles are designed primarily to intercept ballistic missiles.

12 The term “ballistic missiles or other objects” refers to objects other than aircraft such as ballistic missiles which could cause grave damage to human life and property when they fall to the ground.

13 Information on the area of launch, the time of the launch, the projected area where objects fall and the projected time when the objects fall relating to ballistic missiles launched in the direction of
Japan, which is analyzed and conveyed to the SDF by the U.S. Forces in a short period of time after the launch. (The SDF started to receive the information since April 1996.)

14 On the day before an actual launch, misinformation related to the launch was distributed due to the mishandling of information by the MOD and the SDF. At the time of the actual launch, information

Further cooperation with the U.S. government
including the U.S. Forces in Japan is necessary for eff cient
and effective operation of the BMD system. Thus, related
measures including constant real-time sharing of BMD
operational and relevant information, and the expansion of
BMD cooperation have been agreed upon at the Japan-U.S.
Security Consultative Committee (2+2).

See Part II, Chapter 3, Section 3-2 (Policy Consultation between Japan and
the United States)

Furthermore, Japan has closely cooperated with the
United States in responding to ballistic missiles, by means
such as receiving SEW from the U.S. Forces, and sharing
intelligence gathered by assets including transportable
BMD radar (TPY-2 radar) and Aegis-equipped destroyers
deployed in Japan by the U.S. Forces. In addition,
maintenance, enhancement and validation of Japan-U.S.
bilateral response capabilities have been actively conducted
through training and other activities. In February 2015,
following on from the previous year, a special BMD
exercise was held between the MSDF and the U.S. Navy,
connecting their ships via a network and conducting a
simulation of response to ballistic missiles, to improve
tactical capabilities and strengthen bilateral coordination.


**2** **Missile Defense of the United States and Japan-**
**U.S. BMD Technical Cooperation**

**(1) Missile Defense of the United States**
The United States is developing a multi-tier missile defense
system that combines defense systems suited for each of the
following phases of the ballistic missile f ight path to provide
a mutually complementary response: (1) the boost phase,
(2) the mid-course phase, and (3) the terminal phase. Japan
and the United States have developed close coordination
concerning ballistic missile defense, and a part of the missile
defense system of the United States has been deployed
in our country in a step-by-step manner. Specif cally, a
TPY-2 radar (so-called “X-band radar”) for BMD has been
deployed at the U.S. Shariki Communication Site in 2006,
and BMD-capable Aegis ships have been forward deployed
in Japan and surrounding areas. In October 2006, Patriot
PAC-3 units were deployed in Okinawa Prefecture, and in
October 2007, a Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS)[15]
was deployed in Aomori Prefecture. Furthermore, the
2nd TPY-2 radar was deployed at the U.S. Kyogamisaki
Communication Site in December 2014.


-----

**(2) Japan-U.S. BMD Technology Cooperation, etc.**
The government commenced a Japan-U.S. cooperative
research project on a sea-based upper-tier system in
FY1999. As the result showed good prospects for resolving
initial technical challenges, in December 2005, the
Security Council and the Cabinet decided to start JapanU.S. cooperative development of an advanced ballistic
missile interceptor by using the results of the project as a
technical basis. The joint development started in June 2006
with a view to expanding the coverage of protection and
dealing with future threats posed by increasingly advanced
and diverse ballistic missiles attacks, and it is aimed to be
completed by around 2017.
With regard to the Japan-U.S. cooperative development,
it is necessary to export BMD related arms from Japan to
the United States. In accordance with the Chief Cabinet
Secretary’s statement issued in December 2004, it was
determined that the Three Principles on Arms Exports


would not apply to the BMD system and related matters
under the condition that strict controls are maintained.
Based on these circumstances, it was decided that the prior
consent of Japan could be given to the third party transfer
of the SM-3 Block IIA under certain conditions[16]. This
decision was formally announced in the Joint Statement of
the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee (2+2) on
June 21, 2011.
The Three Principles on Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology (Three Principles) received
Cabinet approval in April 2014. However, with regard to
exceptional measures instigated before the Three Principles
were decided, overseas transfers will continue to be
organized in the guidelines for the principles as allowable
under the Three Principles.

See Part II, Chapter 2, Section 4 (Three Principles on Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology)

See Reference 17 (Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and
Technology)

**4** **Initiatives towards Ensuring Maritime Security**


and promote international cooperation and will make use of
fora such as multilateral and bilateral ocean conferences to
contribute to international rules and consensus-building.


**1** **Basic Approach by the Government**


The National Security Strategy (NSS) states that Japan
will play a leading role in maintaining and developing
“Open and Stable Seas,” and will take necessary measures
to address various threats in sea lanes of communication,
including counter-piracy operations, ensuring safe maritime
transport and promoting cooperation with other countries
by conducting bilateral/multilateral joint exercises related
to maritime security. In addition, it is stated that Japan will
provide assistance to those coastal states alongside the sea
lanes of communication and other states in enhancing their
maritime law enforcement capabilities.
The new Basic Plan on Ocean Policy[17], which was
given Cabinet approval in April 2013, states the following
initiatives for ensuring the security of the oceans: reinforcement
of the wide-range routine system of surveillance; systematic
improvement of warships, aircraft and other vehicles;
strengthening of the system of collaboration between the
SDF and Japan Coast Guard; and development of a system
of collaboration to ensure order and safety on the coasts
and isolated islands.
In addition, the Basic Plan on Ocean Policy states that
in order to contribute to the creation and development of
order on the ocean, it will ensure international collaboration


**2** **Initiatives of the MOD and the SDF**

In order to maintain the order of “Open and Stable Seas”
and to ensure the safety of maritime transport, the MOD
and the SDF promote various kinds of initiatives such as
implementing counter-piracy activities, providing capacity
building assistance to coastal countries, and enhancing joint
exercises and practices using a variety of opportunities.
Within the framework of the Western Pacif c Naval
Symposium (WPNS), the MSDF has been actively engaged
in and cooperating with initiatives such as the establishment
of the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES),
which was adopted at the 14th meeting in April 2014[18].
On October 7, the sixth Japan-ASEAN Defense
Vice-Ministerial Forum hosted by the MOD took place
and participants agreed to further strengthen cooperation
in each f eld such as discussion of the establishment of a
hotline in preparation for unforeseen consequences and the
promotion of capacity building by the MSDF.

region of the earth; (2) using outer space to respond to
various incidents including incoming ballistic missiles; and
(3) ensuring stable use of space; the MOD and the SDF
is implementing initiatives to enhance their information
gathering capabilities using satellites; reinforcing
command, control and communication; and realizing the
stable use of space.
The MOD’s “Basic Policy Relating to the Development
and Use of Space,” which was decided when the Basic
Space Law was enacted in 2008, was revised in August
2014. This was done in light of the major changes in the
environment surrounding space policy such as the revision
of the Law Concerning Japan Aerospace Exploration
Agency (JAXA) in 2012, the Cabinet Decision on the
NSS and NDPG in 2013, and from the viewpoint of
systematically and realistically promoting various measures
concerning the development and utilization of space.
From the perspective of further promoting cooperation in
the space f eld between the defense authorities in Japan
and the U.S., the “Space Cooperation Working Group
(SCWG)” was established based on the instruction given
in the Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Talk in April 2015.
Making use of this working group, reviews will be further
promoted in broader f elds such as: 1. promotion of policyrelated consultation regarding space, 2. closer information
sharing, 3. cooperation for nurturing and securing experts,
4. implementation of tabletop exercises.


**1** **The Whole-of-Government Approach**


The Off ce of National Space Policy established in the
Cabinet Off ce in July 2012 engages in the planning,
drafting, coordinating and other policy matters relating to
the government’s development and use of space. In light
of the environmental changes surrounding space policy,
and in order to suff ciently ref ect the new security policies
stated in the NSS that was approved by the Cabinet in
2013, improve predictability of industries’ investments,
and strengthen the industrial base, the Basic Plan on Space
Policy was decided upon in the Strategic Headquarters
for Space Development established within the Cabinet
in January 2015 as a 10-year development plan focusing
on the next approximately 20 years. This plan has set the
following goals: (1) Ensuring space security; (2) Promoting
the use of space in the civilian sector; and (3) Maintaining
and strengthening of space industry and scientif c/
technological bases.


**2** **Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**


The use of space is extremely important for the MOD
and the SDF to conduct a range of tasks effectively and
eff ciently. Thus, from the following three perspectives of:
(1) promoting the use of space by leveraging the special
characteristics of satellites that are able to access every

f scal year, which was approximately 1,080,000[19].
In order to deal with these issues, in November 2014,
the Cyber Security Basic Act was enacted in the 187th
Extraordinary Session of the Diet. In light of the current
situation where urgent response to emerging threats against
cyber security occurring on a global scale has become a
pressing matter along with the development of information
and communications technology advances, the act aims
to contribute to the security of Japan by clarifying the
basic principles of Japan’s cyber security measures and
the responsibilities of local governments, as well as by
comprehensively and effectively promoting the measures
regarding cyber security.
Based on the Cybersecurity Basic Act, the
Cybersecurity Strategic Headquarters has been established
in the Cabinet to take a controller role, and the National


Information and communications technology has developed
and been widely adopted at great speed and, as a result, it is
now an essential infrastructure for socioeconomic activities.
On the other hand, there is a possibility that people’s lives
and economic activities will be severely affected if the
computer systems or networks fail. This is the same for
both the MOD and the SDF. If the critical functions of the
SDF are intercepted by a cyber attack, there is a possibility
that problems that threaten the core of Japan’s defense
may arise. The number of cyber attacks targeting Japanese
governmental organizations and agencies in JFY2013
reached approximately 5,080,000. It shows a rapid increase
by f ve times in comparison with the number in the previous

center of Incident readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity
(NISC)[20] has been established in the Cabinet Secretariat as
a secretariat of the Cybersecurity Strategic Headquarters.
The NISC is responsible for planning and promotion of
cybersecurity-related policies and takes the central role in
taking measures and responding to signif cant cybersecurity
incidents in government organizations and agencies, as well
as critical infrastructures. Various initiatives are also being
promoted by both the public and private sectors; along with
the National Police Agency, the Ministry of Internal Affairs
and Communications, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the MOD
is designated as one of the f ve government agencies that
cooperate particularly closely with the NISC. The MOD
contributes to the cross-sector initiatives led by the NISC
to provide it with the knowledge and skills of the MOD
and the SDF. For example, the MOD participates in cyber
attack response training and personnel exchanges, and
provides information about cyber attacks, etc. In light of
such incidents as the cyber attacks on defense industry
companies reported in 2011, the NISC has established
the Cyber Incident Mobile Assistance Team (CYMAT) to
provide agile support, forming cross-cutting partnerships
among ministries and agencies. The MOD also sends
personnel to the CYMAT.


integrated deliberations regarding cooperation with
other countries and relevant organizations, training and
securing personnel capable of responding to cyber attacks,
cooperation with the defense industry, and responses to
supply chain risks[22]. In March 2014, a “Cyber Defense
Group” was established under the SDF C4 (Command,
Control, Communication & Computers) Systems Command,
in order to appropriately deal with the threat posed by cyber
attacks, which are becoming increasingly sophisticated and
complicated, and the relevant systems were enhanced and
strengthened. In addition, in March 2015, cyber information
gathering devices have been installed to aid the prevention
of attacks by the early detection of cyber attack indications.
The necessary systems are also scheduled to be developed,
such as the development of a cyber training environment in
which the SDF units can conduct more practical trainings.
At the same time, it is diff cult for the MOD and
the SDF alone to achieve the stable use of cyberspace.
In particular, since comprehensive defense cooperation
between Japan and its ally the United States, including
joint response, is vital, the “Cyber Defense Policy Working
Group” (CDPWG) was set up as a framework between
the defense authorities of the U.S. and Japan. Under this
framework, meetings have been held three times to discuss
the following topics: (1) promotion of policy discussions
regarding cyber issues, (2) closer sharing of information,
(3) promotion of joint exercises incorporating response
to cyber attacks, and (4) matters such as cooperation
for training and maintaining experts. In May 2015, a
joint declaration on the specif c future direction of the
cooperation between the two countries was announced. In
addition, through participation in the “Japan-U.S. Cyber
Dialogue,” a whole-of-government approach by both
nations, and in the “Japan-U.S. IT Forum,” a framework
between the defense authorities that has been discussed
repeatedly since 2002, Japan’s cooperation with the United
States is to be strengthened.
In addition to the IT Forum held between the defense
authorities of Singapore and Vietnam, cyber dialogues
are also being held between the authorities of the United
Kingdom, NATO, Estonia, the Republic of Korea and
others, in order to exchange views on threat awareness and
relevant initiatives taken by each country.
In 2013, the “Cyber Defense Council” (CDC) was set
up, and its core members consist of around ten companies in
the defense industry with a strong interest in cyber security.
Efforts are being made to improve capacities to counter
cyber attacks by both the MOD and the SDF, and the defense
industry, through joint exercise and other initiatives.


**2** **Initiatives of the MOD and the SDF**


As for response to cyber attacks, the SDF C4 (Command,
Control, Communication & Computers) Systems
Command is monitoring MOD/SDF communications
networks around the clock. Along with introduction
of intrusion prevention systems in order to increase the
safety of information and communications systems, and
development of defense systems such as the security and
analysis device for cyber defense, the MOD and the SDF
are engaged in holistic measures including enactment
of regulations[21], stipulating postures and procedures for
responding to cyber attacks, and improving the human
resources and technological bases, as well as conducting
research on cutting-edge technology.

See Reference 52 (MOD/SDF Comprehensive Measures to Deal with Cyber
Attacks)

**7** **Response to Large-Scale Disasters**


When disasters such as natural disasters occur, the SDF
works in collaboration with municipal governments,
engaging in various activities such as the search for and
rescue of disaster victims or missing ships or aircraft,
controlling f oods, offering medical treatment, preventing
epidemics, supplying water, and transporting personnel
and goods.


However, when a warning declaration is issued based on
the Act on Special Measures Concerning Countermeasures
for Large-Scale Earthquakes[24] or a declaration of a nuclear
emergency situation is issued based on the Act on Special
Measures Concerning Nuclear Emergency Preparedness,
the Minister of Defense is authorized to order a nuclear
disaster dispatch upon the request of the Director of the
Nuclear Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters (the
Prime Minister).

See Fig. III-1-1-10 (Flow of Events from the Point of Request to Dispatch
and Withdrawal)

See Reference 11 (Main Operations of the Self-Defense Forces), Reference
12 (Statutory Provisions about the Use of Armed Force and Weapons
by SDF Personnel)

The SDF has put in place arrangements for an initial
response to ensure that disaster relief operations are
conducted promptly. This is called “FAST-Force.”

See Fig. III-1-1-11 (State of Readiness for Disaster Dispatches (Standard))


**1** **Outline of Disaster Relief Dispatches**


In principle, disaster dispatch is carried out at the request
of prefectural governors and other off cials when there has
been a natural disaster; in cases where a request has been
made to the Minister of Defense or another designated
off cer who then determines that the situation warrants such
action[23]. This is because the course of action considered to
be most appropriate is that prefectural governors and other
off cials grasp the overall conditions of the disaster and their
own disaster relief capabilities f rst, and then decide whether
to make a request for the SDF disaster relief dispatch.

On May 29, 2015, an eruption occurred in Kuchinoerabujima. In response to a request for disaster relief dispatch
from the Governor of Kagoshima Prefecture, the SDF
conducted evacuation assistance and intelligence
gathering. The scale of this disaster relief effort was
approx. 430 personnel, approx. 20 vehicles, and a total of
around 44 aircraft.
d. Other natural disasters
The GSDF conducted disaster relief dispatches for an
earthquake with an epicenter in northern Nagano Prefecture
that occurred on November 22, 2014 and a disaster caused
by heavy snow in Tokushima Prefecture that occurred from
December 5 to 6 .

**(2) Transportation of Emergency Patients**
The SDF uses its aircraft to transport emergency patients
from isolated islands and remote areas with insuff cient
medical facilities (transportation of emergency patients).
In FY2014, out of a total of 521 cases of disaster relief
operation dispatch, 407 cases involved the transportation
of emergency patients, with dispatches to remote islands
such as the Southwestern Islands (Okinawa and Kagoshima
Prefectures) and the Ogasawara Islands (Tokyo)
representing the majority of such cases.
In addition to aiding in the transport of emergency
patients from vessels navigating areas of ocean far from
the mainland where the aircraft of other organizations
are unable to respond, due to reasons including a short
f ight range, in the event that urgent action is required due
to incidents such as f re, f ooding or capsizing, the SDF
carries out sea rescues when requested to do so by the
Japan Coast Guard.
Furthermore, it conducts wide-ranging medical
transport operations, using the Mobile Medical Unit to
move serious-case patients by C-130H transport aircraft.
At the same time, in FY2014, there were 73 dispatches
of f ref ghting support, the second largest number of
dispatches after those for the transportation of emergency
patients. Within this category, responses to f res in areas
near SDF facilities were the largest in number, with 54
cases in FY2014. The SDF also conducts aerial f ref ghting
activities in locations such as mountain and forest areas
where f ref ghting conditions are diff cult.

farms in Kasaoka City in Okayama Prefecture and Arita
Town in Nishi-Matsuura County of Saga Prefecture,
respectively. In response to a request for disaster relief
dispatch from the governors of each prefecture, the SDF
conducted the culling and disposal (by burial) of birds, and
other relevant activities. The scale of the disaster relief effort
was approximately 670 personnel, and a total of around
100 vehicles Also on April 12 there was an outbreak of

County in Kumamoto Prefecture. In response to a request
for disaster relief dispatch from the Governor of Kumamoto
Prefecture, the SDF conducted the culling and disposal (by
burial) of birds, and other relevant activities. The scale of
the disaster relief effort was approximately 880 personnel,
and a total of around 180 vehicles.

**(4) Exercises Involving SDF**
In order to respond to large-scale and various other
disasters with speed and accuracy, the SDF carries out
various disaster prevention drills including joint exercises
for rescue in peacetime, in addition to formulating disaster
relief plans. The SDF also actively participates in local
government disaster prevention drills and is seeking to
ensure cooperation with various ministries and agencies,
and local governments.
In FY2014, the SDF organized and participated in
various emergency drills with the objective of maintaining
and improving the ability to carry out disaster relief
missions swiftly and accurately in times of disaster, such
as major earthquakes, and many of the issues relating to
the response in the event of a disaster that arose due to the
Great East Japan Earthquake were actively incorporated
into disaster prevention exercises.

See Reference 43 (Implementation and participation record of major drills
concerning disaster dispatch (FY2014))

On October 19, 2014, the SDF participated in tsunami
response drills hosted by Wakayama Prefecture and
worked to enhance their earthquake response capability in
preparation for the predicted earthquake along the Nankai
trough. In collaboration with the U.S. Forces in Japan, the
SDF conducted exercises and other activities in which
SDF personnel carried the sick and wounded to the MSDF
destroyer “Ise” standing by offshore, and used the Osprey
V-22 vertical takeoff and landing transport aircraft. On
November 6, 2014, the SDF conducted disaster response
training for the Northeastern Army called “Michinoku
ALERT 2014” covering the whole Tohoku region.

**3** **Initiatives for Preparation for Disaster**

**(1) SDF Plans for Responding to Various Disasters and**
**Operational Plans**

In the event of the occurrence of various disasters, the MOD
and the SDF will take all possible measures such as swift
transportation and deployment of suff ciently sized units
in their initial response. At the same time, by establishing
a rotating staff ng posture based on a joint operational
approach, the MOD and the SDF will ensure that they are
able to sustain a well-prepared condition for a long-term
response. In doing so, the two organizations will fully take
into account the lessons learned from the Great East Japan
Earthquake.
The MOD and the SDF are in the process of formulating
various contingency plans for responses to large-scale
earthquakes, which are under consideration at the Central
Disaster Management Council, based on the Ministry of
Defense Disaster Prevention Plan that was formulated in
2012 to respond to such earthquakes.


**(5) Response to Large-Scale Disasters, the Great East**
**Japan Earthquake and Other Disasters**

Following the Great East Japan Earthquake, which occurred
on March 11, 2011, the MOD and the SDF dispatched
as many as 100,000 or so personnel and did their utmost
to rescue disaster victims. The SDF’s disaster relief
activity ended on December 26, 2011, when the period
for the dispatch for nuclear relief expired. In addition,
the MOD and the SDF are making efforts to increase the
effectiveness and eff ciency of their work by reviewing
the format of collaboration with the relevant organizations
through assigning two GSDF regular personnel to the
Nuclear Regulation Authority in September 2012[25],


25 Based on the fourth recommendation by the ruling parties for the acceleration of the reconstruction from the Great East Japan Earthquake, alongside the strengthening of the nuclear disaster


-----

**(2) Coordination with Local Governments**
It is also important for the SDF to strengthen coordination
with local governments in peacetime in order to conduct
disaster relief operations smoothly. For this reason, the SDF
implements various measures including: (1) Establishment
of the post of Liaison and Coordination Off cer for Civil
Protection and Disaster Relief Operation Countermeasures at
the SDF Provincial Cooperation Headquarters; (2) Temporary
assignment of SDF off cers to the department in charge of
disaster prevention at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,
and mutual exchange between administrative off cials of both
the GSDF Middle Army Headquarters and Hyogo Prefectural
Government; and (3) Recommending retired SDF personnel
with knowledge in disaster prevention in response to requests
from local governments. As of the end of March 2015, the
total number of retired SDF personnel working in disaster
prevention in local governments was 334 individuals in 46
prefectures and 220 municipalities throughout the country.
Personnel-related cooperation with local governments and the
MOD and the SDF is a very effective method of improving
cooperation with those governments, and its eff cacy was
conf rmed during the Great East Japan Earthquake. In

particular, each GSDF regional army provides opportunities
to interact with crisis management supervisors and other
off cials from local governments and exchange information
and opinions to strengthen the cooperation with these local
organizations and agencies.

for and detected by reconnaissance units, aviation units
and others and combat units will be promptly deployed to
besiege and capture or to defeat them.

See Fig. III-1-1-13 (Example of Operations against the Attacks by Guerillas
and Special Forces)


Even small-scale inf ltrations and attacks by guerrillas or
special forces can pose a serious threat. Such attacks could
result in the destruction of critical private infrastructure
and other facilities, attacks on people, and assassinations
of dignitaries. In the event that an armed attack is carried
out against Japan by guerillas or special forces, Japan will
respond under a defense operation order.

See Reference 11 (Main Operations of the Self-Defense Forces), Reference
12 (Statutory Provisions about the Use of Armed Force and Weapons
by SDF Personnel)

In dealing with attacks by guerrillas, the MOD
and the SDF respond with a particular emphasis on the
establishment of an intelligence gathering posture, warning
and surveillance to prevent invasions in coastal areas, the
safeguarding of key facilities, and search and defeat of
invading units. Efforts will be made for early detection of
attacks and signs through warning and surveillance, and,
as required, the SDF units will be deployed to guard key
facilities such as nuclear power plants and a guarding
posture will be established at an early stage. Based on
this, in the event of an inf ltration of our territorial land by
guerrillas or special operations forces, they will be searched


**2** **Response to Armed Agents**


**(1) Basic Concept**
While the police assumes primary responsibility for
responding to illegal activities of armed agents[26], the SDF
will respond in accordance with situational developments.
When this happens, it is important for the SDF to cooperate
with the police agency. Accordingly, with regard to public
security operations, the Basic Agreement concerning
cooperation procedures between the SDF and the police[27],
as well as local agreements and other agreements between
GSDF divisions/brigades and prefectural police forces,
have been concluded[28].

**(2) MOD and SDF Initiatives**
The GSDF continues to implement combined f eld
exercises nationwide with the police of each prefecture and
has been strengthening such collaboration by, for example,
conducting f eld exercises at the sites of nuclear power

danger of the proliferation of NBC (Nuclear, Biological,
and Chemical) weapons, which can cause indiscriminate
mass casualties and contamination of an extensive area,
and the means for transporting such weapons, as well as
related equipment and materials, to terrorists and countries
under suspicion of proliferating such weapons. The sarin
gas attack[30] on the Tokyo subway in 1995 is one of the
examples of an incident in which these weapons were used.

**(1) Basic Concept**
In the event of the use of NBC weapons in Japan in a way that
corresponds to an armed attack, the SDF will conduct defense
operations to abate the armed attack and rescue victims.
Furthermore, in the event of the use of NBC weapons in a way
that does not correspond to an armed attack but against which
the general police alone cannot maintain public security, the
SDF will conduct public security operations to suppress the
armed attack and rescue victims in cooperation with related
agencies. Furthermore, when the incident does not fall under
the category of defense operations or public security operations,
the chemical protection units of the GSDF and medical units
of the ASDF, GSDF and MSDF will cooperate with relevant
organizations in intelligence gathering concerning the extent
of the damage, decontamination activities, transportation of
the sick and injured, and medical activities through different


GSDF personnel conducting checkpoint training jointly with the police

plants throughout the country since 2012[29]. Furthermore,
combined exercises in dealing with unidentif ed vessels are
also continuously implemented between the MSDF and the
Japan Coast Guard.

capability for responding to NBC weapon attacks. Also, the
GSDF has designated personnel to take initial action in the
event of special-type disasters in order to allow operations
to begin within approximately one hour.
The MSDF and the ASDF have also acquired protective
equipment and materials to be used on vessels and at bases.

multinational joint exercise “Cobra Gold” in Thailand
in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the
Japanese Embassy in Thailand, and others, together with
local Japanese Embassy staff and their family members,
and conducted the f rst ever overseas ground transport
exercises.

See Reference 11 (Main Operations of the Self-Defense Forces), Reference
12 (Statutory Provisions about the Use of Armed Force and Weapons
by SDF Personnel)


In the event of disasters, insurgencies, and other
emergencies overseas, the Minister of Defense is authorized
to transport Japanese nationals and other people overseas
upon request from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and
subsequent consultations with the Foreign Minister, as
well as on the basis of Article 84 (3) of the SDF Law
(transport of Japanese nationals overseas, etc.). In such
cases, the SDF will protect the Japanese nationals and
other parties in the country in question, and safely guide
them to transport by aircraft, ships and vehicles. To this
end, the SDF maintains operational readiness, with the
GSDF designating helicopter unit and leading transport
unit personnel, the MSDF designating vessels such as
transport ships (including boarded aircraft), and the ASDF
designating airlift units and personnel for dispatch.
Through the revision of the SDF Law in 2013, vehicles
were added to the means of ground transport, resulting
in the introduction of transport protection vehicles with
superior defensive capabilities.
Since the transport of Japanese nationals overseas
requires close coordination among the GSDF, MSDF, and
ASDF, collaborative exercises are carried out in peacetime.
In addition, in FY2014, the f rst joint exercises in Japan
were carried out. The MOD participated in the exercise for
the transport of Japanese nationals overseas in the annual

**10** **Readiness against Invasion**


The NDPG states that only the necessary level of readiness
against land invasions involving the mobilization of large
ground forces, which was expected primarily during the
Cold War, will be retained.
In case Japan faces a full-scale invasion, the SDF will
respond to the situation in an aligned and systematic manner
based on their integrated operations. Their operations
are categorized into (1) operations for aerial air defense
operations, (2) defense operations protecting waters
around Japan, (3) operations protecting the land, and (4)
operations ensuring security in maritime communication,
based on the characteristic of their purposes. In executing
these operations, the U.S. Forces will assist the operations
implemented by the SDF and deploy operations to

**1** **Air Defense Operations**

Based on the geographic features of Japan, in that it is
surrounded by the sea, and the features of modern wars[31],
it is expected that Japan will be hit by repeated rapid aerial
attacks by aircraft and missiles in the case where a fullscale invasion against Japan occurs. Operations for aerial


31 Aerial attacks are important elements influencing the results of modern wars. It is vital to obtain air superiority before or at the same time as implementing ground or maritime operations.

32 A special characteristic of aerial defense operations is the importance of initial response in terms of infl uencing the entirety of operations. Thus, Japan needs to maintain its readiness for a quick initial

defense[32] can be categorized into comprehensive aerial
defense mainly conducted by the ASDF and individual
aerial defense conducted by the GSDF, MSDF or ASDF for
their bases or troops. Comprehensive aerial defense aims to
deal with enemy aerial attacks at the farthest point from our
territory, prohibiting enemies from gaining air superiority
and preventing harm to the people and the sovereign
territory of Japan. At the same time, efforts will be made
to inf ict signif cant damage on the enemy thus making the
continuation of their aerial attack diff cult.

**3** **Operations Protecting the Land**


In order to invade the islands of Japan, invading countries
are expected to gain sea and air superiority, followed by the
landing of ground troops from the sea and airborne troops
from the air.
Invading ground and airborne troops f nd it diff cult to
exert systematic combat capabilities while they are moving
on their vessels or aircraft or right before or after they land
in our territory. As we protect our land, we need to eliminate
this weakness to deal with our enemies between coastal
and sea areas or at landing points as much as possible and
attack them at an early stage.

See Fig. III-1-1-16 (Example of Operations for Coping with the Landing of
Invading Forces)

**4** **Operations Ensuring Security in Maritime**
**Transportation**


As the islands of Japan are attacked with arms, aerial attacks
are expected to be combined with attacks against our ships
and territory by enemy destroyers. In addition, transport
vessels could be deployed to enable massive enemy ground
forces to invade our territory.
Our defense operations protecting the waters
surrounding Japan are composed of measures at sea,
measures in waters around our coasts, measures in major
straits, and aerial defense above waters around Japan. We
need to protect the waters around our country by combining
the results of these multiple operations, blocking the
invasion of our enemies, and attacking and depleting their
combat capabilities


Japan depends upon other countries for the supply of much
of its resources and food, making maritime transportation
routes the lifeblood for securing the existence of our country
and the foundation of our prosperity. Furthermore, in case our
country comes under armed attack, maritime transportation
routes set the foundation to maintain continuous warfare

in the defense of Japan. As such, operations to ensure the
safety of our maritime transportation are important. Our
operations ensuring security in maritime transportation can
be done in waters around Japan or in sea lanes[33].
In the case where operations are to be implemented
in waters around Japan, the SDF combines various
operations such as anti-sea, anti-submarine, anti-air and
anti-mine operations to patrol[34], defend SDF ships, and

protect straits and ports. In the case where operations are
implemented by setting up sea lanes, the SDF periodically
patrols the def ned areas, detects and addresses attacks by
enemy vessels or submarines at an early stage, and directly
defends Japanese ships as required. Aerial defense (anti-air
operations) for Japanese ships on maritime transportation
routes is conducted by destroyers, and support from f ghter
jets and other aircraft is provided as required.


**2** **Military Intelligence Collection**


For formulating defense policy accurately in response to
the changes in the situation and for effective operation of
defense capabilities in dealing with various contingencies,
it is necessary to ascertain the long-term military trends in
the neighboring countries of Japan and to detect the signs of
those situations at an early stage. For this reason, the MOD
and the SDF always make efforts to collect information
swiftly and accurately using various methods.
Some examples of intelligence collection methods
used by the MOD and the SDF include:


In the event of situations in areas surrounding Japan, the
MOD and the SDF will provide materials and services as
rear area support and conduct rear area search and rescue
activities or ship inspection activities as stipulated in the
Act Concerning the Measures for Peace and Safety of
Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan and the
Ship Inspections Operations Act.

As the security environment surrounding Japan
has become increasingly severe, the strengthening of
information capabilities is considered to be an increasingly
important issue. For this reason, the MOD is currently
promoting comprehensive enhancement of its information
capabilities at all stages, including gathering, analyzing,
sharing, and securing intelligence. Specif cally, the MOD
will implement the high-level use of geospatial data such
as by integrating various information to visualize the
situation, securing highly competent analysts by integrating
and strengthening educational curricula, and strengthening
the dispatch system for Defense Attachés through their
dispatch to Africa, and other means.

**Commentary** About Defense Attachés

Defense Attachés are stationed in Japanese Embassies and other relevant offi ces
abroad and perform tasks such as collecting military intelligence and coordinating
defense cooperation with the country where they are stationed. Based on a trusting
relationship between militaries that share the same mission of “national defense,”
Defense Attachés are able to gain various types of information from the armed forces,
national defense authority of the country where they are stationed and from Defense
Attachés from other countries.
As the security environment surrounding Japan is becoming increasingly severe,
the importance of collecting military intelligence in a timely manner is growing. In
addition, defense cooperation, including equipment cooperation, between Japan and
other countries is expanding both in quality and quantity. Therefore, expectations for A Defense Attaché who was newly dispatched to Algeria in
the role to be played by Defense Attachés are becoming increasingly higher. For this January of this year
reason, the MOD is working to enhance the dispatch system of Defense Attachés.
During the previous fi scal year, the MOD newly dispatched Defense Attachés to seven countries in Africa (Algeria, Ethiopia, Kenya,
Djibouti, Nigeria, South Africa, and Morocco) in order to enhance its intelligence gathering capability regarding Africa, in light of the terrorist
attack in Algeria in which Japanese nationals in Algeria were involved. Also, the MOD increased the number of Defense Attachés in three
European countries (the United Kingdom, Germany, and France), which possess a wide range of information regarding Africa.
Furthermore, in cooperation with MOFA, the MOD is currently considering the strengthening of its dispatch system of Defense
Attachés in the Middle East, in light of the terrorist attack in Syria which involved the killing of Japanese nationals.
Defense Attachés are seconded from the MOD to MOFA, and are then dispatched overseas. They possess the status of both SDF
offi cer and MOFA offi cial. This ensures the mechanism that allows MOFA and the MOD to cooperate closely, whilst maintaining centralized
diplomatic efforts. As of March 31, 2015, the MOD has a total of 58 Defense Attachés dispatched to 40 Embassies of Japan and two
Permanent Missions of Japan.


Forming KIZUNA (meaning “Bonds”) – Dispatch and Acceptance
**Commentary**
of Liaison Off cers

In order for us to maintain our peaceful and stable lives in the contemporary
international community, it is necessary to cooperate with other countries
that share the same values as Japan. People to people exchange is a valid
means of achieving this objective. The SDF dispatches Defense Attachés
and security attachés to the Embassies of Japan and other relevant offi ces
located in foreign countries. In addition, the SDF personnel are dispatched to
foreign countries that have a cooperative relationship with Japan as liaison
offi cers to exchange and share information, as well as to engage in various
tasks such as coordinating joint exercises.
The MSDF dispatches liaison offi cers to the Naval Academy, the offi ce of
the Chief of Naval Operations, and other organizations of the U.S. Navy. At the Commander in Chief of the Self Defense Fleet and the fi rst Royal Navy
same time, it accepts a liaison offi cer from the U.S. Navy to the MSDF Offi cer liaison offi cer dispatched to the Headquarters of the Self Defense Fleet

visit the Memorial Ship Mikasa (former battleship Mikasa) (Yokosuka City)

Candidate School. Furthermore, since February 2015, the MSDF has accepted
a liaison offi cer from the Royal Navy, who is the fi rst liaison offi cer accepted from a country other than the United States. Just like Japan, the
United Kingdom is a maritime state whose development as a nation depends on the “sea”. Thus, the two countries share common values, and
Japan recognizes the United Kingdom as an important partner in the same manner as the United States. This acceptance of a liaison offi cer on
this occasion will signifi cantly contribute to information exchange and the enhancement of cooperation between Japan and the U.K.
In order to further ensure peace and stability of Japan, liaison offi cers are steadily forming small but strong and fi rm KIZUNA “bonds”
in foreign countries at this very moment.

**Section 2 Build-Up of Defense Capability in FY2015**


Japan will steadily build up its defense capability during
FY2015, which serves as the second f scal year under the
NDPG and MTDP, to establish a Dynamic Joint Defense
Force, based on these programs.
As part of this build-up, Japan will improve its defense
capabilities, focusing on further enhancement of joint
functions in order to seamlessly and dynamically fulf ll its
defense responsibilities, which include providing an effective
deterrence and response to a variety of security situations,
and supporting stability in the Asia-Pacif c region, as well
as improving the global security environment. In doing
so, Japan will place particular emphasis on the following
measures: intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance


(ISR) capabilities; intelligence capabilities; transport
capabilities; command, control, communication, intelligence
(C3I) capabilities; response to attacks on remote islands;
response to ballistic missile attacks; response in outer space
and cyberspace threats; response to large-scale disasters,
etc.; and international peace cooperation efforts, etc.
Furthermore, considering the increasingly severe
situation in Japan’s public f nance, Japan will strive
to achieve greater eff ciencies and streamlining, while
harmonizing these efforts with other measures taken by the
Government.

**1** **Defense-Related Expenditures and Changes**


Defense-related expenditures include spending for
maintaining and managing the SDF, improving living
conditions in the neighborhoods of defense facilities, and
supporting U.S. Forces in Japan.
In FY2015, in light of the increasingly harsh security
environment, defense-related expenditures were increased
for the second consecutive year in a row in order to reinforce
preparedness aimed at protecting the lives and property of
the people and the nation’s land, sea, and airspace.
In comparison with the previous f scal year, when
including expenses related to SACO (Special Action
Committee on Okinawa) and the U.S. Forces realignmentrelated expenses (the portion allocated for reducing the
burden on local communities and the expenses associated
with the introduction of a new dedicated government
aircraft), defense-related expenditures were increased


by 95.3 billion yen to 4.9801 trillion yen. If the SACOrelated expenses and the U.S. Forces realignment-related
expenses (the portion allocated for reducing the burden
on local communities and the expenses associated with
the introduction of a new dedicated government aircraft)
are excluded from the above amount, defense-related
expenditures were increased by 38.3 billion yen from the
previous f scal year to 4.8221 trillion yen.
Additionally the supplementary budget for FY2014
contains an appropriation of 211.0 billion yen for
improving SDF’s disaster response capabilities, securing
stable operations of the SDF, and necessary expenses for
SDF operations.

Amount of future obligation

When improving defense capabilities, it is common for work in areas like the procurement
of equipment and the upgrading of facilities to be carried out over several years.
Consequently, a procedure is undertaken whereby a contract that extends for multiple
years is arranged (five years in principle), and the Government promises in advance at the
time of the agreement to make the payment at a fixed time in the future.
Future obligation refers to the sum of money to be paid in the following year and beyond
under such contracts, which extend for multiple years. Example: A case in which 10 billion
yen of equipment is procured under a contract that runs for four years

Structure of Defense-related Expenditures

Annual expenditure

Defense-related expenditures are broadly classified into personnel and food provision
expenses and material expenses (operating expenses).

Personnel and Expenses relating to wages for personnel, retirement
food provisionsexpenses allowance, meals in barracks, etc.

Expenses relating to procurement; repair and upgrading of
equipment; purchase of oil;
education and training of staff; facilities improvement; barracks

Material expenses expenses such as lighting, heating, water and supplies;
(operating expenses) technological research and development; cost-sharing for the

stationing of USFJ; and expenses related to measures to alleviate
the burden on local communities hosting U.S. bases in Japan

the FY2014 recommendation by the National Personnel
Authority and other factors. Obligatory outlay expenses for
the year increased by 800 million yen from the previous
year, while general material expenses increased by
18.1 billion yen from the previous year[1].

See Fig. III-1-3-3 (Breakdown of Defense-Related Expenditures (FY2015))
See Reference 40 (Changes in Composition of Defense-Related Expenditures

See
See

(Original Budget Basis))

In addition to the budget expenditure, the amount
of new future obligation also indicates payments for the
following year and beyond. In the build-up of defense
capabilities, it is common for multiple years to be required
from contract to delivery or completion, in areas such as
the procurement of vessels, aircraft, and other primary
equipment, as well as the construction of buildings such as
aircraft hangars and barracks. However, the budget of Japan
must gain Diet approval each f scal year, and therefore,
as a general rule, the spending of national expenditures
prescribed in the budget is limited to the applicable f scal


year. Consequently, for items that require multiple years
between contract and delivery or completion, a procedure
is undertaken whereby a contract that extends for multiple
years is arranged, and it is promised in advance at the time
of the agreement that payment will be made at a f xed time
in the future (within f ve years, in principle). The sum of
money to be paid in the following f scal year and beyond,
based on such contracts that extend for multiple years, is
called the “future obligation.” The amount of new future
obligation arising in FY2015 (future obligation concerning
new contracts) increased from the previous f scal year by
353.4 billion yen (18.2%), partly due to the impact of the
introduction of integrated procurement associated with
long-term contracts for over f ve years.
Furthermore, if looked at on a contract basis[2], which
shows the scale of operations, there is an increase from the
previous f scal year of 371.8 billion yen (12.7%).

See Part III, Chapter 2, Section 2 (Initiatives for Improving the Contract
System and Other Related Matters)


The comparison with the previous year is made by expenditure excluding the SACO-related expenses and the U.S. Forces realignment-related expenses (the portion for the reduction of the burden
on local communities and the expenses associated with the introduction of a new dedicated government aircraft). The same applies hereinafter in regard to this section.

The sum total of general material expenses and future obligation concerning new contracts, which shows the amount of the material expenses (operating expenses) that are to be contracted in the

**3** **Comparison with Other Countries**


Understanding the defense expenditures of each country
using a single standard is not possible in view of differences
in the socioeconomic and budgetary systems. There is not an
internationally unif ed def nition of defense expenditures,
and breakdowns of defense expenditures are unclear in
some countries where such data is publicly disclosed.
Furthermore, in comparing the defense expenditures
of each country, though there exists the method of
converting their defense expenditures into dollar amounts
for comparison by foreign exchange rate, their dollarbased defense spending calculated by this method does
not necessarily ref ect the precise value based on each
country’s price levels. Therefore, the results of converting
Japan’s defense-related expenditures and the off cial
defense expenditures published by other countries into
dollar amounts, using the purchasing power parity[3] of each
country as published by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD), are shown in
Figure III-1-3-4 (The Defense Budgets of Major Countries
(FY2013)).

See Part I, Chapter 1 (Defense Policies of Countries), Reference 41 (Trend
of Defense Expenditures of Major Countries)

In addition, Fig. III-1-3-5 (Changes in Defense Budgets
in Surrounding Countries Over the Past Ten Years) shows
the changes in defense expenditures of Japan’s neighboring
counties over the past ten years.

**Section 4 Human Foundation and Organization that Supports the Defense Force**


In order to exert their defense capabilities with the
maximum effectiveness, it is necessary that the MOD and
the SDF enhance their human foundation as well as further


deepening mutual trust between local communities, the
people, and the SDF.


**1** **Recruitment and Employment**


**1** **Recruitment**


**2** **Employment**


Expectations from the public for the MOD and the SDF
have continued to rise. In Japan, however, due to the
declining birthrate and increasing university enrollments,
the general recruitment climate for uniformed SDF
personnel is anticipated to become increasingly severe.
In light of these circumstances, it is necessary to recruit
personnel with superior abilities and a strong desire to
enlist, after carefully explaining to them the missions and
duties as well as the working conditions of the SDF.

See Fig. III-1-4-1 (Changes in the Number of People Eligible to Join the SDF)

For this reason, the MOD and the SDF hold recruiting
meetings at schools and also maintain Provincial
Cooperation Off ces in 50 locations throughout Japan to
respond to the individual needs of applicants, with help
in the form of understanding by educators and support
from recruitment counselors. Moreover, local governments
are also obliged to carry out some of the administrative
activities regarding the recruitment of uniformed SDF
personnel and candidates for uniformed SDF personnel,
such as announcing the recruitment period and promoting
the SDF as a workplace, for which the MOD allocates them
the requisite budget.


**(1) Uniformed SDF personnel**
Under a voluntary system, which is based on individuals’
free will, uniformed SDF personnel are recruited under
various categories.

See Fig. III-1-4-2 (Overview of Appointment System for SDF Regular
Personnel)

Due to its uniqueness as a career, personnel management
of uniformed SDF personnel differs from that of general
civilian government employees[1], including aspects such as
an “Early Retirement System” for maintaining a powerful
SDF, and “Fixed Term System.” Upon employment,
uniformed SDF personnel are assigned a job appropriate
to their choice or aptitude in a training unit or at a school
belonging to the respective branch of the SDF, followed by
an appointment to units and positions all around the country.

First Lieutenant if they pass the national examinations in medicine.
2. Student candidates for enlistment (upper) refers to a candidate who has been appointed as an officer

with the premise that he/she will be promoted to a fixed-term position of “Enlisted (upper).” Until
FY2006, there were two programs consisting of “Student candidates for enlistment (upper)” and
“Enlisted (upper) candidates.” However, these two programs were reorganized and combined, and
since 2007, candidates have been appointed as “General candidates for enlistment (upper)”.

3. As for the SDF candidates, in order to enhance the initial education of SDF personnel in short-term
service, in July 2010, it was decided that their status for the first three months of their enlistment
would be as non-SDF personnel, and they would engage exclusively in fundamental education and
practice as non-regular Ministry of Defense personnel.

4. GSDF High Technical School trains people to be SDF personnel who will be capable not only of

operating and making full use of equipment in the GSDF but also of conducting missions in the
international community. For SDF students, starting from FY2010 appointments, their status was
changed from SDF officer to “students,” which is a new non-regular status. New students receive a
high school diploma at the conclusion of a student course (three years) through distance learning.
From the FY2011 appointments, a new recommendation system was introduced in which those who
are considered appropriate to be a GSDF High Technical School student are selected from among the
candidates based on the recommendation of the principal of their junior high school etc., in addition to
the conventional general examination.

of the system.
To enable Ready Reserve Personnel to participate in
training sessions without any constraint, the MOD takes
into consideration the burden on the companies that employ
these personnel and takes necessary measures to allow
such employees to attend training sessions, and provides a
special subsidy to companies.
Furthermore, the MOD promotes the use of retired
ASDF pilots more widely over a range of f elds by appointing
them as SDF reserve personnel through the reemployment
system[3]. At the same time, it also implements measures
to increase the rate fulf llment of actual uniformed SDF
personnel, for example, by promoting a system in which
a special sticker is issued to off ces that have provided
cooperation in employing SDF reserve personnel and other
reserve personnel.

**(3) Administrative Offi cials, Technical and Engineering**
**Offi cials, Instructors, and Other Civilian Personnel**

There are approximately 21,000 civilian personnel—
administrative off cials, technical and engineering off cials,
instructors, and others—in addition to uniformed SDF
personnel in the MOD and the SDF. Civilian personnel are
mainly employed from among those who have passed the
Examination for National Public Off cials for either career
track or general staff run by the National Personnel Authority
(NPA), and those who have passed the Examination for


**(2) SDF Reserve Personnel, SDF Ready Reserve Personnel,**
**and Candidates for SDF Reserve Personnel**

The number of uniformed SDF personnel should be
expanded promptly in the event of a crisis, to meet the
needs of each contingency. To fulf ll such needs promptly
and systematically, the MOD maintains three systems: the
SDF Reserve Personnel system, the SDF Ready Reserve
Personnel system, and the system for Candidates for SDF
Reserve Personnel[2].

See Fig. III-1-4-4 (Overview of Systems Related to SDF Reserve Personnel)

SDF Reserve Personnel become uniformed SDF
personnel in cases such as the issue of muster orders for
defense, and carry out logistical support and base guard
duties as uniformed SDF personnel. SDF Ready Reserve
Personnel introduced into the GSDF are assigned to carry
out their mission together with active duty uniformed SDF
personnel as part of frontline units following the issue of
muster orders for defense and other orders. SDF Reserve
Personnel candidates are to be assigned as SDF Reserve
Personnel after completing the necessary education and
training to work as uniformed SDF personnel.
As SDF Reserve Personnel work in their own civilian
jobs during peacetime, they need to adjust their work
schedule and participate in musters for training exercises
or in the event of a crisis. Therefore, understanding and
cooperation from the companies that employ these SDF
Reserve Personnel are essential for the smooth operation


Many countries other than Japan also have reserve personnel systems.

The reemployment system for SDF pilots is intended to prevent the outfl ow of active young SDF pilots to civil aviation companies in an unregulated manner. This system is also designed to utilize SDF

the Need Arises

The SDF Reserve Personnel System is a system supported by the understanding and
cooperation provided not only by the Reserve Personnel themselves but also by the
parties concerned such as companies employing them. During FY2015, the “SDF Reserve
Personnel Cooperation Offi ces Display System” will be introduced in order to facilitate
collaboration and cooperation with business offi ces that employ SDF Reserve Personnel.
Below are comments from people who have registered as SDF Reserve Personnel
with no previous experience of serving as SDF Personnel.

H I attended my fi rst mobile training and visited a base of the U.S. Marine corps in Okinawa
for a study tour. In Marine Corps Air Station Futenma I was shown the inside of an
Osprey aircraft and received an explanation about it, which broadened my knowledge.
In addition, I had an opportunity to exchange opinions regarding the Reserve Personnel
Systems both in Japan and the U.S. as well as on the subject of balancing being a
reserve personnel with my work, and I was impressed by the professionalism of the
Reserve Personnel of the U.S Marines regarding national defense.

H I was employed as an SDF Reserve Personnel Candidate in the second batch of personnel belonging to the “Technical” category.
I joined Camp Takeyama and the fi rst words I received were “Your status outside of the SDF has no bearing here.” Over time I gradually
began to realize how much sense that made and completed education in Takeyama. Even now, when I think about taking things a little
easy, I think of what my leader would say if he saw me doing this. Currently, I work at Camp Narashino as a commissioned doctor.
Going forward, I will continue to keep in mind the importance of one’s rank and improve my profi ciency by taking part in many different
training sessions.

and to better respond to various situations, efforts are being
made to expand the scope of bilateral and multinational
exercises engaged by the individual SDF services[5].

**(2) Training Environment**
SDF training has been planned and conducted under
conditions that are as close as possible to actual combat
situations, yet many restrictions remain. Therefore, the SDF
makes maximum use of its limited domestic training areas,
including further use of the prime training environment
of Hokkaido stated in the National Defense Program
Guidelines (NDPG) and other guidelines. They also strive
to carry out more practical combat training by conducting
joint exercises and other training and exercises in the
United States and surrounding sea and airspace where they
can secure training conditions not available in Japan

See Reference 49 (Results of Firing Training and Related Training by
Dispatch of Each of the Self-Defense Forces to the United States
(FY2014))


**2** **SDF Training**


**(1) Training by Each SDF**
Training conducted by units in each service can be broadly
divided into training for individual SDF personnel to
improve the necessary prof ciency for their respective
f elds, and training for units to enhance their systematic
capabilities. Training for individuals is conducted oneon-one in stages based on occupational classif cation
and individual ability. Training for units is conducted by
size of unit, from small to large; meanwhile, large-scale
comprehensive training including coordination between
units is also conducted.

See Reference 48 (Major Exercises Conducted in FY2014)

In addition to such training for national defense,
enhanced training is given in response to the diversif ed roles
required of the SDF in recent years, such as peacekeeping
operations and large-scale disaster relief operations.
Moreover, in order to strengthen joint operational capabilities


**3** **Safety Management Initiatives**

Any accidents that cause injury to the public, damage to
its property, or the loss of life of SDF personnel, must be
avoided at all costs. Therefore, during routine training, the
MOD and SDF make a united effort to ensure the constant
management of safety through the utmost mindfulness of
ensuring safety.


**3** **Promotion of the Careers of Female Personnel**


having to quit their job, and to further expand the range of
activities available to them. The MOD and the SDF also
promote the active participation of female uniformed SDF
personnel with the motivation and the ability. For example,
since December 1, 2014, a female uniformed SDF personnel
has been sent to NATO Headquarters as the adviser to NATO
Special Representative for Women, Peace and Security for
approximately two years.
On January 28, 2015, the MOD formulated the “Action
Plan for Promoting the Active Participation of Female
Employees and Work-Life Balance,” which incorporated
three reforms—“Working style reform,” “Reform to realize
a successful career with a balanced life between childrearing and nursing, etc.,” and “Reform for promoting
successful female personnel”—in order to promote the
work-life balance of the personnel in a unif ed manner
whilst promoting further recruitment and promotion of
female personnel. Along with these initiatives, with regard
to the recruitment and promotion of female personnel, the
MOD is also planning to actively work for the promotion
of successful female personnel by setting up specif c goals.


**1** **Specifi c Initiatives**

The MOD and the SDF open their doors wide not only to men
but to women to fulf ll their duties. As of the end of March
2015, the number of female personnel is about 13,000 (about
5.6% of total uniformed SDF personnel). Compared with
ten years ago (end of March 2005, at around 4.6% of total
uniformed SDF personnel), this is a rise of 1.0 percentage
points, indicating that the ratio of female personnel has been
on an increasing trend in recent years. While there are still
limitations to certain assignments, due to the requirement
for protecting motherhood and securing privacy (excluded
from assignment to tanks, submarines, f ghters, etc.), female
uniformed SDF personnel engage in boarding escort vessels
and piloting antisubmarine patrol aircraft and transport
aircraft, and their roles are expanding even at the nucleus of
the SDF, such as the staff off ces and headquarters.
In order to continue the further expansion of recruitment
and promotion of female uniformed SDF personnel, the MOD
and the SDF call for the consideration and implementation of
various measures to allow female uniformed SDF personnel
to lead a balanced life between work and family without

**(1) Female Administrative Offi cials, and Others**
As a goal to be achieved from FY2016 onwards, women
should account for 30% of newly hired staff at the MOD.
Regarding furthering the careers of women, as a goal to be
achieved by the end of FY2015, the proportion of women
reaching the Division-Director level at local organizations
and Assistant-Division-Director or equivalent level at the
ministry proper should be over 2.8%, and the proportion of
women serving at the Division-Director level or equivalent
level at the ministry proper should be 1.2%.

**(2) Female SDF Personnel**
The goal, by the end of FY2015, is to increase the
proportion of women among newly hired staff from the
current 7.6%. As for FY2016 and beyond, based on the
uniqueness of the career and recruitment environment going
forward, necessary measures for active recruitment will be
formulated by the end of FY2015. In addition, with regard
to the goal of furthering women’s careers to be realized by
the end of FY2015, the proportion of women accounting
for uniformed SDF personnel with a rank of f eld off cer or
higher is planned to increase from the current 2.8%.

well as based on the perspective of realizing a society in which both men and women can fully express their individuality and abilities, the
MOD and the SDF promote effective utilization of human resources. Specifi cally, various initiatives that expand opportunities for women to
be more active are being promoted, such as disaster relief dispatch, including responses to the Great East Japan Earthquake, international
peace cooperation activities, and dispatch to international organizations.

NATO Headquarters, Advisor to the NATO Secretary General’s Special Representative for Women, Peace and Security Lieutenant Colonel
Chizu Kurita
Since December 2014, I have been serving at the NATO Headquarters
and have been learning a great deal about their mission everyday. NATO
is implementing advanced initiatives in the fi elds of women, peace and
security, as well as gender, and women account for approximately 10% of
the military personnel in the member states of NATO. “No Women, No Peace”
is a slogan I have with my colleagues. Going forward, I intend to make great
efforts to bring most of the knowledge and experiences I have acquired
through this experience back to Japanese society, while contributing to the
development of Japan-NATO cooperation.

diversif cation and internationalization of SDF missions.
The MOD will employ measures for personnel system
reform as stipulated in the NDPG and other programs in
order to ensure an appropriate age distribution, taking into
account the various missions and characteristics of each
branch of the SDF. Specif cally, the MOD will implement
the following measures: the retirement age of 60 will be
reviewed; an early retirement system will be proactively
employed; more suitable personnel management will be
implemented; and the re-employment of aircraft pilots
in the private sector will be mediated. Furthermore, f nal
promotion rates of off cers, warrant off cers, sergeants and
petty off cers will be reviewed, and in order to maintain
the strength of the SDF, more appropriate personnel
management, which takes into account physical attributes,
will be employed.
Within the Ground, Marine, and Air SDF etc.,
serving as senior sergeant, petty off cers or other similar
positions, veteran warrant off cers, sergeants and petty
off cers who possess a superior sense of responsibility,
knowledge, skills, and leadership will be assigned the role
of managing uniformed SDF personnel of warrant off cer,
sergeant, or petty off cer rank. By doing so and based on the
characteristics of each of the Ground, Marine, and Air SDF
etc., the MOD and the SDF are striving to activate uniformed
SDF personnel of warrant off cer, sergeant or petty off cer
rank by, for example, promoting support for the leadership
of commanders, maintenance of discipline among the units,
and raising the morale of personnel. Furthermore, due to the
harsh environmental circumstances under which uniformed
SDF personnel have to perform their duties, the MOD and
the SDF strive to provide salaries, allowances, welfare and
other benef ts that ref ect the special nature of their duties
in order to instill uniformed SDF personnel with pride and
allow them to concentrate on their duties without anxiety.
The MOD and the SDF will also promote measures relating
to awards and honors, beginning with the expansion of the
system of Defense Meritorious Badges.


within the SDF. So far, internal crèche facilities have been
opened at f ve locations including one in the JGSDF Asaka
dormitory district that was opened in April 2015 (JGSDF
Camp Mishuku, JGSDF Camp Kumamoto, the JMSDF
Yokosuka Naval Base district, JGSDF Camp Makomanai,
and the JGSDF Asaka dormitory district). In addition, the
required conditions are being enhanced on an ongoing
basis, to facilitate the temporary care of children when
personnel must suddenly attend to duties, such as when
dispatched to a disaster area.


**3** **Initiatives to Support Families**


Measures such as exchanges between units and personnel’s
families, as well as between families are pursued as routine
initiatives. Furthermore, specif c welfare services for
SDF personnel who will be deployed overseas include
facilitating direct communication between SDF personnel
on deployment and their families in Japan by means such as
e-mail and video conference systems. In addition, support
for sending comfort items from their families on a later day
is also provided. Moreover, brief ng sessions for families
of the dispatched personnel are held to provide them with
a variety of information, and family support centers and
similar facilities have been established to respond to various
questions and concerns raised by the families.


**4** **Discipline-related Initiatives**


The MOD and the SDF strive to foster well-disciplined
personnel by distributing the “discipline reference material,”
which explains the gist of instructing subordinates.
Moreover, by setting up such campaign periods as the
“Anti-Drug Abuse Month,” the “Self-Defense Forces
Personnel Ethics Week,” and “Self-Defense Personnel
Sexual Harassment Prevention Week,” the MOD and the
SDF are making efforts to instill in personnel an awareness
of compliance with the law.

**Other Similar Incidents within the Ministry of Defense**


**2** **Promotion of Measures to Support Child-Raising**


Based on the “Action Plan for Promoting the Active
Participation of Female Employees and Work-Life Balance
at the MOD” formulated in January 2015 and the “Action
Plan to Support a Good Work-family Balance of the
Personnel of the MOD” (FY2015-FY2020) formulated
in March 2015, the MOD currently implements measures
aimed at encouraging its personnel to use the system, which
supports them in their efforts to balance work with family,
by creating a “Work-Family Balance Handbook,” holding
lectures to educate them and so on, in order to make the
MOD a workplace where both male and female personnel
with time constraints due to child rearing and nursing of the
elderly can play an active role.
Internal crèche facilities have been developed to
respond to the need for special working arrangements


Based on the fact that the defense of Japan, which is
a mission of the SDF, will never be achieved without
continuous trust and support from the people of Japan, the
MOD recognizes that the prevention of bullying and similar
incidents is extremely important from the perspective of
promoting the maintenance of rigorous service disciplines.
For this reason, the “Review Committee on the Prevention
of Bullying within the Ministry of Defense” chaired by
the Parliamentary Senior Vice-Minister of Defense was
established on September 17, 2014, and the examination of
valid measures with regard to the prevention of bullying is
being undertaken.

In the MOD and the SDF, funeral ceremonies are
carried out by each unit to which the personnel who perished
in the line of duty belonged, in order to express condolences.
Moreover, in order to eternally recognize the achievements
of the SDF personnel who perished in the line of duty, and to
express deep honor and condolences, memorial ceremonies
are carried out in various forms, such as the Memorial for
SDF Members Killed in the Line of Duty conducted with the
participation of the Prime Minister[6].

**6** **Initiatives to Prevent Suicide among SDF Personnel**

While a record was set in FY2005, with 101 SDF personnel
suicides, subsequent f gures have shown a decline, with 83
suicides in 2012, 82 suicides in 2013, and 69 suicides in
2014. The suicide of a member of the SDF is truly a great
tragedy for both the persons who committed suicide and
their bereaved families. It also represents a great loss to the
MOD and the SDF in terms of the loss of capable personnel,
and the MOD and the SDF are taking on-going measures to
prevent suicides, including the following initiatives:
(1) Expansion and enhancement of the counseling
system (internal/external counselors, a 24-hour telephone
counseling hotline, assignment of clinical psychotherapists
at camps and bases, etc.); (2) Strengthening of education
among commanders as well as enlightening education
for enlisted personnel such as mental health education;
(3) Establishment of a campaign period for enhancing
mental health measures, close monitoring by commanders
of the mental health condition of their subordinates whose
environment has been changed due to personnel transfers,
etc., and distribution of various reference materials.

**7** **Commemorating Personnel Perished in the Line**
**of Duty**


In order to maintain the strength of the SDF, many
uniformed SDF personnel retire by their mid-50s
(personnel serving under the early retirement system) or
their 20s (most uniformed SDF personnel serving under
the f xed-term service system). Therefore, many of them
need to f nd another job after retirement in order to secure
their livelihoods.
It is the responsibility of the Japanese government
(the MOD) as the employer to support this re-employment.
As this is of the utmost importance both for resolving any
concerns that uniformed SDF personnel may have about
their future, and for securing high-quality human resources,
support measures such as occupational training is provided.
The re-employment of retired uniformed SDF personnel is
also important from the perspective of enabling them to
serve society, making the best use of their various skills,
thereby reinforcing human resources infrastructure.
As the MOD does not have the authority to work
as an employment agency, the SDF Personnel Support
Association has permission from the Minister of Health,
Labor and Welfare and the Minister of Land, Infrastructure,
Transport and Tourism to provide free job consultations.
Retired uniformed SDF personnel have excellent
abilities in planning, leadership, faculty, cooperativeness
and responsibility gained through work performance,
education, and training. Furthermore, they also have
various qualif cations and licenses acquired through their
work and occupational training. For these reasons, they are
making positive contributions in a broad range of sectors,
including the manufacturing and service industries, as
well as the f nance, insurance, real estate, and construction
industries, in addition to the areas of disaster prevention
and risk management at local governments. Going forward,
based on the NDPG, the MOD will make an effort to
improve the reemployment of retired uniformed SDF
personnel by developing measures to increase incentives


Since the establishment of the National Police Reserve
in 1950 and through its evolution via the National Safety
Force and the Coastal Safety Force into the SDF today,
SDF personnel have been striving to accomplish the noble
mission of protecting the peace and independence of Japan.
They have accomplished this by devoting themselves
unstintingly to training, day and night, to live up to the
expectations and trust of the Japanese citizens, regardless
of danger, and with a strong sense of responsibility. During
this time, however, more than 1,850 personnel have lost

Memorial service for SDF personnel who perished in the line of duty in FY2014


The Monument for SDF Personnel Who Perished in the Line of Duty was constructed in 1962 in Ichigaya. In 1998, the Memorial Zone in its current form was completed by combining this monument
with other monuments located in the same area. A memorial ceremony for SDF personnel who perished in the line of duty is held annually by the MOD. This ceremony is attended by surviving family
members of the honored dead, and also attended by the Prime Minister and high-ranking offi cials of the MOD and the SDF including the Minister of Defense, former Directors-General of the Defense
Agency, and others. At the Monument for SDF Personnel Who Perished in the Line of Duty in the Memorial Zone, there is an iron plate containing the names and other information of personnel who
perished in the line of duty. When foreign dignitaries such as Defense Ministers visit the MOD, they make offerings of fl owers, expressing their respect and condolences to personnel who perished in

for private companies to hire them, and by promoting their
appointment to positions in the public sector further.
With a view to creating an environment where
uniformed SDF personnel can devote themselves to their
duties without any worry, the MOD has a reappointment
system that enables uniformed SDF personnel to be
appointed for f xed terms of up to three years before the
age of 60 (for SDF administration off cials and others, up
to one year). The Mid-Term Defense Program (MTDP)
states that, regarding SDF personnel who possess advanced
knowledge, skills and experiences, the MOD will actively
re-appoint these personnel if such an appointment is
recognized to contribute to the enhancement of the
comprehensive strength of the organization.

Meanwhile, reemployment of SDF personnel is
regulated[7] in order to ensure public service impartiality.
When SDF personnel become employed at private companies
within two years of retirement, and if that company had a
contract with the MOD within f ve years before that SDF
member’s retirement, the approval of the Minister of Defense
or other delegated authority must be sought in accordance
with the regulation. In 2014, the MOD approved 81 cases (81
individuals) of reemployment individually.
As a part of the government-wide Reform of National
Public Off cers’ Systems, the MOD will introduce new
re-employment regulations[8] in accordance with the
examples of civilian government employees as early as
autumn 2015.

is caused by medical off cers leaving the SDF, one of the
major reasons of which is the lack of opportunity to engage
in training and medical practice. The MOD and the SDF
will make efforts to implement various measures to prevent
medical off cers from leaving the SDF by providing them
with more opportunities to engage in training and medical
practice as well as increasing motivation for their work.
Furthermore, in light of the MTDP, the training system for
nurses will be strengthened, and efforts made to ensure the
availability of staff possessing high-level skills.


Aiming to train high-quality nurses who are capable of
fully responding to the diversif cation of duties and the
sophistication of medical technology, a four-year “nursing
program” was established for the training of public health/
registered nurses at the Division of Nursing, School of
Medicine, National Defense Medical College, in April
2014. The nursing program consists of two courses: one for
fostering nurses who will be SDF off cers, and the other for
fostering nurses who will be technical off cials requiring
high-level medical skills.

SDF hospitals play the role of hospitals that are to admit
SDF personnel injured while in service in response to
various emergency events, and in normal circumstances,
these hospitals are required to play a role in providing
medical treatment and also educating medical staff.
For this reason, based on the NDPG and the MTDP,
SDF hospitals will be centralized and their performance
levels increased, making an active contribution to local
medical care, in order to establish a high-quality medical
care system. The MOD will conduct required examinations
of the aid capabilities on the front line when responding to
contingencies, including aspects of the system, as well as
promoting the improvement of the arrangements for prompt
onward transfer of patients. In addition, the functioning of the
National Defense Medical College will be strengthened to
make it a center of training and research for defense medicine,

**1** **The Current Status of Japan’s Defense Production and Technological Bases**


The term “defense production and technological bases”
refers to the human, physical and technological bases
for development, production, operation, sustainment and
maintenance, remodeling, and refurbishment of defense
equipment required for MOD and SDF activities. As Japan
has no national arsenal (state-owned munitions factory),
most of the technological base is covered by companies that
manufacture defense equipment and associated items (the
defense industry). Therefore, a broad range of companies in
the defense industry[1], which are equipped with specialized
and advanced skills and facilities are involved in the
“defense production and technological bases.”
On the other hand, the advances in recent defense
equipment have raised per unit cost and maintenance/

sustainment costs, which has caused a decrease in the
number of units procured. In addition, despite the trend
in increasing research and development costs, the ratio of
research and development expenditure to defense-related
expenditure has leveled off. Furthermore, Japan’s defense
production and technological bases also face challenges in
retaining and passing on skills and techniques, and some
companies, which cannot cope with the reduced number
of units being procured, have pulled out of the defense
business. There has also been exposure to changes in the
international security environment such as the realignment
of the European/US defense industries and advances in
international joint development and production projects.
Amidst these situations, there are new changes emerging

defense industries.
For this reason, the 189th extraordinary session
of the Diet saw the enactment of the “Special Measures
Law Concerning the Term of Expenditure Based on
the Obligatory Assurance of National Subsidization for
Specif c Defense Procurement,” which stipulates changes
to the upper limit of acts that incur national debt from 5
years in principle, as prescribed in the Public Finance Act,
to 10 years for specif c equipment. As for the FY2015
budget, this includes the procurement cost for 20 f xedwing patrol aircraft (P-1) through a long-term contract
based on this Act resulting in an expected cost reduction of
approximately 41.7 billion yen.

See Fig. III-2-2-1 (Image of Long-term Contracts and the Cost Reduction
Effect)

In addition, by realizing long-term multiple-year
contracts through active utilization of the PFI Act[1] and
the Public Service Reform Act[2], it is anticipated that the
planned acquisition and execution of budgets through the
standardization of investment amounts will be realized. It is
also anticipated that the realization of long-term multiple-year
contracts will give rise to such benef ts as cutting equipment
procurement costs by reducing risks for those accepting
orders and by promoting the entry of new suppliers. To that


**1** **Long-term Contracts, etc.**

The production of the equipment, ships and aircraft of
the SDF requires a signif cant amount of time. Therefore,
if a certain set amount is to be acquired by the integrated
procurement method, in many cases a contract for more
than f ve years is needed. With regard to the equipment
etc., and services used by the SDF, economies of scale
tend not to exist due to the following reasons: (1) the
annual procurement quantity is small; (2) procurement is
handled only by the MOD; (3) companies that provide such
equipment etc., are limited. In addition, for companies, it is
particularly diff cult to systematically move forward with
their businesses with a high degree of predictability.
In light of such unique characteristics of the equipment
etc., and services that the SDF use, if long-term contracts
are introduced, then stable procurement will become
possible, leading to the realization of the systematic
improvement of defense capability. At the same time, for
companies, given that the procurement amount will be
assured, the systematic use of personnel and equipment as
well as cost reductions are made possible by the receiving
of bulk orders. Furthermore, this will contribute to the
prevention of subcontractors from withdrawing from the

end, in regard to the project focused on the enhancement and
operation of the X-band communications satellite, which
makes use of the PFI Act, the MOD concluded the contract
for the project in January 2013.

Patrol aircraft P-1, which procurement method is bulk procurement based on a long-term
contract in order to reduce the procurement cost


incentives for the company. Therefore, the MOD will
carry out a review of contract methods in which the cost
reduction incentives for companies work more effectively,
taking into consideration the perspective of realizing the
eff cient procurement of defense equipment.
Furthermore, the MOD will conduct independent
estimates of more appropriate acquisition prices and,
with the cooperation of companies, will also review the
development of a cost database related to the acquisition of
defense equipment, which is required in order to account
for the validity of contract prices. The MOD will also
examine the mechanism for discontinuing a project if the
primary estimate and the results differ when proceeding
with the project management.

**3** **Strengthening of Project Management**
**throughout Its Life Cycle**


In order to ensure the performance of defense equipment
required by the MOD and SDF with appropriate costs and
without a delay in schedule throughout the life cycle of the
equipment, a cross-functional Integrated Project Team (IPT)
headed by a Project Manager (PM) has been established
for the acquisition of primary defense equipment, and the
development of a system in which projects can be managed
in a unif ed way from conception to disposal is in progress.
As a leading example, currently, in the project to
develop a new multi-purpose helicopter (UH-X)[3], where
a Parliamentary Vice-Minister is the group leader in
charge of project management, this initiative is being
promoted cross-organizationally by establishing an IPT
under a neutral PM who does not have a stake in the
development and also under a management system with
enhanced objectivity and fairness[4]. This development
project advances the development of SDF aircraft in
parallel with the development of private aircraft, which are
implemented jointly by domestic and overseas companies,
and promotes the project under a system with enhanced
project management function, such as aiming to realize a
cost reduction through the standardization of the platform.

**2** **Initiatives Aimed at Increasing the Effi ciency of Procurement, and Other Related Initiatives**


incorporate approximately 153 billion yen of cost reduction
in the FY2015 budget.
Specif cally, the MOD has implemented the following
measures: a bulk purchase, which seeks greater eff ciency
by budgeting and entering into contracts for equipment,
supplies and components based on the approach of
consolidating the quantities required for several years into
a single specif c f scal year; and integrated procurement,


**2** **Decrease Procurement Cost and Improve**
**Companies’ Incentives to Reduce Cost**

With regard to the procurement of defense equipment,
based on the special fact that there exists a variety of
equipment without a market price, it is necessary to achieve
both the reduction of procurement cost and improvement
of companies’ incentives to reduce cost simultaneously.
Thus, the MOD has been striving to achieve the reduction
of procurement prices by requiring companies to return any
excessive prof t after the execution of the contract, through
cost audit contracts with a special provision stipulating that
an audit of the actual costs incurred will be conducted and
that the f nal amount paid will be established based on this
(audit contracts incorporating a provision requiring the
return of excessive prof t).
Meanwhile, regarding the provision requiring the
return of excessive prof t, it is also noted that particular
conditions, such as the request that this be returned after
the completion of the contract payment during the end of
the f scal year, diminish the effectiveness of cost reduction


**1** **Achieving Further Effi ciency in the Acquisition**
**of Equipment**

For the purpose of promoting acquisition reform, the
MOD has continuously been holding meetings of the
Comprehensive Acquisition Reform Committee since
October 2007 and the Contractual Systems Study Groups
since 2010, ref ecting acquisition eff ciency policies that


As a successor of the GSDF helicopter UH-1J, this is the development of a new multi-purpose helicopter to be used for air operations in various situations and lifesaving activities in large-scale
disasters. In order to undertake the development during the 2015 fi scal year, currently the process of selecting the developer is in progress.

In order to ensure the adequacy of the formulation of a specifi cation and a request for proposal, efforts are being made to increase the transparency and clarity of the process by collecting information


-----

which involves the consolidated implementation of budgets
for equipment used across multiple different organizations,
or for components that are common to different types
of equipment. For example, in the FY2015 budget, the
bulk purchase of Aegis-Equipped Destroyers will save
approximately ¥35 billion on a contract base.
In addition, the Ministry is striving to reduce
development, acquisition and maintenance expenses
through (1) procuring common equipment and supplies,
(2) standardizing some components, and (3) development
of product families, etc[5].

**2** **Effective and Efficient Maintenance and**
**Replenishment**


PBL will be newly introduced for the minesweeping /transport helicopter (MCH-101)

and Construction Off ce, and an auditing division was
established in the Internal Bureau, showing that the MOD
is working toward strengthening its checking functions.
However, because it was revealed that Mitsubishi
Electric and four of its subsidiaries and aff liates, and
Sumitomo Heavy Industries and its subsidiary[8] had
engaged in overcharging, in December 2012, the MOD
announced measures to prevent recurrence, centering on
the strengthening of system investigation, the revision of
penalties, and the establishment of guidelines concerning
bidding suspensions.
These measures to prevent recurrences seek to
enhance and strengthen measures to alleviate the closed
nature of those involved in defense production and increase
transparency, as well as reviewing measures toward
the impartial evaluation of the costs and risks borne by
companies. In March 2013, the Investigative Committee
on Cases of Overcharging, chaired by the Parliamentary
Vice-Minister of Defense, began deliberations concerning
the specif c ways to implement these measures, and some
of these measures have entered into force since April of the
same year.
Furthermore, in June 2013, Sumitomo Heavy Industries
reported to the Equipment Procurement and Construction
Off ce that they had delivered “12.7-mm heavy machine
guns” having falsif ed the results of product testing on
them. The MOD is working to prevent recurrence, while
at the same time implementing f ve months of bidding
suspension measures against Sumitomo Heavy Industries.


Having made every effort to securely ensure safety, the
MOD has been endeavoring to achieve greater eff ciency
by extending the interval between periodic maintenance
checks of defense equipment. During FY2014, cost
reductions have been achieved, for example, by extending
the interval between the regular maintenance of P-3C
maritime patrol aircraft (P-3C) from 48 to 60 months.
In addition, the MOD embarks on the introduction of
Performance Based Logistics (PBL)[6] from the perspective
of improving the equipment availability ratio and longterm cost reductions. In FY2015, PBL contracts are due
to be concluded on the aircraft maintenance of the MSDF
minesweeper and transporter (MSH-101).


**3** **Efforts to Increase Fairness and Transparency**


The MOD aims to increase fairness and transparency in
relation to the acquisition of equipment and materials,
and has thus far implemented a variety of measures from
the perspective of making contracts more appropriate and
strengthening checking functions.
Recently, as a part of the effort to make public
procurement more appropriate across the whole
government, the MOD has been working on a number of
measures, including the introduction and expansion of a
comprehensive evaluation bidding system[7], the increase
of multiple-year contracts, making bidding procedures
more eff cient, and reviews of single-tendering contracts.
Alongside these measures, a deputy chief in charge of
auditing was assigned at the Equipment Procurement


Examples of each of these include, (1) small arms, vehicles, and chemical supplies in the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF; (2) short-range surface-to-air missiles used by the GSDF and ASDF; and (3) anti-ship
missiles used by all three branches of the SDF.

PBL is a contract method that involves payment of compensation relative to the level of equipment performance achieved, in terms of availability ratio and stable stock. It has achieved positive
outcomes upon application to the maintenance and servicing of equipment in Western countries.

Unlike the automatic bid system, which focuses only on price, this is a system in which the successful bidder is determined on the basis of a comprehensive evaluation that includes both the price
and other elements, which is used in cases in which it is appropriate to carry out such procedures as evaluating the technological elements.

**Section 3 Research and Development**


**1** **Orientation for Research and Development of Equipment and Material**


Based on changes in future combat modality in light of
joint operations, as well as the trend in technology enabling
smarter, more networked and more unmanned conditions,
the MOD is in the process of formulating a medium-tolong-term roadmap for research and development called
“Research and Development Vision,” covering items
that could potentially become Japan’s important defense
equipment in approximately 20 years. The “Research and

**2** **Technical Research and Development Institute (TRDI) Initiatives**


The TRDI conducts advanced research that corresponds
to the needs of the Self-Defense Forces, including
1. improvement of air defense capability, 2. enhancement
of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR)
capabilities, and 3. unmanned equipment that can be used
f exibly at times of various contingencies including largescale disasters. TRDI also makes proposals regarding
highly promising technologies based on technology seeds,
while adopting advanced technology for prototyping as
well as testing and evaluation.
Particularly for improving air defense capability, with
regard to future f ghters, TRDI has been promoting strategic
deliberations through research on f ghter engines with high
thrust using cutting-edge materials technology and research
concerning system integration utilizing a simulation
environment in order to verify the technological feasibility
of future f ghters, in addition to demonstrational research
on high-mobility stealth f ghter “Advanced Technology
Demonstrator (ATD-X).” This will enable the f ghterrelated technology to be compiled and advanced within
Japan, and the development (including the possibility of
international joint development) of f ghters to be taken into
account as an option before the retirement of F-2 f ghters.
The decision on the development will be made by FY2018
and necessary measures will be taken accordingly.
To improve ISR capabilities, the MOD has launched
demonstrational research in outer space by loading dual
wavelength infrared sensors with superior detecting and
discriminating capabilities developed by TRDI onto
“advanced optical satellites,” which are currently being
planned by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports,
Science and Technology (MEXT) and the Japan Aerospace
Exploration Agency (JAXA). TRDI also promotes research
on unmanned equipment, high mobility powered suits and
other equipment that can be used f exibly at times of various
contingencies including large-scale disasters.
Furthermore, from the perspective of joint operation,


Development Vision” is intended to realize effective and
eff cient research and development by presenting a farsighted concept of defense equipment and a roadmap for
research and development designed to achieve the concept.
The MOD also aims to increase predictability for industries,
and promote stable and eff cient capital investment as well
as staff assignment by off cially publishing the vision.

TRDI has also been engaged in “operational verif cation
research”[1] such as research on information sharing
technology required for a joint data link system, which
realizes high-speed and large-capacity data communication
that responds to the enhancement of information capability
among the three services of the SDF, as well as information
diversif cation and complication, research on application of

**1** **Deepening Relationships with the United States regarding Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation**


In December 2014, with regard to regional Maintenance,
Repair, Overhaul and Upgrade (MRO&U) Capability
in the Asia-Pacif c region for F35s, the U.S. government
announced the following decisions: (1) regional MRO&U
capability for airframes will be provided to Japan and
Australia with both capabilities required not later than early
2018[2]; (2) With regard to the regional MRO&U Capability
for engines, initial capability will be provided by Australia
by early 2018, with Japan providing additional capability
within the next 3-5 years[3]. Utilizing the FACO facility for
airframes and engines, and contributing to maintenance in
the Asia-Pacif c region are signif cant from the perspectives
of securing the operational support system for F-35A in
Japan, maintaining the foundation of the domestic defense
industry, strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance, and
deepening equipment cooperation in the region.

F-35A aircraft, the production of which involves the participation of Japanese industries
(U.S. Air Force)


**1** **Joint Research and Development, etc.**

Since 1992, Japan has implemented 19 joint research
projects and 1 joint development project with the United
States. At present, 2 joint research projects (joint research
on hybrid electric propulsion and another joint research
on high-speed multi-hull vessel optimization) and 1
development project (Japan-U.S. joint development of an
Advanced Ballistic Missile Interceptor) are underway. In
addition, with regard to the transfer of Patriot (PAC-2) parts
produced under license in Japan from Japan to the licenser
in the United States, Japan aff rmed in July 2014 that this
overseas transfer falls under the case which may be permitted,
based on deliberations at the National Security Council.

See Part II, Chapter 2, Section 4 (Three Principles on Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology)

See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 1-3-2 (Missile Defense of the United States
and Japan-U.S. BMD Technological Cooperation)

See Reference 25 (Japan–U.S. Joint Research and Development Projects)


**2** **Production, Maintenance and Upgrade of**
**Common Equipment between Japan and the U.S.**

**(1) Participation of Japanese Industry in the Production**
**of the F-35A and the Establishment of Regional**
**Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul and Upgrade**
**(MRO&U) Capability**

In December 2011, Japan selected the F-35A as the
next-generation f ghter aircraft to succeed the F-4 f ghter
aircraft. At the same time, the government decided to
procure 42 aircraft from FY2012 onwards and to have
Japanese industries participate in its production, aside
from several f nished aircraft which shall be imported. In
light of this decision, the Japanese government has been
working to enable the involvement of Japanese industries
in the manufacturing process in preparation for the F-35A
acquisition from FY2013 onwards. Following discussions
with related parties such as the U.S. government, the
Japanese government has steadily expanded the range of
production participation by Japanese industries including
the Final Assembly and Check Out (FACO) for airframes
and engines, the manufacture of engines and radar parts,
and the Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System
(EODAS) parts[1].
It is important for Japanese industries to participate in the
manufacturing process and to come into contact with cutting
edge f ghter aircraft technology and knowledge in order to
ensure safety and high operational availability, resulting in the
safe and eff cient management of ASDF F-35As.


**(2) Initiatives towards the Establishment of the Japan-**
**U.S. Osprey Common Maintenance Base, etc.**

As the Periodic Maintenance Inspection (PMI) of the
U.S. Marine Corps Ospreys (24 aircraft) deployed at
Futenma is scheduled to commence roughly in 2017, the
U.S. Forces will determine a maintenance company for
this purpose by public bidding. With regard to the Osprey
(V-22)[4] to be introduced to the GSDF, the MOD recognizes
the importance of establishing a common maintenance
base for the U.S. Marine Corp aircraft within Japan from
the following perspectives: 1. Smooth introduction of
Ospreys to the GSDF; 2. Smooth and effective operation
of the Japan-U.S. security arrangement; and 3. Enhanced
eff ciency in maintenance. Based on this perspective, the
MOD plans to allow Japanese companies to use the hangars
at GSDF Camp Kisarazu for regular aircraft maintenance


Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System (EODAS), comprising six cutting edge electro-optical sensors per aircraft for 360 degree spherical situational awareness, missile detection and tracking.

The regional MRO&U for airframes in Japan is scheduled to be located at Mitsubishi Heavy Industry Ltd. (Komaki-minami factory in Aichi Prefecture).

The regional MRO&U for engines in Japan is scheduled to be located at IHI Corporation (Mizuho factory in Tokyo).

GSDF will introduce 17 tilt-rotor aircraft (Osprey (V-22)) that can complement and strengthen the capabilities of transport helicopters (CH-47JA) in terms of cruising speed and range. Deployment is

**2** **Building New Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation**


**(1) Australia**
With Australia, the Agreement between the Government
of Japan and the Government of Australia concerning
the Transfer of Defence Equipment and Technology was
signed in July 2014. In addition, joint research in the f eld
of marine hydrodynamics is scheduled to commence in
FY2015.
Meanwhile, at the Japan-Australia Defence Ministerial
Meeting held in October of the same year, it was agreed
to seek multifaceted defense equipment and technology
cooperation, including the following: 1. exploration of
potential cooperation opportunities in the F-35 program;
2. acquisition reform dialogue with the Defence Material
Organisation of Australia; 3. at the request of the Australian
side, building upon previous discussions, exploration of the
possibility of Japanese cooperation in the Australian Future
Submarine Program; 4. defense technology exchanges
with the Defence Science and Technology Organisation
of Australia (marine hydrodynamics f eld and exchanges
among engineers and scientists); and 5. talks between
defense industries in both countries.
Furthermore, during the Japan-Australia Defense
Ministerial telephone conference on May 6, 2015, the
Australia side made a remark regarding the importance of
developing Japan-Australia defense cooperation and the
strategic importance of the Australian Future Submarine
Program. Following this remark, based on Japan’s longstanding achievement and technological capabilities
regarding a conventional submarine, the Australian side
explained its intention to examine the possibility of jointly
designing and building Australian future submarines with
Japan. Then, the Australian government requested that Japan
participate in the procedure of selecting Australian future
submarines. In May 2015, responding to this request, in light
of the importance of Japan-Australia defense cooperation,
it was conf rmed that, with the participation of private
companies, consultations with the Government of Australia
would be commenced. In order to conduct these consultations,
the transfer of technology information for feasibility research
of the joint development and production of submarines was
deliberated at the National Security Council, and it was
aff rmed that this falls under the case in which the transfer of
technology to overseas could be permitted.

See Part II, Chapter 2, Section 4 (Three Principles on Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology)

See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1-4-1 (Japan-Australia Defense Cooperation
and Exchanges)


**1** **Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation**
**with Major European Countries, etc.**

Defense equipment and technology cooperation with
major European countries, which have competitive defense
industries, will contribute to the strengthening of security
and defense cooperation with these countries as well as the
maintenance and strengthening of the defense production
and technological base in Japan. Therefore, Japan will seek
to establish and deepen relationships with these countries.

**(1) United Kingdom**
In July 2013, the governments of Japan and the United
Kingdom concluded an intergovernmental framework
agreement regarding joint development and other initiatives
related to defense equipment etc[5]. In the same month, the
two countries also started joint research on chemical and
biological protection technology, marking the f rst time that
Japan had engaged in such research with a country other than
the United States. Also, in July 2014, information on seeker
technology for joint research with the United Kingdom
was determined by the National Security Council as a case
where overseas transfer may be permitted. Responding to
said decision, in November of the same year, a letter of
arrangement was formulated in relation to Japan-U.K. joint
research on the feasibility of a jointly developed new air-toair missile and the joint research was commenced.

See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1-4-7 (Japan-U.K. Defense Cooperation
and Exchanges)


**(2) France**
Japan and France established a committee on cooperation
in the f eld of defense equipment and a committee on
export control in January 2014, and signed the JapanFrance Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology
Agreement[6] in March 2015.

See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1-4-8 (Japan-France Defense Cooperation
and Exchanges)

**2** **Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation, etc.,**
**with Partner Countries in the Asia-Pacifi c Region**

As partner countries in the Asia-Pacif c region have
expressed their interest and expectation regarding defense
equipment and technology cooperation with Japan, the
MOD will proactively seek to build relationships with
these countries.

**(2) India**
With India, which has been considering the acquisition of
amphibian search and rescue aircraft, the establishment
of the Joint Working Group (JWG) to facilitate bilateral
cooperation for the US-2 aircraft was decided during the
Japan-India Summit Meeting held in May 2013. So far,
three JWG meetings have been held in total in which the
Japanese representatives provided information on the
performance, overview of operations, production and
assembly, and maintenance, etc. of the US-2, including
the offer of an opportunity to experience a US-2 f ight and
to visit the factory to the Indian delegation of the JWG.
Furthermore, talks between the two countries are taking
place to prepare the formulation of a roadmap for industryto-industry cooperation, including technology transfer and
production within India. Also, in response to the JapanIndia Summit Meeting in September 2014, working-level
meetings have been held in order to promote cooperation in
defense equipment and technology.

See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1-4-3 (Japan-India Defense Cooperation
and Exchanges)

**(3) ASEAN[7] countries**
Between the Association of South-East Asia Nations
(ASEAN) and Japan, opinion exchanges are taking place
regarding defense equipment and technology cooperation


Japan and India are discussing how to engage in bilateral cooperation in relation to the US-2
amphibian rescue aircraft

in non-traditional security sectors, such as humanitarian
assistance, disaster relief and maritime security through
the Japan-ASEAN Defense Vice-Ministerial Meetings and
other occasions. Participating countries have expressed
their expectation for Japan’s cooperation in effectively
dealing with these issues. In September 2014, as part of
the Seminar on Capacity Building in Maritime Security and
Disaster Relief (hosted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs),
an event to introduce defense equipment, etc., by Japanese
defense-related companies was held at the MOD.

See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1-2-3 (Japan–ASEAN Defense ViceMinisterial Forum)


**3** **Adapting Defense Equipment for Civilian Use**


In August 2010, the MOD compiled a set of guidelines
for the development of a concrete system for converting
aircraft to civilian use, while in 2011, it also developed
the application procedure for private companies interested
in civilian use. At present, technical data related to the
civilian use of the US-2 amphibian rescue aircraft and the


C-2 transport aircraft are being disclosed in response to
requests from the implementing companies.
The possibility of civilian use of equipment other than
aircraft will be considered based on the needs of foreign
countries and the intentions of the defense industry.

**4** **Technology Control, etc.**


control under the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology.


**1** **Technology Control**

In promoting defense equipment and technology
cooperation internationally, it is necessary to evaluate
the sensitivity and strategic value of defense technology
and dual-use technology and protect those technologies
that should be protected as strengths of Japan. At the
same time, it is necessary to strengthen the technology
control functions by avoiding the risk of their conversion
into weapons from the perspective of Japan’s security.
As such, cooperation with the Ministry of Economy,
Trade and Industry will be promoted, and efforts will be
made to contribute to strict examination and appropriate


**2** **Other**

In December 2014, the “Committee on Challenges
surrounding the Transfer of Defense Equipment and
Technology,” consisting of members that include external
experts and others, was launched with the aim of reviewing
the system for smoothly and appropriately advancing
cooperation in defense equipment and technology for the
security of Japan, as well as support measures for companies.

**Chapter** **Active Promotion of Security Cooperation**
##### 3


The international community today is facing an increasing
number of challenges, which are extremely diff cult
for one country to deal with on its own. Therefore, it is
important to strengthen bilateral and multilateral security
cooperation, as well as proactively engage in international
peace cooperation activities, from the perspective of
“proactive contribution to peace” based on the principle of
international cooperation.
In light of this situation, the National Defense


Program Guidelines aims to continuously promote and
enhance various initiatives related to capacity building,
arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation in order
to address global security issues, such as local conf icts,
expansion and spread of international terrorism, failed
states, and proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction
(WMD), while promoting cooperation with the allied
countries and the related countries that share the security
benef ts in peacetime.


**Section 1 Defense Cooperation and Exchanges with Other Countries and Regions**


**1** **Signifi cance and Evolution of Security Cooperation and Dialogue and Defense Cooperation and Exchange**


In recent years, dialogues and exchanges with other
countries have been deepened qualitatively and expanded
quantitatively. In the security f eld, the following approaches
are necessary: nurturing the habits of cooperation, and
promoting practical and concrete cooperation for building
regional order and establishing common norms and
standards; eliminating the sense of confrontation and sense
of caution in our neighboring countries and region in order
to foster a collaborative and cooperative atmosphere with
a future-oriented perspective; and actively promoting
cooperation in bilateral and multilateral arenas. To that

**Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus) Framework**


end, the MOD and the SDF are promoting multi-layered
security cooperation and dialogue, defense cooperation and
exchange, as well as joint training and exercises, utilizing
the limited resources effectively and eff ciently, and taking
into account the characteristics of each country and region.

See Reference 54 (Record of Major Multinational Security Dialogues (AsiaPacific Region, Last Five Years)), Reference 55 (Exchange Student
Acceptance Record (Number of Newly Accepted Students in FY2014))

outside the ASEAN region. Thus, the establishment of the
ADMM-Plus is highly signif cant from the perspective of
encouraging the development and deepening of security
and defense cooperation in the region, and the MOD and
the SDF are providing active support for its initiatives.
The ADMM-Plus is comprised of (1) ADSOMPlus (ASEAN Defence Senior Off cials’ Meeting Plus),
(2) ADSOM-Plus Working Groups (ADSOM-Plus WG), and
(3) Experts’ Working Groups (EWG). Japan and Singapore
served as co-chairs of the EWG on Military Medicine until
March 2014, and the participants in the meeting exchanged
practical opinions on approaches to cooperation with each
country in the f eld of military medicine at times of a major
disaster. Furthermore, at meetings of the EWG on Maritime
Security, Japan emphasized the importance of establishing
shared customary “manners” by which all countries abide,


The countries of ASEAN hold meetings such as the
ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)[1], which serves as a
security framework for the region, and the ASEAN Defense
Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM), which is a ministerial
level meeting between defense authorities in the ASEAN
countries. In addition to these meetings, a decision was
taken to establish the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ MeetingPlus (ADMM-Plus), which added eight new non-ASEAN
countries[2] including Japan to the members, and the 1st
ADMM-Plus was held in October 2010 in Hanoi, Vietnam.
Until the establishment of the ADMM-Plus, there
had been no off cial meeting for the region’s defense
ministers in the Asia Pacif c region including the countries


The ARF, a forum aimed at improving the security environment in the Asia-Pacifi c region through dialogue and cooperation on the political and security sectors, has been held since 1994. The ARF
currently comprises the following 26 countries and 1 organization as member states, and holds various inter-governmental meetings on security that are attended by both foreign affairs offi cials and
defense offi cials to exchange opinions on the regional situation and security areas that require a particular focus. The 26 countries consist of 10 ASEAN countries (Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia,
Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia (since 1995) and Myanmar (since 1996)), in addition to Japan, Australia, Canada, China and India (since 1996), New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Republic of Korea (ROK), Russia, the United States and Mongolia (since 1998), North Korea (since 2000), Pakistan (since 2004), Timor-Leste (since 2005), Bangladesh (since
2006), and Sri Lanka (since 2007), plus the European Union (EU).

**(1) Japan-ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Roundtable Meeting**
Based on the proposal by Prime Minister Abe at the
ASEAN-Japan Commemorative Summit in December
2013, the Japan-ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Roundtable
Meeting took place in Myanmar in November 2014. This
roundtable, in which opinion exchanges were conducted
regarding cooperation in non-traditional security areas such
as humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and maritime
security, was a breakthrough opportunity, bringing together
defense ministers from the relevant countries for the f rst
time in the 40 years of friendship and cooperation between
Japan and ASEAN, this marked an important f rst step
towards strengthening defense cooperation in future.

**2** **ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)**

In recent years, specif c initiatives[3] in non-traditional
security areas such as disaster relief, maritime security,
and peacekeeping and peace building have been actively
implemented by the ARF. For example, in the maritime
security f eld, an Inter-Sessional Meeting on Maritime
Security (ISM-MS) has been held since 2009[4]. At the
ISM-MS, Japan compiled a collection of best practices
concerning support for capacity building in the f eld of
maritime security was formulated on the basis of a summary
compiled by Japan. In the f eld of disaster relief, the MOD
and the SDF have dispatched SDF personnel and aircraft to
participate in ARF Disaster Relief Exercises (ARF-DiREx)
since 2009. In May 2015, ARF-DiREx 2015, the fourth
such exercise, was held in Malaysia, with Japan sending
around 10 personnel to participate.

In addition to Foreign Ministers’ meetings at the Foreign Minister level, the Senior Officials Meeting (SOM) and Inter-Sessional Meetings (ISM) are held each year, as well as meetings of the InterSessional Support Group on Confidence Building Measures and Preventive Diplomacy (ISG on CBM/PD) and the ARF Security Policy Conference (ASPC). Moreover, since the Foreign Ministers’ meeting
in 2002, ARF Defense Officials’ Dialogues (DOD) is held ahead of the main meeting.


-----

**(2) Tokyo Defense Forum etc.**
As Japan’s own initiatives regarding security in the AsiaPacif c region, the MOD has held since 1996 the AsiaPacif c Defense Forum (Tokyo Defense Forum) with
the participation of off cers in charge of defense policy
(Directors General of defense ministries and Generalclass off cers) from the countries in the region. At the
forum, defense policies of the participating countries and
conf dence-building measures in the region are discussed.
24 countries from the Asia-Pacif c region, as well as
the ASEAN Secretariat, the European Union (EU), the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and the
United Nations Off ce for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs (UNOCHA) took part in the 19th forum in March
2015. At this forum, discussions took place on the topics of
(1) Enhancing Maritime Security; and (2) Synergy among
the Frameworks for Multilateral Cooperation.
Since 2001, the MOD has invited key f gures who
are primarily involved in security policy to Japan from
countries in the Asia-Pacif c region, with the objective of
promoting understanding of Japan’s security and defense
policy as well as the current status of the SDF.

**(3) Japan-ASEAN Defense Vice-Ministerial Forum**
Since 2009, the MOD has annually held the Japan-ASEAN
Defense Vice-Ministerial Forum, with the purpose of
creating a foundation for strengthening multilateral and
bilateral relationships through establishing human networks
between Japanese and ASEAN vice-ministerial-level
off cials. On the sidelines of the forum, the Ministry holds
bilateral talks at the vice-ministerial level. The 6th meeting
was held in Yokohama in October 2014, attended by the
vice-ministerial level off cials from ASEAN member states
and the ASEAN Secretariat. They exchanged opinions on
the topics of (1) Promoting Maritime Defense Cooperation;
and (2) Possible Maritime Cooperation – From the
Perspective of Equipment and Technology Cooperation and


Capacity Building. At the forum, the Administrative ViceMinister of Defense conducted bilateral talks at the viceministerial level with participants from Brunei Darussalam,
Cambodia, Myanmar, and other countries.


**4** **Other**


**(1) International Conferences Held by Private**
**Organizations**

In the f eld of security, various international conferences
are also held by private organizations, and such conferences
provide a forum for sharing and exchanging opinions
on medium-to long-term security issues. The leading
international conferences are the IISS Asia Security
Summit (Shangri-La Dialogue)[5] and the IISS Regional
Security Conference (Manama Dialogue), both hosted by
the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).
At the 14th Shangri-La Dialogue held in May 2015,
Minister of Defense Nakatani delivered a speech at the
second plenary session entitled “New Forms of Security
Collaboration in Asia,” and also held bilateral and trilateral
talks with the participating countries to explain the security
policies of Japan, as well as exchange opinions on regional
situations and defense cooperation. The Manama Dialogue
is an international conference held in Manama, Bahrain
at which foreign and defense off cials in the Middle East
exchange opinions on security. As the stability of the Middle
East is extremely important for Japan, from the perspective
of energy security, as well as the safety and security of sea
lanes, the MOD has participated in every conference since
the 2nd conference in 2005.

**(2) Inter-Service Branch Initiatives**
a. Asia-Pacific Chiefs of Defense Conference (CHOD)
The CHOD is a meeting of the chiefs of defense, mostly
from the Asia-Pacif c region, aimed at nurturing trust among
countries in the region and enhancing security relations
through free exchanges of opinions on regional security
and bilateral dialogues, among other activities. Japan has
participated in each conference since the f rst one held in
1998. In 2004, Japan hosted the 7th conference together
with the United States Pacif c Command. More recently, in
November 2014, the 17th Conference was held in Brunei
Darussalam, and was attended by the Joint Chief of Staff.
b. Chief of Army’s Exercise (CA EX)
CA EX is a forum held once every two years by the
Australian Army where army chiefs, experts and other
relevant off cials in the Asia-Pacif c region participate in
and widely exchange opinions on issues regarding ground
forces in the region. The GSDF participated in CA EX for
the f rst time in 2012, while the Chief of the Staff of the
GSDF attended and delivered a speech at CA EX 2014,
which was held in September 2014.

c. The Western Pacific Naval Symposium (WPNS)
The WPNS has been held since 1988. It is attended by
the chiefs of staff of the navy of countries in the Western
Pacif c region, and holds discussions on various maritime
security issues. The MSDF has been participating since
the second symposium in 1990, and the Chief of Maritime
Staff attended the last meeting held in Qingdao, hosted by
China in April 2014.
d. The Pacific Air Chiefs Symposium (PACS), etc.
The PACS, hosted by the United States, is held every
two years. It aims to promote mutual understanding and


enhance security relationships between the countries in the
region through exchanges of views among the chiefs of
staff of the air forces, etc. from those countries. The ASDF
has been participating in PACS since the f rst symposium in
1989, except the 13th in 2013, and the Chief of Staff of the
ASDF attended the last meeting held in Washington, D.C.,
in March 2014.
In October 2014, the ASDF also hosted the Air Chief’s
Dialogue in Japan (ACDJ), an event inviting air chiefs and
others, as part of celebrations for the 60th anniversary of
the ASDF[6].


60th Anniversary of the Air Self-Defense Force, Air Chiefs’
**Commentary**
Dialogue in Japan (ACDJ)

In October 2014, the ASDF invited a total of eight Air Chiefs and
Commanders from seven different countries as part of its 60th
Anniversary, and held a fi ve-day event named the Air Chiefs’ Dialogue in
Japan (ADCJ), which included a symposium, a courtesy call on the Prime
Minister, and participation in the Air Review.
The Chief of Staff of the ASDF held bilateral talks with Air Chiefs and
Commanders who visited Japan, and agreed to strengthen their mutual
relationships and to further promote dialogues at various levels.
The symposium, which was the main event of the ACDJ, was
held on the theme of “The Future of Air Power” Following the opening
speeches by the State-Minister of Defense and the Chief of Staff of the The Air Chiefs and Commanders with Prime Minister Abe
ASDF, representatives of each participating country delivered a speech at the Prime Minister’s Offi ce.
on subjects including the relationship between scientifi c technologies
and the air force, and the role of the air force in the future. In particular, the delegates came to share the recognition about the importance
of respecting international law in order to maintain order in airspace.
Next, the delegates paid a courtesy call to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at his offi cial residence. Prime Minister Abe stated, “As the role
of air power grows increasingly important, the fact that I am able to meet with you who play a major role in maintaining the peace and
stability of the region makes this a signifi ciant occasion.” General Robinson, the fi rst female Commander of the U.S. Pacifi c Air Forces,
expressed her gratitude on behalf of the delegation. Furthermore, the delegates viewed the ASDF aircraft fl ying in a well-organized
formation at the Air Review commemorating the 60th Anniversary of the MOD and the SDF.
For Japan, to host such an event, in which Air Chiefs from different countries were able to interact with one another, is extremely
benefi cial in terms of promoting defense cooperation and exchanges. It is important that Japan will continue to implement defense
cooperation and exchanges to promote the understanding of the SDF and to further enhance relationships with other countries through
all available opportunities.

Japanese people and the countries receiving such support
of Japan’s stance of working proactively and independently
to realize regional peace and stability, thereby increasing
trust in the MOD and the SDF, as well as Japan as a whole.
In addition, these initiatives also facilitate improving
the capabilities of the SDF itself.

**(2) Specific Activities**
The long-term dispatch program involves dispatching a
team composed of defense off cials, SDF personnel, and
staff from knowledgeable private sector groups such as
NGOs for a comparatively long period in order to conduct
large-scale, systematic human resource development, such
as lectures and practical training. This program has so far
been conducted in Timor-Leste, Cambodia, and Mongolia.
The short-term dispatch program involves activities
such as giving lectures at seminars, so knowledgeable
SDF personnel are dispatched for short periods of time.
To date, the MOD and the SDF have dispatched SDF
personnel etc., to Mongolia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Papua
New Guinea, and Myanmar.
The invitation program involves inviting practitioners
from the counterpart country to Japan, in order to provide
opportunities for them to view facilities and undergo
training. To date, the MOD and the SDF have invited
military off cials from Vietnam, Mongolia, Indonesia,
Timor-Leste, Cambodia, and the Philippines.

**Building Assistance**

**(1) Significance of the Implementation of Capacity**
**Building Assistance**

In recent years, the importance of capacity building assistance
has received increasing recognition. Capacity building
assistance is an initiative based on the concept of seeking
to actively create stability within the region and improve
the global security environment by enhancing the ability
of countries eligible for support through continuous human
resource development and technical support in security and
defense f elds in peacetime[7]. Providing support for capacity
building has the following signif cance: (1) enabling the
countries receiving such support to contribute to improving
the global security environment; (2) strengthening bilateral
relationships with the countries receiving such support;
(3) the strengthening of relationships with other supporting
countries; and (4) promoting an awareness among the

**2** **Pacific Partnership**

The Pacif c Partnership (PP), which started in 2007, is an
initiative in which naval vessels, primarily those from the
U.S. Navy, visit countries in the region to provide medical
care, to conduct civil engineering business, and to engage
in cultural exchange, as well as to seek to strengthen
collaboration with the participating countries and facilitate
international disaster relief activities, through cooperation
with the government, military, international organizations,
and NGOs in each of those countries. Since 2007, Japan
has dispatched SDF medical personnel and units, amongst
others, as part of this initiative.
In 2015, SDF medical personnel, engineering personnel
from the GSDF, and an MSDF vessel have been dispatched
to Fiji, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines since May,
and are scheduled to complete their activities in August.


**3** **Multilateral Joint Training**

**(1) Significance of Multilateral Joint Training in the**
**Asia-Pacific Region**

Since 2000, in the Asia-Pacif c region, in addition to
conventional training conducted in preparation for
combat situations, steps have also been taken to undertake
multinational training in non-traditional security f elds,
such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, as well
as non-combatant evacuation operation.
It is important to participate in and host such
multinational training exercises so as not only to raise the
skill level of the SDF, but to create a cooperative platform
through various forms of coordination and exchanges of
opinions with the countries involved. The MOD and the
SDF continue to actively engage in such training.

See Reference 59 (Participation in Multilateral Training (Last Three Years))


-----

**(2) Initiatives toward Multilateral Training**
a. Participation in, and Hosting of, Multilateral Joint
Training and Exercises
In April 2002, the MSDF hosted the second Western Pacif c
submarine rescue exercise, its f rst time hosting the exercise.
In October 2002, the MSDF also hosted multilateral search
and rescue exercises. In March 2011, Japan and Indonesia
co-hosted ARF-DiREx2011, the second time the exercise
was held, within the framework of the ARF. Furthermore,
in September 2013, the MSDF hosted the Sixth Western
Pacif c submarine rescue exercises.
Moreover, since 2005, the SDF has also been involved
in the annual Cobra Gold exercise, a multinational joint
training exercise co-hosted by the United States and
Thailand. In Cobra Gold 15 held in February 2015,
the SDF participated in the command post exercises,
conducted training in transporting Japanese nationals
overseas, and also participated in the public health section
of humanitarian and civic assistance activities. Since 2010,
the SDF has participated in the Global Peace Operations
Initiative (GPOI) Capstone Exercise, a multinational
exercise for U.N. peacekeeping operations launched by the
United States. In August 2014, the SDF participated in staff
exercises, f eld training, and a leaders’ seminar as part of
the Garuda Shanti Dharma exercise held in Indonesia.
The GSDF participated in the multilateral exercise,
KHAAN QUEST 14, co-hosted by the United States and

Mongolia in June 2014. The MSDF participated in the
multilateral exercise (TGEX KOA KAI EAST) in October
2014, and at the same time, it also participated in the U.S.hosted International Minesweeper Training conducted in
the waters around the Arabian Peninsula between October
and November of the same year. The ASDF participated
in the exercise “Corp North Guam 15,” which was hosted
jointly by Japan, the United States and Australia and was
held in Guam in February 2015. The ASDF also participated
in the HA/DR exercises, which was a multilateral exercise.
b. Multinational Tabletop Exercises, etc.
Initiatives have also been made to invite observers from
other foreign countries since September 2001, when
observers from eight Asia-Pacif c countries participated in
the fourth Japan-Russia Search and Rescue training hosted
by Japan.
In addition, the GSDF has hosted the Multinational
Cooperation Program in the Asia Pacif c (MCAP) every
year since 2002 as part of its multilateral cooperative
initiatives, inviting off cers from the respective countries
involved. In November 2014, 26 countries and organizations
including administrative agencies, the largest number in
the past, participated in the event, and conducted a group
discussion on the theme of the “Approaches to multilateral
joint operations in on-site humanitarian assistance/disaster
relief activities” and observed the disaster relief exercise
“Michinoku ALERT 2014.”

**4** **Promotion of Defense Cooperation and Exchanges**


In order to improve the security environment in the AsiaPacif c region, as well as across the globe, and ensure the
safety and prosperity of Japan, it is important to utilize
the Japan-U.S. Alliance as an axis, while developing
networks that combine bilateral and multilateral dialogue,
cooperation and exchange frameworks in a complementary
and multilayered manner. Accordingly, the MOD and the
SDF are conducting strategic defense cooperation and

**(2) Recent Major Achievements in Defense Cooperation**
**and Exchanges**

From the policy perspective, based on the agreement
made at the Japan-Australia Defense Ministers Meeting in
September 2012, personnel in charge from the Australian
Department of Defence were seconded to the Ministry of
Defense in Japan from February 2015, while personnel in
charge from the latter have been dispatched to the former
since June 2015, as part of human resources exchanges in the
capacity building support area[10]. The ministers also agreed
to establish vice-ministerial and working level meetings
as a framework for discussions on defense equipment and
technology cooperation. Furthermore, the Japan-Australia
Defense Cooperation Off ce was established at the Internal
Bureau since FY2014, in order to further enhance defense
cooperation between the two countries.
At the Japan-Australia Summit Meeting in July 2014,
Prime Minister Abe described the relationship between the
two countries as a “Special Strategic Partnership for the
21st Century” and signed the Agreement on the Transfer
of Defence Equipment and Technology between Japan
and Australia as well as approved the proposal for JapanAustralia defense cooperation that was agreed upon at
the f fth Japan-Australia “2+2” held in June 2014. This
proposal deepened the bilateral security and defense
relationship through the expansion and enhancement of
training and exercises, extension of human exchanges,
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, maritime
security, peacekeeping and capacity building as well as
Japan-Australia-U.S. trilateral cooperation. At the same
time, it also determined the commencement of negotiation
towards the development of an agreement to mutually
improve administrative, policy and legal procedures in
order to facilitate joint operation and training.
At the Japan-Australia Ministers Meeting in October
2014, the two ministers agreed to move ahead with
the proposed matters for the enhancement of JapanAustralia defense cooperation, which were approved by
the abovementioned joint declaration, as well as carrying
out a review to enhance Japan-Australia and Japan-U.S.Australia joint exercises going forward.
In May 2015, at the Defense Ministerial Talks held at
the timing of the 14th Shangri-La Dialogue, Minister of
Defense Nakatani informed the Australian side of Japan’s
decision to commence consultations with the Government
of Australia in order to examine in detail how specif cally
Japan could cooperate with Australia with regard to the
Australian Future Submarine Program. In response to
this, Minister for Defence Kevin Andrews expressed his


**(1) Significance of Defense Cooperation and Exchanges**
**with Australia**

Australia is an important partner for Japan in the AsiaPacif c region: Both Japan and Australia are allies of the
United States and share not only universal values[8] but
also strategic stakes and interests in the security f eld. In
particular, in recent years, as responsible countries in the
Asia Pacif c region, Japan and Australia are strengthening
mutual cooperation focused primarily on areas such as
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief activities. In
terms of Japan-Australia bilateral defense cooperation
and exchanges, the Japan-Australia Joint Declaration on
Security Cooperation, the f rst such joint declaration in
the realm of security with a country other than the United
States, was announced at the Japan-Australia Summit
Meeting in March 2007. It has been making steady progress
since then and has now reached the stage of more concrete
and practical cooperation.
In May 2010, the Japan-Australia Acquisition and
Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA)[9] and its Procedural
Arrangement were signed at the third Japan-Australia
Foreign and Defense Ministerial Consultations (“2+2”),
and they entered into force in January 2013. The ACSA
enabled the reciprocal provision of supplies and services
by the SDF and the Australian Defence Force (ADF)
during international peace cooperation and other activities.
Moreover, due to the Japan-Australia Information Security
Agreement that entered into force in March 2013 and
the foundations for sharing information that have been
developed between the two countries, it is expected that
bilateral cooperation will be further strengthened.
Furthermore, at the fourth Japan-Australia “2+2” in
September 2012, both countries issued a joint statement
entitled Common Vision and Objectives agreeing to further
expand defense cooperation between Japan and Australia.


8 Universal value: The National Security Strategy (approved by the National Security Council and the Cabinet on December 17, 2013) stipulates, “freedom, democracy, respect for fundamental human
rights, and the rule of law” as universal values.

9 Official title: The Agreement between the Government of Japan and the Government of Australia concerning reciprocal provision of supplies and services between the SDF of Japan and the ADF of Australia.

gratitude. The two ministers agreed on the necessity of
further strengthening Japan-Australia defense cooperation
through joint exercises and other initiatives. Furthermore,
at the Defense Ministerial Talks held in Tokyo in June
2015, the two ministers conf rmed the progress of defense
policies and defense cooperation between Japan and
Australia, and exchanged opinions regarding the future
defense cooperation between the two countries. The
ministers agreed that the two countries would continue
to hold close consultations regarding their bilateral
cooperation concerning the submarine program, strongly
oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by
force in the South China Sea, share grave concerns over
China’s attempts to reclaim land, and resolve the situation
in accordance with international law.
As for service-to-service exchanges, exchanges took
place between the Chief of Joint Staff and the Commander
of the Australian Defence Force in August 2014, the
GSDF Chief of Staff and the Australian Chief of Army
in September 2014, the MSDF Chief of Staff and the
Australian Chief of Navy in November of the same year,
and the ASDF Chief of Staff and the Australian Chief
of Air Force in February 2015, thereby promoting the
enhancement of mutual understanding, trust, and friendly
relations between the two countries.
As for the operational side, in 2012, the defense
authorities of Japan and Australia agreed to enhance
cooperation between SDF personnel and ADF personnel
in peacekeeping activities. Following this, two ADF
personnel have been working at a Coordination Unit (the
former Coordination Center) of the SDF since August
of the same year, providing liaison assistance for the
United Nations Mission in the Republic of South Sudan
(UNMISS). Moreover, through the international emergency
relief activities for the typhoon disaster in the Philippines
and the incident of the missing Malaysian airplane, the
strategic partnership between Japan and Australia has
been facilitated and consolidated. It is anticipated that
the cooperation between Japan and Australia facilitated
and strengthened in this way will contribute to the peace
and prosperity of the Asia-Pacif c region, while also
being conducive to fostering intraregional order through
cooperation and efforts to achieve international peace
undertaken by the United Nations in particular, such as
conducting U.N. peacekeeping operations.
As for the f eld of training and exercises, MSDF naval
vessels and aircraft participated in the Kakadu 14 multinational
naval exercise organized by the Royal Australian Navy
in August 2014. In addition, in October 2014, the MSDF
destroyer Kirisame participated in the Albany Convoy
Commemorative Event to celebrate its centenary[11].
Moreover, further reviews will be conducted on multifaceted equipment and technology cooperation such as


discussions on the possibility of Japanese cooperation for
the Australian Future Submarine Program.

Australia (Past Three Years))

**(3) Cooperative Relationship between Japan, the United**
**States, and Australia**

Japan and Australia are both allied with the United States,
and share universal values. They cooperate closely in order
to resolve the various challenges the Asia-Pacif c region
and the international community are facing. In order to
ensure the effectiveness and eff ciency of such cooperation,
it is important to promote trilateral cooperation with the
United States, whose presence is indispensable for regional
peace and stability.
The Security and Defense Cooperation Forum (SDCF),
which is a Director General-level meeting among the three
countries, has been held six times since April 2007, with
discussions taking place on such issues as coordinated
promotion of trilateral defense cooperation.
In May 2015, the Japan-U.S.-Australia Defense
Ministerial Talks were held at the timing of the 14th
Shangri-La Dialogue. The three Ministers exchanged
opinions regarding the regional security situations, joint
exercises, and defense cooperation through capacity building
assistance etc., and expressed their strong opposition against
any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force in
the East China Sea and the South China Sea. The Ministers
also expressed serious concern over China’s attempts to
reclaim land in the South China Sea.
In terms of training and exercises, the MSDF, the U.S.
Navy, and the Royal Australian Navy held joint exercises
in the sea and airspace around Guam in August 2014 and
around Hawaii in September 2014. In February 2015,

**(1) Significance of Defense Cooperation and Exchange**
**with the Republic of Korea**

The Republic of Korea (ROK) is the most important
neighboring country of Japan, and is extremely vital to
Japan in geopolitical terms. In addition, the two countries
share many strategic interests as allies of the United States.
Therefore, even if diff cult issues occasionally arise, close
collaboration between the two countries on the security
front has enormous signif cance for the peace and stability
of the Asia-Pacif c region.
Both Japan and the ROK are confronted with wideranging and complex security challenges including not
only the North Korean nuclear and missile issues, but also
counter-terrorism, peacekeeping operations, large-scale
natural disasters, antipiracy measures, maritime security
and so on. In order for the two countries to deal effectively

My name is Tara Boyd from the Australian Department of Defence. In February 2015, I entered the Japanese Ministry of Defense’s
International Policy Division as a Civilian Policy exchange offi cer and will work for 18 months in the capacity building offi ce.
I aim to contribute to expanding Australia-Japan people-to-people links and exchanges, through building enduring and productive
working relationships within the Japanese Ministry of Defense and the Japanese Self-Defense Forces. I hope to gain a broader
understanding of the Japanese Ministry of Defense and Japanese policy
processes, and assist in progressing mutually agreed defence cooperation.
Working in the Capacity Building Offi ce, I hope to improve exchanges of
information between Australia and Japan’s defence cooperation programs
in South East Asia and the Pacifi c and look for opportunities where we can
coordinate our efforts.
My experience in the MOD has been very enjoyable. I have been
fortunate enough to meet a number of seniors throughout the Department,
including Defence Minister Nakatani. All of the staff in the International
Policy Bureau have welcomed me and are happy to answer all of my

with such challenges, it is important to carry out more broadranging and concrete defense cooperation and exchanges.
With this in mind, at talks between the defense
ministers of the two countries held in January 2011, it
was agreed to further exchange views concerning ACSA
to enable reciprocal provision of water, food, fuel, and so
on in PKO activities, humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief, etc. Furthermore, it was also agreed that the defense
authorities of the two countries will exchange views on the
content of an information security agreement.

**(2) Recent Major Achievements in Defense Cooperation**
**and Exchange**

The Vice-Minister of Defense for International Affairs
visited the ROK in October 2014 to attend the international
conference “Seoul Defense Dialogue” organized by the
Ministry of National Defense of the ROK, and held a
Japan-ROK defense vice-ministerial meeting with ViceDefense Minister Baek Seung-joo. During the meeting, the
two off cials discussed Japan-ROK defense cooperation
and exchanges, and the Vice-Minister of Defense for
International Affairs introduced Japan’s initiatives for
national security such as the development of security
legislation and a review of the Japan-U.S. guidelines. In
April 2015, the Japan-ROK Security Dialogue at the
foreign and defense working-level was held in Seoul for
the f rst time in nearly f ve years where the security policies
and defense policies of the two countries were discussed.
Furthermore, in May 2015, Defense Minister Nakatani held
the f rst Japan-ROK Ministerial Dialogue in four years with
Defense Minister Han Min-koo at the timing of the 14th
Shangri-La Dialogue. The two ministers shared a common
recognition regarding the security environment surrounding
the two countries and exchanged opinions concerning the
defense policies of Japan and the ROK. They also consulted
each other regarding specif c defense cooperation and
exchange such as the participation of ROK naval vessels in
the SDF naval review and the implementation of the JapanROK joint search and rescue bilateral exercise within this
year, to which the ROK side responded positively.
Regarding training and exercises, the MSDF conducted
a Japan-ROK search and rescue bilateral exercise in the
waters west of Kyushu in December 2013, which further
enhanced coordination with the ROK Navy.

See Reference 61 (Recent Defense Cooperation and Exchanges with the
ROK (Past Three Years))


**(3) Cooperative Relationship between Japan, the U.S.,**
**and the ROK**

As both Japan and the ROK have alliances with the United
States, which are indispensable for the peace and stability of
the Asia-Pacif c region, trilateral cooperation among Japan,
the United States, and the ROK is continuously developing.
In July 2014, the Chief of Joint Staff of Japan, the
Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chairman
of the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff held the f rst chief-of-stafflevel meeting in Hawaii to discuss a broad range of issues,
including the increasingly strained security situation,
such as nuclear and missile threats from North Korea, and
measures to enhance trilateral coordination among Japan,
the United States and the ROK.
Furthermore, in December of the same year, the
defense authorities of Japan, the United States, and the
ROK signed the “Japan-U.S.-ROK Information Sharing
Agreement among the Defense Authorities”[12]. This
agreement has enabled the defense authorities from the
three countries to share security secrets regarding the threat
of the North Korea’s nuclear weapon and missiles.
Moreover, in May 2015, the Japan-U.S.-ROK
Defense Ministerial Talks were held at the timing of the
14th Shangri-La Dialogue, and a joint statement was
issued following discussion on the regional situations
including North Korea and cooperation between Japan,
the United States and the ROK. During the meeting, the
three countries once again emphasized their unchanged
stance of not condoning North Korea’s continued
possession and development of nuclear weapons and
delivery systems. At the same time, the three ministers
also decided to hold continuous dialogues regarding
trilateral security issues, and agreed to proceed with
trilateral cooperation on the basis of the common
interests in terms of democracy and security.
With regard to training and exercises, the MSDF
conducted Japan-U.S.-ROK search and rescue trilateral
exercises in the waters west of Kyushu in July 2014 to
strengthen the coordination and cooperation among the
three countries. In addition, the GSDF has been promoting
initiatives to enhance relationships, starting with personnel
at the junior off cer level who will become future leaders,
for example, through exchanges between junior off cers
held in December 2014 and April 2015. It is important
to further develop cooperative relations among Japan,
the United States, and the ROK in this way, in order to
contribute to the peace and stability of the region.

implementation of the following initiatives was agreed upon
in the memorandum of defense cooperation and exchanges
signed during the visit by Prime Minister Modi: high level
exchanges including regular ministerial meetings with the
ministers from the two countries, such as bilateral maritime
training consultation between the chiefs of staff of the
MSDF and the Indian Navy; cooperation in non-traditional
security areas; educational and scholarly exchanges;
defense equipment and technology cooperation, etc.
Furthermore, during the Japan-India Ministerial Meeting
held in March 2015, both ministers conf rmed that the
two countries would make efforts to realize early progress
regarding defense equipment cooperation, such as holding
discussions towards cooperation concerning the US-2
amphibian rescue aircraft, and the regular continuation of
not only bilateral maritime training but also cooperation
involving the ground and air forces.
With regard to exercises and training, the MSDF
participated in the third Japan-U.S.-India trilateral naval
drill conducted in waters south of Shikoku and east of
Okinawa in July 2014, which included anti-submarine
and on-site inspection exercises, as well as strengthening
the cooperative relationship with the U.S. Navy and the
Indian Navy.

**(1) Significance of Defense Cooperation and Exchanges**
**with India**

India, which is becoming increasingly inf uential against a
backdrop of what is projected to become the world’s largest
population as well as its high economic growth and latent
economic power, is located in the center of sea lanes that
connect Japan with the Middle East and Africa, making it
an extremely important country geopolitically for Japan.
Furthermore, Japan and India,which share universal values[13]
as well as have a common interest in the peace, stability,
and prosperity of Asia and the world, have established the
“Special Strategic and Global Partnership”. In this context,
Japan and India have also been strengthening their relations
in the area of security in recent years.
In October 2008, the prime ministers of Japan and
India signed the Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation
between Japan and India (Joint Declaration). India is the
third country with which Japan has signed a joint declaration
specializing in security, following those with the United
States and Australia. The declaration serves as a guideline
for cooperation in the f eld of security between Japan and
India, covering such areas as meetings and dialogues at
various levels such as the ministerial, vice-ministerial, and
staff level, as well as service to service exchanges including
bilateral and multilateral exercises, and educational and
academic exchanges.
Moreover, in December 2009, the prime ministers
of Japan and India formulated the Action Plan to advance
security cooperation between their two countries. The
Action Plan includes measures to promote cooperation
in maritime security such as cooperation in anti-piracy
activities and the holding of joint exercises at sea.


**(2) Recent Major Achievements in Defense Cooperation**
**and Exchanges**

At the Japan-India Summit in May 2013, the prime
ministers of Japan and India welcomed the expanding
defense relations between the two countries based on the
Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation between Japan
and India. At the same time, they signed the joint statement
in which they decided to conduct on a regular basis and with
increased frequency bilateral exercises between the MSDF
and the Indian Navy and to establish a Joint Working Group
(JWG) regarding the US-2 amphibian rescue aircraft.
In September 2014, Prime Minister Modi visited
Japan and a Japan-India Summit Meeting was held.
During the Summit Meeting, both prime ministers agreed
on the following approaches in order to upgrade the

and June 2014.
Taking into account the situation, in which the maritime
communication mechanism is becoming increasingly
necessary to avoid and prevent unforeseen consequences,
Japan has been encouraging the Chinese side to hold
discussions aimed at realizing the commencement of its
early operation. In response to this, China and Japan, at the
second meeting of the High-Level Consultation on Maritime
Affairs held in September 2014, agreed in principle to
resume discussions towards the early commencement of
the operation of the maritime communication mechanism
between the defense authorities. Furthermore, at the
Japan-China Summit Meeting held in November 2014,
the two leaders agreed to continue communication at the
working-level to realize the early commencement of the
operation of the maritime communication mechanism
between the defense authorities. In January 2015, the
fourth Working-Level Talks between Japanese and Chinese
defense authorities were held and both parties agreed
to further coordinate to make its title “Maritime and
Air Communication Mechanism.” They also discussed
matters relevant to this mechanism and technical issues,
and reached a certain level of shared understanding. In
addition, following necessary arrangements based on this
meeting, both sides agreed to strive to realize the early
commencement of the operation of said mechanism.
Moreover, a Japan-China Security Dialogue at the foreign
and defense working-level was held in Tokyo in March
2015, for the f rst time in approximately four years. In this
dialogue, opinions were exchanged regarding security and
defense policies as well as defense exchanges between
the two countries, while the two countries once again
conf rmed that they would make efforts to achieve the early
commencement of the operation of the “Maritime and Air
Communication Mechanism”
In regard to exchanges between troops, since 2007,
the Chinese Navy destroyer Shenzhen and training vessel
Zhenghe have visited Japan, while the MSDF destroyers
Sazanami and, most recently (in December 2011),
Kirisame have visited China. Moreover, in June 2010, the
Commanding General of the Jinan Military Region of the
Chinese People’s Liberation Army visited the GSDF Middle
Army, while in March 2012, the Commanding General of
the GSDF Middle Army visited the Jinan Military Region.
In April 2014, the Chief of Staff of the MSDF visited
Qingdao to attend the WPNS.
As part of initiatives to construct a “Mutually
Benef cial Relationship Based on Common Strategic
Interests,” it will be essential to strive to promote mutual
trust and understanding between Japan and China through
dialogue at various levels and in a range of areas, while also
actively promoting concrete cooperation in non-traditional
security areas, such as counter-piracy measures.

(Past Three Years))


**4** **Japan-China Defense Exchanges and Cooperation**

**(1) Significance of Defense Exchange and Cooperation**
**with China**

Stable relations between Japan and China are an essential
factor for the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacif c region.
From a broad and a medium- to long-term perspective,
Japan it is necessary for both countries to strive to construct
and enhance a “Mutually Benef cial Relationship Based
on Common Strategic Interests with China” in all areas,
including security. In particular, Japan will continue to
encourage China to play a responsible and constructive
role for the sake of regional peace, stability and prosperity,
to adhere to international norms of behavior, as well as
to improve openness and transparency with regard to its
advancing military capabilities in the context of its rapidly
increasing military budget.
As part of such efforts, through continuing and
promoting defense exchange, Japan will urge China to
demonstrate greater transparency in its military and security
policies, and promote measures such as establishing a
framework to avert or prevent unexpected situations.

**(2) Recent Major Achievements in Defense Exchange**
At the Japan-China Defense Ministerial Conference held in
June 2011, both Ministers agreed that promoting defense
exchange between Japan and China in a stable manner
through calm dialogues between the defense authorities
of the two countries will be the basis of the “Mutually
Benef cial Relationship Based on Common Strategic
Interests,” as well as lead to the strengthening of a friendly
and cooperative relationship between the two nations, and
the improvement of transparency in defense policies.
Japan and China are undertaking initiatives to avoid
and prevent unforeseen consequences, as an important
aspect of defense exchange. In particular, the construction
of a maritime communication mechanism between the
defense authorities of the two countries has become an
urgent matter. Accordingly, at the third JWG meeting held
in Beijing in June 2012, it was agreed that the maritime
communication mechanism would be constructed,
consisting of (1) annual meetings and expert meetings;
(2) high-level hotlines between the defense authorities of
Japan and China; and (3) direct communications between
naval vessels and aircraft. The objective of this was to avoid
unexpected collisions and prevent unforeseen consequences
in waters and airspace from escalating into military clashes
or political problems.
Since September 2012, however, defense exchange,
including this process, was stagnated and during this time a
number of incidents occurred. For example, a Chinese naval
vessel directed its f re-control radar at a JMSDF destroyer
in January 2013; China announced the establishment of the
“East China Sea Air Defense Identif cation Zone” based on
its own unilateral assertion in November 2013; and Chinese
fghter jets few excessively close to JSDF aircraft in May

**(1) Significance of Defense Exchange and Cooperation**
**with Russia**

Russia has great inf uence on the security of Europe, Central
Asia, and the Asia-Pacif c region, and is an important
neighboring country of Japan. It is therefore very important
for Japan to deepen defense exchanges and promote mutual
trust and cooperation with Russia. As Japan-Russia relations
have continuously been developing in a wide range of
areas, the MOD and the SDF have been steadily promoting
exchanges with Russia at various levels in accordance with
the Memorandum on Japan-Russia Defense Exchanges
drawn up in 1999 (revised in 2006). Security consultations
between foreign and defense authorities, and MilitaryMilitary Talks at the Director General-level and Councillor
level, as well as annual meetings based on the Japan-Russia
Agreement on Prevention of Incidents On and Over the
High Seas and bilateral search and rescue exercises are all
held continuously.
Regarding Japan’s relationship with Russia, the
Government of Japan is taking an appropriate response
whilst emphasizing the solidarity of the G7 (Group of
Seven)[14], taking the Ukrainian situation and other factors
into account. In light of this, the MOD has also taken this
into account in its exchanges with Russia. Simultaneously,
it is important to maintain constant contact at the working
level in order not to cause any unforeseen circumstances and
unnecessary conf icts with Russia, a neighboring country.
The MOD will consider these points in a comprehensive
manner and advance exchanges with Russia accordingly.

**(2) Recent Major Achievements in Defense Exchange**
At the Japan-Russia Summit Meeting in April 2013, the two
leaders aff rmed the importance of expanding cooperation
between Japan and Russia in the f eld of security and
defense, amid the growing role of the Asia-Pacif c region
and major changes in the international security environment,
and agreed to set up a meeting between foreign and defense
authorities at the ministerial level (the “2+2” Meeting).
At the f rst Japan-Russia “2+2” Meeting in November
2013, the two countries agreed to conduct ground-to-ground
unit exchanges between land forces and mutual dispatch of
exercise observers on a regular basis, and bilateral exercises
between counter piracy units of the MSDF and Russian
Navy in the Gulf of Aden, as well as regular hosting of the
Japan-Russia Cyber Security Meeting. In addition, JapanRussia bilateral talks were held at the Vice-Ministerial level
at the timing of the 14th Shangri-La Dialogue, which took
place in May 2015, and defense exchange between two
countries was discussed.


Southeast Asian countries are located in an area strategically
important for the maritime traff c for Japanese sea lanes, and
have been traditional partners for Japan for over 40 years,
having close economic relations with Japan. Promoting
trust and cooperative relations for issues in various security
challenges is meaningful for both Japan and Southeast
Asian countries. Moreover, the countries of Southeast
Asia are members of ADMM-Plus and ARF, so from the
perspective of stabilizing the security environment in the
Asia-Pacif c region, it is important to build relationships
of trust and cooperation with each country, with a view to
cooperation in multilateral frameworks.
As 2013 marked the 40th anniversary of ASEANJapan Friendship and Cooperation, Prime Minister
Abe announced the Five Principles of Japan’s ASEAN
Diplomacy[15] and visited all of the ten ASEAN countries. In
addition, Japan and ASEAN have been discussing defense
equipment and technology cooperation in non-traditional
security areas as a new f eld for cooperation.

Partnership underpinned by sea and democracy. Both
leaders welcomed the signing of the memorandum on
Cooperation and Exchanges in the f elds of defense f eld,
including capacity building, PKO activities, disaster
relief, defense equipment and technology, and highlevel exchanges. The two leaders also re-aff rmed their
intention to hold the “Japan-Indonesia Foreign and Defense

piracy off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.
To date, approximately 30 countries, including the
United States, have dispatched their warships to the waters
off the coast of Somalia and the Gulf of Aden. As part of
counter-piracy initiatives, the European Union (EU) has also
commenced Operation Atalanta since December 2009, and
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has been
conducting Operation Ocean Shield since August 2009, in
addition to the counter-piracy operations conducted by the
Combined Task Force 151 (CTF 151)[2] that was established
in January 2009. Each country continues to respond against
piracy in the waters off the coast of Somalia and the Gulf of


**1** **Counter-Piracy Operations**


Piracy is a grave threat to public safety and order on the
seas. In particular, for Japan, which depends on maritime
transportation to import most of the resources and food
necessary for its survival and prosperity as a maritime
nation, it is an important issue that cannot be ignored.

**(1) Basic Approach**
The Japan Coast Guard (JCG), one of the law enforcement
agencies in Japan, is primarily responsible for coping with
piracy. However, in cases where it is deemed extremely
diff cult or impossible for the JCG to cope with piracy by


Other United Nations Security Council resolutions calling for cooperation in deterring piracy are: Resolutions 1838, 1846, and 1851 (adopted in 2008), Resolution 1897 (adopted in 2009), Resolutions
1918 and 1950 (adopted in 2010), Resolutions 1976 and 2020 (adopted in 2011), Resolution 2077 (adopted in 2012), Resolution 2125 (adopted in 2013), and Resolution 2184 (adopted in 2014)

The Combined Maritime Force (CMF), the headquarters of which is located in Bahrain, announced the establishment of the CTF in January 2009 as a multilateral combined task force for counter

the Security of Japanese Flagged Vessels in Areas that
Are Highly Susceptible to Acts of Piracy came into force
on November 2013, which made it possible to have
security guards on board a Japanese ship provided certain
requirements are met, enabling them to carry small arms
for the purpose of security operations.

See Reference 11 (Main Operations of the Self-Defense Forces), Reference
12 (Statutory Provisions about the Use of Armed Force and Weapons
by SDF Personnel), Reference 68 (Outline of a Bill Concerning
Punishment of and Response to Acts of Piracy)

b. Activities by the Self-Defense Forces
(a) Participation in CTF 151
Due to the fact that the scope of the area susceptible to acts
of piracy is spreading to areas off the coast of Oman and
the Arabian Sea in recent years, there is a tendency that the
area of activity of the Combined Task Force 151 (CTF 151),
which conducts warning and surveillance activities (zone
defense), has been increasingly spreading. Furthermore,
the number of vessels that are directly escorted by the SDF
surface force per escort operation (a method in which the
destroyers guard the front and rear of the convoy) was
gradually reduced. In light of such a situation, in July 2013,
Japan decided to participate in CTF 151 to commence zone
defense in addition to direct escort missions as before, while
coordinating closely with the units of other countries that
are engaged in counter piracy operations in order to conduct
more f exible and effective operations. Following this, the
surface force started zone defense in December 2013. In
addition, air forces have been participating in CTF 151
since February 2014. This participation enabled the force
to acquire information that was previously not accessible.
Moreover, it became possible to conduct more f exible
warning and surveillance activities. For example, aircraft
can be deployed as needed even to areas that are highly
susceptible to acts of piracy, and as a result, coordination
between other countries’ units was further enhanced.
Moreover, on July 18, 2014, the SDF decided to
dispatch a commander and command center staff to
CTF 151. With SDF personnel serving as the CTF 151
commander and command center staff, it becomes possible
to facilitate coordination among units of countries involved
and more broadly gather information on the counter-piracy
operations of other countries off the coast of Somalia and
in the Gulf of Aden. This enables Japan to enhance the
effectiveness of the SDF’s counter-piracy operations through
strengthened coordination with the units of other countries
engaged in counter-piracy operations. The SDF dispatched
command center staff in August 2014, and dispatched a
CTF 151 commander as well as approximately another 10
command center staff in May 2015. No member of the SDF
has ever served as a commander of a multinational force
since the foundation of the SDF, and it is believed that this

Aden, recognizing it to be a serious concern.
Although the number of acts of piracy occurring
in the waters off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of
Aden has declined substantially in recent years, the root
causes of piracy such as poverty in Somalia have not been
solved. In addition, considering the fact that Somalia’s
capability to crackdown on piracy is also still not suff cient,
if the international community reduces its counter-piracy
efforts, the situation could be easily reversed. Moreover,
the Japanese Shipowners’ Association and other entities
are continuously requesting that the SDF continue their
counter-piracy operations. Therefore, there is no great
change in the situation in which Japan must carry out its
counter-piracy operations.

**(3) Japanese Initiatives**
a. Legislation Concerning Counter-piracy Operations
In March 2009, following the order for Maritime Security
Operations for the purpose of protecting Japan-aff liated
vessels from acts of piracy in the waters off the coast of
Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, two Japanese destroyers
began escorting Japan-aff liated vessels, while P-3C
patrol aircraft also commenced warning and surveillance
operations in June the same year.
In view of the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea, Japan subsequently enacted the AntiPiracy Measures Act[3] in July the same year in order to deal
appropriately and effectively with acts of piracy. This act
made it possible to protect the vessels of all nations from
acts of piracy, regardless of their f ag states. Moreover, it also
enabled the use of weapons to a reasonable extent, if no other
means were available, in order to halt vessels engaging in
acts of piracy, such as approaching civilian vessels.
Furthermore, the Act on Special Measures concerning


-----

In addition, the maritime patrol aircraft (P-3C)
conduct warning and surveillance operations in the f ight
zone that is determined based on coordination with the
CTF 151 headquarters. The P-3Cs conf rm any suspicious
boats, and at the same time, they provide information to the
destroyers, the naval vessels of other countries and civilian
vessels, responding by such means as conf rming the
safety of the surrounding area immediately, if requested.
The information gathered by SDF P-3Cs is constantly
shared with CTF 151 and other related organizations, and
contributes signif cantly to deterring acts of piracy and
disarming vessels suspected of being pirate ships.
Since commencing duties in June 2009, the aircraft
have f own 1,319 missions as of April 30, 2015, and their
f ying hours total 10,160 hours. Approximately 108,300
ships conducted identif cation tasks, and information was
provided to vessels navigating the area and other countries
engaging in counter-piracy operations on around 10,720
occasions. While other countries also dispatch patrol
aircraft, the activities conducted by the two MSDF P-3C
patrol aircraft account for approximately 60% of the
warning and surveillance operations in the Gulf of Aden.
Moreover, in order to improve the operational
eff ciency and effectiveness of the Deployment Air Force
for Counter Piracy Enforcement, the Ministry of Defense
(MOD) and the SDF have set up a base in the northwest
district of the Djibouti International Airport, which started
its operation in June 2011. In addition, GSDF personnel are
also involved in the Deployment Support Unit for Counter
Piracy, providing guards at operational bases and serving
at the headquarters of the Support Unit. Furthermore, the
ASDF has formed an airlift squadron to support these
activities and is engaged in transport missions. In December
2014, the ASDF, for the f rst time, dispatched an ASDF
medical off cer to the Support Unit.

(b) Achievements
At present, two destroyers have been dispatched, one
of which is in principle escorting civilian vessels back
and forth across the Gulf of Aden. The other destroyer is
conducting zone defense in the designated marine area
within the Gulf of Aden.
The direct escort method f rstly places the destroyer
and private vessels to be escorted at the assembly point,
one each designated at the eastern and western ends of
the Gulf of Aden. When the destroyer guards the convoy,
the helicopter carried on the destroyer also watches the
surrounding area from the sky. In this way, the ships take
around two days to sail approximately 900 km[4], all the
while making absolutely certain that the convoy is safe and
secure, day and night. Moreover, there are JCG off cers
aboard the destroyers[5]. As for zone defense, the destroyers
conduct warning and surveillance activities as they stay
within waters designated based on coordination with the
CTF 151 headquarters, and strive to ensure the safety of
the vessels.
As of April 30, 2015, 3,671 vessels have been escorted
under the protection of the destroyers. Not a single vessel
has come to any harm from pirates and they have all passed
safely across the Gulf of Aden.

See Fig. III-3-2-3 (SDF’s Counter-Piracy Operations)


During the non-monsoon seasons (March-May, September-November), when the area within which acts of piracy occur grows due to the calmer seas, the escort route is extended by approximately
200 km to the east.

**(4) Praise for Japan’s Endeavors**
The counter-piracy operations by the Japan SDF have
been highly praised by the international community, with
national leaders and others expressing their gratitude.
Moreover, the MSDF, which is engaging in counter-piracy
operations off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden,
has received many messages from the captains and ship
owners of the vessels that its units have escorted, expressing
their gratitude that the ships were able to cross the Gulf
of Aden with peace of mind and asking them to continue
escorting ships there. From the 1st to the 19th unit, a total
of 2,900 messages have been received.

**(2) U.S-Hosted International Mine Countermeasures**
**Exercise**

From October 27 to November 13, 2014, the MSDF
participated in multilateral mine countermeasures exercise
in the waters around the Arabian Peninsula hosted by the
U.S. Navy (Third International Mine Countermeasures
Exercise)[10]. This exercise has been conducted annually
since 2012, and Japan has constantly participated in it.
Participating in this exercise assists in the enhancement
of the tactical skills of the MSDF and the strengthening
of trust among the participating countries. The exercise
also contributes to the maintenance of maritime security,
while also contributing to the improvement of the global
security environment.

**(1) Training Conducted by the SDF and Counter-Piracy**
**Teams from Various Countries in the Gulf of Aden**

On September 25, 2014, in accordance with the agreement
made between Prime Minister Abe and NATO Secretary
General Rasmussen, the SDF deployed forces and NATO’s
counter-piracy unit, with the objective of enhancing their
cooperation and tactical skills required for counter-piracy
activities, implemented joint exercises for the f rst time
in the Gulf of Aden, followed by the second exercises on
November 26 of the same year[6]. In addition, on October
16, 2014, the SDF conducted their f rst joint exercises with
the EU surface forces, followed by the second exercises
on November 5, 2014, the third exercises on November
22, 2014, and the fourth exercises on March 6 in 2015[7].
Furthermore, the SDF also conducted joint exercises
with counter-piracy units from the Turkish Naval Forces[8]
on November 8, 2014 and another joint exercises with
Pakistani counter-piracy units on March 22, 2015[9].
These training exercises conducted in the Gulf of
Aden had a great signif cance in that they strengthened the
cooperation between the SDF and counter-piracy teams
from various countries, and contributed to the maintenance
of public safety and order on the seas.


**(3) Strengthening of Cooperation in Maritime Security**
**through Japan-Philippines Joint Training**

On May 12, 2015, the MSDF conducted a joint training
with the Philippine Navy in the waters west of Manila
with the aim of improving tactical skills and strengthening
cooperation between the two countries in the area of
maritime security[11]. This training was conducted based on
the agreement reached in the Japan-Philippines Defense
Ministerial Meetings held in January 2015, and during
the exercises the communication training using CUES
(Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea)[12] and tactical
maneuvering was conducted. The signif cance of the
training was that it contributed to the steady implementation
and further development of CUES, and also leading to the
strengthening of maritime security cooperation between
Japan and the Philippines.


6 On September 25, the Japanese destroyer Takanami and one P-3C aircraft conducted joint exercises with the Royal Danish Navy Combat Support Ship Esbern Snare from the Operation Ocean Shield
Unit including exercises in communication, tactical movement, and on-the-spot inspections. On November 26, the Japanese destroyer Takanami and the Royal Danish Navy Combat Support Ship
Esbern Snare from the above operation unit carried out their second joint exercises in communication, tactical movement, on-the-spot inspections, fi ring training, and takeoff and landing of helicopters
on the vessels.

7 The Japanese destroyer Takanami conducted the following joint exercises with the Naval Forces of different countries from the Operation Atalanta Forces: on October 16 exercises in communication,
tactical movement, on-the-spot inspections, etc., with the Italian Navy destroyer Andrea Doria; on November 5 exercises in communication, takeoff and landing of helicopters on the destroyers, and
exercises in close proximity with the German Navy frigate Lübeck; and on November 22 exercises in communication, exercises in close proximity, and takeoff and landing of helicopters on the vessels
with the Royal Netherlands Navy frigate “Van Spejik.” In addition, On March 6, 2015, the Japanese destroyer Harusame carried out joint exercises in communication, tactical movement, and takeoff
and landing of helicopters on the destroyers with the German Navy destroyer “Bayern.”

8 The MSDF destroyer Takanami carried out a bilateral joint exercise in communication and takeoff and landing of helicopters on the destroyer, and exercises in close proximity etc., with the frigate
Gemlic of the Turkish Naval Forces from CTF 151.

9 The MSDF destroyer Harusame carried out a bilateral exercise in communication and tactical movement with the destroyer Tariq of the Pakistan Navy from CTF 151.

10 Minesweeper tender Bungo and minesweeper Yaeyama conducted minesweeping training, submarine training, and other training.

11 MSDF, the destroyers “Harusame” and “Amagiri” of the 20th Counter-Piracy Marine Unit, and the frigate Ramon Alcaraz of the Philippine Navy participated in the training.

in order to contribute to the creation and development of
order on the ocean, it will ensure international collaboration
and promote international cooperation by making use of
fora such as multilateral and bilateral ocean conferences
to contribute to establishment of international rules and
consensus. In response to this, the MOD has been working
on cooperation for maritime security within the regional
security dialogue such as the ASEAN Defense Ministers’
Meeting (ADMM) Plus and the Inter-Sessional Meeting on
Maritime Security (ISM-MS).

Piracy is a grave threat to public safety and order on the seas. In particular, for Japan, which depends on maritime transportation to
import most of the resources and food necessary for its survival and prosperity as a maritime nation, it is an important issue that cannot
be ignored. While the number of incidents of piracy off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden has been decreasing, piracy has
not been completely eradicated. Therefore, it is necessary that Japan continue to respond to this issue in close cooperation with the
international community, and in particular with the naval forces of relevant countries. The MSDF has been conducting counter-piracy
operations since 2009. This year, which marks the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, from the perspective of the policy of
“Proactive Contribution to Peace,” the Government of Japan has made the decision to dispatch a commander and HQ offi cers to the
multinational unit headquarters for counter-piracy operations. Nearly half of the units and the headquarters of Combined Task Force 151
(CTF 151), where a member of the MSDF will serve as commander on this
occasion, is comprised of dispatched offi cers from the naval forces of other
countries. Since ancient times, we, the Japanese, have possessed a spirit of
“valuing harmony,” which respects the personalities of others and accepts
diversity. Making effective use of this unique Japanese characteristic and
collaborating with various units and partners, I will leverage the abilities of
each of these offi cers and partners in an effi cient manner.
The MSDF has grown to possess world-class maritime defense
capabilities. As responsible members of the international community,
countries with such a preeminent ability are required to fulfi l their
responsibilities accordingly. The MSDF will endeavor to complete this
mission, and continue to contribute to the peace and stability of the

The MOD and the SDF are proactively undertaking
international peace cooperation activities, working in tandem
with diplomatic initiatives, including the use of Off cial
Development Assistance (ODA) for resolving the fundamental
causes of problems such as conf ict and terrorism.

**Activities as One of the Primary Missions of the SDF**

The international peace cooperation activities undertaken
by the MOD and the SDF to date are as follows:
(1) international peace cooperation duties such as United
Nations peacekeeping operations (so-called UN PKO);
(2) international disaster relief operations to respond to
large-scale disasters overseas; (3) activities based on the
former Special Measures on Humanitarian Reconstruction
Assistance in Iraq; and (4) activities based on the former
Anti-terrorism Special Measures Act, and the former
Replenishment Support Special Measures Act. In 2007,
international peace cooperation activities, which used to
be regarded as supplementary activities[13] were upgraded,
and are now to be one of the primary missions of the SDF,
alongside the defense of Japan and the maintenance of
public order[14].

the MSDF and ASDF also have a designated stand-by unit,
which are always ready to be deployed.
In 2009, in order to participate more actively in U.N.
peacekeeping operations, Japan registered for the United
Nations Stand-by Arrangement System (UNSAS)[15],
which is a system used when the U.N. peacekeeping
operation is deployed. The objective of this system is
to make the process faster and smoother for the United
Nations to approach countries with a request for dispatch
when implementing peacekeeping operations. Japan has
registered its preparedness to provide SDF personnel
capable of providing logistic support for such activities and
operations as transportation, facilities, and HQ off cers[16].
The SDF is enhancing information-gathering abilities
and defensive abilities, which would enable SDF units to
complete their missions successfully and safely in the f eld.
In addition, in order to respond to various environments and
prolonged missions, the SDF is improving its capabilities
for transport, deployment, and information communication,
and is developing a structure of replenishment and medical
support for conducting smooth and continuous operations.
For example, the GSDF promotes initiatives to enhance the
conditions of the engineering unit, which is in high demand
in dispatch destinations, as well as improving protection
vehicles for transport that are used to protect people from
mines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). It also


**(2) Continuous Initiatives to Promptly and Accurately**
**Carry Out International Peace Cooperation Activities**

To be a proactive contributor to world peace, it is important
for the SDF to be fully prepared for any future operations.
For this purpose, the Central Readiness Regiment, a unit
which can be deployed swiftly whenever it is needed
and prepares the area for when the main unit arrives, was
established under the GSDF Central Readiness Force in
March 2008. Also, the GSDF has a rotational stand-by
unit, in which members are chosen from each area force

14 Missions defi ned in Article 3 of the SDF Act. The primary mission is to defend Japan. The secondary missions are the preservation of public order, activities in response to situations in areas
surrounding Japan and international peace cooperation activities.

15 This is a system adopted by the United Nations in 1994 in order to facilitate agile deployment for U.N. peacekeeping operations. The system involves member nations registering beforehand the scope
of the contribution that they can make, the number of personnel available for dispatch, and the time required for dispatch. When the United Nations approaches member nations with a request for
dispatch based on the registered information, it is up to each country to decide whether or not to actually dispatch personnel.

16 As of the end of March 2015, Japan has registered its preparedness to provide SDF personnel capable of providing logistic support for the following activities and operations: (1) medical care
(including epidemic prevention measures); (2) transportation; (3) storage (including reserve); (4) communications; (5) construction; (6) SDF units capable of logistic support for installation, inspection,

Japan. From the perspective of “Proactive Contribution to
Peace” based on the principle of international cooperation,
and in light of the appreciation and expectation from the
international community, Japan will actively engage in
international peace cooperation operations in a multilayered
way. In this regard, to maximize the effect of Japan’s
contribution to the international community, it is necessary
to deliberate more deeply about how the SDF should
contribute to the international community. Therefore,
regarding international peace cooperation operations and
other relevant missions, the SDF will continue proactively
taking part in peacekeeping activities utilizing their
accumulated experiences and advanced skills in f elds
such as engineering, as well as by expanding the dispatch
of SDF personnel to further responsible positions, such as
mission headquarters and the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations in the United Nations. As such, the SDF places
more emphasis on taking more of a leading role, and the
MOD will be proactively involved in Japan’s initiatives for
international contribution.

**(1) United Nations Mission in the Republic of South**
**Sudan (UNMISS)**

a. Background to the Decision to Dispatch Personnel to
UNMISS
The United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) was
established following the signing of the Comprehensive
Peace Agreement (CPA) between the Government of Sudan
and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army in
January 2005.
Beginning in October 2008, Japan dispatched
two GSDF off cers to UNMIS headquarters as staff
off cers (logistics and information staff off cers), but
UNMIS ended its mission in July 2011 following South
Sudan’s independence. Meanwhile, with the objective
of consolidating peace and security as well as helping to
establish necessary conditions for the development of
South Sudan, the United Nations Mission in the Republic
of South Sudan (UNMISS) was established. The Japanese
Government was requested by the United Nations to
cooperate with UNMISS, particularly through the dispatch
of GSDF engineering units. The Cabinet approved the
dispatch of two staff off cers (logistics and information
staff off cers) to UNMISS in November 2011, and in
December it decided to dispatch an SDF engineering unit,
former Coordination Center, and an additional staff off cer
(engineering staff off cer). In addition, the Cabinet also
approved the dispatch of one staff off cer (air operations
staff off cer).
The peace and stability of South Sudan is essential for
the stability of Africa as a whole, and it is a crucial issue that
should be dealt with by the international community. The

MOD and the SDF have accumulated experience through
past peacekeeping operations, and we believe that it is
possible for Japan to contribute to the peace and stability
of South Sudan by providing personnel-based cooperation
in infrastructure development, on which the United Nations
places great expectations.

b. Activities by the SDF
In January 2012, a Coordination Center (at the time) of
the SDF was established for the f rst time in the SDF’s
participation in U.N. peacekeeping operation, both in the
South Sudan capital city Juba and in Uganda, in order for
coordination for the activities conducted by the dispatched
engineering unit to begin. Since the commencement of
engineering activities within the United Nations facilities in
March 2012, the SDF has gradually expanded its activities
and has so far implemented engineering activities outside of
the United Nations facilities; projects in cooperation with
international organizations; and the “All Japan Project,”
which consists of efforts in collaboration with development
assistance projects. In May 2013, an SDF mobilization
order regarding the expansion of areas for operation was
issued, extending the SDF action areas from in and around
Juba to areas in Eastern and Western Equatoria[17]. Since
December 2013, due to the worsened security situation in
South Sudan, the dispatched engineering unit conducted
site preparation and maintenance activities for the internally
displaced peoples (IDPs) camp within the United Nations’
facility in Juba. In addition, they also provided assistance in
water supply activities and medical services, making use of


17 The SDF operation was planned to be conducted in Eastern and Western Equatoria as well in accordance with the needs of the United Nations. However, following the armed confl icts in South Sudan
that started in December 2013, it was decided that the dispatched units should focus on internally displaced persons support in Juba. For this reason, full-scale operations in Eastern and Western

the SDF management capabilities. On December, 2013, at
the request of the United Nations and other organizations,
Japan provided 10,000 bullets to the United Nations in
light of the urgent necessity and humanitarian nature of
the situation[18].
In May 2014, the United Nations Security Council
adopted Resolution 2155, which created the mandate of
shifting the UNMISS role from support for nation building
to the protection of civilians. Accordingly, the tasks of the
deployed engineering unit also shifted from infrastructure
development to mainly the provision of civilian protection
support for the U.N. troops. In addition, the deployed
engineering unit resumed road development and maintenance
outside the U.N. facilities in June 2014 as the situation in
Juba has become relatively stable. Furthermore, in November
2014, due to the United Nations Security Council’s decision
to adopt Resolution 2187, which extended the dispatch period
to UNMISS until May 30, 2015, Japan made changes to the
implementation plan of the International Peace Cooperation
Operations in South Sudan in February 2015 and extended
the dispatch period until August 31, 2015. In May 2015,
the Security Council adopted the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 2223 to extend the dispatch period of the
UNMISS for six months.

c. Cooperation Between Japan and Australia in UNMISS
To date, the MOD and SDF have cooperated closely with the
Australian Defense Forces in the f eld, such as in activities
to provide humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in
Iraq and United Nations peacekeeping operations. Both
Japan and Australia are also participated in UNMISS. In
August 2012, two Australian military personnel, who were
dispatched to carry out UNMISS duties, began to undertake
coordination activities with Japan’s Coordination Team.


**(2) Dispatch of SDF Personnel to the U.N. Department of**
**Peacekeeping Operations**

Currently two SDF personnel (one Division-Director level
and one operational-level) have been dispatched to the U.N.
Department of Peacekeeping Operations (U.N. DPKO) for
a two-year period to serve as the primary contact to and for
the military components within the off ce of operations and
to conduct force generation affairs for U.N. peacekeeping
operations.

**(3) Dispatch of Instructors to PKO Centers**
To support peacekeeping operation undertaken by African
and other countries, the MOD and SDF have dispatched
SDF personnel as instructors to the PKO centers to
contribute to the peace and stability by enhancing the
capacity of the centers. Starting with the deployment to the
Cairo Regional Center for Training on Conf ict Resolution
and Peacekeeping in Africa (CCCPA) in November 2008,
a total of 20 SDF personnel (17 deployments and eight
countries in total), including two female SDF off cers,
were dispatched over the period until May 2015. The SDF
personnel provided education based on their experiences
and lessons gained through SDF activities overseas, to
include lectures concerning the importance of building
relationships with local population in international peace
cooperation activities, and the international disaster
relief activities in which the SDF has engaged. In March
to May at 2014, a SDF personnel was dispatched to the
Ethiopian International Peacekeeping Center (EIPKTC)
as an international consultant for the f rst time besides
instructors, to provide advice on education and to design
curriculums for cultivating U N peacekeepers which were


highly appreciated by concerned local parties and students.
Furthermore, in March 2015, two SDF off cers were
dispatched to Centre for U.N. Peacekeeping (CUNPK)
in India, one as an evaluation off cer for evaluating the
educational content of the United Nations Peacekeeping
Special Military Female Military Off cers Course, and one
as an observer for this training.

**(4) Formulation of United Nations Military Unit Manuals**
**(UNMUM) for Engineers**

In order to play more of a leading role in international
peace cooperation activities, the MOD and SDF support the
formulation of the United Nations Military Unit Manuals
(UNMUM) for Engineers, which is initiated by the United
Nations Headquarters, and Japan also serves as a chair
country of the Engineering Unit Manual Working Group.
In March 2014, the f rst Engineer Unit Manual
Working Group was held in Tokyo, its second meeting
was held in Indonesia in June, and in August a f nal draft
was submitted. The manual will be distributed to the
member countries following the last adjustment within
the United Nations.

**(5) Partnership project for the Rapid Deployment of**
**Engineering Capabilities in Africa**

In some UN PKO missions in Africa, serious shortage of
personnel and heavy equipment was revealed. In order to
solve this problem, the Government of Japan is discussing
the possibility to prepare equipment such as heavy
equipment in advance at the United Nation’s facilities in
Africa. Together, the Government of Japan is also reviewing
the initiatives to support the dispatch of engineering units
by providing education on heavy equipment operation for
African Troop Contributing Countries (TCC).


**3** **International Disaster Relief Operations**

In recent years, the role of advanced capabilities in military
affairs has become more diverse, and opportunities for
its use in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief are
growing. To contribute to the advancement of international
cooperation, the SDF has also engaged in global disaster
relief operations proactively from the viewpoint of
humanitarian contributions and improvement of the
international security environment.
To this end, the SDF maintains their readiness to
take any necessary action based on prepared disaster
relief operation plans. Based on the consultation with the
Minister for Foreign Affairs, the SDF has been proactively
conducting international disaster relief operations,
which fully utilize their functions and capabilities, while
taking into consideration specif c relief requests by the
governments of affected countries and disaster situations
in these countries.

See Reference 70 (The SDF Record in International Peace Cooperation
Activities)


**(1) Outline of the Japan Disaster Relief Team Law**
Since the enactment of the Law Concerning the
Dispatchment of the Japan Disaster Relief Team (Japan
Disaster Relief Team Law) in 1987, Japan has engaged
in international disaster relief activities in response to
requests from the governments of affected countries and
international organizations. In 1992, the Japan Disaster
Relief Team Law was partially amended, enabling the
SDF to participate in international disaster relief activities
and to provide transport to its personnel and equipment
for this purpose.

See Reference 11 (Main Operations of the Self-Defense Forces)

**(2) International Disaster Relief Operations by the SDF**
**and SDF’s Posture**

Responding to specif c relief requests by the governments
of affected countries and the scale of disaster situations
in these countries, the SDF’s capabilities in international
disaster relief operations encompass (1) medical services,
such as f rst-aid medical treatment and epidemic prevention;
(2) transport of personnel and equipment by helicopter and
other means; and (3) water supply activities using waterpurifying devices. In addition, the SDF uses transport
planes and ships to carry disaster relief personnel and
equipment to the affected area.
The Central Readiness Force and regional units of the
GSDF maintain their readiness to ensure that they can carry
out international disaster relief operations in an independent
manner anytime the need arises. The Self Defense Fleet of

In November 2013, responding to a request from the
Government of the Philippines, which was suffering
catastrophic damage from a large-scale typhoon, to the
Government of Japan, and based on consultation with
the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Defense
decided to initiate international disaster relief operations
conducted by the SDF.
Following the 50 SDF members who were initially
dispatched, the MOD and the SDF formed the f rst ever
international disaster relief Joint Task Force[20] (with
approximately 1,100 personnel, the largest number to date).
During the month-long activities, a total of 2,646 people
received medical care; 11,924 people were vaccinated;
epidemic control operations were conducted in an
approximately 95,600 square meter area; approximately
630 tons of supplies were transported by aircraft; and a
total of 2,768 affected people were transported by aircraft.
The Joint Operations Center consisting of SDF
personnel which was also dispatched to the Philippines
took part in coordination activities with the Embassy of
Japan and JICA, with the related Filipino organizations
and other relevant countries. In addition, liaison off cers
were exchanged between the MSDF destroyer Ise and the
U.K. aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious for maintaining close
communication and coordination. Furthermore, based on
the Japan-US and Japan-Australia Acquisition and CrossServing Agreement (ACSA), supplies and services were
provided and received[21] between these countries for the
f rst time in international disaster relief operations.


SDF personnel, engaged in the activity, conducting search
and rescue operations 46 times and for approximately 400
hours. During this operation, MSDF P-3C patrol aircraft
received support including fuel from Australia based on
the ACSA.

**(5) International Disaster Relief Operations for the**
**Outbreak of Ebola in West Africa**

Following the outbreak reported by Guinea in March
2014, Ebola continued to primarily spread in the three
countries of Guinea and its neighboring countries Liberia
and Sierra Leone. The MOD dispatched a liaison off cer to
the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) located
in Germany in October 2014, in order to strengthen
the cooperation between Japan and the United States
regarding the response to the Ebola epidemic and to gather
information on the operational status of other countries
including the United States (the f rst was a member of the
ASDF, followed by a member of the GSDF). Furthermore,
in response to the request of the United Nations Mission
for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) for swift and
reliable transport of personal protective equipment that is
vital for safe medical practice, and based on consultation
with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of
Defense decided to conduct international disaster relief
operations on November 28, 2014.
The MOD and SDF organized the International
Disaster Relief Airlift Unit for West Africa and initially
four personnel were dispatched on December 5 to Accra,
the capital city of Ghana, to conduct coordination and
preparation tasks with relevant organizations such as
UNMEER. On December 6, the International Disaster
Relief Airlift Unit for West Africa (one KC-767 aerial
refueling/transport aircraft) was dispatched, and on
December 8, delivered approximately 20,000 items of
personal protective equipment to UNMEER.

**3** **Initiatives for Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-Proliferation**


Causing anxiety not only to Japan, but also countries across
the globe, North Korea’s launch of a missile, which was
purported to be a satellite, and its nuclear test demonstrated
that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
and missiles, which serve as their means of delivery, still
posed a pressing challenge to the peace and stability of the
international community.
Moreover, many countries are working on the
regulation of certain conventional weapons, while taking


into account the need to maintain a balance between the
humanitarian perspectives and defensive requirements.
One of the initiatives to deal with these issues is
the development of an international framework for arms
control, disarmament, and nonproliferation, and Japan is
playing an active role in this effort.

See Fig. III-3-2-10 (Framework for Arms Control, Disarmament and
Nonproliferation Relating to Conventional Weapons, Weapons of Mass
Destruction, Missiles and Related Materials, etc.)

Moreover, the whole of the Japanese government
is working on projects aimed at disposing of abandoned
chemical weapons in China, in accordance with the CWC,
and the Ministry has seconded nine personnel, including
GSDF personnel, to the Cabinet Off ce to work on this
project. Since 2000, GSDF personnel with expertise in
chemicals and ammunitions have been dispatched to
conduct excavation and recovery projects on a total of
14 occasions. In 2014, from August to September, seven
GSDF personnel participated in the project undertaken by
the Cabinet Off ce in Hunchun, in China’s Jilin Province.
In addition, the MOD has been cooperating in endeavors
aimed at increasing the effectiveness of regulations and
decisions, by dispatching off cials to major meetings such
as those of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC),
as well as international export control regimes in the form
of the Australia Group (AG) and the Missile Technology
Control Regime (MTCR). Furthermore, from 2011 to 2012,
one GSDF personnel was dispatched to the headquarters
of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the
f rst time.

See Reference 71 (Dispatch of Ministry of Defense Personnel to
International Organizations)


**1** **Initiatives Focused on Treaties Relating to Arms**
**Control, Disarmament, and Nonproliferation**

Japan actively participates in international initiatives for
arms control, disarmament, and nonproliferation in regard
to weapons of mass destruction, in the form of nuclear,
chemical, and biological weapons, as well as missiles as their
means of delivery and associated technologies and materials.
Japan has contributed personnel in this f eld, offering
its knowledge in the f eld of chemical protection from
the time when negotiations over the Chemical Weapons
Convention (CWC) were taking place, as well as dispatching
GSDF personnel who are experts on protection against
chemical weapons to the Organization for the Prohibition
of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which was established to
continuously implement verif cation measures following
the entry of the Convention into force. Furthermore, small
quantities of chemical substances subject to regulation
under the Convention are synthesized at the GSDF Chemical
School (Saitama City), in order to conduct protection
research. Thus, the school has undergone a total of nine
inspections since its establishment, in accordance with the
Convention regulations


-----

Üzümcü, Director-General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)

Taking into account both the humanitarian perspectives
and security needs, Japan has signed various conventions
on the regulation of conventional weapons, including the
Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of
Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed
to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate
Effects (CCW)[22]. Japan has also signed the Convention
on Cluster Munitions (Oslo Convention)[23], which was
adopted outside the framework of the CCW. With the entry
of this Convention into force in August 2010, the use of all
cluster munitions in the possession of the SDF immediately
became prohibited. While the Convention stipulates that,
in principle, all cluster munitions held by signatories be
destroyed within eight years of its entry into force, disposal
of such munitions possessed by the SDF was completed
on February 9, 2015. Furthermore, the MOD has actively
cooperated in the initiatives of the international community
that are focused on the problem of anti-personnel mines,
such as submitting annual reports that include data on
Japan’s exceptional stocks to the United Nations[24].
In addition, the MOD and the SDF participate
in various systems introduced by the United Nations
with the goal of increasing the transparency of military
preparedness and military expenditure (the United Nations
Register of Conventional Arms and the United Nations
Report on Military Expenditures), and as well as providing
the requisite reports, they dispatch personnel as needed to
governmental expert meetings held in order to review and
improve these systems.

**2** **International Initiatives Aimed at Nonproliferation**
**of Weapons of Mass Destruction**

**(1) Proliferation Security Initiative**
Harboring grave concerns about the development of
weapons of mass destruction and missiles by countries
such as North Korea and Iran, the United States announced
its Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI)[25] in May 2003,
and sought the participation of other countries therein.
Various initiatives are being undertaken based on PSI, such
as PSI interdiction exercises aimed at improving the ability
of participating countries to thwart the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and related items, and holding
meetings to consider issues on policies and legislations.
Since the 3rd PSI Meeting in Paris (September 2003),
the MOD and the SDF have collaborated with relevant
organizations and countries, dispatching MOD off cials and
SDF personnel to various meetings, as well as engaging in
ongoing participation in these exercises since 2004.
To date, Japan has twice hosted PSI maritime interdiction
exercises, working in partnership with relevant organizations,
including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the National
Police Agency, the Ministry of Finance and the Japan Coast

**(2) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540**
**Regarding the Nonproliferation of Weapons of Mass**
**Destruction**

In April 2004, the United Nations Security Council
unanimously adopted United Nations Security Council
Resolution 1540 regarding the nonproliferation of weapons
of mass destruction, which lays the foundations for the
international community to deal with the acquisition,
development, use, and proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction by non-state actors. Japan supports the adoption
of this resolution and hopes that all United Nations member
countries will comply with it.

**Japanese Citizens**


**Section 1 Collaboration with Local Communities**


**1** **Activities in Civic Life and Contributions to Society**


The MOD/SDF conducts activities to support the lives of
citizens in a range of f elds, in response to requests from
municipal governments and relevant organizations. Such
activities contribute to further deepening the trust in the
SDF, and provide SDF personnel with pride and conf dence.
The GSDF handles the disposal of unexploded
ordnance found throughout Japan. In FY2014, there were
1,560 such cases (approx. 57.1 tons). In particular, cases
handled in Okinawa Prefecture accounted for approx.
40% of the total cases. The MSDF clears and disposes
of underwater mines and other dangerous explosives, and
approx. 333 explosives (approx. 4.8 tons) were handled
in FY2014.
The SDF camps and bases allow the local residents
access to their facilities to the extent that it does not
interfere with unit activities, thus striving to foster friendly
interaction with local communities. The SDF also provides
transportation and other assistance at a variety of athletic
events. In addition, it supports regional medical treatment
efforts by providing general medical care at some SDF
hospitals as well as conducting urgent transport for
emergency patients from isolated islands. Furthermore,
based on national policy[1], the MOD and SDF will ensure

**2** **Cooperation from Municipal Governments and Other Related Organizations for the SDF**


Amid the harsh recruitment and employment situation,
the cooperation of local governments and relevant
organizations is vital to secure highly qualif ed personnel
and to assist the outplacement of uniformed SDF personnel
who retire in compliance with the early retirement system
of SDF. Furthermore, SDF camps and bases maintain
close relations with local communities, and therefore,


opportunities for local small and medium sized enterprises to
receive orders, while taking eff ciency into account, by such
measures as the promotion of separated/divided ordering[2]
and the securing of competition amongst companies within
the same qualif cation and grade divisions[3].

See Reference 72 (Activities in Civic Life), Reference 73 (Activities
Contributing to Society)

various forms of support and cooperation from the local
community are indispensable for the SDF to conduct
its diverse activities, including training exercises and
disaster dispatch. Moreover, units dispatched overseas
for international peace cooperation missions and other
duties receive support and assistance from the relevant
organizations for the procedures involved[4].


**3** **Activities for Securing Understanding and Cooperation of Municipal Governments and Local Residents**


Regional Defense Bureaus make efforts to build
cooperative relationships with local communities, through
collaboration with SDF units and Provincial Cooperation
Off ces. Specif cally, Regional Defense Bureaus provide
explanations and conduct coordination regarding defense


policies and the realignment of the U.S. Forces in Japan.
They also hold seminars on defense issues for local residents
and host Japan-U.S. friendship programs for citizens
who live near U.S. Forces facilities and areas in Japan,
U.S. Forces personnel, and their families. Furthermore,


The offi cial name of the policy is “The Contract Policy of the Government regarding Small and Medium Enterprises” (Cabinet decision on June 27, 2014)

For example, this is a method through which grouping of products etc. takes place when putting up the order for general competitive bidding, and then a successful bidder for the groups is decided.

Out of the bidding participation eligibility categorized into grade A-D, this refers to competition between grade C or D only, which comprise mostly of small and medium enterprises.

In addition to this kind of support, many letters of encouragement are sent from the public to the SDF personnel, which raise the morale of SDF personnel and reinforce their awareness of serving the

**4** **Measures to Promote Harmony between Defense Facilities and Surrounding Areas**


**1** **Scale and Features of Defense Facilities**

The uses of defense facilities[5] are diverse, and they often
require large volumes of land. Meanwhile, approx. 24% of
the land area of the facilities and areas (for exclusive use)
of the U.S. Forces in Japan is jointly used by the SDF under
the Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement. In addition,
problems related to restricted establishment and operations
of defense facilities have emerged due to the urbanization
of areas around many of the defense facilities. Also, another
problem is that frequent aircraft operations such as takeoffs
and landings cause noise and other issues, impacting the
living environment of local residential communities.

See Fig. III-4-1-1 (Status of SDF Facilities (Land Plots)), Fig. III-4-1-2
(Status of Facilities and Areas of U.S. Forces in Japan (Exclusively
Used Facilities))


**2** **Initiatives to Promote Harmony between**
**Defense Facilities and Surrounding Areas**

Defense facilities, as the foundation that supports the
defense capabilities of Japan and the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements, are indispensable for our country’s
security. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain conditions
for constant and stable utilization by ensuring harmony
between the defense facilities and the surrounding areas
as well as obtaining the understanding and cooperation of
the local residents. For that purpose, the MOD has taken
measures to promote harmony between defense facilities
and surrounding areas since 1974, based on the Act on
Improvement of Living Environment of Areas Around
Defense Facilities (Living Environment Improvement Act).

**(1) Measures of the Act on Improvement of Living**
**Environment of Areas Around Defense Facilities**

Based on the Act on Improvement of Living Environment of
Areas Around Defense Facilities, the MOD has implemented
various measures to prevent, alleviate, and mitigate
impediments such as aircraft noise in the surrounding
areas caused by the SDF or U.S. Forces activities, or by
establishing and operating defense facilities including
airf elds. Furthermore, taking into consideration the requests
of the relevant municipal governments, the MOD partially
revised the Living Environment Improvement Act in 2011,
and conducted a review to make it possible for the specif ed
defense facilities environs improvement adjustment grants
to be applied to so-called soft projects, such as aid for
medical expenses. In addition, the MOD added defense
facilities to be eligible for these grants. Focused work is
also underway to provide residential sound insulation and
efforts are being made to ensure its further progress.
Regarding the specif ed defense facilities environs
improvement adjustment grants, the MOD has implemented
initiatives such as the ‘PDCA Cycle’ process since April
2014, aiming to increase the effectiveness of these grants.

**Section 2 Public Relations Activities, Information Disclosure, and Related Activities**


**1** **Various Public Relations Activities**


As the activities of the MOD/SDF cannot be carried out
without the understanding and support of the Japanese
people, it is important to be proactive in undertaking easily
comprehensible public relations activities and to gain the
trust and cooperation of the public.
According to a “Public Opinion Survey on the Self
Defense Forces and Security Issues” conducted by the
Cabinet Off ce (in January 2015), the public expectations
and evaluations towards the SDF have been increasing


as the scope of MOD/SDF activities has expanded both
domestically and internationally. In light of this result,
the MOD/SDF will continue to conduct a variety of PR
activities, thereby striving to ensure better understanding of
the current status of the MOD/SDF.

**Reference 5** **Development of Seamless Security Legislation to**
**Ensure Japan’s Survival and Protect its People**

(Approved by the National Security Council and the Cabinet on July 1, 2014)
Since the end of World War II, Japan has consistently followed the path
of a peace-loving nation under the Constitution of Japan. While adhering
to a basic policy of maintaining an exclusively national defense-oriented
policy, not becoming a military power that poses a threat to other countries,
and observing the Three Non-Nuclear Principles, Japan has f ourished as
an economic power through continuous efforts of its people and built a
stable and aff uent livelihood. Japan, as a peace-loving nation, has also
been cooperating with the international community and international
organizations including the United Nations (U.N.), and has proactively
contributed to their activities, adhering to the Charter of the United
Nations. The course that Japan has taken as a peace-loving nation has
garnered signif cant praise and respect from the international community,
and Japan must continue these steps to further fortify such a position.
During the 67 years since the Constitution of Japan came into effect, the
security environment surrounding Japan has fundamentally transformed
and is continuing to evolve, and Japan is confronted by complex and
signif cant national security challenges. There exist no prospects of the
realization of the so-called formal “U.N. forces”, an ideal proclaimed in
the Charter of the United Nations. Moreover, even when considering only
the quarter-century since the end of the Cold War, the shift in the global
power balance, rapid progress of technological innovation, development
and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles,
and threats such as international terrorism have given rise to issues and
tensions in the Asia-Pacif c region, and there exists a situation in which
any threats, irrespective of where they originate in the world, could have
a direct inf uence on the security of Japan. Furthermore, in recent years,
risks that can impede the utilization of and free access to the sea, outer
space and cyberspace have been spreading and become more serious.
No country can secure its own peace only by itself, and the international
community also expects Japan to play a more proactive role for peace and
stability in the world, in a way commensurate with its national capability.
Maintaining the peace and security of Japan and ensuring its survival
as well as securing its people’s lives are the primary responsibility of the
Government. In order to adapt to the changes in the security environment
surrounding Japan and to fulf ll its responsibility, the Government, f rst and
foremost, has to create a stable and predictable international environment
and prevent the emergence of threats by advancing vibrant diplomacy with
suff cient institutional capabilities, and has to pursue peaceful settlement
of disputes by acting in accordance with international law and giving
emphasis to the rule of law.
Moreover, it is important to appropriately develop, maintain and
operate Japan’s own defense capability, strengthen mutual cooperation
with the United States, which is Japan’s ally, and deepen trust and
cooperative relations with other partners both within and outside the
region. In particular, it is essential to avoid armed conf icts before they
materialize and prevent threats from reaching Japan by further elevating
the effectiveness of the Japan-United States security arrangements and
enhancing the deterrence of the Japan-United States Alliance for the
security of Japan and peace and stability in the Asia-Pacif c region. On
that basis, in order to resolutely secure the lives and peaceful livelihood
of its people under any situation and contribute even more proactively to
the peace and stability of the international community under the policy of
“Proactive Contribution to Peace” based on the principle of international
cooperation, it is necessary to develop domestic legislation that enables
seamless responses.
In accordance with the basic orientation presented by Prime Minister
Abe at the May 15 press conference which took place after the report of


“the Advisory Panel on Reconstruction of the Legal Basis for Security”
was submitted on the same day, discussions have been repeatedly held
in the ruling parties and examination has also been conducted by the
Government. Based on the result of the discussions of the ruling coalition,
the Government will promptly develop domestic legislation necessary for
securing the lives and peaceful livelihood of its people, in accordance with
the following basic policies:
1. Response to an Infringement that Does Not Amount to an Armed Attack
(1) Considering the increasingly severe security environment
surrounding Japan, situations that are neither pure peacetime nor
contingencies are liable to occur, posing risks which could develop
into more serious situations. In such situations of infringement that
does not amount to an armed attack, it is an even more important
task to prepare and ensure seamless and suff cient responses to any
unlawful acts through closer cooperation between relevant agencies,
including police organizations, and the Self-Defense Forces (SDF),
premised on the basic allocation of their roles.
(2) Specif cally, in order to respond to various unlawful acts, under the
basic policy that relevant agencies including the police and Japan
Coast Guard are to respond in close cooperation in accordance
with their respective duties and authorities, the Government
will further strengthen necessary measures in all areas, which
include enhancing the respective agency’s response capabilities,
strengthening collaboration among agencies including information
sharing, examining and developing concrete response guidelines,
accelerating procedures to issue orders, and improving exercises
and training.
(3) As for accelerating procedures, in cases of responding to a situation
where an infringement from the outside that does not amount to
an armed attack occurs in areas surrounding remote islands,
etc., and police forces are not present nearby or police agencies
cannot respond immediately (including situations in which police
agencies cannot respond because of the weapons possessed by the
armed groups, etc.), the Government will thoroughly examine the
application of related provisions to order public security operations
or maritime security operations in advance and establish a common
understanding among relevant agencies. At the same time, in order
to avoid the spread of damages caused by unlawful acts while
internal administrative procedures are taken, the Government will
also make concrete considerations on measures for issuing orders
swiftly and accelerating procedures in light of circumstances.
(4) Moreover, for ensuring Japan’s security, it is important for the SDF
and the United States armed forces to respond seamlessly in close
cooperation to a situation where an attack occurs against the units of
the United States armed forces currently engaged in activities which
contribute to the defense of Japan and such situation escalates
into an armed attack depending on its circumstances. Assuming a
situation where an infringement that does not amount to an armed
attack occurs in the course of various peacetime activities carried
out in coordination between the SDF and the United States armed
forces and referring to the concept of “use of weapons” for the
purpose of protecting its own weapons and other equipment under
Article 95 of the SDF Law, the Government will develop legislation
that enables the SDF to carry out very passive and limited “use of
weapons” to the minimum extent necessary to protect weapons and
other equipment of the units of the United States armed forces, if
they are, in cooperation with the SDF, currently engaged in activities
which contribute to the defense of Japan (including joint exercises),
in line with the provisions of Article 95 of the SDF Law, premised
on request or consent by the United States.

2. Further Contributions to the Peace and Stability of the International Community
(1) So-called Logistics Support and “Ittaika with the Use of Force”
A. So-called logistics support is an activity that does not in itself
constitute a “use of force”. For instance, when international
peace and security are threatened and the international
community is united in responding to the situation in
accordance with a U.N. Security Council resolution, there exist
situations in which it is necessary for Japan to conduct such
support activities to armed forces of other countries carrying
out legitimate “use of force” based on the resolution. As for
Japan’s support activities, however, legal frameworks limiting
the area of such activities to “rear area” or so-called “noncombat
area”, etc. have been established in past legislations to ensure
that the issue of “ittaika with the use of force” (forming an
“integral part” of the use of force) does not arise, in relation to
Article 9 of the Constitution. This is intended to avoid Japan
from being legally evaluated as carrying out by itself the “use
of force” which is not permitted under the Constitution because
its support activities would form an “integral part” of the use of
force (“ittaika with the use of force”) by other countries.
B. The SDF, even under such legal frameworks, has steadily
accumulated its records of various support activities, and the
expectations to and trust in Japan have been growing. Amid a
major change in the security environment, from the perspective
of “Proactive Contribution to Peace” based on the principle of
international cooperation, it is necessary to enable the SDF
to play suff cient roles in wide-ranging support activities for
peace and stability of the international community. It is also
vital from the viewpoint of ensuring Japan’s peace and security
to enable the carrying out of such activities more than before
without hindrance.
C. The Government, while premising on the theory of so-called
“Ittaika with the use of force” itself, based on the accumulation
of discussions related to the “ittaika with the use of force” and
considering factors such as the SDF’s actual experiences to
date and the reality of U.N. collective security measures, no
longer takes the current framework uniformly limiting SDF’s
activities to such areas as “rear area” or so-called “non-combat
area” where the issue of “ittaika with the use of force” does
not arise. Instead, the Government takes the recognition that
Japan’s support activities such as supply and transportation
conducted at a place which is not “the scene where combat
activities are actually being conducted” by a foreign country
are not regarded as “ittaika with the use of force” by that
country. From the viewpoint of the following positions which
is based on that recognition, the Government will proceed
with developing legislation which enables necessary support
activities to armed forces of foreign countries engaging in
activities for ensuring Japan’s security or for peace and stability
of the international community:
(a) Do not conduct support activities in “the scene where
combat activities are actually being conducted” by armed
forces of a foreign country to which Japan provides support.
(b) Immediately pause or cease support activities if the place
where Japan is conducting support activities becomes
“the scene where combat operations are actually being
conducted” due to changes of the situation.
(2) Use of Weapons Associated with International Peace Cooperation
Activities
A. To date, Japan has developed necessary legislation and has
conducted international peace cooperation activities for over
20 years. In conducting such activities, Japan has limited the
right of SDF personnel to use weapons when engaging in
international peace cooperation activities to so-called selfpreservation type and protection of its own weapons and other
equipment since use of weapons associated with so-called
“kaketsuke-keigo” (coming to the aid of geographically distant
unit or personnel under attack) or “use of weapons for the
purpose of execution of missions” could constitute the “use
of force” prohibited by Article 9 of the Constitution, if such
use of weapons are directed against “a state or a quasi-state
organization.”
B. From the perspective of a “Proactive Contribution to Peace”
based on the principle of international cooperation, Japan
needs to enhance its efforts to promote the peace and stability
of the international community. To that end, it is important to be
able to participate in international peace cooperation activities
including peace keeping operations (PKOs) suff ciently and
proactively. Moreover, given that many Japanese nationals are
actively working overseas and face risks of being involved in
emergency situations such as terrorism, it is necessary to enable


subject to the consent of acceptance from the territorial State
which, under international law, has the obligation to extend
protection to foreigners who are within its territories.
C. Based on the above, the Government will proceed with
developing legislation based on the following positions in order
to enable the SDF’s use of weapons associated with so-called
“kaketsuke-keigo” and the “use of weapons for the purpose
of execution of missions” in international peace cooperation
activities that do not invoke “use of force” including U.N.
peacekeeping operations as well as police-like activities that
do not invoke “use of force” including the rescuing of Japanese
nationals with a consent from the territorial State, through
ensuring that “a state or a quasi-state organization” does not
appear as the adversary:
(a) As for U.N. peacekeeping operations, etc., since “consent
by the State to which the areas in which activities are
conducted belong” and “consent by the parties to the
conf ict to activities conducted” are necessary under the
framework of the Five Principles for PKOs, “a quasi-state
organization” other than parties to the conf ict who have
given consent of acceptance is, in principle, not expected
to appear as the adversary. For more than 20 years, this
has been demonstrated by Japan’s experience of U.N.
peacekeeping operations, etc. When the use of weapons
for the execution of missions is expected to exceed
selfpreservation and protection of its own weapons and
other equipment including when the SDF is tasked with the
maintenance of order such as the protection of population,
which is deemed as an important mission in recent U.N.
peacekeeping operations, it is necessary that consent from
the parties to the conf ict is stably maintained, especially
because of the nature of the activities.
(b) When the SDF units conduct police-like activities that
do not involve “use of force” including the rescuing of
Japanese nationals in a foreign country based on the consent
of the territorial State’s Government, it is natural that the
activities be conducted in the area within which the consent
of the territorial State’s Government is valid, i.e. the area
within which its authority is maintained. This means that no
“quasi-state organization” exists in that area.
(c) The Cabinet will make a decision on whether the consent
ofacceptance is stably maintained or the area within which
the consent of the territorial State’s Government is valid, etc.
based on deliberations etc. at the National Security Council.
(d) Use of weapons in these activities is subject to the inherent
constraint of the strict principle of proportionality which is
similar to the principle of police proportionality.
3. Measures for Self-Defense Permitted under Article 9 of the Constitution
(1) In order to adapt to the changes in the security environment
surrounding Japan and secure the lives and peaceful livelihood of
its people under any situations, the Government has examined what
constitutional interpretation would be appropriate, as suff cient
responses would not necessarily be possible if the constitutional
interpretation to date were maintained. In this regard, logical
consistency and legal stability are required for the Government’s
constitutional interpretation.
Accordingly, it is necessary to draw a logical conclusion for
securing the lives and peaceful livelihood of its people within the
limit of the basic logic of the interpretation of Article 9 of the
Constitution as expressed by the Government to date.
(2) The language of Article 9 of the Constitution appears to prohibit
“use of force” in international relations in all forms. However, when
considered in light of “the right (of the people) to live in peace”
as recognized in the Preamble of the Constitution and the purpose
of Article 13 of the Constitution which stipulates, “their (all the
people’s) right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” shall
be the supreme consideration in governmental affairs, Article 9 of
the Constitution cannot possibly be interpreted to prohibit Japan
from taking measures of self-defense necessary to maintain its
peace and security and to ensure its survival. Such measures for
self-defense are permitted only when they are inevitable for dealing
with imminent unlawful situations where the people’s right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness is fundamentally overturned due
to an armed attack by a foreign country, and for safeguarding these
rights of the people. Hence, “use of force” to the minimum extent
necessary to that end is permitted. This is the basis, or so-called the
basic logic, of the view consistently expressed by the Government
to date with regard to “use of force” exceptionally permitted under
Article 9 of the Constitution, and clearly shown in the document
“Relationship between the Right of Collective Self-Defense and the
Constitution” submitted by the Government to the Committee on


-----

This basic logic must be maintained under Article 9 of the
Constitution
(3) To date, the Government has considered that “use of force” under
this basic logic is permitted only when an “armed attack” against
Japan occurs. However, in light of the situation in which the
security environment surrounding Japan has been fundamentally
transformed and continuously evolving by shifts in the global
power balance, the rapid progress of technological innovation, and
threats such as weapons of mass destruction, etc. as mentioned at
the outset, in the future, even an armed attack occurring against a
foreign country could actually threaten Japan’s survival, depending
on its purpose, scale and manner, etc.
Japan, as a matter of course, will make the utmost diplomatic
efforts, should a dispute occur, for its peaceful settlement and take
all necessary responses in accordance with the existing domestic
laws and regulations developed based upon the constitutional
interpretation to date. It is still required, however, to make all
necessary preparations in order to ensure Japan’s survival and
protect its people.
Under such recognition and as a result of careful examination
in light of the current security environment, the Government has
reached a conclusion that not only when an armed attack against
Japan occurs but also when an armed attack against a foreign
country that is in a close relationship with Japan occurs and as
a result threatens Japan’s survival and poses a clear danger to
fundamentally overturn people’s right to life, liberty and pursuit of
happiness, and when there is no other appropriate means available
to repel the attack and ensure Japan’s survival and protect its people,
use of force to the minimum extent necessary should be interpreted
to be permitted under the Constitution as measures for self-defense
in accordance with the basic logic of the Government’s view to date.
(4) As a matter of course, Japan’s “use of force” must be carried out
while observing international law. At the same time, a legal basis
in international law and constitutional interpretation need to be
understood separately. In certain situations, the aforementioned “use
of force” permitted under the Constitution is, under international
law, based on the right of collective self-defense. Although this “use
of force” includes those which are triggered by an armed attack
occurring against a foreign country, they are permitted under the
Constitution only when they are taken as measures for self-defense
which are inevitable for ensuring Japan’s survival and protecting its
people, in other words for defending Japan.
(5) Moreover, even when “use of force” is permitted under the
Constitution, since they are carried out to secure the lives and
peaceful livelihood of the people, it is natural to require an assurance
of democratic control. The Government will stipulate in the draft
legislation that prior approval of the Diet is in principle required
upon issuing orders of operations to the SDF for carrying out “use
of force” permitted under the Constitution when an armed attack
occurs not against Japan but against a foreign country, in the same
manner as the procedures related to defense operations stipulated in
the current laws and regulations.
4. The Way Forward for Developing Domestic Legislation
When these activities are to be conducted by the SDF, the Cabinet shall
make a decision in accordance with deliberations, etc. at the National
Security Council. Including such procedures, domestic legislation
which serves as the legal basis is necessary in order to enable the
SDF to actually conduct such activities. Based on the basic policies
described above, the Government will herewith commence the tasks
of drafting legislation that enables seamless responses to any situations
in order to secure the lives and peaceful livelihood of its people.
The Government will give adequate consideration, and as soon as it
completes its preparation, it will submit the draft legislation to the Diet
for its deliberations.

forth this National Security Strategy (hereinafter referred to as the
Strategy”) in order to set out Japan’s fundamental policies pertaining to
national security.
The Strategy f rst elaborates on Japan’s peaceful orientation to date
and the policy of “Proactive Contribution to Peace” based on the principle
of international cooperation, examines its national interests and identif es
its national security objectives. Furthermore, the Strategy identif es
national security challenges Japan faces, taking into account the trends of
the security environment surrounding Japan. Finally, the Strategy presents
strategic approaches to be taken for national security, with diplomatic
and defense policies at their core, based on the recognition that in order
to overcome the challenges and achieve its objectives, Japan needs to
effectively utilize its diverse resources and promote comprehensive
measures, strengthen the domestic foundation for national security and
seek deeper understanding both at home and abroad, and advance efforts
at various levels in a multifaceted and coordinated manner.
The Strategy, as fundamental policies pertaining to national security,
presents guidelines for policies in areas related to national security,
including sea, outer space, cyberspace, off cial development assistance
(ODA) and energy.
Pursuant to the Strategy, and with the National Security Council (NSC)
serving as the control tower, as well as with strong political leadership, the
Government of Japan will implement national security policies in a more
strategic and structured manner through a whole-government approach.
In addition, when implementing policies in other areas, the
Government of Japan will give due consideration to national security
so that Japan can utilize its strengths, such as its diplomatic ability and
defense capability, in a smooth and fully-functional way as a whole, based
on the Strategy.
The Strategy will guide Japan’s national security policy over the next
decade. Through the implementation of concrete policies, the NSC will
regularly carry out systematic evaluation and upgrade the Strategy in a
timely and appropriate manner. Should any major changes in the situation
occur, the NSC will review this Strategy in consideration of the security
environment at the time, and make necessary revisions.
**II. Fundamental Principle of National Security**
1. Principles Japan Upholds
Japan is a country with rich culture and tradition, and upholds universal
values, such as freedom, democracy, respect for fundamental human
rights and the rule of law. Japan has a wealth of highly educated human
capital and high cultural standards, and is an economic power with
strong economic capacity and high technological capabilities. Japan
has achieved its development benef ting from an open international
economic system.
Surrounded by the sea on all sides and blessed with an immense
exclusive economic zone and an extensive coastline, Japan as a maritime
state has achieved economic growth through maritime trade and
development of marine resources, and has pursued “Open and Stable Seas.”
Japan has consistently followed the path of a peace-loving nation
since the end of World War II. Japan has adhered to a basic policy
of maintaining an exclusively national defense-oriented policy, not
becoming a military power that poses a threat to other countries, and
observing the Three Non-Nuclear Principles.
In addition, Japan has maintained its security, and contributed to
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacif c region, by enhancing its alliance
with the United States (U.S.) with which it shares universal values and
strategic interests, as well as by deepening cooperative relationships
with other countries. Moreover, Japan has contributed to the realization
of stability and prosperity in the international community through
initiatives for supporting the economic growth of developing countries
and for addressing global issues based on the principle of human
security, as well as through trade and investment relations with other
countries. In particular, Japan’s cooperation contributed to realizing
stability, economic growth and democratization in many countries,
especially those in Asia, including the member states of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Furthermore, as a peace-loving nation, complying with the United
Nations (U.N.) Charter, Japan has been cooperating with the U.N. and
other international organizations, and has actively contributed to their
activities. In particular, Japan has continuously participated in U.N.
peacekeeping operations (PKO), as the role of military forces diversif ed
after the end of the Cold War. In addition, as the only country to have
ever suffered atomic bombings in war, Japan has consistently engaged
in disarmament and non-proliferation efforts, playing a leading role in
international initiatives to realize “a world free of nuclear weapons.”
The course that Japan has taken as a peace-loving nation
has garnered signif cant praise and respect from the international
community, and Japan must continue these steps to further consolidate
such a position.
At the same time, surrounded by an increasingly severe security
environment and confronted by complex and grave national security


challenges, it has become indispensable for Japan to make more
proactive efforts in line with the principle of international cooperation.
Japan cannot secure its own peace and security by itself, and the
international community expects Japan to play a more proactive role
for peace and stability in the world, in a way commensurate with its
national capabilities.
Against this backdrop, under the evolving security environment,
Japan will continue to adhere to the course that it has taken to date
as a peace-loving nation, and as a major player in world politics and
economy, contribute even more proactively in securing peace, stability,
and prosperity of the international community, while achieving its own
security as well as peace and stability in the Asia-Pacif c region, as a
“Proactive Contributor to Peace” based on the principle of international
cooperation. This is the fundamental principle of national security that
Japan should stand to hold.
2. Japan’s National Interests and National Security Objectives
In order to achieve the fundamental principle of national security by
implementation of concrete policies, the Government of Japan needs to
def ne our national interests and national security objectives, examine
them in the context of the constantly evolving security environment,
and mobilize all possible means.
Japan’s national interests are, f rst of all, to maintain its sovereignty
and independence; to defend its territorial integrity; to ensure the safety
of life, person, and properties of its nationals, and to ensure its survival
while maintaining its own peace and security grounded on freedom and
democracy and preserving its rich culture and tradition.
In addition, Japan’s national interests are to achieve the prosperity
of Japan and its nationals through economic development, thereby
consolidating its peace and security. To this end, especially in the AsiaPacif c region, it is essential that Japan, as a maritime state, strengthens
the free trade regime for accomplishing economic development through
free trade and competition, and realizes an international environment
that offers stability, transparency and predictability.
Similarly, the maintenance and protection of international order
based on rules and universal values, such as freedom, democracy,
respect for fundamental human rights, and the rule of law, are likewise
in Japan’s national interests.
In order to safeguard these national interests and to fulf ll our
responsibility in the international community, Japan, adopting the
policy of “Proactive Contribution to Peace” based on the principle
of international cooperation as a fundamental principle, will seek to
achieve the following national security objectives.
The f rst objective is to strengthen the deterrence necessary for
maintaining its peace and security and for ensuring its survival, thus
deterring threats from directly reaching Japan; at the same time, if by
any chance a threat should reach Japan, to defeat such threat and to
minimize the damage.
The second objective is to improve the security environment of
the Asia-Pacif c region, and prevent the emergence of and reduce
direct threats to Japan, through strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance,
enhancing the trust and cooperative relationships between Japan and
its partners within and outside the Asia-Pacif c region, and promoting
practical security cooperation.
The third objective is to improve the global security environment
and build a peaceful, stable, and prosperous international community
by strengthening the international order based on universal values and
rules, and by playing a leading role in the settlement of disputes, through
consistent diplomatic efforts and further personnel contributions.
**III. Security Environment Surrounding Japan and National Security Challenges**
1. Global Security Environment and Challenges
(1) Shift in the Balance of Power and Rapid Progress of Technological
Innovation
Since the beginning of the twenty f rst century, the balance of
power in the international community has been changing on an
unprecedented scale, and this has substantially inf uenced the
dynamics of international politics.
The primary drivers of this change in the balance of power are
the emerging countries, including China and India. In particular,
China is further increasing its presence in the international
community. On the other hand, though its relative inf uence in the
international community is changing, the U.S. remains the country
that has the world’s largest power as a whole, composed of its soft
power originating from its values and culture, on top of its military
and economic power. Furthermore, the U.S. has manifested its
policy to shift its emphasis of national security and economic policy
towards the Asia-Pacif c region (the “rebalance” policy).
While the change in the balance of power has encouraged
the shift of the center of gravity of world politics and economy
from the Atlantic to the Pacif c, it has also been a reason for a
weakening leadership in global governance, as exemplif ed by the
stalled negotiations in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and


-----

of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC).
In addition, while the rapid advancement of globalization and
technological innovation has deepened interdependence among
states, it has also invited a change in the relative inf uence between
states and non-state actors, and brought about a complex impact on
the global security environment.
Sovereign states remain the principal actors in the international
community, and conf ict and coordination between states continue
to be the most signif cant factors affecting global stability. However,
as cross-border f ow of people, goods, capital, information and
other items have been facilitated more easily by the advancement
of globalization, non-state actors are beginning to play a more
important role in decision-making in the international community.
In addition, the advancement of globalization and technological
innovation bears negative impact. Terrorism and crimes committed
by non-state actors are posing serious threats to the security of any
country. Today, these threats, irrespective of where they originate
in the world, could instantly have a direct inf uence on the security
of Japan.
(2) Threat of the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and
Other Related Materials
As the only country to have ever suffered atomic bombings in war,
Japan best understands the tragedy of the use of nuclear weapons
and shoulders the responsibility to realize “a world free of nuclear
weapons.”
The issue of the transfer, proliferation, and performance
improvement of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), including
nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons (NBC), and their means
of delivery, such as ballistic missiles, remain major threats to Japan
and the international community. In particular, the issue of nuclear
and missile development by North Korea and the nuclear issue
of Iran continue to pose grave threats to peace and stability, not
only in each region but also in the entire international community.
Moreover, there remain concerns over the acquisition and the use of
WMD and related items by non-state actors, including international
terrorist organizations, against which traditional deterrence may not
function effectively.
(3) Threat of International Terrorism
Terrorist attacks continue to occur around the world, and the threat
of terrorism by international terrorist organizations remains serious.
The advancement of globalization has made it easier for those
organizations to share information and conspire within their own
organizations and with other groups, and to secure geographical
access and acquire arms.
International terrorism has spread and become diverse in its
forms. International terrorist organizations are utilizing politically
unstable and weakly governed countries and regions as bases
for operation and training for terror activities. The ideologies of
such terrorist organizations are also motivating other groups and
individuals to commit terrorist acts.
Some international terrorist organizations designate Japan
as their target. Terrorist attacks against Japanese nationals and
interests have actually taken place overseas. Japan and its people
face the threat of international terrorism both at home and abroad.
Diversity of nationality of the perpetrators and victims in
recent international terrorism cases has underscored the increasing
importance of combating terrorism through international cooperation.
(4) Risks to Global Commons
In recent years, risks that can impede the utilization of and free
access to global commons, such as the sea, outer space, and
cyberspace, have been spreading and become more serious.
While the seas are governed by international maritime law, in
particular the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS), there have been an increasing number of cases of
unilateral actions in an attempt to change the status quo by coercion
without paying respect to existing international law. With regard
to outer space and cyberspace, applicable norms remain to be
developed due to the different positions among relevant countries.
Against such a backdrop, not only for economic development
but also for the national security of each country, it has therefore
become even more important to promote appropriate international
rule-making over global commons and to make concerted efforts by
the international community while respecting such rules.
“Open and Stable Seas” constitute the basis for peace and
prosperity of the international community as a whole. In this regard,
each state has been tackling on its own or with others various
issues including piracy, unidentif ed vessels, illegal dumping,
contraband, human smuggling, maritime disasters, and the removal
of hazardous substances, for maintaining the stability of sea lanes
of communication.


interests between or among states over natural resources and the
security of respective states is increasing. As a result, there is a
growing risk of incidents at sea, and of possible escalation into
unexpected situations.
In the South China Sea in particular, disputes that have arisen
over sovereignty between coastal states and China cause concerns
over the maintenance of the rule of law at sea, freedom of navigation,
and stability in the Southeast Asian region. In addition, vulnerability
is also increasing in sea lanes of communication, spanning between
Japan and the Middle East, on which Japan is largely dependent for
its natural and energy resources, due to various problems including
regional conf icts and international terrorism in and around the
coastal states, as well as piracy. Therefore, advancing efforts to
address these issues is also important for securing the sea lanes.
Furthermore, the Arctic Sea is deemed to have enormous
potential for developing new shipping routes and exploration of
natural resources. While it is expected that states concerned work
together under relevant international rules, such potential could
provide new causes of friction among them.
While outer space has been utilized for civil purposes, from
security perspective, the importance of outer space has dramatically
increased in recent years, given its use for the reinforcement of
capabilities for information gathering and surveillance, as well as
for securing communication means for military purposes.
On the other hand, the congestion of outer space has heightened
as more countries utilize outer space. There exist risks that could
impede the continuous and stable use of outer space with an
increasing amount of space debris caused by anti-satellite tests and
satellite collisions amongst others, as well as with the development
of counter-space weapons.
Cyberspace, a global domain comprised of information systems,
telecommunications networks and others, provides a foundation for
social, economic, military and other activities.
Meanwhile, risks of cyber-attacks with the intent to steal
classif ed information, disrupt critical infrastructure and obstruct
military systems, are becoming more serious.
In Japan, with an increasing level of connecting networks of
social systems and various other elements, cyberspace is necessary
for promoting both economic growth and innovation through the
free f ow of information in cyberspace. Protecting cyberspace from
the above-mentioned risks is vital to secure national security.
(5) Challenges to Human Security
Globalization has enabled people, goods, capital, and information
to instantaneously move across borders in large quantities. As a
result, international economic activities have expanded, thereby
bringing prosperity to the international community.
In contrast, global issues that cannot be dealt with by a single
country —namely, poverty, widening inequality, global health
challenges including infectious diseases, climate change and other
environmental issues, food security, and humanitarian crises caused
by civil wars and natural disasters – are emerging as critical and
urgent issues of human security, threatening the very survival
and dignity of individuals. The Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), common goals in the development f eld to be achieved
by the international community, are not likely to be achieved in
some regions and sectors. In addition, the increasing demand for
energy, food, and water resources due to the population growth in
developing countries and the expansion of economic scale could
cause new conf icts.
These challenges could have repercussions on peace and
stability of the international community; therefore, Japan needs
to promote necessary measures based on the principle of human
security.
(6) The Global Economy and Its Risks
In today’s global economy, no economy is self-suff cient and
isolated from the world economy; thus the risk of the expansion of
an economic crisis from one country to the entire global economy is
growing. While this trend is conspicuous in the f nancial economy,
today, it is also witnessed in the real economy, as value chains
and supply chains are established across borders with increasing
international specialization.
Under these circumstances, there are concerns over f scal
problems and the slowdown in the growth of emerging economies.
In some emerging economies and developing countries, visible
signs of protectionism as well as reluctance towards the creation of
new trade rules have been observed.
Furthermore, in recent years, with the advancement of
technological innovation in energy sector, one has seen the rise
of resource nationalism in resource rich countries and growing
global demand, especially in emerging economies, for energy and
mineral resources, followed by the intensif ed competition for the


-----

environmental problems arising from climate change, there are
risks of crunches in global supply and demand as well as temporary
shortages of supply in food and water.
2. Security Environment and Challenges in the Asia-Pacif c Region
(1) Characteristics of the Strategic Environment of the Asia-Pacif c
Region
The shift in the global power balance has elevated the importance
of the Asia-Pacif c region in the international community. While
this shift provides opportunities for security cooperation, it has also
given rise to regional issues and tensions.
In particular, the region of Northeast Asia is home to a host
of actors, such as countries with large-scale military forces, or
those possessing nuclear weapons or continuing with nuclear
development. Yet a regional cooperation framework in the security
realm has not been suff ciently institutionalized. Countries in the
region have contrasting political, economic, and social systems,
and thus their security views are diverse, which constitutes another
characteristic of the strategic environment of this region.
In this context, in addition to the issues and tensions arising
from the shift in the balance of power, the Asia-Pacif c region has
become more prone to so-called “gray-zone” situations, situations
that are neither pure peacetime nor contingencies over territorial
sovereignty and interests. There is a risk that these “gray-zone”
situations could further develop into grave situations.
On the other hand, the Asia-Pacif c region is also witnessing a
rise in opportunities for bilateral exchanges and cooperation among
countries in the region. In addition, there have been multilateral
security dialogues, including the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF),
and bilateral and multilateral joint exercises. These initiatives
are contributing to the development of mutual understanding
and enhancement of joint response capabilities. Therefore, it
is important to further promote and develop these multilayered
initiatives for regional stability.
(2) North Korea’s Military Buildup and Provocative Actions
In the Korean Peninsula, the large-scale military forces of the
Republic of Korea (ROK) and North Korea confront each other.
While North Korea continues to face serious economic diff culties
without any improvement in its human rights situation, North Korea
heavily allocates its resources on military affairs today.
In addition, North Korea has enhanced the capability of WMDs
including nuclear weapons and that of ballistic missiles. At the
same time, North Korea has repeatedly taken provocative military
actions in the Korean Peninsula including the use of provocative
rhetoric, some of which are directed at Japan, thereby increasing
the tension in the region.
In particular, North Korea’s ballistic missiles development,
including those with ranges covering the mainland of the U.S.,
along with its continued attempts to miniaturize nuclear weapons
for warheads and equipping them to ballistic missiles, substantially
aggravate the threat to the security of the region, including Japan.
These concerns pose a serious challenge to the entire international
community from the viewpoint of the non-proliferation of WMD
and related materials.
As Kim Jong-un, First Chairman of the National Defense
Commission, has been making efforts to consolidate his regime, the
domestic situation in North Korea needs to be closely monitored.
Furthermore, North Korea’s abduction is a grave issue affecting
Japan’s sovereignty as well as the lives and safety of Japanese
nationals. It is an urgent issue for the Government of Japan to resolve
under its responsibility and a universal issue for the international
community to address as a violation of fundamental human rights.
(3) China’s Rapid Rise and Intensif ed Activities in Various Areas
There is an expectation for China to share and comply with
international norms, and play a more active and cooperative role for
regional and global issues. On the other hand, China has been rapidly
advancing its military capabilities in a wide range of areas through
its continued increase in its military budget without suff cient
transparency. In addition, China has taken actions that can be
regarded as attempts to change the status quo by coercion based on
their own assertions, which are incompatible with the existing order
of international law, in the maritime and aerial domains, including
the East China Sea and the South China Sea. In particular, China
has rapidly expanded and intensif ed its activities in the seas and
airspace around Japan, including intrusion into Japan’s territorial
waters and airspace around the Senkaku Islands. Moreover, China
has shown the move that appears to unduly infringe the freedom of
overf ight above the high seas by establishing its own “Air Defense
Identif cation Zone” over the East China Sea.
Such an external stance and military activities by China, coupled
with a lack of transparency in its military affairs and security policy,
have become an issue of concern to the international community


careful attention to this situation.
The relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait has
deepened in recent years, primarily in economic areas. Meanwhile,
the military balance between the two sides has been changing. Thus,
the cross-strait relationship contains both orientations towards
stability and potential instability.
**IV. Japan’s Strategic Approaches to National Security**
To ensure national security, Japan needs to f rst and foremost strengthen its
own capabilities and the foundation for exercising those capabilities. Japan
must also steadily fulf ll the role it should play and adapt its capabilities to
respond to future developments.
Enhancing Japan’s resilience in national security, through reinforcing
its diplomatic power and defense force, as well as bolstering its economic
strengths and technological capabilities, contributes to peace and stability
in the Asia-Pacif c region and the international community at large. This
belief forms the core of the strategic approaches in the Strategy.
Moreover, in order to overcome national security challenges and
achieve national security objectives, as well as to proactively contribute
to peace in cooperation with the international community, Japan needs to
expand and deepen cooperative relationships with other countries, with
the Japan-U.S. Alliance as the cornerstone. At the same time, Japan needs
to make effective use of its diverse resources and promote comprehensive
policies.
In light of this, Japan will take the following concrete strategic
approaches, centering on diplomatic policy and defense policy.
1. Strengthening and Expanding Japan’s Capabilities and Roles
(1) Strengthening Diplomacy for Creating a Stable International
Environment
The key of national security is to create a stable and predictable
international environment, and prevent the emergence of threats.
It is thus necessary for Japan to realize an international order and
security environment that are desirable for Japan, by playing an even
more proactive role in achieving peace, stability and prosperity of
the international community as a “Proactive Contributor to Peace”
based on the principle of international cooperation.
This strategic approach f rst requires the capability to analyze
the constantly changing security environment and the course that the
international community is taking. On top of this, Japan must have
the power to take the lead in setting the international agenda and to
proactively advance its national interests, without being conf ned
to a reactionary position to events and incidents after they have
already occurred. In doing so, it is necessary to enhance diplomatic
creativity and negotiating power to deepen the understanding of and
garner support for Japan’s position in the international community,
through effectively utilizing all strengths and features of the nation.
In addition, by highlighting Japan’s attractiveness, Japan needs
to strengthen its soft power that would benef t the international
community. Japan also needs to strengthen its capacity to promptly
and accurately identify the needs of Japanese nationals and f rms to
support their overseas activities. Furthermore, it is the responsibility
of Japan as a “Proactive Contributor to Peace” to make even more
proactive contributions to international organizations such as the
U.N., including through increasing the number of Japanese staff
in such institutions. In order to advance such vibrant diplomacy,
Japan will strengthen the institutional capabilities through which
it undertakes diplomacy. Such overall strengthening of diplomatic
capability is critical to ensure the security of Japan.
(2) Building a Comprehensive Defense Architecture to Firmly Defend
Japan
Japan’s defense force is the f nal guarantee of its national security
which deters direct threats from reaching Japan and defeats any
threat that reaches it. Japan will steadily develop its defense force.
To ensure peace and security in Japan amid the severe security
environment surrounding the country, Japan will eff ciently develop
a highly effective and joint defense force, adapting to the change
in strategic environment with consideration of its national power
and the political, economic, and social situations; and strive to
ensure operations with f exibility and readiness based on joint
operations. Japan will also advance not only the coordination within
the government, but also coordination with local governments
and the private sector. In doing so, even in peacetime, Japan will
maintain and improve a comprehensive architecture for responding
seamlessly to an array of situations, ranging from armed attacks to
large-scale natural disasters.
In developing the structure of the Japan Self-Defense Forces
(SDF), which plays a central role in the above-mentioned efforts,
Japan will develop a streamlined planning and programming
process, which includes the National Defense Program Guidelines
and the Medium Term Defense Program, based on the Strategy
to enhance its defense structure for deterrence and response to
various situations, prioritizing important functions from a joint and


-----

In addition, with regard to the threat of nuclear weapons, the
extended deterrence of the U.S. with nuclear deterrence at its core
is indispensable. In order to maintain and enhance the credibility
of the extended deterrence, Japan will work closely with the U.S.,
and take appropriate measures through its own efforts, including
ballistic missile defense (BMD) and protection of the people.
(3) Strengthening Efforts for the Protection of Japan’s Territorial
Integrity
To fully protect its territories, in addition to building a comprehensive
defense architecture, Japan will enhance the capabilities of the law
enforcement agencies responsible for territorial patrol activities
and reinforce its maritime surveillance capabilities. Furthermore,
Japan will strengthen coordination among relevant ministries and
agencies to be able to respond seamlessly to a variety of unexpected
situations.
Japan will also make a constant review on issues that are
relevant to ensuring the security of its territories, and take effective
measures.
In addition, Japan will proactively engage in the protection,
management, and development of remote islands near national
borders. Furthermore, from a national security viewpoint, Japan will
study the situation of land ownership in areas such as remote islands
near national borders and areas surrounding defense facilities, and
review issues related to the use of such land.
(4) Ensuring Maritime Security
As a maritime state, Japan will play a leading role, through close
cooperation with other countries, in maintaining and developing
“Open and Stable Seas,” which are upheld by maritime order based
upon such fundamental principles as the rule of law, ensuring the
freedom and safety of navigation and overf ight, and peaceful
settlement of disputes in accordance with relevant international law.
More concretely, Japan will take necessary measures to address
various threats in sea lanes of communication, including anti-piracy
operations to ensure safe maritime transport and promote maritime
security cooperation with other countries.
Japan will strengthen its maritime domain awareness
capabilities that are necessary for the above-mentioned measures, in
a comprehensive manner that involves the use of outer space, while
paying attention to the establishment of international networks.
At the same time, Japan will strive to enhance the frequency and
the quality of bilateral and multilateral cooperation on maritime
security such as joint exercises.
In particular, sea lanes of communication, stretching from the
Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz, the Red Sea and the Gulf of
Aden to the surrounding waters of Japan, passing through the Indian
Ocean, the Straits of Malacca, and the South China Sea, are critical
to Japan due to its dependence on the maritime transport of natural
and energy resources from the Middle East. In this regard, Japan
will provide assistance to those coastal states alongside the sea lanes
of communication and other states in enhancing their maritime law
enforcement capabilities, and strengthen cooperation with partners
on the sea lanes who share strategic interests with Japan.
(5) Strengthening Cyber Security
Japan as a whole will make concerted efforts in comprehensively
promoting cross-cutting measures to defend cyberspace and
strengthen the response capability against cyber-attacks, so as to
protect cyberspace from malicious activities threatening cyber
security; to ensure the free and safe use of cyberspace; and to guard
its critical infrastructure against cyber-attacks, including those in
which state involvement is suspected.
To this end, Japan will strengthen public-private partnership in
the areas of system design, development and operations based on risk
assessment, as well as identifying incidents, minimizing damages
and their expansion, and analyzing the causes of and preventing
similar incidents. In addition, Japan will comprehensively consider
and take necessary measures with regard to expanding the pool of
human resources in the security f eld, protection of control systems,
and response to the issues of supply chain risk.
Furthermore, Japan will strengthen inter-agency cooperation
and def ne the roles of relevant agencies so that it can reinforce
its capability to protect cyberspace and respond to incidents as a
nation at large. At the same time, Japan will promote a range of
measures, including enhancing the ability and function to oversee,
assess, apprehend, analyze, and internationally coordinate on cyber
incidents, as well as reinforcing relevant agencies in charge of those
tasks.
In promoting these measures, strengthening international
partnership in a wide range of areas is essential. For this, Japan
will take measures at technical and operational levels to enhance
international cooperation. Japan will also strengthen information
sharing and promote cyber defense cooperation with relevant


(6) Strengthening Measures against International Terrorism
Japan will f rst and foremost strengthen its domestic measures
against international terrorism such as ensuring the security of
nuclear facilities in Japan. Moreover, in order to ensure the safety
of Japanese nationals living abroad, Japan will strengthen such
measures as building a network where risk information held by
private sectors can be shared more effectively and eff ciently; and
reinforcing the structure for analyzing the situation of international
terrorism and overseas information-collecting capabilities.
(7) Enhancing Intelligence Capabilities
In order to appropriately support decision-making on national
security policies, Japan will fundamentally strengthen its
information-collecting capabilities from a diverse range of
sources, including human intelligence, open source intelligence,
signals intelligence, and imagery intelligence. In addition, Japan
will promote the utilization of geospatial intelligence with which
various types of intelligence are combined.
Moreover, Japan will enhance its intelligence analysis,
consolidation, and sharing capabilities by bolstering its human
resources, including developing highly-skilled intelligence experts.
Japan will thereby promote all-source analysis that makes use of
the array of information-collecting means at the Government’s
disposal.
Furthermore, Japan will operate the intelligence cycle
more effectively through the timely provision of materials and
intelligence to the NSC, which serves as the control tower of
foreign and security policy, and through the appropriate utilization
of intelligence in policy formulation.
In addition, under the Act on the Protection of Specially
Designated Secrets (*provisional English translation), Japan will
strengthen its counter intelligence functions by developing such
intelligence protection system in order to facilitate intelligence
functions throughout the Government.
(8) Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation
In cases that contribute to peace and international cooperation, there
are increasing opportunities to cooperate in a more effective manner,
including through the utilization and provision of heavy machinery
and other defense equipment carried to disaster-stricken countries
and sites by the SDF. Moreover, internationally, it has become
mainstream to participate in international joint development and
production projects in order to improve the performance of defense
equipment, while dealing with the rising costs of defense equipment.
In this context, from the perspective of “Proactive Contribution to
Peace” based on the principle of international cooperation, Japan is
required to contribute more proactively to peace and international
cooperation including through utilizing defense equipment, and
to participate in joint development and production of defense
equipment and other related items.
Against this backdrop, while giving due consideration to the
roles that the Three Principles on Arms Exports and their related
policy guidelines have played so far, the Government of Japan will
set out clear principles on the overseas transfer of arms and military
technology, which f t the new security environment. In this context,
considerations will be made with regard to def ning cases where
transfers are prohibited; limiting cases where transfers could be
allowed with strict examination; and ensuring appropriate control
over transfers in terms of unauthorized use and third party transfer.
(9) Ensuring the Stable Use of Outer Space and Promoting Its Use for
Security Purposes
The stable use of outer space is not only fundamental to the lives
of the people and the economy, but is also crucial for national
security. Japan will therefore maintain and improve the foundation
of science, technology and industry that supports the development
and utilization of outer space, and promote the utilization of outer
space from a security perspective.
In particular, Japan will engage itself in enhancing the functions
of information-gathering satellites and in making effective use of
satellites, including ones Japan possesses for the operation of the
SDF units, information-gathering and analysis, maritime domain
awareness, telecommunication, positioning, navigation and timing.
In addition, Japan will enhance a system for space situational
awareness.
Furthermore, Japan will promote the development and
utilization of outer space in a manner that contributes to national
security in the medium- to long-term, including the development of
technologies such as satellite manufacturing.
(10) Strengthening Technological Capabilities
The advanced technology of Japan constitutes the foundation of
its economic strength and defense forces, and is also a valuable
resource that the international community strongly seeks from
Japan. Therefore, Japan should encourage the further promotion of


-----

Japan s technological capabilities.
In promoting measures for strengthening its technological
capabilities from a national security viewpoint, Japan will constantly
grasp science and technology trends, including information on
technology development. Japan will also make effective use of
technology in the area of security, by combining the efforts of
industries, academia, and the Government.
Furthermore, Japan’s outstanding energy-saving and other
environment-related technologies play an important role in Japan’s
efforts to tackle global issues together with the international
community. Therefore, Japan will proactively utilize these
technologies in diplomacy as well.
2. Strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance
For more than 60 years, the Japan-U.S. Alliance, with the Japan-U.S.
security arrangements at its core, has played an indispensable role for
peace and security in Japan as well as peace and stability in the AsiaPacif c region. In recent years, the Alliance has also played a more
critical role for peace, stability, and prosperity in the international
community.
The Japan-U.S. Alliance is the cornerstone of Japan’s security.
Likewise, for the U.S., the Alliance has served as the core of its alliance
network with countries in the region, including the Republic of Korea
(ROK), Australia, Thailand, and the Philippines.
In this context, the Japan-U.S. Alliance has been serving as a
foundation for the U.S. strategy in the Asia-Pacif c region. Such close
alliance between Japan and the U.S. is underpinned by various factors,
including that the two countries share common strategic interests and
universal values, such as freedom, democracy, respect for fundamental
human rights, and the rule of law. Furthermore, Japan’s geostrategic
importance in supporting the U.S. engagement in the Asia-Pacif c
region underlies the close alliance of the two countries.
With the above-mentioned Japan-U.S. Alliance serving as the
foundation, the two countries have been working closely at various
levels, including at the summit and ministerial levels. The two countries
address not only bilateral issues, but also the situation in the AsiaPacif c region, including North Korea, as well as global security issues,
including counterterrorism measures and non-proliferation of WMD.
In the area of economy, Japan and the U.S. aim to achieve
economic prosperity in the Asia-Pacif c region in a rules-based and
transparent manner, including through the Trans-Pacif c Partnership
(TPP) negotiations, which will be mentioned later in this document.
Thus, Japan and the U.S. have persistently strengthened and
expanded their cooperation on a wide range of areas for peace, stability,
and prosperity of not only the two countries themselves, but also the
Asia-Pacif c region and the broader international community.
As Japan strengthens its efforts in security as elaborated
above, the U.S., based on its Defense Strategic Guidance emphasizing
a rebalancing towards the Asia-Pacif c region, aspires to enhance
its presence in the region and strengthen cooperation with its allies,
including Japan and its partners.
In order to ensure the security of Japan and to maintain and
enhance peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacif c region
and the international community, Japan must further elevate the
effectiveness of the Japan-U.S. security arrangements and realize a
more multifaceted Japan-U.S. Alliance. Based on this recognition,
Japan will undertake the following initiatives:
(1) Further Strengthening of Japan-U.S. Security and Defense
Cooperation in a Wide Range of Areas
Japan ensures its national security by enhancing deterrence through
the strengthening of its own defense capability, as well as by the
deterrence of the Japan-U.S. Alliance, including the extended
deterrence provided by the U.S.
Japan will work with the U.S. to revise the Guidelines for
Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation, through discussions on a variety
of issues such as the concrete manner of defense cooperation and
basic concepts of bilateral roles, missions, and capabilities (RMC),
while ensuring consistency with various policies in line with the
Strategy.
In addition, Japan will strive to enhance the deterrence and
response capability of the Japan-U.S. Alliance through the following
efforts: advancing joint training, joint intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (ISR) activities, and joint/shared use of facilities
by the SDF and the U.S. forces; working closely with the U.S. on
operational cooperation and policy coordination on issues such as
response to contingencies and the medium- to long-term strategy;
strengthening its security cooperation with the U.S. in such broad
areas as BMD, maritime affairs, outer space, cyberspace and largescale disaster response operations.
Moreover, in order to strengthen the foundation of the
Alliance, including enhanced interoperability, Japan will advance
multilayered initiatives with the U.S. such as defense equipment


(2) Ensuring a Stable Presence of the U.S. Forces
To maintain and enhance the Japan-U.S. security arrangements, it is
important for Japan to cooperate proactively with the U.S. to realize
the optimal force posture of the U.S. forces in the Asia-Pacif c
region. At the same time, it is also important for Japan to reduce the
impact of the U.S. forces in Japan on local communities, including
Okinawa, while maintaining and enhancing the deterrence of the
Japan-U.S. Alliance.
As part of this effort, while f rmly supporting the smooth and
effective stationing of the U.S. forces in Japan through various
measures, including Host Nation Support, Japan will steadily
implement the realignment of the U.S. forces in Japan including
the relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa to Guam in
accordance with the existing bilateral agreements. In addition,
Japan will further promote the joint/shared use of facilities by the
SDF and the U.S. forces, while taking into consideration relations
with local communities.
Furthermore, Japan will steadily implement measures to reduce
the impact on people living near the facilities and areas of the U.S.
forces in Japan. In particular, Okinawa Prefecture is situated in a
critically important location in terms of national security, and the
stationing of the U.S. forces there signif cantly contributes to the
deterrence of the Japan-U.S. Alliance. In the meantime, as a large
part of the facilities and areas for the exclusive use of the U.S. forces
in Japan are concentrated in the prefecture, Japan will make utmost
efforts to reduce the impact on Okinawa, including through the
relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma.
3. Strengthening Diplomacy and Security Cooperation with Japan’s
Partners for Peace and Stability in the International Community
As elaborated above, strengthening the Japan-U.S. alliance in all
its aspects, including in political, economic and security areas is
indispensable to improve the security environment surrounding Japan.
On top of that, Japan will engage itself in building trust and cooperative
relations with other partners both within and outside the Asia-Pacif c
region through the following approaches, as it plays an important role
in enhancing Japan’s security environment.
(1) Japan will strengthen cooperative relations with countries with
which it shares universal values and strategic interests, such as the
ROK, Australia, the countries of ASEAN, and India:
— The ROK is a neighboring country of the utmost geopolitical
importance for the security of Japan. Close cooperation with
the ROK is of great signif cance for peace and stability of the
region, including in addressing North Korean nuclear and missile
issues. For this reason, Japan will construct future-oriented and
multilayered relations and strengthen the foundation for security
cooperation with the ROK. In particular, trilateral cooperation
among Japan, the U.S. and the ROK is a key framework in realizing
peace and stability in East Asia. Japan will strengthen this trilateral
framework, including in cooperation on North Korean nuclear and
missile issues. With regard to the issue over the sovereignty of
Takeshima, Japan will make persevering diplomatic efforts, based
on the principle of peaceful resolution of conf icts in accordance
with international law.
— Australia is an important regional partner that shares not only
universal values but also strategic interests with Japan. In addition
to strengthening the mutually complementary economic relations
between the two countries, Japan will also strengthen its strategic
partnership by steadily sharing strategic recognition and advancing
security cooperation. Japan will also promote a wide range of
cooperation with Australia in its efforts to shape a regional order
in the Asia-Pacif c and to maintain and reinforce peace and stability
in the international community. In so doing, Japan will utilize
the trilateral framework among Japan, the U.S. and Australia, as
necessary.
— The countries of ASEAN, where economic growth and
democratization have been progressing and which embraces great
cultural diversity, are located in the critical areas of sea lanes of
communication of Japan. Japan will further deepen and develop
cooperative relations with the ASEAN countries in all sectors,
including politics and security based on the traditional partnership
lasting more than 40 years. Given the inf uence ASEAN has
on peace, stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacif c region as a
whole, Japan will provide further assistance to their efforts towards
maintaining and strengthening the unity of ASEAN. Furthermore,
Japan appreciates the efforts by the countries concerned to settle
disputes in the South China Sea not by force, but in accordance with
the law and rules, as shown in their efforts towards the formulation
of a Code of Conduct (COC) with China. Japan will support these
efforts so that an effective and legally binding code of conduct is
formulated.
— India is becoming increasingly inf uential, due to what is projected


-----

growth and potential. India is also geopolitically important for
Japan, as it is positioned in the center of sea lanes of communication.
Japan will strengthen bilateral relations in a broad range of areas,
including maritime security, based on the bilateral Strategic and
Global Partnership.
(2) Stable relations between Japan and China are an essential factor
for peace and stability of the Asia-Pacif c region. From a broad,
as well as a medium- to long-term perspective, Japan will strive
to construct and enhance a Mutually Benef cial Relationship Based
on Common Strategic Interests with China in all areas, including
politics, economy, f nance, security, culture and personal exchanges.
In particular, Japan will continue to encourage China to play a
responsible and constructive role for the sake of regional peace,
stability and prosperity, to adhere to international norms of behavior,
as well as to improve openness and transparency in its advancing
military capabilities through its rapidly increasing military budget.
As a part of such efforts, through continuing and promoting defense
cooperation, Japan will seek to urge improvement in transparency
of China’s military and security policies, and promote measures
such as establishing a framework to avert or prevent unexpected
situations. Furthermore, with regard to China’s recent attempts to
change the status quo by coercion based on its unique assertion in
its relations with neighboring countries, including Japan, Japan will
urge China to exercise self-restraint and will continue to respond
f rmly but in a calm manner without escalating the situation.
(3) With regard to the issues of North Korea, Japan will cooperate
closely with relevant countries to urge North Korea to take concrete
actions towards its denuclearization and other goals, based on the
Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks and relevant U.N. Security
Council (UNSC) Resolutions. Concerning Japan-North Korea
relations, Japan will endeavor to achieve a comprehensive resolution
of outstanding issues of concern, such as the abduction, nuclear
and missile issues, in accordance with the Japan-North Korea
Pyongyang Declaration. In particular, it is the basic recognition of
Japan that normalization of relations with North Korea will not be
possible without resolving the abduction issue. Japan will make
every effort to realize the safety and prompt return of all abductees
at the earliest possible date, investigate the truth regarding the
abductions, and transfer those who executed the abductions.
(4) Under the increasingly severe security environment in East Asia,
it is critical for Japan to advance cooperation with Russia in all
areas, including security and energy, thereby enhancing bilateral
relations as a whole, in order to ensure its security. Based on this
recognition, Japan will cooperate with Russia in securing peace and
stability of the Asia-Pacif c region. With regard to the issue of the
Northern Territories, the most important pending issue between the
two countries, Japan will vigorously negotiate with Russia under a
consistent policy of resolving the issue of the attribution of the four
islands and concluding a peace treaty.
(5) In promoting the efforts mentioned above, Japan will actively
utilize and engage in the further development of functional and
multilayered frameworks for regional cooperation, starting from
Asia-Pacif c Economic Cooperation (APEC), the East Asia Summit
(EAS), ASEAN+3, ARF, the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ MeetingPlus (ADMM-Plus), to the Trans-Pacif c Partnership (TPP) and
trilateral frameworks, such as Japan-U.S.-ROK, Japan-U.S.Australia and Japan-U.S.-India, as well as Japan-China-ROK, a
grouping of three large neighboring economic powers. In addition,
Japan will appropriately contribute to the creation of a more
institutional security framework in East Asia in the future.
(6) Japan will also cooperate with other partners of the Asia-Pacif c
region towards ensuring the stability of the region. These partners
include Mongolia, Central Asian countries, Southwest Asian
nations, the Pacif c Island Countries (PICs), New Zealand, Canada,
Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Chile. In particular, Japan will
deepen its cooperation with the PICs, which possess vast exclusive
economic zones and abundant maritime resources in the Pacif c
Ocean, in many areas including maritime cooperation, through such
fora as the Pacif c Islands Leaders’ Meeting (PALM).
(7) Furthermore, Japan will strengthen cooperative relations with
countries outside the Asia-Pacif c region that play an important role
in ensuring the peace and stability of the international community.
— Europe has the inf uence to formulate international public opinions,
the capacity to develop norms in major international frameworks
and a large economy. Japan and European countries, especially the
United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Poland, share
universal values of freedom, democracy, respect for fundamental
human rights and the rule of law, and principles such as market
economy. They are partners for Japan which together take a leading
role in ensuring the peace, stability and prosperity of the international
community. At a time when the power balance of the international


based on universal values and rules, to effectively address global
challenges, and to accomplish Japan’s initiatives for a peaceful and
prosperous international community, Japan will further strengthen
its relations with Europe, including cooperation with the European
Union (EU), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and
the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).
Japan has contributed to the democratization of East European
countries and Baltic countries, and will engage in strengthening
relations with them, as well as the Caucasus countries.
— Emerging countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, Argentina and
South Africa have been increasing their presence not only in the
international economy, but also in international politics. Japan will
therefore endeavor to further develop relations with such countries,
not merely on a bilateral basis, but in cooperative efforts in tackling
global challenges.
— Stability in the Middle East is an issue that is inseparably linked
to the stable supply of energy, and therefore Japan’s very survival
and prosperity. Given that the Gulf States are the largest source of
crude oil for Japan, in order to ensure the stability of the Middle
East, Japan will engage in constructing multilayered cooperative
relations with these countries, encompassing wide-raging economic
cooperation beyond resources and energy, as well as politics and
security. In this context, Japan will play a proactive role in the
resolution of major issues affecting the stability of the Middle East,
including the issue of democratization in Arab countries that stems
from the “Arab Spring,” the situation in Syria, Iran’s nuclear issue,
the Middle East peace process and peacebuilding in Afghanistan. In
the same vein, Japan will also collaborate with other countries that
play important roles in the Middle East, such as the U.S., European
countries, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
— Africa is a prospective economic frontier with abundant strategic
natural resources and sustained economic growth. In addition,
Africa has been increasing its inf uence in the international
community. Japan will continue to contribute to the development
and the consolidation of peace in Africa through various avenues,
especially through the Tokyo International Conference on African
Development (TICAD) process, and promote cooperation in
international fora.
4. Proactive Contribution to International Efforts for Peace and
Stability of the International Community
As a “Proactive Contributor to Peace” based on the principle of
international cooperation, Japan will play an active role for the peace
and stability of the international community.
(1) Strengthening Diplomacy at the United Nations
The U.N. was established with the UNSC as the core of a collective
security system for maintaining international peace and security.
However, the system has not fully functioned as originally
anticipated.
Nevertheless, the U.N. has taken the lead on various efforts for
peace and security of the world, backed by its legitimacy through
universal participation by the Member States and its expertise. In
particular, since the end of the Cold War, the role played by the
U.N. in maintaining international peace and security has continued
to grow.
Building on the invaluable experiences of having served on
numerous occasions as a non-permanent member of the UNSC,
Japan will further engage in active efforts by the U.N. for the
maintenance and restoration of international peace and security.
Moreover, Japan will actively contribute to diverse U.N.led efforts, including U.N. peacekeeping operations (PKO) and
collective security measures; diplomatic efforts such as preventive
diplomacy and mediation; seamless assistance efforts from the
phase of post-conf ict emergency humanitarian relief to recovery
and reconstruction, as well as assistance through the U.N.
Peacebuilding Commission.
At the same time, one must be mindful that realizing the
enhancement of the effectiveness and legitimacy of the U.N.,
including the strengthening of collective security functions, is
an urgent challenge. Therefore, Japan will continue to strive to
achieve the UNSC reform, including through an expansion of both
permanent and non-permanent categories, with Japan becoming a
permanent member of the Council.
(2) Strengthening the Rule of Law
Japan will continue to faithfully comply with international law as
a guardian of the rule of law. In addition, in order to establish the
rule of law in the international community, Japan will participate
proactively in international rule-making from the planning stage, so
that Japan’s principles and positions based on fairness, transparency
and reciprocity are duly ref ected.
Furthermore, Japan will actively support international judicial
organs in terms of both human capital and f nance. In addition,


-----

systems in other countries.
In particular, Japan will involve itself in realizing and
strengthening the rule of law relating to the sea, outer space and
cyberspace. While advancing policy coordination with countries
with shared interests, Japan will contribute proactively to the
development of international rules in the above-mentioned areas,
and to the promotion of conf dence building measures among
countries of mutual interest. In addition, Japan will further
strengthen capacity building efforts for developing countries in
these f elds. More concretely:
— With regard to the sea, Japan will promote regional efforts and play
a leading role in creating a shared recognition that reinforcement of
the maritime order governed by law and rules and not by coercion
is indispensable for peace and prosperity of the international
community as a whole.
— With regard to outer space, emphasizing the concept of ensuring
freedom of access and utilization of space, Japan will participate
proactively in the efforts to formulate an international code of
conduct that aims to prevent experiments of anti-satellite weapons
(ASAT) and avoid collision of satellites, and consequently strive to
ensure safe and stable use of outer space.
— With regard to cyberspace, based on the recognition of ensuring the
free f ow of information in cyberspace, Japan will actively cooperate
with like-minded countries in the development of international rules
on the premise that existing international law applies to cyberspace.
Japan will also vigorously support the capacity building efforts of
developing countries in this area.
(3) Leading International Efforts on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation
Japan, as the only country in the world to have suffered atomic
bombings in war, will continue its vigorous efforts to seek “a world
free of nuclear weapons.”
In view of the threat posed by progress in nuclear and missile
development by North Korea, and being mindful of future trends
in the balance of nuclear forces in the Asia-Pacif c region together
with the rapid advancement of military technologies, Japan will
lead international efforts on disarmament and non-proliferation,
including those towards the resolution of North Korea’s nuclear and
missile development issues and Iran’s nuclear issues, in a manner
consistent with the maintenance of the credibility of extended
deterrence under the Japan-U.S. alliance.
Furthermore, Japan will steadily implement export control
measures from a security perspective, including active participation
in the discussions in the international export control regime,
in coordination with other relevant countries, to prevent the
proliferation of arms, as well as dual use items or technologies to
countries of proliferation concern. In addition, Japan will engage in
international efforts on conventional weapons, such as small arms
and light weapons, and anti-personnel mines.
(4) Promoting International Peace Cooperation
Over the course of more than 20 years, Japan has dispatched SDF
units and other personnel to various regions on international peace
cooperation assignments, including in Cambodia, the Golan Heights,
Timor-Leste, Nepal, and South Sudan. These contributions have been
deeply appreciated both in Japan and by the international community.
Japan will further step up its cooperation with U.N. PKO
and other international peace cooperation activities with its
determination to contribute even more proactively to peace based
on the principle of international cooperation, taking into account the
appreciation and expectation Japan receives from the international
community. In addition, when participating in PKO, Japan will
endeavor to ensure effective implementation of its operations,
through coordination with other activities, including ODA projects.
Moreover, in order to implement seamless assistance in
security-related areas, including through further strategic utilization
of ODA and capacity building assistance, as well as coordination
with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Japan will develop
a system that enables assistance to potential recipient organizations
that cannot receive Japan’s assistance under the current schemes.
Furthermore, Japan as a whole will proactively engage in
training for peacebuilding experts and PKO personnel in various
countries. When engaging in such efforts, Japan will consult closely
with countries or organizations that have experience in the same
f elds, including the U.S., Australia and European countries.
(5) Promoting International Cooperation against International Terrorism
Acts of terrorism are unjustif able regardless of their motivation
and must be f rmly condemned. It is important for the international
community as a whole to take a f rm position against them.
Japan will promote international counter-terrorism efforts
with the international community for national security. Japan will
promote consultations and exchanges of views with other countries
on the situation on international terrorism and international


legal framework to stringently punish terrorists; and assistance
to developing countries which do not have suff cient capacity for
counter-terrorism and other measures.
Furthermore, Japan must be aware that terrorism and
transnational organized crime are closely linked in light of the
situation whereby the proceeds of organized crime, such as illicit
traff cking, the trade of arms and drugs, and kidnapping, form an
important source of funding for terrorists. Therefore, Japan will
enhance international cooperation and assistance for developing
countries to prevent and combat transnational organized crime.
5. Strengthening Cooperation Based on Universal Values to Resolve
Global Issues
Japan will endeavor to share universal values and reinforce an open
international economic system, which form the basis of peace, stability
and prosperity of the international community. At the same time,
Japan will advance the following measures towards the resolution
of development issues and global issues that could hinder peace and
stability of the international community, such as poverty, energy issues,
widening disparity, climate change, natural disasters, and food-related
issues, through the active and strategic utilization of ODA, as necessary.
(1) Sharing Universal Values
Through a partnership with countries with which Japan shares
universal values, such as freedom, democracy, respect for
fundamental human rights including women’s rights, and the rule
of law, Japan will conduct diplomacy that contributes to addressing
global issues.
The wave of democratization that began in the countries
of Eastern Europe and ASEAN in the 1990s and spread to the
countries of the Arab world at the beginning of the 2010s has
become an irreversible tide, coupled with the rapid development of
globalization and market-oriented economic reforms.
On the other hand, as was observed in the “Arab Spring,” the
process of democratization does not always proceed smoothly.
As an advanced, liberal and democratic nation, based on the
principle of human security, Japan will actively utilize its ODA in
supporting democratization, the development of legal systems, and
human rights, and contribute to the enhancement of the growing
international trend towards the protection of human rights, including
through dialogues in the area of human rights.
Japan will also engage proactively in diplomatic issues
on women, cooperating with the international community to
implement measures to empower women in conf ict prevention and
peacebuilding, and promote their social advancement.
(2) Responding to Global Development and Global Issues and
Realizing Human Security
Japan has garnered high recognition by the international community,
by its proactive contribution to global development in the world
through utilizing ODA. Addressing development issues contributes
to the enhancement of the global security environment, and it is
necessary for Japan to strengthen its efforts as part of “Proactive
Contribution to Peace” based on the principle of international
cooperation.
Against this backdrop, in order to contribute to the realization
of human security, Japan will utilize its ODA in a strategic and
effective manner. Japan will also strengthen efforts towards the
achievement of the MDGs, in areas such as poverty eradication,
global health, education and water, in cooperation with diverse
stakeholders, including international organizations and NGOs.
In addition, Japan will play a leading role in the formulation of new
international development goals, namely the post-2015 development
agenda. In this context, Japan will engage in further efforts in
mainstreaming the concept of human security in the international
community, building on our initiatives on this agenda to date.
Moreover, Japan will share the lessons learned and experiences
from the many natural disasters that it has experienced, including the
Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, the Great East Japan Earthquake
and Tsunami. Given the expanding scale, impact and frequency
of disasters globally, Japan will take the lead in international
cooperation on disaster management and ensure that communities
around the world have a high degree of resilience to disasters.
(3) Cooperating with Human Resource Development Efforts in
Developing Countries
Japan will invite a broad range of personnel from developing
countries, including eminent students and administrative off cials
who are expected to become future leaders. Japan will make use of
such opportunities to learn from their knowledge and experience, as
well as providing them with opportunities to be familiarized with
Japanese systems, technologies and expertise. Japan will further
promote human resource development in order to enhance mutual
understanding with Japan, and ensure that these personnel can
contribute to sustainable economic and social development in their


-----

Japan will engage in efforts to maintain and develop such human
networks to expand and reinforce the foundations of cooperation.
(4) Maintaining and Strengthening the Free Trade System
The expansion of the open and rule-based international economic
system, where Japan continues to be a major player, is essential for
the world economy and Japan’s economic prosperity.
In this regard, Japan will promote economic partnership,
including through the Trans-Pacif c Partnership (TPP), the
Japan-EU Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), a Free Trade
Agreement (FTA) among Japan, China and the ROK, and the
Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), so as to
achieve comprehensive and high-level trade agreements. Through
these efforts, Japan will contribute to the growth of the global
economy, which in turn, will also bring economic growth to Japan.
In addition, rule-making for trade and investment in the AsiaPacif c region through the above-mentioned efforts strengthens the
vigor and prosperity in the region, and has a strategic importance
of strengthening the foundation for a stable security environment
in the region.
It is expected that the conclusion of such 21st- century economic
partnership agreements will set new and attractive precedents of
trade liberalization, and promote global-scale trade liberalization in
the multilateral trade regime based on the WTO.
(5) Responding to Energy and Environmental Issues
The stable supply of energy and other resources is essential for
a vibrant Japanese economy and thus constitutes a challenge to
national security. Promoting measures such as the diversif cation
of supply sources is necessary for securing stable and low-cost
resource supply. Japan will actively utilize diplomatic tools to gain
the understanding of countries concerned in this course.
In the area of climate change, Japan will increase its engagements
towards emission reduction. Japan will implement a proactive
strategy for countering global warming (the Actions for Cool Earth
(ACE)) that utilizes its strengths in outstanding technologies on
environment and energy, and its assistance to developing countries.
At the same time, Japan will engage in establishing a fair and
effective international framework with participation by all countries.
Through these efforts, Japan will contribute to the achievement of
emission reduction by the international community as a whole and
to the resolution of climate change issues.
(6) Enhancing People-to-people Exchanges
People-to-people exchanges are signif cant as they enhance mutual
understanding and friendship between countries and solidify
national ties, while also helping to develop a stable and friendly
security environment by deepening an appropriate understanding
towards Japan in the international community.
In particular, Japan will implement measures to expand twoway youth exchanges and will seek to strengthen relations with
various countries into the future. For example, Japan has recently
marked 40 years of friendship and cooperation with ASEAN,
where regional integration is advancing while maintaining cultural
diversity. By further vitalizing exchange programs with ASEAN,
Japan will further promote mutual understanding.
Moreover, through events of interest for the world, such as the
2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo, Japan will promote
people-to-people exchanges through sport and culture, and will work
to construct and deepen friendly relations at the individual level.
6. Strengthening the Domestic Foundation that Supports National
Security and Promoting Domestic and Global Understanding
In order to fully ensure national security, in addition to strengthening
key capabilities with diplomatic power and defense force at their core,
it is vital to reinforce the domestic foundation for these capabilities to
be effectively demonstrated.
Furthermore, considering the importance of seeking a deeper
understanding for Japan’s security policies both at home and abroad to
ensure national security, Japan will advance the following measures.
(1) Maintaining and Enhancing Defense Production and Technological Bases
Defense production and technological bases are one of the important
factors that support defense forces through research, development,
production, operation and maintenance of defense equipment. In
order to develop, maintain and operate defense capability steadily
with limited resources in the medium- to long-term, Japan will
endeavor to engage in effective and eff cient acquisition of defense
equipment, and will maintain and enhance its defense production
and technological bases, including through strengthening
international competitiveness.
(2) Boosting Communication Capabilities
In order to promote its security policy from a medium- to longterm perspective, it is imperative that Japan proactively and
effectively communicate its policy to the world and its people, and
increase transparency. In this regard, it is necessary to deepen the


and build cooperative relations and trust with other countries.
To this end, with the Prime Minister’s off ce serving as the
control tower, Japan will enhance its public relations in an integrated
and strategic manner through a government-wide approach. Fully
utilizing various information technologies and diverse media,
Japan will also strengthen its information dissemination in foreign
languages.
In addition, the Government as a whole will cooperate with
educational institutions, key f gures, and think tanks. In doing so,
Japan will promote Japanese language education overseas, and
train personnel who are capable of contributing to strategic public
relations efforts and other areas.
At a time when the global security environment is becoming
more complex and diverse, it becomes increasingly likely for
countries to have conf icting interests. However, by precisely and
effectively communicating information on Japan’s position based
on objective facts, Japan will be able to gain accurate understanding
in the forum of international opinion, and contribute to the stability
of the international community.
(3) Reinforcing the Social Base
In order to support national security policy from a medium- to
long-term perspective, it is essential that each and every Japanese
national hopes to contribute to peace and stability in the region and
the world, and to the improvement of the welfare of humanity. In
addition, it is also essential that they perceive national security as a
familiar and immediate issue for them, and have deep understanding
of its importance and complexity.
To that end, the Government of Japan will promote the
following measures: foster respect for other countries and their
people as well as love for the country and region; raise awareness
with regard to security on such issues as territory and sovereignty;
and ensure the understanding and cooperation of residents around
defense facilities, which serve as the foundation for the activities of
the SDF and the U.S. forces in Japan, through advancing measures
that widen the understanding of the general public about the current
status of such activities.
(4) Enhancing the Intellectual Base
In order to invigorate a national discussion and debate and contribute
to high-quality policymaking on national security, Japan will seek
to enhance and strengthen education on security-related subjects
at institutions of higher education, including through the dispatch
of off cials of relevant ministries. In addition, Japan will promote
practical research on national security, and engage in deepening
exchanges among the Government, higher education institutions
and think tanks, thereby promoting the sharing of insight and
knowledge.
Furthermore, Japan will promote the creation of experts and
government off cials that can make practical and constructive
contributions to national security policy, thus broadening the pool
of experts on national security.

**Reference 15** **NATIONAL DEFENSE PROGRAM GUIDELINES for FY2014**
**and beyond**

(Approved by the National Security Council
and the Cabinet on December 17, 2013)
Stipulations regarding the National Defense Program Guidelines for
FY2014 and Beyond are included in the reference.
Accordingly, the National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2011
and Beyond (approved by the Cabinet on December 17, 2010) are
discontinued as of the end of FY2013.
(Additional reference)
National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2014 and beyond
**I. NDPG’s Objective**
In light of the current security environment surrounding Japan, the
Government of Japan sets out the “National Defense Program Guidelines
for FY2014 and beyond” as new guidelines for Japan’s national defense,
based on “Defense Capability Build-up in FY2013” (approved by the
Security Council and the Cabinet on January 25, 2013) and the “National
Security Strategy” (approved by the National Security Council and the
Cabinet on December 17, 2013).
**II. Security Environment Surrounding Japan**
1. As interdependence among countries expands and deepens, there is a
growing risk that unrest in the global security environment or a security
problem in a single country or region could immediately develop into
a security challenge or destabilizing factor for the entire international
community. The multi-polarization of the world continues as a result
of shifts in the balance of power due to the further development of
countries such as China and India and the relative change of inf uence
of the United States (U.S.). At the same time, the U.S. is expected to
continue to play the role in maintaining world peace and stability as it


-----

retains the largest national power.
There are ongoing regional conf icts involving various countries as
well as an increase in the number of so-called “gray-zone” situations,
that is, neither pure peacetime nor contingencies over territory,
sovereignty and maritime economic interests.
The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD)
and ballistic missiles continues to be a deep concern despite nonproliferation efforts by the international community. The presence of
countries with weak governance and failed states feeds the expansion
and spread of international terrorism. These problems continue to pose
imminent security challenges.
In the maritime domain, piracy acts have taken place in various
parts of the world, and there have been cases where coastal states
unilaterally asserted their rights and took action based on their own
assertion concerning international maritime law, thereby unduly
infringing the freedom of the high seas.
Securing the stable use of outer space and cyberspace as global
commons is becoming a signif cant security challenge for the
international community including Japan against the backdrop of rapid
technology innovation. In addition, military strategies and military
balance in the future are anticipated to be signif cantly affected by
the progress and proliferation of technologies such as those related to
precision guided munitions, unmanned vehicles, stealth capability and
nanotechnology.
2. In the Asia-Pacif c region, including areas surrounding Japan, countries
are enhancing and strengthening their cooperative relationships to
resolve security challenges. Specif c and practical cooperation and
collaboration have progressed to settle challenges particularly in nontraditional security f elds. In the meantime, gray-zone situations over
territory, sovereignty and maritime economic interests tend to linger,
raising concerns that they may develop into more serious situations.
North Korea is military-focused and deploys a massive military
force. It is also proceeding with the development, deployment and
proliferation of WMDs including nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles
which may be used to deliver such weapons, and it maintains a largescale special operations force. Through these activities, North Korea is
maintaining and strengthening its asymmetrical military capabilities.
North Korea has also repeatedly heightened tension in the region
by conducting military provocations in the Korean Peninsula and by
escalating its provocative rhetoric and behavior against Japan and
other countries. Such North Korean military trend constitutes a serious
destabilizing factor to the security not only of Japan but of the entire
region and the international community. Therefore, Japan needs to pay
utmost attention to such activities.
In particular, North Korea’s ballistic missile development has
presumably entered a new stage, as technological improvements
have been made to extend the range and increase the accuracy of
its missiles through a series of missile launches. Also, North Korea
has conducted nuclear tests in def ance of calls for restraint from the
international community, so the possibility cannot be ruled out that
it has successfully miniaturized nuclear weapons for warheads and
equipped them on ballistic missiles. North Korea’s nuclear and missile
development, coupled with its provocative rhetoric and behavior, such
as suggesting a missile attack on Japan, pose a serious and imminent
threat to Japan’s security.
As for China, while it is greatly expected to play an active role
in a more cooperative manner in the region and the world, it has been
continuously increasing its defense expenditures and has been rapidly
reinforcing its military in a wide range of areas. As part of such effort,
China is believed to be making efforts to strengthen its asymmetrical
military capabilities to prevent military activity by other countries in
the region by denying access and deployment of foreign militaries
to its surrounding areas. However, China has not clearly stated the
purposes and goals of the military buildup and therefore, transparency
concerning its military and security is not fully achieved.
In addition, China is rapidly expanding and intensifying its
activities in the maritime and aerial domains in the region including
in the East China Sea and the South China Sea. In particular, China
has taken assertive actions with regard to issues of conf icts of interest
in the maritime domain, as exemplif ed by its attempts to change the
status quo by coercion. As for the seas and airspace around Japan, China
has intruded into Japanese territorial waters frequently and violated
Japan’s airspace, and has engaged in dangerous activities that could
cause unexpected situations, such as its announcement of establishing
an “Air Defense Identif cation Zone” based on its own assertion thereby
infringing the freedom of overf ight above the high seas.
China is also expanding and intensifying its activities in the maritime
and aerial domains farther offshore than before. For example, Chinese
military vessels and aircraft routinely enter the Pacif c Ocean, and are
expanding their operational areas which include areas north of Japan.
As Japan has great concern about these Chinese activities, it will


concerns over regional and global security.
As for Russia, it is observed that the country is proceeding to
reform and modernize its military forces mainly by strengthening their
readiness and introducing new equipment. The activities of Russian
armed forces have been active.
The U.S. has clearly manifested its strategic decision to put
greater emphasis on the Asia-Pacif c region (the rebalance to the AsiaPacif c region) and is maintaining and strengthening its engagement
and presence in the region despite f scal and various other constraints
in order to maintain the stability and growth of the region while
enhancing its relationships with its allies and expanding cooperation
with partner countries. In addition, the U.S. has made its stance clear
to prevent coercive actions that aim at changing the status quo in the
region in cooperation with allies and partners.
3. Japan is surrounded by the sea, and has a long coastline, numerous
remote islands and a vast Exclusive Economic Zone. Japan is a maritime
state and dependent largely on international trade for its supply of food
and natural resources. Therefore, securing the safety of maritime and air
traff c, through strengthening an “Open and Stable Seas” order based
upon such fundamental principles as the rule of law and the freedom of
navigation, constitutes the basis of peace and prosperity.
Japan also faces security vulnerabilities resulting from
concentration of industry, population and information infrastructure in
urban areas and from the presence of a large number of key facilities,
such as nuclear power plants, in coastal areas. In the event of another
massive earthquake like the Great East Japan Earthquake, Japan
may suffer enormous damage and the impact may spread not only
nationwide but also to other countries. The possibility of future huge
earthquakes such as a Nankai Trough earthquake or a Tokyo inland
earthquake makes it increasingly necessary to take every possible
measure to prepare for large-scale disasters.
4. In light of the above, while the probability of a large-scale military
conf ict between major countries, which was a concern during the
Cold War era, presumably remains low, various security challenges
and destabilizing factors are emerging and becoming more tangible
and acute. As a result, the security environment surrounding Japan
has become increasingly severe, since the formulation of “National
Defense Program Guidelines, FY2011 and beyond” (approved by
the Security Council and the Cabinet on December 17, 2010). As the
security challenges and destabilizing factors are diverse and wideranging, it is diff cult for a single country to deal with them on its
own. Under these circumstances, it is increasingly necessary not only
that the military sector cooperate with the non-military sector but also
that countries which share interests in responding to shared security
challenges cooperate and actively respond to maintain regional and
global stability.
**III. Japan’s Basic Defense Policy**
1. Basic Policy
In light of the National Security Strategy, Japan will strengthen its
diplomatic and defense capabilities along the policy of “Proactive
Contribution to Peace” based on the principle of international
cooperation, thereby expanding the role it can play. At the same time,
Japan will contribute even more proactively in securing peace, stability
and prosperity of the international community while achieving its
own security as well as peace and stability in the Asia-Pacif c region
by expanding and deepening cooperative relationships with other
countries, with the Japan-U.S. Alliance as its cornerstone.
Under this basic principle, Japan will build a comprehensive defense
architecture and strengthen its posture for preventing and responding
to various situations. In addition, Japan will strengthen the JapanU.S. Alliance and actively promote bilateral and multilateral security
cooperation with other countries while closely coordinating defense and
diplomatic policies. Japan will also seek to establish an infrastructure
necessary for its defense forces to fully exercise their capabilities.
When implementing these measures, under the Constitution,
Japan will eff ciently build a highly effective and joint defense force
in line with the basic principles of maintaining an exclusively defenseoriented policy, not becoming a military power that poses a threat to
other countries, while adhering to the principle of civilian control of
the military and observing the Three Non-Nuclear Principles.
With regard to the threat of nuclear weapons, the extended
deterrence provided by the U.S. with nuclear deterrence at its core, is
indispensable. In order to maintain and enhance the credibility of the
extended deterrence, Japan will closely cooperate with the U.S. In
addition, Japan will take appropriate responses through its own efforts,
including ballistic missile defense (BMD) and protection of the people.
At the same time, Japan will play a constructive and active role in
international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts so as to
achieve the long-term goal of creating a world free of nuclear weapons.
2. Japan’s Own Efforts
Recognizing that a country’s security depends f rst and foremost on


-----

its independent efforts, Japan will make full-scale efforts on its own
initiative to prevent various situations and will seamlessly respond to
them as the situation evolves with the National Security Council as the
control tower, while maintaining cooperation with its ally, partners and
other countries concerned.
(1) Building a comprehensive defense architecture
Given the increasingly severe security environment, Japan will
eff ciently develop a highly effective joint defense force and make
efforts to employ it with a high level of f exibility and readiness
based on joint operations. Japan will also ensure close regular
interagency cooperation in normal times. In the event of various
situations, the Government, under strong political leadership, will
appropriately and promptly make decisions. Japan will seamlessly
respond to situations as they unfold, in a whole-of-the-government
approach, to ensure the protection of the lives and property of its
people and the sovereignty of Japan’s territorial land, waters and
airspace, in coordination with local governments, private sectors,
and others.
Japan will also continue to develop various systems to respond
to a variety of disasters and protect its people and will enhance
the capability to quickly evacuate Japanese nationals from foreign
countries in an emergency situation and ensure their safety.
In order to take such approaches appropriately, Japan will
increase the effectiveness of its situation and disaster response
posture by systemizing various related plans and formulating
and reviewing them as well as expanding the use of simulations,
comprehensive training and exercises.
(2) Japan’s defense forces – building a Dynamic Joint Defense Force
Japan’s defense forces are the ultimate guarantee of national security,
and represent Japan’s will and ability to deter threats from directly
reaching Japan and defeat them if threats should reach Japan.
In the times of an ever-changing security environment
surrounding Japan, defense forces need to be constantly reviewed
to adapt to the environment. To this aim, Japan needs to allocate
limited resources in a focused and f exible way to prioritize the
functions and capabilities from a comprehensive perspective,
identif ed through joint operation-based capability assessments of
the Self-Defense Force’s (SDF’s) total functions and capabilities
against various situations.
Amid the increasingly severe security environment surrounding
Japan, the SDF, in addition to its regular activities, needs to respond
to various situations, including “gray zone” situations which
require SDF commitment. The frequency of such situations and
the duration of responses are both increasing. Therefore, Japan
will regularly conduct persistent intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance (hereinafter “ISR”) activities. Moreover, the SDF
will conduct strategic training and exercises in accordance with the
development of the situation and swiftly build a response posture
including advance deployment of units in response to the security
environment and rapid deployment of adequate units. Thus Japan
will demonstrate its will and highly developed capability to prevent
further escalation. In dealing with situations, depending on their
development, minimizing damage by effective response through
achieving maritime supremacy and air superiority is essential in
safeguarding the lives and property of the Japanese people, and the
sovereignty of Japan’s territorial land, waters and airspace.
Therefore, Japan will enhance its deterrence and response
capability by improving the mission-capable rate of equipment and
its employment to conduct tailored activities swiftly and sustainably
based on joint operations, as well as by developing defense
capabilities adequate both in quantity and quality that underpin
various activities to realize a more robust defense force.
At the same time, from the perspective of “Proactive
Contribution to Peace” based on the principle of international
cooperation, Japan will strengthen its bilateral and multilateral
cooperative relationships in order to ensure the stability of the AsiaPacif c region, which is closely related to its own security. Japan
will also engage in international peacekeeping and other similar
activities (peacekeeping operations by the United Nations, nontraditional security initiatives including Humanitarian Assistance/
Disaster Relief (HA/DR), and other internationally collaborative
activities to improve the international security environment) and
other efforts more proactively than before as efforts to address
the global security challenges, in light of the diversif ed roles and
increased opportunities of the defense force.
From these viewpoints, given the changes in the security
environment, the defense force based on this NDPG should prioritize
particularly important functions and capabilities through optimal
resource allocation as a whole. The defense force also must be an
effective one which enables conducting a diverse range of activities
to be seamless as well as dynamic and adapting to situations as they


Force, which emphasizes both soft and hard aspects of readiness,
sustainability, resiliency and connectivity, reinforced by advanced
technology and capability for C3I, with a consideration to establish
a wide range of infrastructure to support the SDF’s operation.
3. Strengthening of the Japan-U.S. Alliance
The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements based on the Japan-U.S.
Security Treaty, together with Japan’s own efforts, constitute the
cornerstone for Japan’s national security. The Japan-U.S. Alliance
centered on bilateral security arrangements functions as public goods
that contribute to the stability and prosperity not only of Japan but also
of the Asia-Pacif c region and the world at large.
Under its policy of strategic rebalancing towards the Asia-Pacif c
region, the U.S. is maintaining and strengthening its engagement and
presence in the region while enhancing its partnerships and cooperation
with its allies, including Japan, and partner countries. As the security
environment surrounding Japan becomes increasingly severer, it has
become more important than ever for Japan’s security to strengthen the
Japan-U.S. Alliance and make it more balanced and effective.
(1) Strengthening deterrence and response capabilities of the JapanU.S. Alliance
In order to ensure Japan’s national security by maintaining and
strengthening the commitment of the U.S. towards Japan and the
Asia-Pacif c region, Japan will revise the Guidelines for JapanU.S. Defense Cooperation, further enhance Japan-U.S. defense
cooperation and reinforce the deterrence provided by the Japan-U.S.
Alliance and the alliance’s contingency response capabilities, while
strengthening Japan’s own capabilities as a premise for these efforts.
At the same time, in response to the increasingly severe
security environment, while increasing the presence of Japan and
the U.S. in the western Pacif c region, Japan will build seamless
cooperation with the U.S. ranging from situations on a day-to-day
basis to various situations, including cooperation in responding to
“gray-zone” situations.
To that end, Japan will continue to expand joint training
and exercises, joint ISR activities and the joint/shared use of
facilities and areas with the U.S. It will also tighten the JapanU.S. operational cooperation and policy coordination including
contingency response and medium-to long-term strategies, such as
BMD, bilateral planning, and Extended Deterrence Dialogue.
(2) Strengthening and expanding cooperation in a broad range of f elds
The Japan-U.S. Alliance will contribute to the peace and stability
of the world, including the Asia-Pacif c region, by strengthening
cooperation not only in the f elds of anti-piracy efforts, capacity
building assistance, HA/DR, peacekeeping and counter terrorism
but also in maritime affairs, outer space and cyberspace.
As for disaster response, Japan will further strengthen its
cooperation between the SDF and the U.S. forces within and
outside Japan in light of the fact that the U.S. forces, including its
USFJ facilities and areas, greatly contributed to the safety of the
Japanese people during the Great East Japan Earthquake.
In addition, Japan will constantly strengthen and expand the
Japan-U.S. cooperative relationship over a broad range of f elds,
including efforts for intelligence cooperation and information
security, and cooperation in the f eld of defense equipment and
technology, to build a f rmer and effective alliance.
(3) Steady implementation of measures relating to the stationing of
U.S. Forces in Japan
Japan will provide stable support for the smooth and effective
stationing of U.S. forces in Japan through various measures,
including Host Nation Support (HNS). At the same time, efforts
will be made to steadily implement the realignment of U.S. forces
in Japan and mitigate the impact on local communities while
maintaining the deterrence provided by U.S. forces. In particular,
Japan will seek to mitigate the impact on Okinawa, located in a
critically important location in terms of national security and
where the stationing of U.S. forces signif cantly contributes
to the deterrence of the Japan-U.S. Alliance, by realignment,
consolidation and reduction of USFJ facilities and areas including
through the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma as well
as the dispersion of the impact and other measures, in light of the
heavy concentration of such facilities and areas there.
4. Active Promotion of Security Cooperation
(1) Cooperation in the Asia-Pacif c region
In the Asia-Pacif c region, specif c cooperative measures have been
taken mainly in non-traditional security f elds, including disaster
relief. Multilateral frameworks such as the ASEAN Regional Forum
(ARF), the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting-Plus (ADMMPlus) and the East Asia Summit (EAS) have been developed and
the regional integration initiative led by ASEAN has been making
progress. However, security challenges are becoming more serious
than ever in North East Asia. Japan will promote a variety of


-----

atmosphere of confrontation and the sense of curiosity toward one
another in the region.
Japan will promote close cooperation with the Republic of
Korea (ROK), which is in a position to support the U.S. presence
in North East Asia together with Japan, and will make efforts to
establish a foundation for further cooperation with the ROK, for
example by concluding an agreement on security information
protection and an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement.
Japan will further deepen its relationship with Australia, with
which Japan shares security interests and security cooperation
has been advancing, and strengthen cooperation in f elds such
as international peacekeeping activities. Japan will also actively
conduct joint training and other activities so as to improve
interoperability with Australia.
Moreover, efforts will be made to promote the partnerships
among U.S. allies in the Asia-Pacif c region by strengthening
cooperative relationships under trilateral frameworks among Japan,
the U.S. and ROK and among Japan, the U.S. and Australia.
As Chinese activities have a signif cant impact on regional
security, Japan will promote security dialogue and exchanges with
China in order to enhance mutual understanding and will develop
conf dence-building measures to prevent unexpected situations.
Japan will maintain a calm and f rm stance in dealing with the rapid
expansion and intensif cation of Chinese activities on the sea and in
the air surrounding Japan.
Japan will promote security dialogues with Russia, including the
Foreign and Defense Ministerial Consultations (“2+2”), high-level
exchanges, and unit-to-unit exchanges in order to deepen understanding
about the intention of Russian military activities and develop mutual
trust with Russia. In addition, Japan will enhance bilateral training and
exercises with Russia to promote regional stability.
Japan will also further strengthen its relationships with partner
countries in the region, including Southeast Asian countries, and will
actively promote joint training and exercises and capacity building
assistance. In addition, Japan will strengthen its cooperation
with these countries in the f eld of disaster management in light
of the increasing frequency and growing scale of disasters in the
region. Japan will strengthen its relationship with India in a broad
range of f elds, including maritime security, through joint training
and exercises as well as joint implementation of international
peacekeeping activities.
As capacity building assistance is effective in stabilizing
the security environment and strengthening bilateral defense
cooperation, Japan will promote it in full coordination with
diplomatic policy initiatives, including the Off cial Development
Assistance, and aligning it with joint training and exercises and
international peacekeeping activities. Japan will also strengthen
cooperation with relevant countries which actively provide such
support, thereby expanding the range of countries receiving support
as well as its scope.
Under ongoing multilateral security cooperation and dialogue in
the Asia-Pacif c region, Japan in cooperation with the United States
and Australia will proactively contribute to building cooperative
relationships in the region. Moreover, Japan will actively participate
in multilateral joint training and exercises and play a major role
in enhancing conf dence-building measures among countries in the
region, attaching importance to multilateral frameworks such as the
ARF and the ADMM-Plus.
(2) Cooperation with the international community
It is very diff cult for a single country to respond to global security
challenges on its own. Moreover, as the roles of military forces
have diversif ed, there are increasing opportunities for such forces
to play an important role not only in preventing and responding to
conf icts and maintaining peace but also in supporting post-conf ict
reconstruction, building peace and promoting conf dence-building
and friendly relationships.
Therefore, Japan will promote various initiatives to improve the
global security environment on a regular basis in cooperation with
the international community.
Japan will continue and strengthen various initiatives concerning
arms control, disarmament, nonproliferation and capacity building
assistance in order to respond to global security challenges,
including regional conf icts, expansion and spread of international
terrorism, failed states, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
and problems related to the sea, outer space and cyberspace, while
regularly cooperating with its ally and relevant countries with which
it shares security interests and with international organizations and
other relevant bodies.
In this respect, Japan will further strengthen its cooperation
with the European Union (EU), North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe


countries and will work with them in responding to these challenges.
Japan will also promote cooperation and exchanges with regard to
equipment and technology with these countries and organizations.
In order to stabilize the security environment in the Asia-Pacif c
region and improve the global security environment based on the
policy of “Proactive Contribution to Peace” based on the principle
of international cooperation, Japan will actively promote various
international peace cooperation activities, including international
peace cooperation assignments and emergency relief activities,
in a multi-layered manner. To this end, Japan will ensure close
cooperation between the defense and foreign affairs authorities,
with comprehensive consideration given to the signif cance of
the dispatch of SDF units, the situation of countries accepting
SDF units and Japan’s political and economic relationships with
recipient countries.
With regard to international peace cooperation activities
and other similar activities in particular, Japan will continue to
actively conduct activities utilizing the SDF’s capabilities and will
increase the number of SDF personnel it dispatches to assume
positions of responsibility at organizations such as the local mission
headquarters and the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping
Operations. In addition, Japan will conduct a study on various
challenges it has to overcome to enable the dispatch of SDF
personnel in a broad range of f elds, and take necessary measures.
Japan will also contribute to the training of domestic and foreign
personnel engaging in peacebuilding by making use of the SDF’s
experience and knowledge.
**IV. Future Defense Forces**
1. The Role of the Defense Force
Japan’s future defense forces will be developed as described in III.
2 (2) above, and will be capable of effectively fulf lling the expected
roles in the following f elds, and will maintain the necessary posture.
(1) Effective deterrence of and response to various situations
In order to respond to various situations in a timely and appropriate
manner, and certainly protect the lives and property of its people
and the sovereignty of its land, sea and airspace, Japan will achieve
intelligence superiority through persistent ISR activities in an
extensive surrounding area to constantly gain an understanding of
military developments in other countries and to detect any signs of
development at an early stage.
Through such activities, Japan will clearly express its resolve
not to tolerate the change of the status quo by force, thereby
preventing various situations from occurring.
At the same time, Japan will swiftly and seamlessly respond
to situations including gray zone situations, and will establish the
necessary posture to continuously address a protracted situation.
Moreover, Japan will implement an effective response tailored
to each situation, even in cases when multiple events occur in a
consecutive or concurrent manner.
When implementing the initiatives above, the following points
are emphasized in particular:
a. Ensuring security of the sea and airspace surrounding Japan
In addition to persistent ISR in an extensive area around Japan,
Japan will immediately take appropriate measures to deal with any
incursions into its territorial airspace. Japan will respond effectively
and promptly to gray-zone situations or any other acts that may
violate its sovereignty. Furthermore, should the acts in question
become protracted or escalate, Japan will respond seamlessly as
the situation evolves, taking all possible measures for the defense
and security of the sea and airspace surrounding Japan.
b. Response to an attack on remote islands
In responding to an attack on remote islands, Japan will intercept
and defeat any invasion, by securing maritime supremacy and
air superiority, with the necessary SDF units swiftly deployed
to interdict, in addition to the units deployed in advance in
accordance with the security environment. Moreover, should any
remote islands be invaded, Japan will recapture them. In doing
so, any ballistic missile or cruise missile attacks will be dealt with
appropriately.
c. Response to ballistic missile attacks
Japan will promptly detect any signs of a ballistic missile launch
and facilitate a swift, sustained response by establishing a multilayered defense posture. Should any damage result, Japan will
take steps to minimize it. Moreover, in the event of an attack by
guerrillas or special operations forces concurrent with a ballistic
missile attack, Japan will protect key facilities including nuclear
power plants and search and destroy the inf ltrating units.
d. Responses in outer space and cyberspace
In regard with outer space and cyberspace, Japan will build up
persistent ISR capabilities to prevent any acts that could impede
eff cient action by the SDF. Furthermore, should any situation


-----

arise, Japan will identify the event without delay and swiftly
repair any damage, while taking necessary steps to contain it.
Moreover, in light of society’s growing dependence on outer
space and cyberspace, Japan will make effective use of the SDF’s
capabilities when endeavoring to strengthen collaboration with
relevant organizations and clarify the division of roles, thereby
contributing to comprehensive, government-wide initiatives.
e. Responses to major disasters
Should a major disaster occur, Japan will swiftly transport
and deploy the requisite units and take all possible measures
as part of its initial response, and maintain its presence in the
longer term, when required. Moreover, as well as providing a
meticulous response to the needs of disaster-stricken citizens
and local government bodies, Japan will engage in appropriate
partnerships and cooperation with local governments and the
private sector, in order to save lives, carry out emergency repairs,
and provide livelihood support.
(2) Stabilization of the Asia-Pacif c and improvement of global security
environments
Through persistent ISR in the area surrounding Japan and the timely
and appropriate implementation of training, exercises, and various
other activities, Japan will ensure the stability of the security
environment in the Asia-Pacif c region as a whole including the
vicinity of Japan.
Moreover, working in partnership with its ally and partners,
Japan will promote multi-tiered initiatives, including bilateral and
multilateral defense cooperation and exchange, joint training and
exercises, and capacity building assistance, effectively fulf lling its
key role in initiatives focused on the stabilization of the security
environment, including the building and strengthening of intraregional cooperative frameworks in the Asia-Pacif c region.
As the roles played by military capacity diversify, in order to
respond appropriately to global security issues including regional
conf icts, the expansion and spread of international terrorism,
failed states, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
Japan will strengthen various initiatives focused on arms control,
disarmament and non-proliferation, as well as actively promote
international peace cooperation activities, anti-piracy initiatives and
capacity building assistance, thereby working on improvement of
the global security environment.
Japan will attach importance to the following in particular,
when engaging in the aforementioned initiatives.
a. Holding training and exercises
As well as the timely and appropriate implementation of
SDF training and exercises, Japan will promote bilateral and
multilateral joint training and exercises in the Asia-Pacif c region,
proactively and visibly demonstrating our nation’s resolve
and advanced capabilities focused on regional stabilization. In
addition, it will build and strengthen cooperative relationships
with relevant countries.
b. Promoting defense cooperation and exchange
Enhancing mutual understanding and relationships of trust with
other countries and international organizations is the cornerstone
of efforts to stabilize the security environment. Japan will take
further steps to promote multi-layered defense cooperation
and exchange, such as building and strengthening cooperative
relationships focused on wide-ranging security issues of common
interest including HADR and ensuring the stable use of the seas,
outer space and cyberspace.
c. Promoting capacity building assistance
Utilizing the capabilities of the SDF, Japan will continuously
engage in capacity building assistance such as human resource
development and technical support on a regular basis in order to
enhance the ability of developing countries themselves, thereby
improving the security environment with particular focus on
active creation of stability in the Asia-Pacif c region.
d. Ensuring maritime security
As it is particularly vital for Japan as a maritime state to maintain
an “Open and Stable Seas” order which serves as the cornerstone
of peace and prosperity, Japan will take all possible measures
to secure the safety of maritime traff c. Japan will also conduct
anti-piracy activities in cooperation with countries concerned,
and will promote various efforts including capacity building
assistance of coastal states in this f eld and enhancement of joint
training and exercises by taking various opportunities in waters
other than those surrounding our country.
e. Implementing international peace cooperation activities
Working in partnership with non-governmental organizations
and other relevant organizations, Japan will actively engage in
international peace cooperation assignments and emergency
relief activities to meet diverse needs, from peacekeeping to


a leading role. In doing so, as well as enhancing its readiness
posture to facilitate rapid overseas dispatch according to the
situation, Japan will strengthen its sustainable preparedness for
a protracted overseas deployment.
f. Cooperating with efforts to promote arms control, disarmament,
and nonproliferation
Japan will be actively involved in arms control and disarmament
activities undertaken by the United Nations and other bodies.
In doing so, Japan will make active, effective use of the SDF’s
knowledge, including through personnel contribution. Moreover,
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles that
can serve as their means of delivery, as well as the proliferation
of arms and goods and technology which could be diverted
to military use pose severe threats to the peace and stability
not only of Japan but also of the international community as
a whole. Thus, Japan will cooperate with relevant countries
and international organizations and other relevant bodies in
promoting nonproliferation initiatives.
2. Priorities in strengthening architecture of the Self Defense Forces
(1) Basic approach
The SDF will maintain an appropriate structure to effectively
fulf ll the abovementioned roles of defense forces. As such, Japan
has conducted capability assessments based on joint operations in
relation to various potential contingencies to identify the functions
and capabilities that should be prioritized in order to pursue more
effective build-up of the defense force.
Based on the results of the capability assessments, in the defense
capability buildup, the SDF will prioritize the development of
capacities to ensure maritime supremacy and air superiority, which
is the prerequisite for effective deterrence and response in various
situations, including defense posture buildup in the southwestern
region. Furthermore, the SDF will emphasize the establishment of
rapid deployment capabilities with a consideration to establishing a
wide-ranging logistical support foundation.
At the same time, in terms of preparation for a Cold-War era
style invasion such as the landing of large-scale ground forces, the
SDF will possess the minimum necessary level of expertise and skills
required to respond to unforeseen changes in the situation in the
future and to maintain and inherit them, and thereby further promote
efforts to achieve even greater eff ciency and rationalization.
(2) Functions and capabilities to be emphasized
From the perspective of eff ciently developing an effective defense
force, the SDF will selectively strengthen the following functions
and capabilities in particular, paying attention to enhance joint
functions with interoperability with the U.S. forces.
a. ISR capabilities
In order to ensure effective deterrence and response to various
situations, while utilizing unmanned equipment, Japan will
implement extensive persistent ISR on objectives such as aircraft
and vessels in the seas and airspace surrounding it, and the
SDF will adopt a f exible approach to boosting its ISR posture
according to the developments of situations.
b. Intelligence capabilities
Japan will strengthen its system for intelligence collection,
processing information, and analyzing and sharing the collected
information, so that the SDF can promptly detect and swiftly
respond to signs of various situations and take necessary
measures based on medium-to long-term military trends mainly
in its vicinity.
In doing so, the SDF will seek to augment its various
information collection capabilities, including HUMINT, OSINT,
SIGINT, and IMINT, as well as persistent ISR capabilities using
unmanned aerial vehicles. Also, the SDF will engage in integrated
efforts to strengthen its geospatial intelligence capabilities to
combine various types of intelligence on images and maps to
exploit them in a sophisticated manner, while establishing a
framework for the integrated and systematic nurturing of highly
capable personnel in information gathering analysis.
c. Transport capability
In order to secure swift and large-scale transport and deployment
capability, and to swiftly deploy and move necessary units, the
SDF will strengthen integrated transport capacity including
maritime and airborne transport capacity, with collaboration
with the civilian transport sector. In doing so, the SDF will avoid
redundancy in functions by clarifying roles and assignments
among various means of transport, considering their respective
characteristics.
d. Command and control, and information and communications
capabilities
In order to establish a command and control system that can
manage units nationwide in a mobile, joint integrated manner,


-----

Force (GSDF), Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) and Air
Self-Defense Force (ASDF) personnel in the main headquarters
of each service, making effective use of the knowledge and
experience held by each respective service. Furthermore, the
SDF will facilitate swift, resilient nationwide operation of the
GSDF’s units such as basic operational units (divisions and
brigades) through the establishment of a new central headquarters
to control all of the regional armies, as well as greater eff ciency
and streamlining of the command and control function in each
regional army headquarters, and other measures.
Moreover, the SDF will strive to enhance and strengthen
its information and communications capabilities that are
prerequisites for supporting nationwide operation, starting with
the communications infrastructure on remote islands and data
link functions among the three services.
e. Response to an attack on remote islands
In order to ensure maritime supremacy and air superiority which
is a prerequisite for effective response to an attack on remote
islands, the SDF will strengthen its ability to deal with attacks by
aircraft, naval vessels, and missiles, etc.
Moreover, while strengthening the integrated capabilities
to seek to interdict any attack on Japan’s remote islands at sea,
the SDF will newly develop suff cient amphibious operations
capability, which enables the SDF to land, recapture and secure
without delay in the case of an invasion of any remote islands.
Furthermore, the SDF will enhance its logistical support
capabilities, so that SDF units can swiftly and continuously
respond in the event of a situation in the southwestern region.
In addition, the SDF will also examine the desirable air
defense posture in remote islands in the Pacif c.
f. Response to ballistic missile attacks
To counter North Korea’s improved ballistic missile capability,
Japan will pursue comprehensive improvement of its response
capability against the threat of ballistic missiles.
With regard to the BMD system, Japan will enhance
readiness, simultaneous engagement capability and sustainable
response capability to strengthen the capability to protect the
entire territory.
Based on appropriate role and mission sharing between Japan
and the U.S., in order to strengthen the deterrent of the JapanU.S. Alliance as a whole through enhancement of Japan’s own
deterrent and response capability, Japan will study a potential form
of response capability to address the means of ballistic missile
launches and related facilities, and take means as necessary.
g. Responses in outer space and cyberspace
While strengthening information collection capability using
satellites equipped with a variety of sensors, and reinforcing
command, control and telecommunications capabilities, the SDF
will secure effective, stable use of outer space so that satellites
can continuously exercise their capabilities even in contingencies
by enhancing the survivability of satellites through such
initiatives as space situational awareness. In implementing such
initiatives, the SDF will form organic partnerships with research
and development institutions in Japan, as well as with the U.S.
As for cyberspace, Japan will enhance integrated persistent
surveillance and response capabilities and expertise and latest
equipment will be continuously developed and secured in order
to prevent actions that hinder eff cient SDF activities.
h. Responses to major disasters, etc.
In the event of a large-scale natural disaster such as a Nankai
Trough earthquake, or an atypical disaster such as a nuclear
emergency, it is of vital importance to respond swiftly from the
initial stages of the impact and carry out such tasks as information
gathering on the extent and nature of the damage from the air by
aircrafts, rescue operations and emergency repairs. In this regard,
the SDF will develop a response posture sustainable for longterm operation, through swift transportation and deployment of
appropriately size units, and by establishing a rotating staff ng
posture based on a joint operational approach.
i. Responses focused on international peace cooperation activities
and other similar activities
In international peace cooperation activities and other similar
activities, the SDF will strengthen the necessary protective
capabilities to carry out its operations, ensuring the safety of
personnel and units. Moreover, the SDF will work on enhancing
transport and deployment capability, information communication
capability with a view to long term activities in Africa and other
remote locations, and strengthening logistic and medical service
structure for smooth and continuous operation.
From the standpoint of carrying out international peace
cooperation activities more effectively, Japan will consider measures


Deployed Air Force for Anti-Piracy Operation in Djibouti.
Furthermore, while strengthening intelligence gathering
capability required for operations, the SDF will enhance its
education, training and personnel management systems in order
to facilitate the continuous dispatch of adequate personnel for
overseas cooperation activities.
3. Architecture of each service of the Self-Defense Forces
The organization, equipment and disposition in each service of the SDF
are outlined in (1) to (3) below. The specif cs of major organizations
and equipment in the future are as shown in the Annex table.
(1) Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF)
a. In order to be able to respond swiftly and deal effectively and
nimbly with an attack on offshore islands and various other
situations, the GSDF will maintain rapidly deployable basic
operational units (rapid deployment divisions, rapid deployment
brigades and an armored division) furnished with advanced
mobility and ISR capabilities. In addition, the GSDF will maintain
mobile operating units sustaining specialized functions in order
to effectively perform such operations as airborne operations,
amphibious operations, special operations, air transportation,
defense against NBC (nuclear, biological, and chemical) weapons,
and international peace cooperation activities.
Keeping in mind that the role of these highly-prof cient
rapidly deployable basic operational units is to swiftly deploy
and move via the integrated transport capacity referred to in 2
(2) c. above, the GSDF will maintain half of these in Hokkaido,
given the excellent training environment there.
The defense posture in the remote islands of the
southwestern region will be enhanced and strengthened via the
permanent stationing of the units where the SDF is not currently
stationed, the deploy ability of the aforementioned units, and
the establishment of organic partnerships and networks with the
MSDF and ASDF.
b. The GSDF will maintain surface-to-ship guided missile units in
order to prevent invasion of Japan’s remote islands while still at
sea, as far as possible.
c. The GSDF will maintain surface-to-air guided missile units in
order to effectively provide air defense to protect operational
units and key areas, working in tandem with the surface-to-air
guided missile units referred to in (3) d. below.
d. The GSDF will review the organization and equipment of the
basic operational units (divisions and brigades) other than the
rapidly deployable ones referred to in a. above, with a particular
focus on tanks/howitzers and rockets. Following thorough
rationalization and streamlining, these units will be deployed
appropriately, according to geographical characteristics.
(2) Maritime Self Defense Force (MSDF)
a. The MSDF will maintain destroyer units and ship-based patrol
helicopter units strengthened by increased numbers of equipment,
including the new destroyers, with additional multifunctional
capability and with a compact-type hull, in order to effectively
conduct persistent ISR and antisubmarine operations etc.,
thereby facilitating agile response in such areas as the defense of
the seas surrounding Japan, the security of maritime traff c, and
international peace cooperation activities etc.
Along with the surface-to-air guided missile units referred to
in (3) d. below, the destroyer units will maintain Aegis-equipped
destroyers capable of providing Japan with multi-layered defense
against ballistic missile attacks.
b. The MSDF will maintain submarine units strengthened by
increased numbers of them, in order to effectively conduct patrol
and defense of the seas surrounding Japan, as well as regularly
engage in broad underwater intelligence gathering and warning
and surveillance in those seas.
c. The MSDF will maintain f xed-wing patrol aircraft units in order
to effectively conduct patrol and defense of the seas surrounding
Japan, as well as regularly engage in broad maritime intelligence
gathering and warning and surveillance in those seas.
d. The MSDF will maintain minesweeper units in order to
effectively conduct minesweeping operations in the seas
surrounding Japan in collaboration with the new destroyers with
additional multifunctional capability and with the compact-type
hull referred to in a. above.
(3) Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF)
a. The ASDF will maintain air warning and control units consisting
of warning and control units and air warning units. Warning and
control units will be equipped with ground-based warning and
control radar that can detect and track any ballistic missiles f ying
into Japanese air space, as well as providing persistent ISR in
most air space over Japan and the surrounding areas. Air warning
units will be enhanced in order to conduct effective warning,


-----

of gray zone situations.
b. The ASDF will maintain f ghter aircraft units reinforced by
highly capable f ghter aircrafts in order to provide aerial defense
for Japan based on a comprehensive posture that brings together
f ghter aircrafts and relevant support functions. In addition, the
ASDF will maintain enhanced aerial refueling and transport
units that will enable f ghter aircraft units and air warning units,
etc. to carry out various operations sustainably in the air space
surrounding Japan.
c. The ASDF will maintain air transport units in order to effectively
carry out the mobile deployment of ground-based units etc., and
international peace cooperation activities etc.
d. The ASDF will maintain surface-to-air guided missile units
providing multi-layered defense for Japan against ballistic
missile attacks, together with the Aegis destroyers referred to in
(2) a. above, as well as protecting key areas in tandem with the
surface-to-air guided missile units referred to in (1) c. above.
**V. Basic Foundations for SDF**
To ensure that the diverse activities required of the SDF are carried out in
a timely and appropriate manner, it is not suff cient simply to upgrade the
main elements of the organization and its equipment; it is also imperative
to strengthen the various foundations underpinning the defense force, in
order to ensure that it can function as effectively as possible. The key
aspects of this are as follows.
1. Training and Exercises
Through routine training and exercises, the SDF will ceaselessly
review and examine various plans for dealing with situations, as well
as strive to enhance and strengthen its training and exercises in order to
improve the tactical skills in each of its branches. In doing so, as well
as making more effective use of the excellent training environment in
Hokkaido, the SDF will work in partnership with relevant organizations
and the civilian sector, in order to ensure systematic implementation of
more practical training and exercises.
In the southwestern region, where there are limitations on the
exercise areas, etc. of the SDF, the SDF will secure a favorable training
environment through the joint use of U.S. military facilities and areas,
while remaining sensitive to relationships with the local community,
so that timely and appropriate training and exercises can be carried
out, including Japan-U.S. bilateral training and exercises.
2. Operational Infrastructure
The SDF will improve survivability, including the recovery capabilities of
military camps and bases, etc., in order to maintain the support functions
that serve as the operational infrastructure for units, so that units can be
deployed swiftly and respond to various situations effectively.
Moreover, in light of the fact that some SDF facilities are currently
dilapidated, the SDF will implement a steady repair and maintenance
program, as well as expansion of the necessary quarters in order to
ensure an emergency call-up of personnel in the event of various
situations, thereby enhancing readiness.
The SDF will undertake necessary deliberations concerning civilian
airports and ports, including approaches to the various systems on a dayto-day basis, in order to ensure that such facilities can be used as part
of the operational infrastructure for the SDF, etc. from an early stage,
depending on the situation. Furthermore, it will implement various
family support measures, in order to alleviate the anxieties both of troops
serving away from home and of their families while they are away.
The SDF will enhance and strengthen the operational infrastructure
in terms of equipment and materials, such as improving the operational
availability of equipment, by taking all possible measures to maintain
and upgrade SDF equipment, as well as securing and stockpiling the
necessary ammunition.
3. Personnel and Education
Given that equipment has become more advanced and complex, and
missions more diverse and internationalized in recent years, the SDF
will implement measures to reform the personnel management system,
in order to ensure the edge of its troops and the effective use of human
resources amid a severe f scal situation, taking into consideration a variety
of elements, including skills, experience, physical strength and morale.
Accordingly, the SDF will implement measures to ensure an
appropriate composition of ranks and age distribution, taking into account
the various missions and characteristics of each branch of the SDF.
The SDF will implement measures to make effective use of
human resources, such as more effective use of female SDF personnel
and expansion of reappointment, and measures related to honors and
privileges. In order to strengthen the joint operations structure, the
SDF will enhance education and training, and, through secondments
to the Joint Staff and relevant ministries and agencies, retain adequate
personnel who have a broad outlook and ideas, as well as wide-ranging
experience in Japan’s security-affairs, and who can respond f exibly
and rapidly to various situations as part of the government.
In light of the deterioration of the recruiting environment resulting


from social factors such as the declining birthrate and popularization of
higher education, the SDF will promote a diverse range of recruitment
measures to spread the perception that the SDF is an attractive job option.
Furthermore, as it is the responsibility of the Government of Japan
to secure the livelihoods of the SDF personnel, who are compelled
to resign at a younger age than ordinary civil servants, the SDF will
promote support for re-employment by strengthening collaboration
with local governments and relevant organizations.
In order to support sustainable operation of units in situations
that are becoming increasingly diversif ed and protracted, the SDF
will promote utilization of reserve personnel in broad areas, including
those with professional skills such as aviators, and will take measures
to improve the suff ciency of reserve personnel.
4. Medical
In order to keep SDF personnel in good health and enhance their
ability to engage in a diverse range of missions, such as various
situation responses and international peace cooperation activities, the
SDF will establish an eff cient and high-quality medical care structure,
through endeavors including upgrading of SDF hospitals into hubs
with enhanced functions, and improvements in the management of the
National Defense Medical College Hospital. The SDF will also attach
greater importance to securing and training of such medical staff as
medical off cers, nurses and emergency medical technicians.
The SDF will consider such matters as revisions of regulations
of emergency medical treatment on situation responses, and improve
f rst aid capabilities on the frontline, and will put in place a posture
for rapid medical evacuation that takes into account the viewpoints of
enhanced joint capabilities.
5. Defense Production and Technological Bases
Retaining an adequate level of defense production and technological
bases is essential not only for the production, operation, maintenance
and upkeep of equipment, but also for research and development of
equipment that f ts the operational environment, and for the expected
potential to contribute to enhancing deterrence.
At the same time, against the backdrop of the severe f scal
situation and rises in the equipment unit price as it becomes
increasingly sophisticated and complex, the numbers of units of
procured equipment are on the decline. Moreover, the environment
surrounding Japan’s defense production and technological bases is
becoming more severe. For instance, the competitiveness of foreign
companies is growing, as a result of the advance of large-scale and
cross-border restructuring and consolidation of the defense industry.
In this kind of environment, the Ministry of Defense will
formulate a strategy that sets forth its future vision for Japan’s defense
production and technological bases as a whole and will promote
participation in international joint development and production and
adapting defense equipment to civilian use, in order to maintain and
reinforce such bases without delay.
With regard to contribution to peace and international cooperation,
there are increasing opportunities to cooperate in a more effective
manner through, for example, the utilization and provision to disasterstricken countries and others of heavy machinery and other defense
equipment carried to sites by the SDF. Moreover, internationally, it has
become the mainstream to participate in international joint development
and production projects in order to improve the performance of defense
equipment while dealing with the rising costs of the equipment. In this
context, from the perspective of “Proactive Contribution to Peace” based
on the principle of international cooperation, Japan is required to engage
more proactively in peacebuilding efforts and international cooperation by
utilizing defense equipment in various ways, and to participate in joint
development and production of defense equipment and other related items.
Against this backdrop, while giving due consideration to the
roles that the Three Principles on Arms Exports and their related
policy guidelines have played so far, the Government of Japan will
set out clear principles on the overseas transfer of arms and military
technology, which f t the new security environment. In this context,
considerations will be made with regard to def ning cases where
transfers are prohibited; limiting cases where transfers could be
allowed with strict examination; and ensuring appropriate control over
transfers in terms of unauthorized use and third party transfer.
6. Eff cient Acquisition of Equipment
In order to achieve effective and eff cient acquisition of equipment,
including in research and development activities, the Ministry of
Defense will strengthen project management throughout the life-cycle
of equipment through introducing a project manager system, as well
as through considering the possibility of further introducing longterm contracts and further upgrading the contract system to provide
cost reduction incentives to companies, aiming to improve costeffectiveness throughout the life-cycle of equipment.
Moreover, the Ministry of Defense will try to improve readiness
and response capabilities through reforms of the logistics posture


-----

will ceaselessly pursue greater transparency in the acquisition process
and increased rationalization of the contract system, and strive to
achieve more rigorous procedures for the acquisition of equipment.
7. Research and Development
The Ministry of Defense will ensure consistency with the priorities
for upgrading defense capability when commencing research and
development, in order to guarantee that research and development that
meets the operational needs of the SDF is prioritized in view of the
severe f scal situation.
In conjunction with this, the Ministry of Defense will promote
research and development based on a medium- to long-term perspective,
taking into account the latest trends in science and technology, changes
in combat modality, cost-effectiveness and the potential for international
joint research and development, with a view to implementing research
and development that can ensure Japan’s technological superiority
against new threats in strategically important areas.
From the aspect of security, it is necessary to utilize civilian
technology effectively also in the f eld of security through regularly
assessing the trend in science and technology including information
related to technological development as well as consolidating the
capabilities of the government, industry and academia. Under such
recognition, the Ministry of Defense will strive to make effective
use of civilian technology that can also be applied to defense (dualuse technologies), by enhancing partnerships with universities and
research institutes, while strengthening technology control functions
to prevent the outf ow of advanced technologies.
The Ministry of Defense will examine its research and
development initiative for achieving the aforementioned objectives.
8. Collaboration with Local Communities
The Ministry of Defense and the SDF will further strengthen
collaboration with relevant organizations, including local governments,
the police and the f re service, in order to enable the SDF to provide
accurate response to various situations. Such close partnerships with
local governments, etc. are exceedingly important from the perspective
not only of the effective improvement and smooth operation of defense
facilities, but also of the recruitment of SDF personnel, as well as the
provision of re-employment support for them.
Accordingly, as well as continuing to advance measures targeting
the areas around defense facilities, with a view to their improvement
and operation, the Ministry of Defense and SDF will routinely engage
in various measures such as intensive public relations activities focused
on their policies and activities, in order to secure the understanding
and cooperation of local governments and communities.
Given that the presence of SDF units makes a substantial
contribution to the maintenance and revitalization of local communities
in some areas, and supports community medicine through emergency
patient transport using SDF search and rescue aircraft in others,
the Ministry of Defense and the SDF will give consideration to the
attributes of each area in the reorganization of units and deployment
of military camps and bases, etc., in order to secure the understanding
of local governments and residents. At the same time, in operating
the military camps and bases, etc., the Ministry of Defense will pay
attention to the contribution of the operation to the local economy.
9. Boosting Communication Capabilities
The Ministry of Defense and SDF will strengthen strategic public
relations and communication to enhance the dissemination of information
via a diverse range of media, in order to secure domestic and overseas
understanding which is vital to effectively conduct SDF duties.
10. Enhancing the Intellectual Base
The Ministry of Defense will promote education on security-related
matters at educational institutions, in order to enhance understanding
of security and crisis management among the populace. Moreover, in
addition to strengthening the Ministry of Defense and SDF research
systems, with a particular focus on the National Institute for Defense
Studies, the Ministry of Defense will promote various partnerships,
including education and research exchange with other research and
educational institutions within the government, as well as universities
and think-tanks both within Japan and overseas.
11. Promoting Reform of the Ministry of Defense
The Ministry of Defense will further promote reforms by constantly
reviewing its work methods and organization in order to foster a
sense of unity among civilian off cials and uniformed personnel,
total optimization in building up defense capability, strengthening
SDF’s joint operation functions and enhancing policy-making and
communication functions.
**VI. Additional Points**
1. These Guidelines set out the form of Japan’s defense force over the
next decade or so. The National Security Council will conduct regular,
systematic review over the course of implementation of the various
measures and programs. Smooth, swift and accurate transition to
the future defense force will be facilitated through validations based


on joint operational capability assessment while advancing such
initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner.
2. When major changes in the situation are anticipated during the
review and verif cation process, necessary examination of the security
environment at that time will be taken into account and these guidelines
will be revised adequately.
3. In light of the increasingly tough f scal conditions, Japan will strive to
achieve greater eff ciency and streamlining in the defense capability
buildup to curb costs, and harmonize with other initiatives in other
f elds to ensure that Japan’s defense force as a whole can smoothly
fulf ll its expected function.

(December 17, 2013 Approved by
National Security Council and the Cabinet)
The Five-Year Defense Program (FY2014-FY2018) in accordance with the
National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2014 and beyond (approved
by the National Security Council and the Cabinet on December 17, 2013)
has been established as shown in the attached document.
(Attachment)
Medium Term Defense Program (FY2014-FY2018)
**I. Program Guidelines**
In carrying out the Defense Program for FY2014 to FY2018 in accordance
with the National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2014 and beyond
(approved by the National Security Council and the Cabinet on December
17, 2013) (hereinafter “NDPG2013”), Japan will develop a Dynamic Joint
Defense Force. It will provide an effective defense which enables the SDF
to conduct a diverse range of activities based on joint operations seamlessly
and dynamically, adapting to situations as they demand, while prioritizing
particularly important functions and capabilities through optimal
resource allocation At the same time the Dynamic Joint Defense Force


-----

will serve as a defense force which emphasizes soft and hard readiness
capabilities, sustainability, resiliency and connectivity, reinforced by
advanced technology and Command, Control, Communications and
Intelligence (C3I) capabilities, with a consideration to establish a wide
range of infrastructure to support operations by the Self-Defense Forces
(SDF). In strengthening the SDF structure, a highly effective joint defense
force will be eff ciently developed by comprehensively prioritizing
particularly important functions and capabilities identif ed through joint
operation-based capability assessments of the SDF’s overall functions and
capabilities against various scenarios.
Given the considerations mentioned above, the SDF will effectively
and eff ciently build, maintain and operate defense forces based on the
following program guidelines:
1. The defense forces will seamlessly and dynamically fulf ll its
responsibilities including providing an effective deterrence and
response to a variety of security situations, supporting stability in
the Asia-Pacif c, and improving the global security environment.
With a focus on enhancement of joint operability, the SDF will place
particular emphasis on Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance
(ISR), intelligence, transport, and C3I capabilities. In addition,
defense forces will enhance their capabilities to respond to an attack
on remote islands, ballistic missile attacks, outer space and cyberspace
threats, large-scale disasters, and international peace cooperation
efforts (activities cooperatively carried out by the international society
to improve the international security environment such as U.N. Peace
Keeping Operations, Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/
DR), and others in the f elds of non-traditional security). The SDF will
steadily develop the foundations for maximizing the effectiveness of
these functions and capabilities.
2. In relevant efforts, the SDF will prioritize the development of
capacities to ensure maritime supremacy and air superiority, which
is the prerequisite for effective deterrence and response to various
situations, including defense posture buildup in Japan’s southwestern
region. Furthermore, the SDF will emphasize the establishment of
rapid deployment capabilities.
At the same time, regarding preparation for a Cold-War era style
invasion such as the landing of large-scale ground forces, the SDF will
establish the minimum necessary level of expertise and skill required
to respond to unforeseen changes in its security situation in the future
and to maintain them, and thereby further promote efforts to achieve
even greater eff ciency and rationalization of its activities.
3. Regarding equipment acquisition and maintenance, by properly
combining the introduction of new, high-performance equipment,
with life extension and improvement of existing equipment etc., the
SDF will eff ciently secure defense capabilities adequate both in
quantity and quality. In this effort, the Ministry of Defense (MOD)
will strengthen its project management throughout its equipment lifecycle, including during its research and development activities, and
reduce the life-cycle costs to improve cost-effectiveness.
4. Given the more advanced and complex equipment, and more diverse
and internationalized missions in recent years, to ensure SDF’s
strength and the effective use of defense force personnel, the SDF
will implement measures, including the more effective use of female
SDF personnel and reserve personnel, in order to reform its personnel
management system.
5. In order to address an increasingly severe security environment and
to strengthen deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S.
Alliance, in conjunction with the U.S. policy of strategic rebalancing
towards the Asia-Pacif c region, Japan will further promote a variety
of cooperation and consultations with the United States in a wide
range of areas including the revision of the Guidelines for Japan-U.S.
Defense Cooperation. Japan will also actively facilitate measures for
furthering smooth and effective stationing of U.S. forces in Japan.
6. Considering the increasingly diff cult situation in Japan’s public
f nance, Japan will strive to achieve greater eff ciencies and streamline
the buildup of its defense forces, while harmonizing these efforts with
other measures taken by the Government.
**II. Reorganization of the Major SDF Units**
1. Regarding the reorganization of the Ground Self-Defense Force
(GSDF), given the changes in the security environment surrounding
Japan, for the purpose of carrying out swift and f exible nation-wide
operations of basic operational units (rapid deployment divisions/
brigades, an armored division, and divisions/brigades) and various
units under the joint operations, the GSDF will establish the Ground
Central Command. In addition, the GSDF promote eff ciency and
rationalize the command and control function of each regional army
headquarters, as well as review other functions of some regional army
headquarters. As part of such efforts, the Central Readiness Force
will be disbanded and its subsidiary units will be integrated into the
Ground Central Command.
In order to be able to respond swiftly to and deal effectively and


nimbly with an attack on remote islands and various other situations,
the GSDF will transform two divisions and two brigades respectively
into two rapid deployment divisions and two rapid deployment brigades
that are furnished with advanced mobility and ISR capabilities. By
establishing a coast observation unit, area security units in charge of
initial response activities and so on, the defense posture of the remote
islands in the southwest region will be strengthened. In a bid to develop
suff cient amphibious operational capabilities, which enable the SDF
to land, recapture and secure without delay any remote islands that
might be invaded, an amphibious rapid deployment brigade consisting
of several regiment-scale units specializing in amphibious operations
will be established.
From the perspective of enabling swift and f exible operations,
while thoroughly facilitating eff ciency and rationalizing preparations
for invasion, such as the landing of large-scale ground forces, the
GSDF will steadily implement programs towards successive formation
of units equipped with newly-introduced mobile combat vehicles and
removal of tanks deployed in basic operational units stationed in
locations other than Hokkaido and Kyushu. It will also concentrate
tanks located in Kyushu into newly organized tank units under direct
command of the Western Army. In addition, the GSDF will steadily
carry out programs that concentrate howitzers deployed in basic
operational units stationed in locations other than Hokkaido into f eld
artillery units to be newly organized under the direct command of the
respective regional armies.
2. For the purpose of defending the seas surrounding Japan and ensuring
the security of maritime traff c in the region, through the effective
conduct of various operations such as persistent ISR operations and
anti-submarine operations, as well as for agile response in international
peace cooperation activities, the Marine Self-Defense Force (MSDF)
will retain four f otillas mainly consisting of one helicopter destroyer
(DDH), and two Aegis-equipped destroyers (DDG). Five divisions will
consist of other destroyers as well. Necessary measures to increase the
number of submarines will also be continued.
3. To enhance the air defense posture in the southwestern region, the Air
Self-Defense Force (ASDF) will relocate one f ghter squadron to Naha
Air Base, and newly organize and deploy one airborne early warning
squadron at Naha Air Base.
To prevent the relative decline of Japan’s air defense capabilities
and ensure sustained air superiority, ASDF units equipped with training
support functions will be integrated for further effective enhancement
of advanced tactical skills.
4. The total number of authorized GSDF personnel at the end of FY2018
will be approximately 159,000, with approximately 151,000 being
active-duty personnel, and approximately 8,000 being reserve-ready
personnel. The authorized number of active-duty personnel of the
MSDF and ASDF through FY2018 will be approximately at the same
levels as at the end of FY2013.
**III. Major Programs regarding SDF’s Capabilities**
1. Effective Deterrence and Response to Various Situations
(1) Ensuring Security of the Sea and Airspace Surrounding Japan
In order to strengthen the posture to conduct persistent ISR in broad
areas and to detect any signs of signif cant development at an early
stage, the SDF will procure additional Aegis-equipped destroyers
(DDG), destroyer (DD), submarines, f xed-wing patrol aircraft (P1) and patrol helicopters (SH-60K), and conduct service-extension
work on existing destroyers, submarines, f xed-wing patrol aircraft
(P-3C) and patrol helicopters (SH-60J), as well as take necessary
measures after fully reviewing the value of ship-based unmanned
aerial vehicles with patrol capabilities. With a view to increasing the
number of destroyers, the SDF will also introduce new, compacttype hull destroyers with additional multifunctional capabilities.
The SDF will procure new airborne early warning and control
aircraft or airborne early warning aircraft, and f xed air defense
radar, as well as continuously improve its existing airborne warning
and control systems (AWACS) (E-767). In addition, the introduction
of unmanned aerial vehicles will support the establishment of a
joint unit with persistent ISR capabilities in broad areas. The SDF
will also undertake organizational reform that integrate groundbased aerial search and rescue functions into the ASDF, which are
currently performed by both the MSDF and ASDF.
(2) Response to an Attack on Remote Islands
(a) Development of a Persistent ISR Structure
With a view to organizing the structure required to carry
out regular and persistent ISR activities which enable an
immediate response in the case of various contingencies, the
SDF will deploy a coast observation unit to Yonaguni Island.
Considering the current operational situation of the existing
AWACS (E-767) and airborne early warning aircraft (E-2C),
the SDF will procure new airborne early warning and control
aircraft or airborne early warning aircraft as stated in (1), and


-----

establish one squadron consisting of airborne early warning
aircraft (E-2C) in the air warning unit and deploy it at Naha
Air Base as stated in Section II-3. By preparing a deployment
structure for mobile air defense radar on remote islands in the
southwestern region, a fully-prepared surveillance posture will
be maintained.
(b) Obtaining and Securing Air Superiority
For overall improvement of air defense capabilities including
cruise missile defense capability, the SDF will increase the
number of f ghter aircraft units at Naha Air Base from one
squadron to two as stated in Section II-3, continue to facilitate
procurement of f ghter aircraft (F-35A), modernize its f ghter
aircraft (F-15), and improve the air-to-air combat capabilities
and network functions of its f ghter aircraft (F-2). In addition,
after considering its options, it will take necessary measures
to replace f ghter aircraft (F-15) unsuitable for modernization
with more capable f ghter aircraft. Along with continuing to
procure middle-range surface-to-air guided missiles, the SDF
will further improve its surface-to-air guided missile PATRIOT
systems by equipping them with new advanced interceptor
missiles (PAC-3 MSE) that can be used both for response to
cruise missiles and aircraft and for ballistic missile defense
(BMD). The SDF will also procure new aerial refueling/
transport aircraft, and continuously work to equip transport
aircraft (C-130H) with aerial refueling capabilities and procure
rescue helicopters (UH-60J). In addition, the SDF will examine
what is the appropriate air defense posture in remote islands in
the Pacif c.
(c) Obtaining and Securing Maritime Supremacy
In defense of the seas surrounding Japan and to ensure the
security of maritime traff c, the SDF will effectively conduct
various activities including holding persistent ISR and antisubmarine operations; procuring Aegis-equipped destroyers
(DDG), destroyer (DD), submarines, f xed-wing patrol aircraft
(P-1) and patrol helicopters (SH-60K); and conducting serviceextension activities on existing destroyers, submarines,
f xed-wing patrol aircraft (P-3C) and patrol helicopters (SH60J) as stated in (1). At the same time, it will introduce new
compact-type hull destroyers with multifunctional capabilities.
In addition, the SDF will introduce ship-based multipurpose
helicopters required for enabling destroyer units to sustainably
conduct activities as situations demand, and continue to
procure Mine Sweeper Ocean (MSO) vessels, amphibious
rescue aircraft (US-2), and surface-to-ship guided missiles.
(d) Improvement of Capabilities for Rapid Deployment and
Response
In order to secure capabilities for swift and large-scale
transportation and deployment operations and improve
effective response capabilities, transport aircraft (C-2) and
transport helicopters (CH-47JA) will continue to be procured.
Besides the ship-based multipurpose helicopters mentioned in
(c), the SDF will introduce tilt-rotor aircraft that complement
and strengthen the capabilities of transport helicopters (CH47JA) in terms of cruising speed and range. In addition, the
SDF will take necessary measures after considering the
possibility of new multipurpose helicopters that will success
the existing multipurpose helicopters (UH-1J). In developing
such aerial transport capabilities, the SDF will avoid functional
redundancy by clarifying the roles and assignments among the
various means of transportation.
The SDF will reinforce transportation and deployment
capabilities, by such means as acquiring amphibious vehicles
that support units’ amphibious landing efforts on remote
islands, and ref tting existing Tank Landing Ships (LST). The
SDF will consider what the role should be of a multipurpose
vessel with capabilities for command and control, large-scale
transportation, and aircraft operations, which can be utilized
in various operations such as amphibious operations, and
reach a conclusion regarding its acquisition. With a view to
eff ciently conducting large-scale transportation movements
in coordination with the SDF’s transport capabilities, the
SDF will take necessary measures after considering active
utilization of civilian transport capabilities including methods
for utilizing the funds and know-how of the private sector and
reserve personnel.
Mobile combat vehicles transportable by airlift will be
introduced in the rapidly deployable basic operational units
(rapid deployment divisions/brigades) highlighted in Section
II-1, and rapid deployment regiments that immediately respond
to various situations will be organized. The SDF will also
establish area security units in charge of initial responses on


maneuver deployment training for prompt unit deployment
to remote islands. While improving guidance capability of
existing precision-guided bombs and procuring surface-to-ship
guided missiles, the SDF will also promote the development of
improved capabilities of ship-to-ship guided missiles, such as
increasing their f ring range.
(e) Development of C3I
From the perspective of improving joint force capabilities,
aimed at establishing a command and control system which
enables the dynamic operation of units across the country so
as to immediately concentrate necessary units into the area to
be dealt with, such as remote islands, the SDF will take steps
to station GSDF, MSDF and ASDF personnel in the main
headquarters of each of the other services, making effective
use of the knowledge and experience held by each respective
service. In addition, as stated in Section II-1, the SDF will
expedite the establishment of the Ground Central Command,
while promoting eff ciency and rationalizing the command and
control functions of each regional army headquarters, as well
as reviewing the functions of some regional army headquarters.
With regard to the information and communications
capabilities which serve as a foundation for nation-wide
operations, and the goal of strengthening the communications
infrastructure on remote islands, the SDF will extend the
secured exclusive communication link for the SDF to Yonaguni
Island, and newly deploy mobile multiplex communication
equipment at Naha Air Base. The SDF will strive to enhance
data link functions among the three services, upgrade the f eld
communications systems, continue to promote the utilization
of outer space for defense-related purposes, and develop an
X-Band communications satellite with high performance. The
SDF will take additional necessary measures after considering
the necessity of further enhancements to its communications
systems.
(3) Response to Ballistic Missile Attacks
Given North Korea’s improved ballistic missile capabilities, the
SDF will pursue the comprehensive improvement of its response
capabilities against the threat of ballistic missiles.
For reinforcing its multi-layered and sustainable defense
posture for the entire territory of Japan against ballistic missile
attacks, the SDF will procure additional Aegis-equipped destroyers
(DDG), and continue to improve the capabilities of its existing
DDGs. As stated in (2)(b), the SDF will pursue further improvement
of its surface-to-air guided missile PATRIOT system so as to equip
it with new advanced interceptor missiles (PAC-3 MSE) that can
be used both for response to cruise missiles and aircraft and for
BMD. In addition, to reinforce its ballistic missile detecting and
tracking capabilities, the SDF will promote the improvement of its
automated warning and control systems (Japan Aerospace Defense
Ground Environment), as well as procurement and improvement of
its f xed air defense radar (FPS-7) systems.
Along with the continuous promotion of Japan-U.S. cooperative
development of advanced interceptor missiles for BMD (SM-3
Block IIA), the MOD will, after examining options, take necessary
measures for the transition to the production and deployment
phases. The SDF will conduct bilateral training and exercises to
enhance the effectiveness of the Japan-U.S. bilateral BMD response
posture, and make an effort to establish the basis for deployment of
the SDF to respond to a ballistic missile attack.
The MOD will conduct studies on the best mix of the overall
posture of its future BMD system, including the new BMD
equipment. Also, based on appropriate role-sharing between Japan
and the U.S., with a view to strengthening the deterrence capacity of
Japan-U.S. Alliance as a whole by enhancing Japan’s own deterrence
and response capabilities, the MOD will study its possible response
capability to address the means of ballistic missile launches and
related facilities, and will take necessary measures.
In preparation for an attack by guerrilla or special operations
forces concurrent with a ballistic missile attack, the SDF will
continue to procure a variety of surveillance equipment, light
armored vehicles, NBC reconnaissance vehicles, and transport
helicopters (CH-47JA) in order to improve its ISR posture, and its
ability to protect key facilities such as nuclear power plants, and
search and destroy inf ltrating units. In sensitive locations such as
where a number of nuclear power plants are located, the SDF will
conduct training with relevant agencies to conf rm coordination
procedures, and take necessary measures after considering the basis
for deployment in areas neighboring nuclear power plants.
(4) Response in Outer Space and Cyberspace
(a) Promoting Utilization of Outer Space
The SDF will continue to enhance information gathering

the SDF will actively promote space situational awareness
efforts, and research on satellite protection, and work to
enhance the resiliency of its satellites. In making such efforts,
given that relevant domestic organizations and the United
States possess the latest technologies and knowledge related to
outer space, the MOD will facilitate cooperation including in
the area of personnel development with such organizations.
(b) Response to Cyber Attacks
To continuously ensure suff cient security against cyber attacks,
with consideration to enhancing capabilities through joint
operations and eff ciency in resource allocations, the SDF will
establish the necessary system by such measures as to enhance
the survivability of the command and control systems and
information communication networks of the three services, to
strengthen capabilities for information gathering and research
and analysis, and to develop a practical training environment
where response capabilities against cyber attacks can be
tested. Through its efforts to secure response capabilities in
cyberspace where attackers have an overwhelming advantage,
the SDF may consider the acquisition of capabilities to prevent
them from using cyberspace. In addition, the SDF will strive
to keep abreast of the latest risks, response measures and
technological trends, including through cooperation with the
private sector, and strategic talks and joint exercises with allies.
Given that it is essential to employ personnel with expertise
on a continuing basis and that methods of cyber attack are
increasingly sophisticated and complicated, the SDF plans
to develop personnel with strong cyber security expertise,
through efforts such as improving the in-house curriculum
for specialized education, expanding learning opportunities
at institutions of higher education at home and abroad, and
cultivating expertise through personnel management efforts.
To enable a comprehensive response to cyber attacks
through a whole-of-government approach, the SDF will
enhance close coordination with relevant government agencies
by regularly providing expertise and MOD/SDF personnel, and
improve training and exercises.
(5) Response to Large-scale Disasters
In the event of a large-scale natural disaster such as the Nankai
Trough earthquake, or a special disaster such as a nuclear
emergency, the SDF will respond by immediately transporting and
deploying suff cient numbers of SDF units, as well as establishing
a rotating staff posture based on a joint operational approach. These
efforts will enable a sustained response over the long term. In these
efforts, the SDF will leverage lessons of vital importance learned
from the Great East Japan Earthquake, to gather information on the
extent and nature of the damage by aircraft from the initial stages
of the impact and immediately engage in rescue activities, for the
purpose of protecting people’s lives, In addition, it will implement
prompt emergency reconstruction activities including elimination
of road obstacles indispensable for the private sector’s efforts
including the smooth transportation of relief materials. With close
coordination and cooperation with relevant government agencies,
local governments and private sector organizations, the MOD will
promote such measures as to establish contingency planning and to
conduct training and exercises, and secure alternative capabilities
when the basis for the SDF’s disaster and deployment operations is
affected.
(6) Strengthening Intelligence Capabilities
Given that advanced intelligence functions lay the foundation
for MOD/SDF to suff ciently fulf ll their roles, the MOD will
strengthen all stages of its intelligence capabilities, including
gathering, analyzing, sharing and securing intelligence.
With regards to the methods for intelligence gathering and
analysis, with a view to f exibly meeting the demands of changes in
the security environment, the MOD will promote the development
and improvement of its intelligence gathering facilities, and
actively utilize the outer space and unmanned aerial vehicles so as
to drastically reinforce its capability to gather intelligence from the
diverse sources including SIGINT and IMINT. In a related move,
the MOD will develop the ability to utilize sophisticated GEOINT
by such means as visualization and prediction of situations with
a variety of information and intelligence overlaid on a map or
image, while promoting the comprehensive and eff cient geospatial
database development. The MOD will take measures to enhance its
HUMINT gathering capabilities including by increasing the number
of personnel to be newly dispatched as Defense Attachés. It will


from overseas through cooperation with the ally and partners, and
use of advanced system for collecting public information.
In an effort to meet the increasingly complex and diverse needs
from policy departments and operational sides, in a timely and
precise manner, in the increasingly severe security environment
surrounding Japan, the MOD will strengthen its comprehensive
information gathering and analysis capabilities, through such
efforts as the review of its recruitment efforts and the composition
of its human resources to develop highly competent analysts,
integration and enhancement of its cross-organizational intelligence
curriculum, and regularization of the efforts to place the intelligence
side personnel for a given period in the policy departments and
operational sides.
Considering the importance of information security, under
the current severe f scal situation, and in pursuit of more eff cient
intelligence gathering, the MOD will promote the all-source
analysis expected to create great synergies, through seeking to
enhance the posture of and the effective collection management,
and facilitating complete information sharing between those who
need to know, including relevant government agencies.
2. Stabilization of the Asia-Pacif c Region and Improvement of the
Global Security Environments
From the perspective of “Proactive Contribution to Peace” based on
the principle of international cooperation, aimed at stabilizing the
Asia-Pacif c region, Japan will enhance bilateral and multilateral
cooperative relations and conduct various activities including training
and exercises in a timely and appropriate manner, as well as actively
engage in international peace cooperation activities to properly address
global security challenges. The following elements will be particularly
important to these efforts:
(1) Holding Training and Exercises
In addition to timely and appropriate implementation of SDF
training and exercises, Japan will promote bilateral and multilateral
combined training and exercises in the Asia-Pacif c region,
proactively and visibly demonstrating our nation’s resolve and
advanced capabilities focused on regional stabilization. In addition,
it will seek to improve interoperability and build and strengthen
practical cooperative relationships with relevant countries.

Enhancing mutual understanding and relationships of trust with
other countries and international organizations is important as
the cornerstone of efforts to stabilize the security environment.
Japan will take further steps to promote bilateral and multilateral
defense cooperation and exchanges on various levels not limited
to high-level exchanges, but including unit-level exchanges, such
as building and strengthening cooperative relationships focused on
wide-ranging security issues of common interest including HA/DR,
maritime security, and ensuring the stable use of outer space and
cyberspace.
(3) Promoting Capacity Building Assistance
By utilizing the capabilities the SDF has accumulated, the MOD
will help countries concerned to enhance their military capabilities
in such f elds as HA/DR, disposal of landmines and unexploded
ordnance, and military medicine, so as to stabilize the security
environment, as well as strengthen relations with defense authorities
of those countries. Cooperating with partners actively engaged in
capacity building such as the United States and Australia, with due
consideration for coordination with diplomatic policies such as
the Off cial Development Assistance (ODA), Japan will provide
effective and eff cient support in capacity building.
(4) Ensuring Maritime Security
For the purpose of maintaining “Open and Stable Seas”, which
serve as the cornerstone of Japan’s peace and prosperity efforts as a
maritime state, and ensuring security of maritime traff c, the MOD
will further cooperate with allies to engage in anti-piracy activities
off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, as well as help
gulf countries improve their own capabilities. In other ocean not
surrounding Japan such as the Indian Ocean and the South China
Sea, the SDF will also leverage a variety of opportunities to promote
combined training and exercises with countries which share Japan’s
goal of maintaining maritime security.
(5) Implementing International Peace Cooperation Activities
To immediately commence international peace cooperation
activities, the SDF will reinforce its emergency response and
transport capabilities. To steadily engage in its activities for the long
term, the SDF will work to further ensure the safety of its activities
by strengthening information-gathering and equipment protection
capabilities, as well as continue efforts to improve communications,
supplies, military medicine, and support for families of military
personnel. By improving the capacity of the engineer units which
are highly appreciated at the SDF’s activity areas, the SDF will


-----

more effectively meet the needs of the SDF s activity areas. Japan
will strengthen the development of personnel who can play an
active role in the f eld of international peace cooperation activity,
and will send more personnel to mission headquarters of the U.N.
Peace Keeping Operation and U.N. Department of peacekeeping
operations which would help Japan in making more contribution in
the f eld.
The Japan Peacekeeping Training and Research Center will
expand its curriculum, and strengthen cooperation with relevant
government agencies, foreign countries, and non-governmental
organizations through efforts such as providing educational
opportunities to not only SDF personnel, but also candidates from
various backgrounds.
To correspond to the reality of the U.N. peacekeeping
operations, Japan will continue to consider how it might expand its
participation in such operations.
(6) Cooperating to Promote Arms Control, Disarmament and
Nonproliferation
In order to contribute to various activities in the f eld of arms
control and disarmament undertaken by the United Nations and
other organizations, Japan will continue its active engagement
including its contribution of personnel to these efforts. Given that
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles that serve
as their means of delivery pose a severe threat to the peace and
stability not only to Japan, but also to the international community
as a whole, in cooperation with relevant countries and international
organizations, Japan will facilitate efforts towards nonproliferation
such as participation in the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).
3. Basic Structure to Maximize Defense Capability
(1) Training and Exercises
To effectively respond to various contingencies and enhance its
deterrence effectiveness, the SDF’s joint training and exercises
and Japan-U.S. bilateral training and exercises will be conducted
in a tailored and visible way. Leveraging the lessons learned from
these training and exercises, the SDF will conduct regular studies
and reviews of its plans to address contingencies. Along with these
efforts, the SDF will expand the use of the good training environment
in Hokkaido, by SDF units across the country, to conduct effective
training and exercises. In addition, the SDF will facilitate active use
of LSTs and transport capabilities of the civilian sector, and improve
unit mobility. Doing so will enable nation-wide deployment of welltrained units stationed in Hokkaido. To carry out effective training
and exercises in the SDF’s southwestern region, where only limited
space is available for SDF training, and accounting for relations
with local communities, the MOD will continue effort to expand
the joint/shared use of U.S. Forces facilities with the SDF. In
addition, actively engaging in bilateral trainings at home and abroad
with U.S. Forces such as the U.S. Marines, the SDF will strive to
promptly develop suff cient amphibious operational capabilities.
Seeking to respond to various situations with a wholeof-government approach, coordination with relevant agencies
including police and f ref ghters, and the Japan Coast Guard will
be reinforced. In addition, the government will conduct various
simulation exercise and comprehensive training and exercises
regarding various situations including civil protection on a regular
basis in a tailored manner.
(2) Operational Infrastructure
Given that SDF camps and bases are indispensable for rapid
deployment and response to various contingencies as well as
for ensuring a sustained response posture for the long term,
the resiliency of military camps and bases will be enhanced. In
particular, the SDF will strengthen its capabilities to immediately
rebuild various camp and base support functions such as runways,
information-communication infrastructure, and stable fuel supply.
For the SDF to immediately utilize civilian airports and ports in
contingency situations, necessary measures will be taken with
consideration especially to developing a deployment structure in
the southwestern region. In addition, for the purpose of establishing
readiness capabilities, the SDF will store necessary ammunition
and spare ports in locations most appropriate for operations, as
well as steadily construct and maintain necessary living quarters
surrounding SDF camps and bases. From the perspective of enabling
a sustained response posture over the long term, various measures
supporting families of military personnel will be promoted.
To keep availability ratio of equipment at higher standards with
lower costs, the MOD will conduct research as to what activities
hamper improvement of availability ratio. In addition, given
that longer-term contracts raise predictability and enhance costeffectiveness, the MOD will expand the use of its new contract
system, Performance Based Logistics (PBL), under which the price
is to be determined according to realized performance.


(3) Personnel and Education
Given the more advanced and complex equipment, and more
diverse and internationalized missions in recent years, the SDF
will, from a long-standing perspective, promote feasible measures
to ensure the strength of its troops and the effective use of personnel
amid the severe f scal situation, taking into consideration a variety
of elements, including skills, experience, physical strength and
morale.
(a) Composition of Ranks and Age Distribution
Given the characteristics of respective units, for the purpose of
achieving a composition of ranks that enables the three services
to accomplish their respective missions in the most appropriate
and sustainable way, the SDF will promote measures to
secure and nurture appropriate-numbers of off cers, warrant
off cers and sergeants/petty off cers equipped with necessary
capabilities, as well as recruit in a planned manner high-quality
privates/seaman/airman.
To ensure an appropriate age distribution, in addition to
reviewing the retirement age of 60, the SDF will work to adjust
the age distribution in the respective off cer, warrant off cer,
sergeant/petty off cer, and private/seaman/airman ranks, by
encouraging early retirement and more appropriately managing
its privates/seaman/airman. While taking into consideration
the status guarantee of SDF personnel, the SDF will conduct
research on new systems for early retirement including
systems used by other countries. With a view to maintaining
the proper age distribution among airplane pilots, the SDF will
take measures to allow them to be re-employed in the private
sector. In addition, the SDF will review the f nal promotion rate
of off cers, warrant off cers and sergeants/petty off cers, and
manage personnel more appropriately with consideration to
personnel’s physical strength so as to maintain SDF’s strength.
(b) Effective Utilization of Human Resources
In order to more effectively make use of its personnel,
including its female personnel, the SDF will actively reappoint
retiring personnel possessing advanced knowledge, skills and
experience where such personnel prove benef cial to the overall
SDF’s strength.
To enable SDF personnel to pursue their missions with
high morale and a strong feeling of pride, the SDF will promote
measures related to honors and privileges including expansion
of the Defense Meritorious Badge program.
In order to strengthen the joint operations structure,
the SDF will enhance education and training, and, through
secondment to the Joint Staff Off ce and relevant ministries
and agencies, retain adequate personnel in the government
who have a broad outlook and ideas, as well as wide-ranging
experience in Japan’s security-affairs, and who can respond
f exibly and rapidly to a variety of situations.
(c) Recruitment and Re-employment Support
In light of the deteriorating recruiting environment, resulting
from social factors such as the declining birthrate and the
increased pursuit of higher education, in order to continue
to secure competent personnel in the coming years, the SDF
will work to enhance public understanding of national defense
and security issues, effectively engage in public relations to
adjust to the changing times, and coordinate and cooperate
with relevant ministries and agencies and local governments,
so as to spread the perception that the SDF is an attractive job
option.
As it is the responsibility of the Government of Japan
(GOJ) to provide f nancially for SDF personnel, compelled
to resign at a younger age than ordinary civil servants, by
strengthening collaboration with local governments and
relevant organizations, through sharing the knowledge, skills
and experience of retired SDF personnel with society, the
GOJ will facilitate such efforts as measures to provide more
incentives for companies to employ retired SDF personnel, and
encourage employment of retired SDF personnel in the public
sector, so as to improve their re-employment environment.
(d) Utilization of Personnel including Reserve Staff
In order to support sustainable unit operations in situations that
are becoming increasingly diversif ed and protracted, the SDF
will promote the use of ready reserve personnel and reserve
personnel in broad areas To that end, the SDF will facilitate the
appointment of reserve personnel and their assignment to duties
commensurate with their specialized knowledge and skills
including possible opportunities to work at headquarters, and
will also improve training for call-ups. Aiming at active use of
the private sector’s transport capabilities, necessary measures
will be taken to utilize reserve personnel including those who


-----

appointment of reserve personnel equipped with specialized
skills, including airplane pilots who the SDF releases to the
private sector for re-employment. Other necessary measures
will be taken as well with broad consideration to using
reserve personnel, including for call-ups in various situations.
Furthermore, to increase the adequacy of reserve personnel,
the SDF will seek to increase public awareness of the reserve
program, and take measures to provide more incentives for
reserve personnel themselves and companies to employ reserve
personnel.
(4) Medical
In order to keep SDF personnel in good health and enhance its
military medicine capabilities to enable the SDF to cope with a
diverse range of missions in responses to various situations and
international peace cooperation activities, the SDF will upgrade
its hospitals to hubs with enhanced functions, and promote the
formation of networks across hospitals and medical treatment
rooms. Along with contributions to medical services in local
communities, the SDF will establish an eff cient and high-quality
medical care structure, including improvements in the management
of the National Defense Medical College Hospital. By reinforcing
education for medical off cers, nurses and emergency medical
technicians, the SDF will make efforts to secure personnel with
more specialized and advanced skills. In addition, the SDF will
consider such matters as revision of regulations of emergency
medical treatment on situation responses, and improve frontline
f rst aid capabilities, and will put in place a posture for rapid
medical evacuation that takes into account the need for enhanced
joint service capabilities. Furthermore, the SDF will also reinforce
the functions of the National Defense Medical College, establishing
it as a hub for education, and research in the f eld of defense medical
science.
(5) Defense Production and Technology Base
Retaining an adequate level of defense production and a technology
base is essential not only for the production, operation, sustainment
of equipment, but also for research and development of equipment
that f ts the operational environment in Japan, and for the expected
potential to contribute to enhancing deterrence. Given that and
Japan’s intention to maintain and reinforce above-mentioned base,
the MOD will formulate a strategy that sets forth its future vision
for Japan’s defense production and technology base as a whole.
With a view to enhancing the technological capability and
improving productivity of Japan’s defense production and technology
base, as well as increasing global competitiveness, Japan will
actively promote cooperation on defense equipment and technology
development, such as through international joint development and
production with other countries including the United States and
the United Kingdom, utilizing the technological f elds where Japan
enjoys an advantage. In coordination with relevant government
agencies, the MOD will promote adapting defense equipment, such
as aircraft developed by the MOD/SDF, to civilian uses.
The MOD will promote international joint development and
production and civilian uses of defense equipment in a way that
benef t both manufacturers and the government.
(6) Eff cient Acquisition of Equipment
To carry out effective and eff cient acquisition of equipment,
a project manager system will be introduced so as to enhance
consistent project management including insertion of a
technological perspective throughout the life-cycle of equipment
design, R&D, full rate production, acquisition, sustainment,
capability upgrade and eventual disposal. In relevant efforts, the
MOD will establish a database of past contracts, which it will
use to develop a simulation model for price estimation, so as to
enable independent estimates of more appropriate acquisition
prices. While utilizing the private sector’s knowledge, the MOD
will actively train and appoint personnel to positions that require
knowledge, skills and specialized expertise in the acquisition
of equipment, such as specialists in cost analysis. In addition,
the MOD will develop a system that allows for reconsideration, including review of specif cations and project plans, when
there is a signif cant discrepancy between the estimated life-cycle
cost derived from the analysis concerned and the real value of the
life-cycle costs.
To allow for prompt and eff cient acquisitions, while ensuring
transparency and fairness, parties available for negotiated contracts
will be sorted and ranked as necessary so as to be useful. To
diversify contract types and allow for the eff cient acquisition of
various equipment, the government will take necessary measures
after considering further development of its contract system, to
incentivize companies to lower prices, introduce longer-term
contracts, which raise the predictability for companies and lead to


as, the use of a consortium that enables convergence of technologies
from respective, globally competitive companies.
(7) Research and Development (R&D)
Taking cost-effectiveness into account under Japan’s severe f scal
situation, the MOD will prioritize R&D projects that best meet the
operational needs of the SDF.
In order to strengthen its air defense capabilities, the MOD
will promote technical review of next-generation surface-to-air
guided missiles in view of replacing the functions both of the GSDF
middle-range surface-to-air guided missile and the ASDF PATRIOT
surface-to-air guided missiles. In addition, the MOD will promote
strategic studies including empirical research to accumulate and
enhance f ghter aircraft-related technologies in Japan so as to
keep an option for development of next-generation f ghter aircraft
including the possibility of international joint development of an
aircraft to replace the F-2 when it is time to retire it. Based on the
f ndings, the MOD will take necessary measures. In an effort to
improve ISR capability, the MOD will promote development of
SIGINT aircraft as well as research on new f xed air defense radar,
and sonars with higher detecting capabilities through simultaneous
use of multiple sonars. In addition, the MOD will conduct research
on unmanned equipment available for f exible operations in case
of various contingencies including large-scale natural disasters, and
promote R&D to improve existing equipment including vehicles,
ships and aircraft.
With a view to addressing emerging threats and securing
technological advantage in the areas of strategically important
f elds, the MOD will set a vision of future equipment which
shows a direction of medium- and long-term R&D with regard to
development of major equipment, in order to systematically conduct
advanced research from medium and long term perspectives. It will
do this while considering the latest trends in science and technology,
changes in battle f eld techniques, the potential for international
joint research and development, and availability of effective joint
operations among major pieces of equipment.
From a security standpoint, the MOD will also make an effort
to actively utilize civilian technologies applicable to defense
needs (dual-use technologies) by such means as enhancement of
coordination with universities and research institutions, while
strengthening the function of technology control to prevent outf ow
of advanced technologies. In doing so, the MOD will always pay
attention to keeping abreast of scientif c technological trends
including information relevant to technological development and
gathering industry-academic-government strengths. In a related
effort, the MOD will also promote to have military technologies
employed in civilian activities.
In order to achieve effective and eff cient R&D in consideration
of the items stated above, the MOD will re-examine its research and
development posture, and take necessary measures.
(8) Collaboration with Local Communities
As it is essential to closely coordinate with local governments in
such efforts as effective response to various contingencies, and
recruitment and re-employment support for SDF personnel, in
pursuit of facilitated harmonization between defense facilities
and their surrounding local communities, the MOD will continue
to advance measures targeting the areas around defense facilities,
as well as engage in various measures such as intensive public
relations activities focused on their policies and activities, in order
to secure the understanding and cooperation of local governments
and communities.
Given that the presence of SDF units makes a substantial
contribution to the maintenance and revitalization of local
communities in some areas, and supports medical services in
communities through emergency patient transport by SDF search
and rescue aircraft, etc., the MOD/SDF will give consideration
to the attributes of each area in the reorganization of units, and
deployment and administration of SDF camps and bases, etc. in order
to secure the understanding of local governments and residents. In
these efforts, based on the governmental contract policies vis-a-vis
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), while considering
eff ciencies, the MOD will promote various measures conducive to
local economies such as securing opportunities for local SMEs to
receive orders.
(9) Boosting Communication Capabilities
Given that understanding and support from Japanese people
and foreign countries are of utmost importance for successful
accomplishment of SDF missions, the MOD will strive to provide
information actively and effectively via various media sources such
as social media networks with due consideration to consistency in
the information content. Efforts to provide information to foreign
countries about MOD/SDF activities abroad will be facilitated by


-----

(10) Enhancing its Intellectual Base
To enhance understanding among Japanese citizens on security and
crisis management, the MOD will contribute to the promotion of
education on security-related matters at educational institutions,
including by MOD personnel presenting academic papers and
sending MOD lecturers as experts in security and crisis management.
The role of the National Institute for Defense Studies (NIDS) as a
think tank associated with the MOD will be strengthened, through
such efforts as facilitating coordination with policy-making
divisions by relocating the institute to the Ichigaya district (where
the MOD’s headquarters is located), and to by promoting academic
exchanges with foreign research institutions. The MOD will also
strive to administer the NIDS in such a way that it is capable of
dealing with policy issues that the MOD faces in a timely and
appropriate manner.
(11) Promoting Reform of the MOD
The MOD will further promote its reforms by regularly reviewing
its work methods and organization in order to foster a sense of unity
among civilian off cials and uniformed personnel, and to optimize
the build-up of defense capabilities, promote SDF joint operation
functions and enhance policy-making and communication functions.
In doing so, with the intention of optimizing its defense force buildup, the MOD will establish a planning system for defense build-up
with a focus on joint operation-based capability assessments, and
take measures to facilitate eff ciency and optimization in acquisition
of equipment, keeping in mind an option to establish a new agency
in the MOD. Also, to enhance the prompt and eff cient operation
of the SDF, by such effort as integration of duties related to actual
unit operations into the Joint Staff Off ce, the MOD will eliminate
overlapping duties in the Internal Bureau and the Joint Staff Off ce,
and conduct an organizational review including the reorganization
or disbanding of the Bureau of Operational Policy.
**IV. Measures for Strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance**
1. Strengthening Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation
In order to maintain and strengthen the U.S. commitment to Japan and
the Asia-Pacif c region and to ensure Japan’s national security, Japan
will continue the revision of and revise the Guidelines for Japan-U.S.
Defense Cooperation while strengthening Japan’s own capabilities as
a premise for these efforts.
Meanwhile, Japan will expand bilateral training and exercises,
joint ISR activities and the joint/shared use of facilities and areas by
the SDF and the U.S. forces. In addition, Japan will further deepen
various Japan-U.S. operational cooperation and policy coordination
in areas such as BMD, bilateral planning, and bilateral Extended
Deterrence Dialogue.
Japan will also strengthen cooperation not only in the f elds of
counter-piracy, capacity building assistance, HA/DR, peacekeeping
and counter-terrorism, but also in maritime affairs, outer space and
cyberspace.
Furthermore, Japan will strengthen and expand Japan-U.S.
cooperative relationship over a broad range of f elds, including
intelligence cooperation and information security, and defense
equipment and technology cooperation.
2. Measures for furthering Smooth and Effective Stationing of U.S.
Forces in Japan
From the perspective of making the stationing of the U.S. Forces in
Japan more smooth and effective, Japan will steadily ensure the Host

**Reference 17 Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and**
**Technology**

(Approved by the National Security Council
and the Cabinet on April 1, 2014)
The Government has made it its basic policy to deal with overseas transfer
of defense equipment and technology in a careful manner in accordance
with Prime Minster Eisaku Sato’s remarks at the Diet in 1967 (hereinafter
referred to as “the Three Principles on Arms Exports”) and the collateral
policy guideline by the Miki administration in 1976. These policy
guidelines have played a certain role as Japan has been following the
path of a peace-loving nation. On the other hand, these policy guidelines
including the non-permission of arms exports to communist bloc countries
have increasingly proved unsuitable for the current situation. Also, the
Government has repeatedly taken exemption measures depending on
the individual necessity of each case since arms exports to substantially
all areas were not permitted, as a result of not promoting arms exports
regardless of the destinations,.
Japan has consistently followed the path of a peace-loving nation
since the end of World War II. Japan has adhered to a basic policy of
maintaining an exclusively national defense-oriented policy, not becoming
a military power that poses a threat to other countries, and observing
the Three Non-Nuclear Principles. At the same time, surrounded by an
increasingly severe security environment and confronted by complex and
grave national security challenges, it has become essential for Japan to
make more proactive efforts in line with the principle of international
cooperation. Japan cannot secure its own peace and security by itself,
and the international community expects Japan to play a more proactive
role for peace and stability in the world commensurate with its national
capabilities. Against this backdrop, under the evolving security
environment, Japan will continue to adhere to the course that it has taken
to date as a peace-loving nation, and as a major player in world politics and
the world economy, contribute even more proactively in securing peace,
stability and prosperity of the international community, while achieving
its own security as well as peace and stability in the Asia-Pacif c region, as
a “Proactive Contributor to Peace” based on the principle of international
cooperation.
From the view point of achieving the fundamental principle of
national security by implementing concrete policies, the Government,
in accordance with the National Security Strategy adopted on December
17, 2013, decided to review the Government’s existing policy guidelines
on overseas transfer of defense equipment and technology, and set out
clear principles which f t the new security environment while giving due
consideration to the roles that the existing policy guidelines have played
so far and by consolidating the policy guidelines comprehensively with
consideration on the past exemption measures.


-----

An appropriate overseas transfer of defense equipment and technology
contributes to further active promotion of the maintenance of international
peace and security through timely and effective implementation of
contribution to peace and international cooperation such as international
peace cooperation, international disaster relief, humanitarian assistance,
responses to international terrorism and piracy, and capacity building of
developing countries (hereinafter referred to as “peace contribution and
international cooperation”). Such transfer also contributes to strengthening
security and defense cooperation with Japan’s ally, the United States as
well as other countries. Furthermore, it contributes to maintaining and
enhancing Japan’s defense production and technological bases, thereby
contributing to Japan’s enhancement of defense capability, given that
international joint development and production projects have become the
international mainstream in order to improve the performance of defense
equipment and to deal with their rising costs.
On the other hand, since the distribution of defense equipment and
technology has signif cant security, social, economic and humanitarian
impact on the international community, the need for each government to
control the transfer of defense equipment and technology in a responsible
manner while taking various factors into account is recognized.
In light of the above, while maintaining its basic philosophy as a
peace-loving nation that conforms to the Charter of the United Nations
and the course it has taken as a peace-loving nation, Japan will control
the overseas transfer of defense equipment and technology based on the
following three principles. The overseas transfer of facilities related to
arms production will continue to be treated in the same manner as defense
equipment and technology.
**1. Clarifi cation of cases where transfers are prohibited**
Overseas transfer of defense equipment and technology will not be
permitted when:
1) the transfer violates obligations under treaties and other international
agreements that Japan has concluded,
2) the transfer violates obligations under United Nations Security
Council resolutions, or
3) the defense equipment and technology is destined for a country party
to a conf ict (a country against which the United Nations Security
Council is taking measures to maintain or restore international
peace and security in the event of an armed attack).
**2. Limitation to cases where transfers may be permitted as well as strict**
**examination and information disclosure**
In cases not within 1. above, cases where transfers may be permitted
will be limited to the following cases. Those cases will be examined
strictly while ensuring transparency. More specif cally, overseas
transfer of defense equipment and technology may be permitted in
such cases as the transfer contributes to active promotion of peace
contribution and international cooperation, or to Japan’s security from
the viewpoint of—implementing international joint development and
production projects with countries cooperating with Japan in security
area including its ally, the U.S. (hereinafter referred to as “the ally and
partners”), —enhancing security and defense cooperation with the ally
and partners, as well as—supporting the activities of the Self-Defense
Forces including the maintenance of its equipment and ensuring the
safety of Japanese nationals. The Government will conduct strict
examination on the appropriateness of the destination and end user,
and the extent the overseas transfer of such equipment and technology
will raise concern for Japan’s security. Then the Government will
make a comprehensive judgment in light of the existing guidelines of
the international export control regime and based on the information
available at the time of export examinations.
Signif cant cases that require especially careful consideration from
the viewpoint of Japan’s security will be examined at the National
Security Council (NSC). As for the cases that were deliberated at the
NSC, the Government will disclose their information in accordance
with the Act on Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs
(Law No. 42 of 1999).
**3. Ensuring appropriate control regarding extra-purpose use or transfer**
**to third parties**
In cases satisfying 2. above, overseas transfer of defense equipment and
technology will be permitted only in cases where appropriate control is
ensured. More concretely, the Government will in principle oblige the
Government of the recipient country to gain its prior consent regarding
extra-purpose use and transfer to third parties. However, appropriate
control may be ensured with the conf rmation of control system at the
destination in such cases as those where the transfer is judged to be
appropriate for active promotion of peace contribution and international
cooperation, when the transfer involves participation in an international
system for sharing parts etc., and when the transfer involves delivery of
parts etc. to a licenser.
Implementation guidelines for the policy described above will be
decided by the NSC. The Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry will
i l h i h d i d A ( 228


of 1949) appropriately in accordance with the decision.
For the purpose of this policy, “defense equipment and technology”
refers to “arms and military technologies”; “arms” refers to items
listed in Section 1, Annexed List 1 of the Export Trade Control Order
(Cabinet Order No. 378 of 1949), and are to be used by military forces
and directly employed in combat; and “military technologies” refers to
technologies for the design, production or use of arms.
The Government will contribute actively to the peace and stability
of the international community as a “Proactive Contributor to Peace”
based on the principle of international cooperation. Under such policy,
it will play a proactive role in the area of controlling defense equipment
and technology as well as sensitive dual-use goods and technologies to
achieve the early entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty and further
strengthen the international export control regimes.

**Reference 18 The Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation**
**(April 27, 2015)**

**I. Defense Cooperation and the Aim of the Guidelines**
In order to ensure Japan’s peace and security under any circumstances,
from peacetime to contingencies, and to promote a stable, peaceful,
and prosperous Asia-Pacif c region and beyond, bilateral security and
defense cooperation will emphasize:

-  seamless, robust, fl exible, and effective bilateral responses;

-  synergy across the two governments’ national security policies;

-  a whole-of-government Alliance approach;

-  cooperation with regional and other partners, as well as international
organizations; and

-  the global nature of the Japan-U.S. Alliance.
The two governments will continuously enhance the JapanU.S. Alliance. Each government will maintain its individual defense
posture based on its national security policy. Japan will possess
defense capability on the basis of the “National Security Strategy”
and the “National Defense Program Guidelines”. The United States
will continue to extend deterrence to Japan through the full range of
capabilities, including U.S. nuclear forces. The United States also will
continue to forward deploy combat-ready forces in the Asia-Pacif c
region and maintain the ability to reinforce those forces rapidly.
The Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation (“the
Guidelines”) provide the general framework and policy direction
for the roles and missions of Japan and the United States, as well as
ways of cooperation and coordination, with a view to improving the
effectiveness of bilateral security and defense cooperation. In this way,
the Guidelines advance peace and security, deter conf ict, secure the
basis for economic prosperity, and promote domestic and international
understanding of the signif cance of the Japan-U.S. Alliance.
**II. Basic Premises and Principles**
The Guidelines, as well as actions and activities under the Guidelines, are
and will be consistent with the following basic premises and principles.
A. The rights and obligations under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation
and Security between Japan and the United States of America (the
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty) and its related arrangements, as well as
the fundamental framework of the Japan-U.S. Alliance, will remain
unchanged.
B. All actions and activities undertaken by Japan and the United
States under the Guidelines will be consistent with international
law, including the Charter of the United Nations and its provisions
regarding the peaceful settlement of disputes and sovereign equality
of States, as well as other relevant international agreements.
C. All actions and activities undertaken by Japan and the United States
will be in accordance with their respective constitutions, laws, and
regulations then in effect, and basic positions on national security
policy. Japan will conduct actions and activities in accordance with
its basic positions, such as the maintenance of its exclusively national
defense-oriented policy and its three non-nuclear principles.
D. The Guidelines do not obligate either government to take
legislative, budgetary, administrative, or other measures, nor do the
Guidelines create legal rights or obligations for either government.
Since the objective of the Guidelines, however, is to establish an
effective framework for bilateral cooperation, the two governments
are expected to ref ect in an appropriate way the results of these
efforts, based on their own judgment, in their specif c policies and
measures.
**III. Strengthened Alliance Coordination**
Effective bilateral cooperation under the Guidelines will require the
two governments to conduct close, consultative dialogue and sound
policy and operational coordination from peacetime to contingencies.
The two governments must be well informed and coordinate
at multiple levels to ensure successful bilateral security and defense
cooperation. To that end, the two governments will take advantage of
ll il bl h l t h i f ti h i d t


-----

seamless and effective whole-of-government Alliance coordination that
includes all relevant agencies. For this purpose, the two governments
will establish a new, standing Alliance Coordination Mechanism,
enhance operational coordination, and strengthen bilateral planning.
A. Alliance Coordination Mechanism
Persistent and emerging threats can have a serious and immediate
impact on the peace and security of Japan and the United States.
In order to address seamlessly and effectively any situation that
affects Japan’s peace and security or any other situation that may
require an Alliance response, the two governments will utilize the
Alliance Coordination Mechanism. This mechanism will strengthen
policy and operational coordination related to activities conducted
by the Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces
in all phases from peacetime to contingencies. This mechanism
also will contribute to timely information sharing as well as the
development and maintenance of common situational awareness.
To ensure effective coordination, the two governments will establish
necessary procedures and infrastructure (including facilities as well
as information and communication systems) and conduct regular
training and exercises.
The two governments will tailor to the situation the procedures
for coordination as well as the exact composition of participating
agencies within the Alliance Coordination Mechanism structure.
As part of these procedures, contact information will be shared and
maintained from peacetime.
B. Enhanced Operational Coordination
Enhanced bilateral operational coordination for f exible and
responsive command and control is a core capability of critical
importance to Japan and the United States. In this context, the two
governments recognize the continued importance of collocating
operational coordination functions to strengthen cooperation between
the Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces.
The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces
will exchange personnel to ensure robust information sharing, to
facilitate coordination from peacetime to contingencies, and to
support international activities. The Self-Defense Forces and the
United States Armed Forces, in close cooperation and coordination,
will take action through their respective chains-of-command.
C. Bilateral Planning
The two governments will continue to develop and update bilateral
plans to ensure smooth and effective execution of coordinated
operations by the Self-Defense Forces and the United States
Armed Forces. To ensure the effectiveness of the plans and the
ability to make f exible, timely, and appropriate responses, the
two governments will exchange relevant information, including
identifying operational and logistic support requirements and
sources in advance, as appropriate.
The two governments will conduct bilateral planning in
peacetime for contingencies relevant to Japan’s peace and security
through an upgraded Bilateral Planning Mechanism, which includes
relevant agencies of the respective governments. Bilateral plans will
be developed with input from relevant agencies, as appropriate.
The Security Consultative Committee (SCC) will continue to be
responsible for presenting directions, validating the progress of the
planning under the mechanism, and issuing directives as necessary.
The SCC will be assisted by an appropriate subordinate body.
Bilateral plans are to be ref ected appropriately in the plans of
both governments.
**IV. Seamlessly Ensuring Japan’s Peace and Security**
Persistent and emerging threats can have a serious and immediate
impact on Japan’s peace and security. In this increasingly complex
security environment, the two governments will take measures to ensure
Japan’s peace and security in all phases, seamlessly, from peacetime to
contingencies, including situations when an armed attack against Japan
is not involved. In this context, the two governments also will promote
further cooperation with partners.
The two governments recognize that these measures need to be
taken based on f exible, timely, and effective bilateral coordination
tailored to each situation and that interagency coordination is essential
for appropriate Alliance responses. Therefore, the two governments will
utilize the whole-of-government Alliance Coordination Mechanism, as
appropriate, to:

-  assess the situation;

-  share information; and

-  develop ways to implement the appropriate Alliance response,
including f exible deterrent options, as well as actions aimed at deescalation.
To support these bilateral efforts, the two governments also will
coordinate strategic messaging through appropriate channels on issues
that could potentially affect Japan’s peace and security.

**Reference 19 United States–Japan Roadmap for Realignment**
**Implementation**

(Washington, DC, May 1, 2006)
**Overview**
On October 29, 2005, the U.S.–Japan Security Consultative Committee
(SCC) members approved recommendations for realignment of U.S.
forces in Japan and related Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF) in their
document, “U.S.– Japan Alliance: Transformation and Realignment for
the Future.” In that document, the SCC members directed their respective
staffs “to f nalize these specif c and interrelated initiatives and develop
l i l di t i l t ti h d l l t th M h


2006. This work has been completed and is ref ected in this document.
**Finalization of Realignment Initiatives**
The individual realignment initiatives form a coherent package. When
implemented, these realignments will ensure a life-of-the-alliance
presence for U.S. forces in Japan.
The construction and other costs for facility development in the
implementation of these initiatives will be borne by the Government of
Japan (GOJ) unless otherwise specif ed. The U.S. Government (USG)
will bear the operational costs that arise from implementation of these
initiatives. The two Governments will f nance their realignment associated
costs consistent with their commitments in the October 29, 2005 SCC
document to maintain deterrence and capabilities while reducing burdens
on local communities.
**Key Implementation Details**
1. Realignment on Okinawa
(a) Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF)
 The United States and Japan will locate the FRF in a conf guration
that combines the Henoko-saki and adjacent water areas of
Oura and Henoko Bays, including two runways aligned in a
“V”-shape, each runway having a length of 1,600 meters plus
two 100-meter overruns. The length of each runway portion of
the facility is 1,800 meters, exclusive of seawalls (see attached
concept plan dated April 28, 2006). This facility ensures agreed
operational capabilities while addressing issues of safety, noise,
and environmental impacts.
 In order to locate the FRF, inclusive of agreed support facilities,
in the Camp Schwab area, necessary adjustments will be made,
such as reconf guration of Camp Schwab facilities and adjacent
water surface areas.
 Construction of the FRF is targeted for completion by 2014.
 Relocation to the FRF will occur when the facility is fully
operationally capable.
 Facility improvements for contingency use at ASDF bases at
Nyutabaru and Tsuiki related to replacement of Marine Corps Air
Station (MCAS) Futenma capabilities will be made, as necessary,
after conducting site surveys and before MCAS Futenma is
returned.
 Requirements for improved contingency use of civilian facilities
will be examined in the context of bilateral contingency planning,
and appropriate arrangements will be made in order to realize the
return of MCAS Futenma.
 In principle, the construction method for the FRF will be landf ll.
 The USG does not intend to operate f ghter aircraft from this
facility.
(b) Force Reductions and Relocation to Guam
 Approximately 8,000 III Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF)
personnel and their approximately 9,000 dependents will relocate
from Okinawa to Guam by 2014, in a manner that maintains
unit integrity. Units to relocate will include: III MEF Command
Element, 3rd Marine Division Headquarters, 3rd Marine
Logistics Group (formerly known as Force Service Support
Group) Headquarters, 1st Marine Air Wing Headquarters, and
12th Marine Regiment Headquarters.
 The affected units will relocate from such facilities as Camp
Courtney, Camp Hansen, MCAS Futenma, Camp Zukeran, and
Makiminato Service Area.
 The U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) forces remaining on Okinawa
will consist of Marine Air-Ground Task Force elements, such as
command, ground, aviation, and combat service support, as well
as a base support capability.
 Of the estimated $10.27 billion cost of the facilities and
infrastructure development costs for the III MEF relocation to
Guam, Japan will provide $6.09 billion (in U.S. FY2008 dollars),
including $2.8 billion in direct cash contributions, to develop
facilities and infrastructure on Guam to enable the III MEF
relocation, recognizing the strong desire of Okinawa residents
that such force relocation be realized rapidly. The United States
will fund the remainder of the facilities and infrastructure
development costs for the relocation to Guam estimated in
U.S. FY2008 dollars at $3.18 billion in f scal spending plus
approximately $1 billion for a road.
(c) Land Returns and Shared Use of Facilities
 Following the relocation to the FRF, the return of MCAS
Futenma, and the transfer of III MEF personnel to Guam, the
remaining facilities and areas on Okinawa will be consolidated,
thereby enabling the return of signif cant land areas south of
Kadena Air Base.
 Both sides will develop a detailed consolidation plan by March
2007. In this plan, total or partial return of the following six
candidate facilities will be examined:
 Camp Kuwae: Total return


-----

 Camp Zukeran: Partial return and consolidation of remaining
facilities and infrastructure to the extent possible.
 MCAS Futenma: Total return (see FRF section above).
 Makiminato Service Area: Total return.
 aha Port: Total return (relocated to the new facilities, including
additional staging constructed at Urasoe).
 Army POL Depot Kuwae Tank Farm No. 1: Total return.
 All functions and capabilities that are resident in facilities
designated for return, and that are required by forces remaining
in Okinawa, will be relocated within Okinawa. These relocations
will occur before the return of designated facilities.
 While emphasizing the importance of steady implementation
of the recommendations of the Special Action Committee on
Okinawa (SACO) Final Report, the SACO relocation and return
initiatives may need to be reevaluated.
 Camp Hansen will be used for GSDF training. Shared use that
requires no facility improvements will be possible from 2006.
 ASDF will use Kadena Air Base for bilateral training with U.S.
forces, taking into account noise impacts on local communities.
(d) Relationships among Initiatives
 Within the overall package, the Okinawa-related realignment
initiatives are interconnected.
 Specif cally, consolidation and land returns south of Kadena
depend on completing the relocation of III MEF personnel and
dependents from Okinawa to Guam.
 The III MEF relocation from Okinawa to Guam is dependent
on: (1) tangible progress toward completion of the FRF, and (2)
Japan’s f nancial contributions to fund development of required
facilities and infrastructure on Guam.
2. Improvement of U.S. Army Command and Control Capability
 U.S. Army command and control structure at Camp Zama will
be transformed by U.S. FY2008. The headquarters of the GSDF
Central Readiness Force subsequently will arrive at Camp Zama
by Japan FY2012; SDF helicopters will have access to Kastner
Heliport on Camp Zama.
 Along with the transformation of Army headquarters in Japan, a
battle command training center and other support facilities will
be constructed within Sagami General Depot (SGD) using U.S.
funding.
 In relation to this transformation, the following measures for eff cient
and effective use of Camp Zama and SGD will be implemented.
 Some portions of land at SGD will be returned for local
redevelopment (approximately 15 hectares (ha)) and for road
and underground rail (approximately 2ha). Affected housing
units will be relocated to Sagamihara Housing Area.
 A specif ed area of open space in the northwest section of SGD
(approximately 35ha) will be provided for local use when not
required for contingency or training purposes.
 Portions of the Chapel Hill housing area of Camp Zama
(1.1ha) will be returned to the GOJ following relocation of
affected housing units within Camp Zama. Further discussions
on possible additional land returns at Chapel Hill will occur as
appropriate.
3. Yokota Air Base and Airspace
 ASDF Air Defense Command (ADC) and relevant units will
relocate to Yokota Air Base in Japan FY2010. A bilateral master
plan for base use will be developed to accommodate facility and
infrastructure requirements.
 A bilateral, joint operations coordination center (BJOCC),
established at Yokota Air Base, will include a collocated air and
missile defense coordination function. The USG and GOJ will fund
their own required equipment and systems, respectively, while both
sides will coordinate appropriate funding of shared use equipment
and systems.
 The following measures will be pursued to facilitate movement of
civilian aircraft through Yokota airspace while satisfying military
operational requirements.
 Establish a program in Japan FY2006 to inform commercial
aviation entities of existing procedures to transit Yokota
airspace.
 Return portions of Yokota airspace to Japanese control by
September 2008; specif c portions will be identif ed by October
2006.
 Develop procedures in Japan FY2006 for temporary transfers
of air traff c control responsibility to Japanese authorities for
portions of Yokota airspace, when not required for military
purposes.
 Study the conditions required for the possible return of the
entire Yokota airspace as part of a comprehensive study of
options for related airspace reconf gurations and changes in
air traff c control procedures that would satisfy future patterns


of Japanese airspace. The study will take into account both
the lessons learned from the Kadena radar approach control
(RAPCON) transfer experience and the lessons learned from
experiences with collocation of U.S. forces and Japanese
controllers in Japan. This study will be completed in Japan
FY2009.
 The USG and GOJ will conduct a study of the specif c conditions
and modalities for possible civilian-military dual use of Yokota Air
Base, to be completed within 12 months from commencement.
 The study will be conducted on the shared understanding that
dual-use must not compromise military operations and safety
or the military operational capabilities of Yokota Air Base.
 Based upon the outcome of this study, the two governments
will consult and then make appropriate decisions on civilianmilitary dual-use.
4. Relocation of Carrier Air Wing from Atsugi Air Facility to Marine
Corps Air Station (MCAS) Iwakuni
 The relocation of Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5) squadrons from
Atsugi Air Facility to MCAS Iwakuni, consisting of F/A-18, EA6B, E-2C, and C-2 aircraft, will be completed by 2014, subsequent
to the following: (1) completion of necessary facilities, and (2)
adjustment of training airspace and the Iwakuni RAPCON airspace.
 Necessary facilities will be developed at Atsugi Air Facility to
accommodate MSDF E/O/UP-3 squadrons and other aircraft from
Iwakuni, taking into account the continued requirement for U.S.
operations from Atsugi.
 The KC-130 squadron will be based at MCAS Iwakuni with its
headquarters, maintenance support facilities, and family support
facilities. The aircraft will regularly deploy on a rotational basis
for training and operations to MSDF Kanoya Base and Guam. To
support the deployment of KC-l30 aircraft, necessary facilities will
be developed at Kanoya.
 U.S. Marine Corps CH-53D helicopters will be relocated from
MCAS Iwakuni to Guam when the III MEF personnel relocate from
Okinawa to Guam.
 Training airspace and Iwakuni RAPCON airspace will be adjusted
to fulf ll safely the training and operational requirements of U.S.
forces, Japan SDF, and commercial aircraft (including those in
neighboring airspace) through coordination by the Joint Committee.
 A bilateral framework to conduct a study on a permanent f eldcarrier
landing practice facility will be established, with the goal of
selecting a permanent site by July 2009 or the earliest possible date
thereafter.
 Portions of the future civilian air facility will be accommodated at
MCAS Iwakuni.
5. Missile Defense
 As both sides deploy additional capabilities and improve their
respective ballistic missile defense capabilities, close coordination
will continue.
 The optimum site for deployment of a new U.S. X-Band radar
system has been designated as ASDF Shariki Base. Necessary
arrangements and facility modif cations, funded by the USG, will
be made before the radar becomes operational in summer 2006.
 The USG will share X-Band radar data with the GOJ.
 U.S. Patriot PAC-3 capabilities will be deployed to Japan within
existing U.S. facilities and areas, becoming operational at the
earliest possible time.
6. Training Relocation
 Both sides will develop annual bilateral training plans beginning
in Japan FY2007. As necessary, a supplemental plan for Japan
FY2006 can be developed.
 Initially, aircraft from three U.S. facilities — Kadena, Misawa, and
Iwakuni — will participate in relocated training conducted from
the following SDF facilities: Chitose, Misawa, Hyakuri, Komatsu,
Tsuiki, and Nyutabaru. Both sides will work toward expanding use
of SDF facilities for bilateral training and exercises in the future.
 The GOJ will improve infrastructure for training relocation at SDF
facilities as necessary after conducting site surveys.
 Relocated training will not diminish the quality of training that
is currently available to U.S. forces in Japan, taking into account
facilities and training requirements.
 In general, bilateral training will commence with participation of
1–5 aircraft for the duration of 1–7 days, and develop over time to
participation of 6–12 aircraft for 8–14 days at a time.
 At those SDF facilities at which terms of joint use are stipulated
by Joint Committee agreements, limitations on the number of joint
training events will be removed. Limitations on the total days and
period per training event for joint use of each SDF facility will be
maintained.
 The USG and GOJ will share costs for bilateral training as
appropriate, bearing in mind the priority of maintaining readiness.

**Reference 23 Joint Statement of the Security Consultative Committee**

**(April 27, 2015)**
**A STRONGER ALLIANCE FOR A DYNAMIC SECURITY ENVIRONMENT**
**The New Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation**
**1. OVERVIEW**
Minister for Foreign Affairs Fumio Kishida, Minister of Defense Gen
Nakatani, Secretary of State John Kerry, and Secretary of Defense Ashton
Carter convened the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee (SCC) in
New York on April 27, 2015. In light of the evolving security environment,
the Ministers reconf rmed the Alliance’s commitment to the security of
Japan and to the maintenance of international peace and security.
The Ministers announced the approval and release of new, revised
“Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation” (the Guidelines), which
update the roles and missions of the two countries and promote a more
balanced and effective Alliance to meet the emerging security challenges
of the 21st century. The Ministers discussed a variety of regional and
global challenges, initiatives to enhance bilateral security and defense
cooperation in various areas, promotion of enhanced regional cooperation,
and moving forward on the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan.
As articulated in its 2015 National Security Strategy, the United
States is actively implementing its rebalance to the Asia-Pacif c region.
Central to this is the ironclad U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan,
through the full range of U.S. military capabilities, including nuclear and
conventional. Japan highly values U.S. engagement in the region. In this
context, the Ministers reaff rmed the indispensable role of the Japan-U.S.
Alliance in promoting regional peace, security, and prosperity.
As Japan continues its policy of “Proactive Contribution to Peace,”
based on the principle of international cooperation, the United States
welcomes and supports Japan’s recent monumental achievements. Among
these are: the cabinet decision by the Government of Japan on July 1,
2014, for developing seamless security legislation; the creation of its
National Security Council; the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology; the Act on the Protection of Specially
Designated Secrets; the Basic Act on Cybersecurity; the new Basic Plan
on Space Policy; and the Development Cooperation Charter.
The Ministers aff rmed that the Japan-U.S. Alliance, strengthened by
the new Guidelines and the two countries’ respective security and defense
policies, continues to serve as the cornerstone of peace and security in the
Asia-Pacif c region as well as a platform for promoting a more peaceful
and stable international security environment.
The Ministers also reaff rmed that the Senkaku Islands are territories
under the administration of Japan and therefore fall within the scope of
the commitments under Article 5 of the Japan-U.S. Treaty of Mutual
Cooperation and Security, and that they oppose any unilateral action that
seeks to undermine Japan’s administration of these islands.
**2. THE NEW GUIDELINES FOR JAPAN-U.S. DEFENSE COOPERATION**
The Guidelines, which were f rst approved on November 27, 1978, and
revised on September 23, 1997, have provided a general framework and
policy direction for the roles and missions of the two countries, as well
as ways of cooperation and coordination. At the SCC meeting in Tokyo
on October 3, 2013, the Ministers shared views on the evolving security
environment and directed the Subcommittee for Defense Cooperation
(SDC) to draft recommended changes to the 1997 Guidelines to ensure
that the Alliance continues its vital role in deterring conf ict and advancing
peace and security.
Today, the SCC approved the SDC’s recommended new Guidelines,
which accomplishes the objectives outlined by the Ministers in October
2013. The new Guidelines, which replace the 1997 Guidelines, update
the general framework and policy direction for the roles and missions
of the two countries and manifest a strategic vision for a more robust
Alliance and greater shared responsibilities by modernizing the Alliance
and enhancing its deterrence and response capabilities in all phases, from
peacetime to contingencies.
Recognizing the signif cance of ensuring consistency between the new
Guidelines and Japan’s efforts to develop seamless security legislation, the
Ministers acknowledged that such legislation would make bilateral efforts
under the new Guidelines more effective The United States welcomes and

plans to procure advanced ISR platforms;

-  praised expanded logistics and defense equipment cooperation, as
ref ected by Japan’s new Three Principles on Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology and the recent U.S. decision to establish
an F-35 regional maintenance, repair, overhaul, and upgrade capability
in Japan. The Ministers highlighted strengthened defense equipment
cooperation through the linkage of the Systems and Technology Forum
and the Alliance Roles, Missions, and Capabilities dialogue, which
facilitates joint research and development of advanced capabilities; and

-  aff rmed the importance of enhanced information security cooperation,
as ref ected by continued progress through the Bilateral Information
Security Consultations and by Japan’s implementation of the Act on
the Protection of Specially Designated Secrets. As a result of this
legislation, the Government of Japan has put in place the policies,
practices, and procedures necessary to facilitate the secure exchange of
sensitive information in peacetime and during contingencies.
In addition, the Ministers aff rmed that host nation support has
demonstrated continued Japanese support for the forward-deployed
presence of U.S. forces in Japan, which contributes to Japan’s peace and
security in an increasingly complex security environment. The Ministers,
noting that the current host nation support commitment, as stipulated
in June 2011 SCC documents, expires in March 2016, expressed their
intention to start consultations on future arrangements to provide an
appropriate level of host nation support.
Recognizing the expanding scope of bilateral activities, the Ministers
aff rmed their intent to consider at the earliest opportunity an appropriate
bilateral consultation framework that would enhance the eff ciency and
effectiveness of Alliance management processes.
**4. REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION**
Recognizing the Japan-U.S. Alliance as the cornerstone of peace and
security in the Asia-Pacif c region as well as a platform for promoting a
more peaceful and stable international security environment, the Ministers
highlighted recent progress in the following areas:

-  Increased cooperation in Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief
operations, as ref ected by close coordination in responding to the
November 2013 typhoon in the Philippines;

-  Continued close coordination on partner capacity building, particularly
in Southeast Asia, including through the provision of coastal patrol
vessels and other maritime security capacity building endeavors; and

-  Expanded trilateral and multilateral cooperation, particularly with key
partners such as the Republic of Korea (ROK) and Australia, as well as
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The Ministers highlighted
the recent signing of a trilateral information sharing arrangement with
the ROK concerning the nuclear and missile threats posed by North
Korea, and resolved to utilize the framework as the foundation for
expanded trilateral cooperation into the future. The Ministers also
aff rmed their intention to pursue closer cooperation with Australia
on capacity building activities in Southeast Asia, and on security and
defense issues through the Security and Defense Cooperation Forum.
**5. REALIGNMENT OF U.S. FORCES IN JAPAN**
The Ministers reaff rmed the two governments’ continued commitment to
implement the existing arrangements on the realignment of U.S. forces in
Japan as soon as possible, while ensuring operational capability, including
training capability, throughout the process. The Ministers underscored
their commitment to maintaining a robust and f exible force posture that
enhances deterrence by strengthening the capability to respond effectively
to future challenges and threats, while also mitigating the impact of U.S.
forces on local communities. In this context, the Ministers welcomed
the relocation of the KC-130 squadron from Marine Corps Air Station
(MCAS) Futenma to MCAS Iwakuni and conf rmed their commitment
to continue aviation training relocation, including to locations outside of
Okinawa, through efforts such as the development of training areas and
facilities.
As an essential element of this effort, the Ministers reconf rmed that
the plan to construct the Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF) at the
Camp Schwab-Henokosaki area and adjacent waters is the only solution
that addresses operational, political, f nancial, and strategic concerns and
avoids the continued use of MCAS Futenma. The Ministers reaff rmed the
two governments’ unwavering commitment to the plan and underscored
their strong determination to achieve its completion and the long-desired
return of MCAS Futenma to Japan. The United States welcomes the steady
and continuing progress of FRF construction projects.
The Ministers also reconf rmed the importance of land returns south
of Kadena Air Base based on the 2006 “Roadmap” and the April 2013
Consolidation Plan, and reiterated the two governments’ determination to
work continuously on the implementation of the plan and anticipated the
update of the plan by Spring 2016. The Ministers highlighted the on-time
return of the West Futenma Housing Area of Camp Zukeran on March 31
of this year, which marked the most signif cant land return completed to
date in accordance with the plan


The Ministers conf rmed that the two governments are steadily
implementing the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps personnel from
Okinawa to locations outside of Japan, including Guam, based upon the
amended Guam International Agreement.
The Ministers reaff rmed their commitment to strengthening
cooperation to protect the environment and conf rmed the importance of
making further efforts in environmental matters. To that end, the Ministers
welcomed progress on a supplementary Agreement on Cooperation in
the Field of Environmental Stewardship and conf rmed their intention
to continue negotiating the ancillary documents of the Agreement as
expeditiously as possible.

**Reference 26 Outline of Cost Sharing of the Stationing of the USFJ**

|Item|Outline|Ground|
|---|---|---|
|Costs for Facilities Improvement Program (FIP)1|Barracks, family housing, environmental facilities, etc., have been constructed in the USFJ facilities and areas by the GOJ since FY1979 and provided to the USFJ|Within the Framework of the Status of Forces Agreement|
|Labor costs|Welfare costs, etc., since FY1978 and portion of pay that exceeds the pay conditions of national public employees since FY1979 have been borne by the GOJ (USFJ differential, language allowance, and portion of the retirement allowance which exceeds the pay standard of national public employees were abolished in FY2008, upon the provision of measures to avoid drastic changes in payments)|Within the Framework of the Status of Forces Agreement|
||Eight kinds of allowances such as adjustment allowance have been borne by the GOJ since FY1987|Special Measures Agreement (FY1987)|
||Basic pay, etc., have been borne by the GOJ since FY1991 (by gradually increasing the costs borne by the GOJ, the total amount has been borne within the scope of the upper limit of the number of workers since FY1996)|Special Measures Agreement (FY1991)|
||The upper limit of the number of workers that the GOJ funds is to be reduced in stages from 23,055 to 22,625 during the SMA period|Special Measures Agreement (FY2011)|
|Utilities costs|Electricity, gas, water supply, sewage and fuel costs (for heating, cooking or hot water supply) have been borne by the GOJ since FY1991 (by gradually increasing the costs borne by the GOJ, the total amount has been borne within the scope of the upper limit of the procured quantity since FY1995)|Special Measures Agreement (FY1991)|
||The upper limit of the procured quantity provided in the Special Measures Agreement (FY1996) has been cut by 10% after subtracting the quantity of the off-base U.S. residential housing since FY2001|Special Measures Agreement (FY2001)|
||The GOJ will bear the costs for fuel, etc., equivalent to 24.9 billion yen, a reduction of 1.5% from the FY2007 budget for FY2009 and 2010|Special Measures Agreement (FY2008)|
||The GOJ will provide the annual utilities costs up to 24.9 billion yen each year. The adjustment borne by the GOJ, will be phased in from current 76% (approximate) to 72% over the new SMA period|Special Measures Agreement (FY2011)|
|Training relocation costs|Additionally required costs incident to the relocation of the training requested by the Government of Japan have been borne by the GOJ since FY1996|Special Measures Agreement (FY1996)|



Notes: 1. Concerning the costs for FIP, the Government of Japan formulated the “Criteria for adopting FIP projects” to make an effort for effi ciency in the implementation of FIP as follows:
1) Concerning facilities contributing to the improvement of foundation for the stationing of USFJ (bachelor housing, family housing, and others), the Government of Japan improves
those facilities steadily considering necessity, urgency, and other factors. 2) Concerning welfare facilities such as recreational facilities and entertainment-oriented facilities, the
Government of Japan especially scrutinizes the necessity and refrains from newly adopting facilities regarded as entertainment-oriented and profi t-oriented (shopping malls and
others).

**Reference 28 The SACO Final Report**

(December 2, 1996)
The Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) was established in
November 1995 by the Governments of Japan and the United States. The
two Governments launched the SACO process to reduce the burden on the
people of Okinawa and thereby strengthen the Japan–U.S. alliance.
The mandate and guidelines for the SACO process were set forth
by the Governments of Japan and the United States at the outset of
the joint endeavor. Both sides decided that the SACO would develop
recommendations for the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) on
ways to realign, consolidate and reduce U.S. facilities and areas, and
adjust operational procedures of U.S. forces in Okinawa consistent with
their respective obligations under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation
and Security and other related agreements. The work of the SACO was


scheduled to conclude after one year.
The SCC which was held on April 15, 1996, approved the SACO
Interim Report which included several signif cant initiatives, and
instructed the SACO to complete and recommend plans with concrete
implementation schedules by November 1996.
The SACO, together with the Joint Committee, has conducted a series
of intensive and detailed discussions and developed concrete plans and
measures to implement the recommendations set forth in the Interim
Report.
Today, at the SCC, Minister Ikeda, Minister Kyuma, Secretary Perry
and Ambassador Mondale approved this SACO Final Report. The plans
and measures included in this Final Report, when implemented, will reduce
the impact of the activities of U.S. forces on communities in Okinawa.
At the same time, these measures will fully maintain the capabilities and


-----

protection requirements. Approximately 21 percent of the total acreage of
the U.S. facilities and areas in Okinawa excluding joint use facilities and
areas (approx. 5,002ha/12,361 acres) will be returned.
Upon approving the Final Report, the members of the SCC welcomed
the successful conclusion of the yearlong SACO process and underscored
their strong resolve to continue joint efforts to ensure steady and prompt
implementation of the plans and measures of the SACO Final Report. With
this understanding, the SCC designated the Joint Committee as the primary
forum for bilateral coordination in the implementation phase, where
specif c conditions for the completion of each item will be addressed.
Coordination with local communities will take place as necessary.
The SCC also reaff rmed the commitment of the two governments to
make every endeavor to deal with various issues related to the presence and
status of U.S. forces, and to enhance mutual understanding between U.S.
forces and local Japanese communities. In this respect, the SCC agreed
that efforts to these ends should continue, primarily through coordination
at the Joint Committee.
The members of the SCC agreed that the SCC itself and the Security
Sub-Committee (SSC) would monitor such coordination at the Joint
Committee described above and provide guidance as appropriate. The
SCC also instructed the SSC to seriously address the Okinawa-related
issues as one of the most important subjects and regularly report back to
the SCC on this subject.
In accordance with the April 1996 Japan–U.S. Joint Declaration on
Security, the SCC emphasized the importance of close consultation on the
international situation, defense policies and military postures, bilateral
policy coordination and efforts towards a more peaceful and stable
security environment in the Asia-Pacif c region. The SCC instructed the
SSC to pursue these goals and to address the Okinawa related issues at
the same time.

all personnel under the SOFA obtain supplemental auto insurance
beginning in January 1997.
— Payment for claims
Make joint efforts to improve payment procedures concerning claims
under paragraph 6, Article XVIII of the SOFA in the following manner:

-  Requests for advance payments will be expeditiously processed and
evaluated by both Governments utilizing their respective procedures.
Whenever warranted under U.S. laws and regulatory guidance,
advance payment will be accomplished as rapidly as possible.

-  A new system will be introduced by the end of March 1998, by which
Japanese authorities will make available to claimants no interest
l i i d f h f l dj di i f l i


-----

by U.S. authorities.

-  In the past there have been only a very few cases where payment
by the U.S. Government did not satisfy the full amount awarded by
a f nal court judgment. Should such a case occur in the future, the
Government of Japan will endeavor to make payment to the claimant,
as appropriate, in order to address the difference in amount.
— Quarantine procedures
Implement the updated agreement on quarantine procedures announced
by the Joint Committee on December 2, 1996.
— Removal of unexploded ordnance in Camp Hansen
Continue to use USMC procedures for removing unexploded ordnance
in Camp Hansen, which are equivalent to those applied to ranges of the
U.S. forces in the United States.
— Continue efforts to improve the SOFA procedures in the Joint
Committee

**The SACO Final Report on Futenma Air Station**
**(an integral part of the SACO Final Report)**
(Tokyo, Japan, December 2, 1996)
1. Introduction
a. At the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) held on December
2, 1996, Minister Ikeda, Minister Kyuma, Secretary Perry, and
Ambassador Mondale reaff rmed their commitment to the Special
Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) Interim Report of April
15, 1996 and the Status Report of September 19, 1996. Based
on the SACO Interim Report, both Governments have been
working to determine a suitable option for the return of Futenma
Air Station and the relocation of its assets to other facilities and
areas in Okinawa, while maintaining the airf eld’s critical military
functions and capabilities. The Status Report called for the Special
Working Group on Futenma to examine three specif c alternatives:
1) incorporate the heliport into Kadena Air Base; 2) construct a
heliport at Camp Schwab; and 3) develop and construct a sea-based
facility (SBF).
b. On December 2, 1996, the SCC approved the SACO recommendation
to pursue the SBF option. Compared to the other two options, the
SBF is judged to be the best option in terms of enhanced safety
and quality of life for the Okinawan people while maintaining
operational capabilities of U.S. forces. In addition, the SBF can
function as a f xed facility during its use as a military base and can
also be removed when no longer necessary.
c. The SCC will establish a bilateral U.S.–Japan working group under
the supervision of the Security Sub-Committee (SSC) entitled the
Futenma Implementation Group (FIG), to be supported by a team of
technical experts. The FIG, working with the Joint Committee, will
develop a plan for implementation no later than December 1997.
Upon SCC approval of this plan, the FIG, working with the Joint
Committee, will oversee design, construction, testing, and transfer
of assets. Throughout this process, the FIG will periodically report
to the SSC on the status of its work.
2. Decisions of the SCC
a. Pursue construction of an SBF to absorb most of the helicopter
operational functions of Futenma Air Station. This facility will be
approximately 1,500 meters long, and will support the majority of
Futenma Air Station’s f ying operations, including an Instrument
Flight Rules (IFR) — capable runway (approximately 1,300 meters
long), direct air operations support, and indirect support infrastructure
such as headquarters, maintenance, logistics, quality-of-life functions,
and base operating support. The SBF will be designed to support
basing of helicopter assets, and will also be able to support short-f eld
aircraft operations.
b. Transfer 12 KC-130 aircraft to Iwakuni Air Base. Construct facilities
at this base to ensure that associated infrastructure is available to
support these aircraft and their missions.
c. Develop additional facilities at Kadena Air Base to support aircraft,
maintenance, and logistics operations which are currently available
at Futenma Air Station but are not relocated to the SBF or Iwakuni
Air Base.
d. Study the emergency and contingency use of alternate facilities,
which may be needed in the event of a crisis. This is necessary
because the transfer of functions from Futenma Air Station to the
SBF will reduce operational f exibility currently available.
e. Return Futenma Air Station within the next f ve to seven years, after
adequate replacement facilities are completed and operational.
3. Guiding Principles
a. Futenma Air Station’s critical military functions and capabilities
will be maintained and will continue to operate at current readiness
levels throughout the transfer of personnel and equipment and the
relocation of facilities.
b. To the greatest extent possible, Futenma Air Station’s operations
and activities will be transferred to the SBF. Operational capabilities


and contingency planning f exibility which cannot be supported by
the shorter runway of the SBF (such as strategic airlift, logistics,
emergency alternate divert, and contingency throughput) must be
fully supported elsewhere. Those facilities unable to be located on
the SBF, due to operational cost, or quality-of-life considerations,
will be located on existing U.S. facilities and areas.
c. The SBF will be located off the east coast of the main island of
Okinawa, and is expected to be connected to land by a pier or
causeway. Selection of the location will take into account operational
requirements, airspace and sea-lane deconf iction, f shing access,
environmental compatibility, economic effects, noise abatement,
survivability, security, and convenient, acceptable personnel access
to other U.S. military facilities and housing.
d. The design of the SBF will incorporate adequate measures to ensure
platform, aircraft, equipment, and personnel survivability against
severe weather and ocean conditions; corrosion control treatment
and prevention for the SBF and all equipment located on the SBF;
safety; and platform security. Support will include reliable and
secure fuel supply, electrical power, fresh water, and other utilities
and consumables. Additionally, the facility will be fully selfsupporting for short-period contingency/emergency operations.
e. The Government of Japan will provide the SBF and other relocation
facilities for the use of U.S. forces, in accordance with the U.S.–
Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security and the Status of
Forces Agreement. The two Governments will further consider all
aspects of life-cycle costs as part of the design/acquisition decision.
f. The Government of Japan will continue to keep the people of
Okinawa informed of the progress of this plan, including concept,
location, and schedules of implementation.
4. Possible Sea-Based Facility Construction Methods
Studies have been conducted by a “Technical Support Group” comprised
of Government engineers under the guidance of a “Technical Advisory
Group” comprised of university professors and other experts outside
the Government. These studies suggested that all three construction
methods mentioned below are technically feasible.
a. Pile Supported Pier Type (using f oating modules) — supported by a
number of steel columns f xed to the sea bed.
b. Pontoon Type — platform consisting of steel pontoon type units,
installed in a calm sea protected by a breakwater.
c. Semi-Submersible Type — platform at a wave free height, supported
by buoyancy of the lower structure submerged under the sea.
5. The Next Steps
a. The FIG will recommend a candidate SBF area to the SCC as
soon as possible and formulate a detailed implementation plan
no later than December 1997. This plan will include completion
of the following items: concept development and def nitions of
operational requirements, technology performance specif cations
and construction method, site survey, environmental analysis, and
f nal concept and site selection.
b. The FIG will establish phases and schedules to achieve operational
capabilities at each location, including facility design, construction,
installation of required components, validation tests and suitability
demonstrations, and transfer of operations to the new facility.
c. The FIG will conduct periodic reviews and make decisions at
signif cant milestones concerning SBF program feasibility.

**Reference 33 Direction of the MOD Reform**

August 30, 2013
Ministry of Defense

**1. Regarding the Previous MOD Reform (2007–2009)**
1. Details
In response to the frequent incidence of scandals within the MOD
and the SDF, the Council for Reforming the Ministry of Defense was
established in the Prime Minister’s Off ce in December 2007. The
Council engaged in repeated discussions, and in July 2008, compiled
a report which detailed the analysis of scandals and the direction of


Ministry of Defense )
In August of that year, the Ministry of defense decided upon the
“Implementation Plan for Realizing Reform of the Ministry of Defense”
and the “Basic Policy for Organizational Reform of the Ministry of
Defense,” based on the direction for reform presented by the Council for
Reforming the Ministry of Defense. In accordance with these, efforts
were made to prevent the recurrence of scandals through the execution
of reforms in the three areas of ensuring thorough observance of rules
and regulations, establishment of professionalism, and establishment
of operational management in a form that focused on the execution of
duties, with the aim of optimization across the board. At the same time,
in an effort to advance drastic realignment of the central organization
in two stages, the Defense Council was f rst to be established in law as
of FY2009, the post of the Director of Defense was abolished and the
post of the Special Adviser to the Minister of Defense newly created.
Furthermore, incorporated into the FY2010 budget request of
the end of August 2009 as the second stage of reorganization, was a
reorganization proposal detailing plans to unify defense capabilities
build-up departments in the MOD central organization, into the Internal
Bureau, and to unify the operational departments into the Joint Staff
(hereinafter the “2010 Reorganization Proposal”). However, due to the
administrative changeover to the Democratic Party in September of that
year, the proposal was relinquished after the budget request scheduled
in October had been suspended.

2. Ministry of Defense Central Reorganization Proposal Scheduled for
FY2010
The contents of the 2010 Reorganization Proposal included (1)
establishment of permanent posts for uniformed personnel in the
Internal Bureau in order to foster a sense of unity among civilian off cials
and uniformed personnel, (2) reorganization of the Bureau of Defense
Policy and strengthening of its functions, (3) creation of a new Buildup Plan Bureau (provisional title) in the Internal Bureau, through the
fusion of the Internal Bureau and the departments involved in defense
capabilities build-up in each of the Staff Off ces, in order to achieve
optimization across the whole of defense capabilities build-up, which
had be optimized individually for each of the Ground, Maritime and
Air Self-Defense Forces, and (4) abolition of the Bureau of Operational
Policy and the incorporation of its work into the Joint Staff, to eliminate
the de facto duplication of duties of operational departments.
Meanwhile, the Proposal thoroughly mixed the civilian off cials
and uniformed personnel in the Internal Bureau and Joint Staff, and
established their positions appropriated according to expertise. The
main point was to facilitate the construction of a system that would
allow civilian off cials and uniformed personnel to work together. With
this in mind, the organizational structure of the Ministry of Defense was
to undergo a large-scale review, which resulted in many points needing
further examination regarding considerations and detailed planning.
Two specif c shortcomings in the 2010 Reform Proposal with
respect to the unif cation of defense capabilities build-up, were the
fact that the system had not necessarily ref ected the viewpoint of joint
operation fully, on which defense capabilities build-up is predicated,
and that considerations had yet to reach the point of actual reform
of departments involved in equipment acquisition, which hold an
important role in defense capabilities build-up.
In regard to the unif cation of operational functions into the
Joint Staff, the fact was that the 2010 Reform Proposal required
further consideration of the specif c scopes of the duties that were to
be concentrated into the Joint Staff. For example, no conclusion had
been reached, despite deliberations taking place, about whether it was
appropriate to transfer all of the duties of the Bureau of Operational
Policy into the Joint Staff after its abolition, even including the duty of
planning and drafting laws and regulations pertaining to SDF operation.
Moreover, during the validation of the 2010 Reform Proposal in its
recent deliberations, the point was raised that if the jurisdiction of the
Joint Staff extended to duties relating to operational policy and dealing
with the Diet, then it was possible that the attribute of the Minister
as “top-level specialist adviser” in “military matters” would undergo
change.

**2. Considerations in the Committee for the Deliberations on the MOD**
**Reform**
1. Minister of Defense instructions
Due to the changeover in administration to a Liberal Democratic
Party-New Komeito coalition, in February of this year, the Minister of
Defense’s instructions to accelerate deliberations regarding the MOD
reform were issued. Subsequently, it was determined in the Committee
for the Deliberations on the MOD Reform, headed by the Senior ViceMinister of Defense (hereinafter, the “Committee”), that (1) from
the perspective not only of preventing the recurrence of scandals,
but of making the SDF operate more actively and eff ciently through


-----

the effective use of human resources, and accomplishing the civilian
control over the SDF under the severe security environment facing
Japan, (2)with regard to the business operation and structure of the
central organization, the Committee is giving necessary consideration,
taking into account the lessons learned from handling recent incidents
such as the Great East Japan Earthquake and the launch of missiles
by North Korea, and in tandem with the discussion to strengthen
the commanding function of the Prime Minister’s Off ce concerning
national security such as the establishment of the Japanese National
Security Council, and (3) that a report would be made to the Defense
Council, with its target time being the period when the FY2014 budget
request is made.

2. Situation regarding considerations
(1) System of consideration
The Committee is composed of the Parliamentary Vice-Minister of
Defense, the Vice-Minister of Defense, the Director General of the
Minister’s Secretariat, the various other director generals and the
Chiefs of Staff, with the Parliamentary Senior Vice-Minister of Defense
as chairman. Under this is a board of executives composed of the ViceMinister of Defense, the Director General of the Minister’s secretariat
and the various Chiefs of Staff. Furthermore, as forums for conducting
practical, cross-organizational considerations regarding the matters of
“defense capabilities build-up,” “operations,” “policy-planning” and
“public relations,” project teams, composed of members at the level
of deputy director general, Assistant Vice-Minister of the Minister’s
secretariat, and the directors of the Staff Off ces, and work team
composed of members at the level of Internal Bureau and Staff Off ce
manager were established.
(2) Course of considerations
At the establishment of the Committee in February, seven preliminary
discussions were held under the Senior Vice-Minister of Defense.
Then from February through March, the points for discussion were
determined by the Committee, regarding which, since April of this
year, earnest discussions and deliberations have been carried out by
each of the project teams and work teams. Specif cally, a number of
discussions and deliberations at a variety of levels were carried out,
through the staging of six meetings by the Committee, four by the
board of executives, 12 by the project teams and 21 by the work teams.
Moreover, although a certain degree of success was achieved
through the solid implementation of the efforts to prevent the recurrence
of scandals proposed in the Report by the Council for Reforming the
Ministry of Defense, incidents still occurred in some cases regarding
procurement. It was therefore determined that, measures to prevent
recurrence would be considered and the related efforts checked, at
forums for deliberations established separately of the Committee
(expert committees such as the Committee for Investigation of
Incidents and Consideration of Recurrence Prevention in the Selection
of Companies to Carry Out a Development Project for the New GSDF
Multi-Use Helicopter (UH-X), and the Committee for Investigation and
Consideration of Incidents of Overcharging, etc.).
Based on the above discussions and deliberations, the seventh
Committee meeting was held on August 29 of this year, the direction
for the MOD reform was compiled, and reported to the Defense Council
on the 30th of the month.

**3. Basic Concept and Direction of Reform**
The security environment surrounding Japan has increasingly grown
severe; China has rapidly expanded and intensif ed its activities in the
waters and airspace surrounding Japan as exemplif ed by its instruction
into Japan’s territorial waters and airspace; North Korea has been such
provocative actions as its launch of the missile and its nuclear test. Above
all else, so-called gray zone situations relating to territorial land and
economic interests are becoming evident and long-term, and the possibility
is feared that the situation will get more acute and serious, leading to more
serious incidents. Through the handling of recent incidents, exemplif ed by
the Great East Japan Earthquake, the lessons learned in relation to the use
of units have been recognized. Furthermore, changes have been occurring
in the political environment, such as the move toward establishing the
NSC, and taking comprehensive, exceptional measures relating to the
Three Principles on Arms Exports.
These various changes in the situation pertaining to the Ministry
of Defense and Self-Defense Forces served as a basis for the recent
considerations regarding MOD reform, during which the points
of optimization of defense capabilities build-up across the board,
rationalization of duplicated work regarding operations, and strengthening
the functions of planning, proposing and transmitting defense policies, as
highlighted in the advice of the Report by the Council for Reforming the
Ministry of Defense were taken into adequate account, in the determination
that the ideal format for the Ministry of Defense and Self-Defense Forces’
duties would be reviewed from the perspective of how to ensure their


functions are executed effectively, and the ideal format of the organization
would be reviewed, including the viewpoint of making it more eff cient
and rational.
The direction of the full-f edged reform, including reorganization, is
as follows.
(1) Remove the barriers to civilian off cials and uniformed personnel
It is essential to prompt decision-making to foster a sense of unity
among civilian off cials and uniformed personnel in the MOD central
organization. For this reason, permanent posts for uniformed personnel
will be in established in the Internal Bureau while permanent posts for
civilian off cials will be established in each of the Staff Off ces and
major commands.
(2) From partial to total optimization (defense capabilities build-up)
In order to eliminate defense capabilities build-up based on individual,
vertically-divided optimization for each of the Ground, Maritime
and Air Self-Defense Forces, and ensure that the build-up is instead
conducted through total optimization, a procedure will be established
for defense capabilities build-up, emphasizing the assessment of the
performance of defense capabilities based on joint operations, which
has not necessarily been given adequate attention in the past, while
further eff ciency and optimization in equipment acquisition will be
attempted, based on consistent management across the life-cycle of the
equipment, and the organization that contributes to total optimization
of defense capabilities realigned.
(3) Make accurate decisions more swiftly (joint operations)
In order to ensure the accuracy of decision-making relating to the
operation of the SDF and make the process swifter, a review of the
organization will be conducted so that affairs concerning actual
operations will be unif ed into the Joint Staff off ce as well as eff cient
coordination body for situation response will be established under the
Defense Council.
(4) Enhancement of policy-planning and public relations capability
The enhancement of the functions of the Bureau of Defense Policy has
made certain progress since the 2010 Reform Proposal. Going forward,
the systems will be enhanced further still, to respond to the drastic
increase in international affairs-related work recently in the Ministry
of Defense, such as the expansion of the Cabinet-Level Discussion
on Foreign Affairs and Defense (“2 + 2”). At the same time, the
enhancement of the functions of the Bureau of Defense Policy will be
advanced, in response to the enhancement of the strategic functions of
the Prime Minister’s Off ce (resulting from the founding of the NSC).
Together with this, efforts will be made to enhance the public relations
capability of the Ministry of Defense.
In order to ensure that reforms are truly effective, it is vital to change
the mentality of each and every member of both the civilian off cials and
the uniformed personnel. Furthermore, in the present serious security
environment, it is necessary to advance reforms smoothly, to avoid
disruption and stagnation in response to contingencies. Accordingly,
it is important to establish a series of reforms through steady and
phased implementation while Internal Bureau and Staff off ces equally
support the Minister of Defense. Reform is, ultimately, something that
is implemented without end. It is natural that it should be constantly
examined, while efforts are made for further reform and improvement.

**4. Specifi c reform efforts**
The matters addressed as a part of the MOD reform are, specif cally, as
follows (including, in addition to items (1) to (4) of 3. above, matters
newly derived in relation to the progress of recent considerations). “Shortterm (FY2014),” “Medium-term” and “Long-term” time schedules will be
established for these, and implemented steadily and gradually.
(1) Mutual assignment of civilian off cials and uniformed personnel
a. By the revision of the relevant articles of the Act for Establishment
of the Ministry of Defense (1954 Law No. 164), permanent posts
within the Internal Bureau for uniformed personnel, mainly
Lieutenant Colonel and Major will be established while permanent
posts for civilian off cials will be established in the Joint Staff and
major SDF commands. (FY2014)
b. Subsequently, permanent posts for uniformed personnel and civilian
off cials will be mutually established in high-ranked staffs of the
Internal Bureau and the respective Staff Off ce and major command.
(Medium-long term)
(2) Total optimization of defense capabilities build-up and strengthening
of equipment acquisition functions
a. Based on the results of implementing optimization method across
the board for defense capabilities build-up, in considerations of
a review of approaches to defense capabilities which is currently
undergoing progress, new procedure will be established for defense
capabilities build-up. (FY2014)
<Image of new procedure (under consideration)>
Rigorous mutual cooperation is being undertaken between the
Internal Bureau and each of the Staff Off ces, and in the following


-----

step, defense capabilities build-up will be advanced.
1) The Director General of the Bureau of Defense Policy and the
Chief of Joint Staff will implement a unif ed assessment of the
performance of defense capabilities from the perspective not of
the Ground, Maritime and Air Defense Forces separately, but
the needs of joint operation, based on envisioned contingencies.
2) The Chief of Joint Staff will present the matters which are
to be emphasized in defense capabilities build-up from the
perspective of the needs of joint operation, based on the results
of 1).
3) The Director General of the Bureau of Defense Policy will
clarify the priority matters in defense capabilities build-up
from a more comprehensive perspective including attitude and
policy, in reference to 2).
b. In addition to a procedure reform for the purpose of the above
total optimization of defense capabilities build-up, the following
measures will be taken so that equipment acquisition duties can be
carried out in a form that is more fair, eff cient and optimized.
(a) In regard to projects for the improvement of equipment and
supplies, the establishment of cross-functional Integrated
Project Teams (IPT), headed by a Project Manager (PM)
responsible for summarizing the project in question and
ensuring its consistent advance, will be increased, and
project management strengthened throughout the life-cycle
of the equipment, from acquisition including its research and
development through to disposal. (FY2014 –)
(b) In order that project management across the entire life-cycle,
as mentioned above, can be implemented organizationally
and appropriately, and can even contribute to the maintenance
and strengthening of defense production and technological
bases, as well as the total optimization of defense capabilities
build-up, departments involved in equipment acquisition in
the Internal Bureau, various Staff Off ces, Technical Research
and Development Institute and Equipment Procurement and
Construction Off ce shall be integrated in accordance with future
discussions, and reorganization that keeps the establishment of
the “Defense Equipment Agency” (provisional title) in mind
carried out. At that time, the strengthening of surveillance
functions will also be considered, in order that procurement is
conducted with greater fairness. (Medium-term)
(3) Strengthening of joint operation functions
a. In order to ensure the accuracy of decision-making relating to the
operation of the SDF and make the process swifter, f rst for fostering
a sense of unity among civilian off cials and uniformed personnel,
permanent posts for uniformed personnel will be established in the
Internal Bureau, while permanent posts for civilian off cials will be
established. (FY2014 –) [Reposted]
b. In order to increase swiftness and eff ciency of operations, affairs
concerning actual operations will be unif ed into the Joint Staff
off ce. Meanwhile, because functions such as the planning and
proposal of laws and regulations pertaining to operations are
administrative and institutional works, they will continue to come
under the jurisdiction of the Internal Bureau. Due to this, the de
facto duplication of duties between the Internal Bureau and Joint
Staff, resulting from accountability to the Diet, regarding the duties
associated with actual force operations, will be eliminated. With
these points in mind, the Bureau of Operational Policy will be
reviewed its organization based on new challenges as for response to
cyber attacks and externally-related tasks referring in (4). (Mediumterm)
c. When responding to emergency events, since the Defense Council
headed by the Minister of Defense and the Emergency Headquarter
are functioning effectively, an organization for eff cient
coordination will be constructed under the Defense Council, to
deal with emergencies consisting of relevant top off cials among
the Internal Bureau and the Joint Staff, in order to ensure the
further acceleration of decision-making procedures pertaining to
emergencies. (Medium-term)
d. Based on the lessons learned at the time that the Self-Defense Forces
were mobilized in response to the Great East Japan Earthquake,
that duties relating to supporting the Minister of Defense from
an expert military perspective in the Joint Staff, and relating to
the enforcement of orders from the Minister of Defense became
strained, and that the burden on the Joint Staff suddenly increased,
cooperation and collaboration will be pursued in areas such as
consideration of a review of approaches to defense capabilities, as
it relates to ensuring effective command and control in the Ground,
Maritime and Air Self-Defense Forces (including considerations
regarding the establishment of a central command organization in
the Ground Self-Defense Force and the ideal format of relations
between the relevant organizations and regional unites of GSDF),


such as the Joint Staff, thereby raising the effectiveness of joint
operations further. (Medium-long term)
(4) Enhancement of policy-planning and public relation capability
a. In order to enhance strategic discussions and dialog with partner
countries, Vice-Minister of Defense for International Affairs
will be newly established to provide general arrangements for
the international affairs-related work in the Ministry of Defense.
(FY2014)
b. In order to form a strong connection with the soon-to-be-established
NSC, and contribute to the drafting of Japanese security strategies,
as well as draft and execute defense policies in their response, the
function of the Bureau of Defense Policy to draft strategies will be
enhanced based, amongst other things, on the situation regarding
the activity of the NSC after its establishment. (FY2014 –)
c. Implementing the following measures to enhance reporting
capability
(a) A mechanism will be established for the unif ed coordination of
information gathering and public relations in urgent operations,
the SDF’s growing international tension and conducting other
crisis management by the Ministry of Defense and the SelfDefense Forces, when the latter is mobilized, the international
situation becomes strained, and other crisis management is
required (Reporting Center). (FY2014)
(b) As the security environment surrounding Japan becomes ever
more serious, in order that the Ministry of Defense and SelfDefense Forces can transmit information strategically and
effectively the reporting organization will be reviewed, so that
spokespersons of the Minister’s Secretariat and the Joint Staff,
that have been assigned as specialists to deal with reporting
requirements can wield their knowhow to the maximum
level and function as a key position in the transmission of
information by the Ministry of Defense. (Medium-term)
(5) Enhancement of collaboration with the local community
In order to promote understanding of the local area with camps
and bases and to enhance the functions of liaison and coordination
with local governments in a state of emergency such as large-scale
disasters, efforts will be made to cooperate and collaborate in areas
such as consideration of a review of approaches to defense capabilities
as it pertains to the format of the relevant regional organizations
that can, at all times, collaborate closely with local governments
and relevant ministries and agencies (Regional Defense Bureaus,
Provincial Cooperation Off ces, GSDF Headquarters, MSDF District
Headquarters, etc.). (Medium-long term)
(6) Thorough management of information
In order to prevent leaks of, not only conf dential information, but
information of any kind that is not to be disclosed externally, and
thereby maintain the reliability of the MOD as an organization that
protects the safety of Japan, and ensure that no obstruction to the
execution of its duties arises, efforts are to be made to ensure the
thorough management of information at all levels including a review of
the specif c scope of management, and methods and systems are to be
established for investigation when leaks occur. (FY2014 –)
(7) Enhancement of the general coordination function of the Minister’s
Secretariat
A continuous review will be made regarding the business operation,
from the perspective of ensuring the accuracy of decision-making by
the Ministry, and the Minister’s secretariat-centered assistant system
for political appointee, will be enhanced so that reports for political
appointee are made promptly and appropriately by the relevant bureau
at all times. (FY2014)

**5. Summary**
As previously stated, the MOD reform must be implemented soundly, in
a manner that brings with it, a reform of the mentality of each and every
member. With this in mind, discussions are to be continually pursued in
earnest, mainly in the Committee, regarding the specif c efforts of the
MOD reform described in section 4, so that they may be made concrete.
The problem of scandals in procurement is to be eagerly considered in
the relevant committees, and the thoroughness of measures to prevent
recurrence ensured.

Not recognized as armed attack

When the possibility that ballistic Although the ballistic missiles are not expected to
missiles may fly toward Japan is fly over Japan, a rapid change in circumstances
acknowledged may create an emergency situation which makes

it difficult to obtain an approval from the Prime
Minister in time

Minister of Defense orders destruction Minister of Defense orders destruction measures
measures upon approval of in advance as provided in the emergency response
the Prime Minister procedure (approved by the Cabinet in 2007)


Article 76 of the SDF Act (Paragraph 1) Article 82-3 of the SDF Act (Paragraph 3)
(Issuance of Defense Operations Orders) (Destruction measures against ballistic missiles)


If armed attack is recognized
(Declared intent to attack,
imminent missile launch)

An armed attack situation is
recognized and a defense operation
order is issued

Take measures in the framework
of defense operation

Article 76 of the SDF Act
(Issuance of Defense Operations Orders)


Concept of ensuring civilian control of the military

H Response against ballistic missiles requires the government to assess the possibility of missiles fl ying toward Japan by comprehensively analyzing and
evaluating the specifi c situation and international circumstances. In addition to the SDF destroying the missile, interagency actions are required, for
example, measures for civil protection such as alert and evacuation, diplomatic activities, information gathering by related agencies, and enhancement of
readiness for emergencies.
H In view of the importance of the matter and the necessity of action by the Japanese government as a whole, the Cabinet and Minister of Defense can
suffi ciently fulfi ll their responsibilities upon the Prime Minister’s approval (Cabinet decision) and orders by the Minister of Defense. Furthermore, the
supervision of the Diet is also defi ned with a provision in the law stipulating reporting to the Diet.
