## Minister of Defence Foreword

###### I am proud of the New Zealand Defence Force and I am continually impressed by the professionalism, skill and dedication of the people who serve in it. They are part of an organisation that, every hour of every day, 365 days a year, contributes to the defence, security and wellbeing of New Zealand.

I am therefore pleased, early in this Parliamentary term,
to be able to introduce in the Strategic Defence Policy
_Statement 2018 updated policy settings that explicitly_
recognise for the first time the full spectrum of the value
Defence delivers to New Zealanders.

This Statement aligns Defence policy with the Coalition
Government’s national security and foreign policy priorities
in the context of New Zealand’s evolving strategic
environment. It reflects New Zealand’s long-standing
interests and deeply held values, and sets a strong
foundation for the future.

The Community, Nation and World framework recognises
the important role Defence plays, and will continue to
play, in promoting the overall wellbeing and resilience of
New Zealand, its communities and environment.

The Statement has at its core a set of principles to guide
how Government makes decisions about Defence. These
make clear our expectations, such as the Defence Force
being combat capable, flexible and ready, that it must
operate at high levels of public trust and confidence, and
embody and promote New Zealand’s values.

We have raised the priority placed on the Defence Force’s
ability to operate in the South Pacific to the same level as
New Zealand’s territory, the Southern Ocean and Antarctica.
This change recognises the challenges facing Pacific Island
states – such as managing the impacts of climate change –
and the importance Government places on New Zealand’s
contributions as a Pacific nation to the security and wellbeing
of our Pacific partners. The Strategic Defence Policy Statement
_2018 supports the Pacific Reset and reinforces the importance_
of New Zealand’s partnership with our Pacific neighbours.


The primary operating area for the Defence Force
stretches from the South Pole to the Equator, a vast
and largely maritime zone that will place substantial
demands on Defence Force personnel and capabilities
to deliver across a range of tasks.

At the same time, Government expects the Defence
Force to continue to work alongside partners in our
neighbourhood and further afield to promote regional
and global security, and to make credible contributions
to strengthen the international rules-based order.
This requires the Defence Force to maintain highly
sophisticated capabilities that deliver for New Zealand,
and that are valued by and interoperable with those key
partners that share our values and interests.

In the context of an increasingly challenging strategic
environment, the Government places high expectations
on the Defence Force and its capabilities. Determining
how best to shape the Defence Force’s capabilities into
the future will be the subject of the Defence Capability
_Plan Review 2018._

**Hon Ron Mark**
Minister of Defence

#### Executive Summary


-----

1. This Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018 sets
out the Government’s policy objectives for Defence,
which includes both the New Zealand Defence Force
and the Ministry of Defence. It provides the policy
basis for further work to identify and define the
Defence capabilities required to give effect to
the Government’s intentions.

###### Ensuring alignment with the Government’s priorities and responding to New Zealand’s strategic environment

4. The Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018
explicitly recognises the important role Defence plays
in promoting the overall wellbeing and resilience of
New Zealand, its communities and environment.
New Zealand Defence provides value to the
**Community, Nation, and World.**

5. For the first time, this policy statement introduces a set
of principles to describe the Government’s fundamental
and enduring expectations of the role Defence plays in
promoting New Zealand’s interests, and the manner in
which Defence operates.

6. This policy statement sets out a more challenging
and complex strategic environment – one in which
the international rules-based order, the foundation
for New Zealand’s security and prosperity, is coming
under increasing pressure from three broad forces.

7. Defence’s priorities and the principal roles of the
Defence Force have been updated to reflect the
Government’s policy priorities, new principles,
New Zealand’s evolving strategic environment, and
a vision of Defence activities providing value to the
Community, Nation, and World.


2. This policy statement builds on a substantial body
of existing work. This includes the Defence White
_Paper 2016, and the ongoing enhanced Defence_
Assessment programme directed by that White
Paper that examines New Zealand’s evolving
strategic environment.

3. The Ministry of Defence has led the development of
this policy statement in close consultation with the
Defence Force. A broad range of other Government
agencies have provided input and assurance.

8. This statement affirms the priority the Government places
on the Defence Force’s ability to operate in New Zealand
and its neighbourhood. It also affirms the importance
of Defence’s ability to contribute to supporting regional
and global security and to maintaining the international
rules-based order. Delivering on these priorities requires
that the Defence Force continues to be able to operate
effectively alongside a range of international partners,
foremost New Zealand’s traditional security partners and
our ally Australia.

9. Detailed capability requirements to deliver on
New Zealand’s Defence policy settings will be
developed in the context of the Defence Capability
_Plan Review 2018. Capability is considered holistically_
and includes people, research and development,
infrastructure, systems and technologies, equipment,
platforms, and logistics.


##### New Zealand Defence provides value to the Community, Nation, and World.


-----

###### Defence outcomes: Delivering value to the Community, Nation and World

10. New Zealand’s national security objectives and the
fundamental principles underpinning Government’s
expectations of Defence require that Defence supports
New Zealand’s security, resilience and wellbeing across
a broad range of activities. In particular, Defence:


###### New Zealand’s strategic environment

11. New Zealand is navigating an increasingly complex and
dynamic international security environment. We will face
compounding challenges of a scope and magnitude not
previously seen in our neighbourhood. While there may
be noteworthy effects on New Zealand’s interests from
singular developments, New Zealand’s security outlook
may be shaped most powerfully by a combination of
forces increasing pressure on the international rulesbased order, which will play out in newly potent ways
close to home.

12. The three key forces, and their dynamic intersections,
pressuring the order are:

12.1. The increasing importance of spheres of
**influence, with some states pursuing greater**
influence in ways that, at times, challenge
international norms

12.2. **Challenges to open societies and Western**
liberalism, driven by increasing disillusionment
with existing arrangements within these societies,
threaten to reduce the willingness of open liberal
states to champion the rules-based order

12.3. A collection of complex disruptors, including
an array of impacts from climate change, new
technologies changing the nature of conflict,
extremist ideologies, and transnational organised
crime. Many of these disruptors disproportionately
affect open societies and weak states. They are
forces for disorder


##### We will face compounding challenges of a scope and magnitude not previously seen in our neighbourhood.


-----

###### Implications for  New Zealand’s security

13. As the international-rules based order – the foundation
of our security – comes under pressure, New Zealand
will also face intensifying disruptors closer to home.
Climate change, transnational organised crime, resource
competition, together with increasing influence and
presence of non-traditional partners, will disrupt our
neighbourhood, including our extensive maritime area, in
complex and compounding ways.

14. Supporting stability in the Asia-Pacific, from countering
violent extremism in Southeast Asia to the denuclearisation of North Korea, will increase in importance.
Groupings of like-minded nations are emerging to
balance challenges to rules and norms, and to reinforce
the rules-based order across the Asia-Pacific.

15. As challenges to the international rules-based order
intensify – from our neighbourhood to the Asia-Pacific and
further afield – it will remain in New Zealand’s vital interest
to act in support of this order. While the New Zealand
Defence Force will conduct some missions on its own,
most deployments will be undertaken alongside other
Government agencies and international partners.

16. It is therefore critical for the Defence Force to maintain
and develop capabilities that support effectively operating
with others. This involves developing complementary
capabilities as appropriate, ensuring mutual familiarity
(developed through personnel exchanges and
exercising), and the compatibility of communications and
command and control systems. Interoperability is key to
New Zealand’s strong international reputation as a valued
and credible defence partner and ally.

17. The domains of cyber and space bring both vulnerabilities
and opportunities. Increased use of cyber and space
capabilities could enhance Defence’s operational
effectiveness and efficiency, but the Defence Force will
also need to be prepared to respond to increased threats
manifesting in and through both space and cyberspace.

18. Defence will have to act in new ways and at new levels to
protect New Zealand’s values and interests.


###### Defence priorities

19. Government’s highest priority for the Defence Force is its
ability to operate and undertake tasks in New Zealand’s
territory, including its Exclusive Economic Zone, and
neighbourhood from the South Pole to the Equator.
The Defence Force must be prepared to operate
independently, or lead combined operations, in
these areas if required.

20. New Zealand’s national security and interests also
depend on events further afield. It is important that
New Zealand can contribute Defence capabilities in
support of Asia-Pacific regional security. Similarly,
New Zealand must be able to commit resources
worldwide to support the maintenance of the
international rules-based order.

21. Defence deployments beyond New Zealand’s immediate
region will most likely continue to be as part of operations
led by New Zealand’s security partners, or as part of
United Nations-mandated operations. The Defence Force
must be able to operate effectively with New Zealand’s
key security partners and ally Australia.

22. The Government will maintain a high level of discretion
as to the size and nature of New Zealand’s contributions
to such operations outside New Zealand’s immediate
neighbourhood. Decisions on such operations will include
New Zealand’s national security interests, New Zealand’s
international relationships, and the threats associated
with any deployment.


##### Defence will have to act in new ways and at new levels to protect New Zealand’s values and interests.


-----

###### Principal roles of the Defence Force

23. The principal roles of the Defence Force are to:

23.1. Defend New Zealand’s sovereignty and territory,
and contribute to protecting New Zealand’s critical
lines of communication

23.2. Contribute to national, community and
environmental wellbeing and resilience, and
whole-of-government security objectives

23.3. Meet New Zealand’s commitments to its allies
and partners

23.4. Support New Zealand’s civilian presence in the
Ross Dependency of Antarctica, and work with
other agencies to monitor and respond to activity
in the Southern Ocean

23.5. Conduct a broad range of operations in the
South Pacific, including leading operations when
necessary, to protect and promote regional peace,
security and resilience

23.6. Make a credible contribution in support of peace
and security in the Asia-Pacific region, including in
support of regional security arrangements

23.7. Protect New Zealand’s wider interests by
contributing to international peace and security
and the international rules-based order

23.8. Contribute to advancing New Zealand’s
international relationships

23.9. Work with other agencies to monitor and
understand New Zealand’s strategic environment

23.10. Be prepared to respond to sudden shifts in the
strategic environment

24. Together, the Defence priorities and principal roles
describe Government expectations for the Defence
Force’s ability to operate. The Government’s decisions
about where to deploy the Defence Force and types of
missions to be undertaken within these priorities and
roles will be determined in practice by local, national,
and global events.


###### Defence Force capabilities

25. Detailed capability requirements to satisfy the Strategic
_Defence Policy Statement 2018 and the financial_
implications will be developed in the context of the
_Defence Capability Plan Review 2018, to be undertaken_
in the second half of 2018. The Strategic Defence Policy
_Statement 2018 identifies the challenges that will need_
to be addressed in that capability review, and sets out
some particular capability elements that the review
should examine.

26. In coming years the Defence Force will very likely be
called upon to undertake an increasing number of
operations in New Zealand’s neighbourhood to respond
to emergencies and instability, and protect and promote
New Zealand’s national security and foreign policy
interests. This will present a capacity challenge, including
in terms of concurrency and sustainment.

27. At the same time, maintaining interoperability with
New Zealand’s security partners and operational
effectiveness in increasingly complex threat environments
will present a capability sophistication challenge.

28. A number of the Defence Force’s major platforms are at
or approaching the end of their operational life. Managing
the introduction of replacement capabilities is, and will
continue to be, a major Defence focus in coming years.

29. The Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018 identifies
three capability areas that will require attention:

29.1. Maritime domain awareness and response,
particularly in New Zealand’s neighbourhood but
also further afield

29.2. A Defence contribution to New Zealand’s secure
access to space-based systems

29.3. Enhanced Defence cyber capabilities to provide
military commanders with a broader set of tools
to achieve military objectives

30. To meet the Government’s requirements, the Defence
Force will continue to need a mix of capabilities with
broad utility. In addition to delivering tasks in support
of national resilience in New Zealand’s territory and
neighbourhood, the Defence Force will also need
capabilities that enable it to remain relevant and make
credible contributions to international efforts in support
of peace and security.


##### In coming years the Defence Force will very likely be called upon to undertake an increasing number of operations in New Zealand’s neighbourhood.

# C h a p t e r 2

#### Defence’s value to the Community, Nation, and World


-----

31. The Government’s expectations of Defence – both
the New Zealand Defence Force and the Ministry of
Defence – are strongly informed by New Zealand’s
enduring national security interests, policies, and the
evolving strategic environment. These expectations
are further underpinned by long-standing (but
previously unstated) principles guiding Defence’s
focus and activities. Defence contributes to making
New Zealand and New Zealanders more secure.

###### New Zealand’s national security

33. National security is the condition that permits
New Zealand citizens to go about their daily business
confidently, free from fear and able to make the
most of opportunities to advance their way of life.
The concept of national security is therefore a broad
one, encompassing a range of activities that include
protecting the state against military threats.

34. New Zealand has seven overarching national security
objectives:

34.1. **Ensuring public safety: Providing for, and**
mitigating risks to, the safety of citizens and
communities

34.2. **Preserving sovereignty and territorial**
**integrity: Protecting the physical security of**
New Zealand citizens, and exercising control
over its territory

34.3. **Protecting lines of communication: These**
are both physical and virtual, and allow
New Zealand to communicate, trade, and
engage globally

34.4. **Strengthening international order to**
**promote security: Contributing to the**
international rules-based system, and engaging
in targeted interventions offshore to protect
New Zealand’s interests

34.5. **Sustaining economic prosperity: Maintaining**
and advancing the economic wellbeing of
New Zealand individuals, families, businesses,
and communities


32. This chapter sets out New Zealand’s national
security interests and newly expressed
principles that inform Government and public
expectations of Defence. It frames Defence’s
value to New Zealand through the Community,
**Nation, and World.**

34.6. **Maintaining democratic institutions and**
**national values: Preventing activities aimed**
at undermining or overturning Government
institutions, principles and values that underpin
New Zealand society

34.7. **Protecting the natural environment:**
Contributing to the preservation and stewardship
of New Zealand’s natural and physical
environment

35. In pursuit of these objectives, New Zealand takes an “allhazards” approach to national security. It has a security
system designed to bring Government agencies together
to respond to all risks to national security, whether
internal or external, human-driven or naturally occurring.
These range from the challenges associated with natural
disasters, resource exploitation, pandemics and other
biosecurity events, through to evolving threats related to
terrorism, space and cyberspace.

36. Defence works with and supports a wide range of
Government agencies to protect and advance all
seven of these security objectives, and as part of the
governance arrangements that coordinate and manage
any Government response.

37. Defence takes a leading role in advancing some of these
objectives and plays more of a supporting role in others.
In many respects, Defence is responsible for contributing
to the maintenance of the domestic and international
environment in which these objectives can be protected
and advanced.


#### Defence contributes to making New Zealand and New Zealanders more secure.


-----

###### Principles underpinning  New Zealand’s Defence policy

38. Successive Governments’ fundamental expectations
of Defence have been largely consistent in recent
decades, and the shape of these expectations was
strongly supported in the content of public submissions
received in the development of the Defence White
_Paper 2010 and the Defence White Paper 2016. These_
fundamental expectations can be described through the
following high-level principles.

38.1. **Defence is combat capable, flexible and**
**ready: The core purpose of the Defence Force**
is to deliver military effects. Combat capabilities
are of fundamental importance. The Defence
Force forms a core component of New Zealand’s
broader national resilience, typically operating
alongside and in support of other agencies.
The Defence Force’s capabilities enable it to
deliver a broad range of activities that support
New Zealand’s overall wellbeing.

38.2. **Defence personnel are highly trained**
**professionals: Whether in regular force,**
reserve or civilian roles, Defence personnel are
professionally trained, with the skills to succeed.

38.3. **Defence has the resources to meet the**

**Government’s operational and strategic**
**priorities: The Defence Force is equipped and**
resourced to meet the operational requirements
placed on it by the Government, and Defence is
positioned to respond to the changing strategic
environment.

38.4. **Defence operates in ways that maintain public**
**trust and confidence: Defence Force activities**
are subject to civilian control, exercised through
the Minister of Defence and the Cabinet more
generally. Defence must be transparent and open
with the New Zealand public.

38.5. **Defence embodies and promotes**

**New Zealand’s values: Domestically and offshore,**
Defence promotes New Zealand’s enduring values.
Defence also operates in accordance with these
values. Internationally, Defence must be an agent
of New Zealand’s independent foreign policy, act
to promote New Zealand as a good international
citizen, and support the international rules-based
order. Defence operates in accordance with both
domestic and international law, including the Law of
Armed Conflict and International Humanitarian Law.

38.6. **Defence is a credible and trusted international**
**partner: In supporting New Zealand’s interests,**
Defence makes valued, credible contributions to
New Zealand’s international security partnerships.
This includes meeting New Zealand’s commitment
as an ally of Australia. The Defence Force
adds value to international coalitions and other
combined operations, and is interoperable with
New Zealand’s key security partners.


###### Defence outcomes: Delivering  value to the Community, Nation,  and World

39. In combination, New Zealand’s national security
objectives and the fundamental principles underpinning
the Government’s expectations of Defence require
Defence to support New Zealand’s security, resilience
and wellbeing across a broad range of activities. Defence
provides significant value to New Zealand’s communities,
the nation, and the world. Defence:

###### Defence Outcomes


#### Domestically and offshore, Defence promotes New Zealand’s enduring values.


-----

###### Community

 Defence supports New Zealand’s community and environmental wellbeing and resilience

40. New Zealanders value the long-standing relationship
Defence has with our communities, both in terms of the
services Defence delivers or supports, and in terms of the
contribution Defence makes directly and indirectly as a
part of New Zealand society.

41. The Defence Force supports community wellbeing and
resilience by assisting in the delivery of a broad range
of public services. As an agency of state that maintains
disciplined forces and fleets of vehicles, ships and aircraft
available at short notice, the Defence Force is a critical
part of the whole-of-government response to a range of
incidents. This includes the provision of capabilities to carry
out domestic search and rescue, supporting civil defence
emergency management and providing rural fire services.
Recently, the Defence Force has contributed to responses
to a range of incidents, including the Christchurch fires, the
Kaikoura earthquake, ex-tropical cyclone Gita, the rupture
of the fuel line between Marsden Point and Auckland, and
flooding in the Manawatu and the Eastern Bay of Plenty.

42. The Defence Force plays an important role in supporting
the protection of New Zealand’s natural environment. This
includes assisting the Ministry for Primary Industries to
conduct regular fisheries patrols and, when called upon,
to support biosecurity operations through the provision of
personnel and logistics support. The Defence Force also
assists the Department of Conservation by transporting
personnel and equipment (notably to offshore islands),
and contributes to national responses to instances of
environmental harm, such as the grounding of the MV
Rena. The Defence Force is also a steward for large areas
of land throughout New Zealand.

43. More generally, Defence is a significant employer,
skills trainer, and economic actor within New Zealand
communities, across both metropolitan and regional
areas. This economic activity directly and indirectly
supports communities across New Zealand, and in some
cases provides a central focus for those communities.


44. In training and developing its staff to deliver Defence
outcomes, the Defence Force provides education that
will continue to contribute to New Zealand’s communities
even after those staff leave Defence. Former Defence
personnel entering the private and public sectors bring
valuable skills, character and resilience.

45. Defence leads programmes such as the New Zealand
Cadet Forces and the Limited Service Volunteers in
support of other Government agencies. Defence’s
contribution to youth development provides motivational
training and valuable life skills to young New Zealanders,
making a difference in their lives and our communities.

46. In supporting commemorations on days of national
significance, from Waitangi Day to Anzac Day, the
Defence Force fosters national pride and belonging, and
reinforces our national values.

###### Nation

 Defence promotes a safe, secure and resilient New Zealand, including at its border and approaches

47. It is a fundamental responsibility of the New Zealand
Government to protect New Zealand’s people,
prosperity, territory, sovereignty and resources; uphold
New Zealand’s constitutional obligations to the Cook
Islands, Niue and Tokelau; and maintain New Zealand’s
claim to territorial sovereignty in the Ross Dependency
of Antarctica.

48. The Defence Force maintains a level of capability
that allows it to detect, deter, and counter threats to
New Zealand. It can enlarge its forces at short notice, and
provide sufficient time for additional help to be sought
from New Zealand’s security partners, if called upon to
execute this fundamental national security responsibility.

49. Domestically, when called upon, the Defence Force
provides support to the New Zealand Police to respond
to terrorism emergencies and other incidents of serious
violent crime. Defence is the sole provider of explosive
ordnance disposal services (including chemical,
biological and radiological defence), and Navy dive teams
assist in search, recovery and other tasks in support of
Police and other agencies.

50. The Defence Force makes an important contribution
in safeguarding New Zealand’s borders and sovereign
territory. It helps ensure that entry into New Zealand
is by legitimate means only and that New Zealand’s
natural resources are protected. In accordance
with the close ties between regional security and
New Zealand’s security interests, the Defence Force
plays an important role in monitoring and responding
to a range of activities in New Zealand’s expansive
maritime area of interest, from Antarctica to the South
Pacific. This now includes monitoring and protecting
the Ross Sea Marine Protected Area.


##### The Defence Force plays an important role in supporting the protection of New Zealand’s natural environment.


-----

###### Defence contributes to maintaining New Zealand’s prosperity via secure air, sea and electronic lines of communication and secure access to space- based services

51. New Zealand’s security and prosperity depend on open
sea, air and electronic lines of communication, and could
be severely impacted by disruptions associated with state
conflict, serious criminal activity, or natural disaster.

52. The Defence Force makes an important contribution to
international efforts to ensure freedom of navigation and
open lines of communication. In recent years this has
included maritime surveillance and patrol activities in the
South Pacific and Southeast Asia and participation in
multinational counter-piracy maritime security operations
in the Arabian Gulf and Indian Ocean.

53. New Zealand relies on national and international
infrastructure that enables electronic communication.
These systems are critical to New Zealand’s ability
to engage and trade internationally (and increasingly
domestically). They are also vital to the Defence Force’s
ability to carry out its roles and tasks effectively and may
hold opportunities to assist in monitoring our maritime
area. Alongside and in support of other Government
agencies, Defence contributes to the protection of this
infrastructure, and through its international partnerships
undertakes efforts to enhance its security.

54. Space-based systems are increasingly important
to New Zealand’s wellbeing and to Defence Force
operations. Defence now has an important role in
contributing to international efforts to ensure secure
access to space-based services. To exercise command
and control, navigate and operate battlefield management
systems that are interoperable with our partners, the
Defence Force is becoming increasingly reliant on
information networks and space-based systems. In
addition, New Zealand’s space industry has grown
substantially in recent years.

55. The increasing reliance on networked communication
and computer systems, by all parts of the nation,
creates a growing need to ensure New Zealand
maintains electronic and digital links to the wider
world. The Defence Force helps to protect these
links by providing physical security against threats to
infrastructure, such as undersea cables, and playing
a part in general cyber resilience by protecting its own
networks and sharing intelligence and expertise with
domestic and international partners.


###### World

 Defence contributes to the maintenance of the international rules-based order

56. The international rules-based order is fundamental
to New Zealand’s national security. It supports
New Zealand’s independent foreign policy and broad
access to global markets, affords the protection
and support of multilateral institutions and collective
arrangements, and allows New Zealand to contribute
to international peace and security. This order provides
protection by disciplining states’ exercise of national
power through international law, custom and convention.
It accords rights to all countries, regardless of their size.

57. Enjoying the benefits of such an order means
New Zealand, like other countries, has an obligation
to support this order and be willing to support the
prevention or resolution of conflicts within and between
states. Contributions to peace and stability in the world
mitigate disruptions to national and community wellbeing
and security.

58. New Zealand has a long history of contributing to such
activities, often as part of United Nations initiatives,
in ways that reflect our national values. In addition to
supporting regional security architecture in the AsiaPacific and the South Pacific, Defence has long-standing
commitments in the Middle East and the Republic
of Korea. In recent years the Defence Force has
undertaken stability and support operations in TimorLeste, Afghanistan, Solomon Islands, and Tonga, as
well as counter-piracy operations off the Horn of Africa
and capacity building in Iraq. While the Defence Force
prepares for this broad range of missions, world events
dictate where the Government may deploy the Defence
Force at any given time.

###### Defence contributes to New Zealand’s network of strong international relationships

59. In addition to supporting the international rules-based
order, New Zealand has an enduring interest in fostering
and maintaining a network of strong international
relationships. These relationships amplify New Zealand’s
international influence while enabling New Zealand to
continue to make independent decisions consistent with
its interests, values and size.


##### Space-based systems are increasingly important to New Zealand’s wellbeing and to Defence Force operations.


-----

60. Defence and security cooperation are a core
component of New Zealand’s international relationships.
New Zealand has a long history of operating alongside
many other countries and making credible contributions
to combined operations. Through continued, meaningful
defence and security engagement, New Zealand
develops familiarity with states with which its relationships
may be less established, and deepens the trust of those
partners to which it is already close.

61. New Zealand has no better friend than Australia. Defence
and security are important components of our relationship,
and our militaries operate closely together both regionally
and globally. The March 2018 Australia-New Zealand Joint
Statement on Closer Defence Relations reinforced the
importance of interoperability to enable our militaries to
work effectively together to address our shared security
interests, with a particular – but not exclusive – focus on
our cooperation in the Pacific. New Zealand will continue
to work closely with Australia to respond to a range of
security events, and New Zealand remains committed to
responding immediately should Australia be subject to an
armed attack.

62. Alongside Australia, New Zealand benefits from
close engagement with its other Five Eyes partners:
Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.
New Zealand values these relationships and is
committed to strengthening and broadening them
where possible through more regular interaction and
cooperation. The Defence Force regularly operates and
exercises alongside these partners across a range of
activities, amplifying New Zealand’s ability to contribute
to international security and to protect and promote
New Zealand’s interests.

63. New Zealand has strong cultural and historical ties to
South Pacific countries, and an enduring interest in the
security and prosperity of the region. The Defence Force
regularly operates in the South Pacific, for example from
contributing to disaster response to supporting marine
resource protection, and maintains strong relationships
with Pacific Island states.


64. New Zealand is an active contributor to Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-centric security
forums, including the East Asia Summit, ASEAN Regional
Forum and the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting-Plus
(ADMM-Plus). These forums fulfil an important role in
fostering stability, peace and security in the region by
promoting understanding, entrenching habits of dialogue
and facilitating practical cooperation. The ADMM-Plus
framework – including its seven Expert Working Groups –
remain Defence’s principal forum for multilateral defence
engagement in Asia.

65. New Zealand maintains bilateral defence relationships
with countries across Asia. Some of these relationships
are long-standing and enduring, including those
with Singapore, Malaysia, and Brunei Darussalam.
New Zealand’s defence relationships with other
Southeast Asian partners including Viet Nam, Indonesia,
and the Philippines have also deepened in recent years.
In addition, New Zealand maintains its commitment to
Singapore and Malaysia through the Five Power Defence
Arrangements, which also includes Australia and the
United Kingdom.

66. New Zealand’s relationship with the Republic of Korea
dates back to New Zealand’s involvement in the Korean
War. Japan is another important Asian defence partner
for New Zealand, with common democratic values
and a shared commitment to regional security and the
international rules-based order. In recognition of progress
towards its elections in 2019, New Zealand is also
resuming a modest defence relationship with Thailand.

67. China is of central strategic importance in the AsiaPacific and globally, and New Zealand continues to build
a strong and resilient relationship with China. Defence
and security cooperation with China has grown over
recent years, supported by a range of visits, exchanges
and dialogues.

68. New Zealand maintains a strong strategic interest in the
Middle East given the effects that events in the region
have on international security and the global economy.
Our defence interests in this region are reflected in longstanding commitments, including to the United Nations
Truce Supervision Organization and multi-national
counter-piracy operations. New Zealand seeks to play a
constructive role in the region.

69. New Zealand’s defence engagement with European
countries takes place both bilaterally and, importantly,
through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
New Zealand’s defence links with Europe have
strengthened over the course of more than a decade of
combined operations, including those in Afghanistan, and
reflect shared strategic interests. New Zealand engages
regularly in broader security dialogue with the European
Union and some of its member states, and contributes
periodically to operations as part of the European Union’s
Common Security and Defence Policy.

70. Defence plays an important role alongside the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other Government
agencies in shaping the international security
environment to support New Zealand’s security
and other interests.

#### New Zealand’s Strategic Environment: Shifting Foundation of Security


-----

###### International order under pressure

71. Since the Defence Assessment 2014 and the publication
of the Defence White Paper 2016, there have been
developments that impact our international outlook. These
include the rise of ISIS and the subsequent diminishing
of its physical caliphate; nuclear developments on the
Korean Peninsula; heightened geopolitical competition
globally; tensions related to territorial disputes,
construction activity, and military deployments in
maritime Asia; increasing unilateralism and economic
protectionism; and the expansion of illiberal democracy.
Climate change impacts and cyber threats are also
materialising, sometimes in even more disruptive
ways than forecast. Across geography and domains,
challenges once conceived of as future trends have
become present realities.

72. New Zealand is navigating an increasingly complex and
dynamic international security environment, and will also
face compounding challenges of a scope and magnitude
not previously seen in our neighbourhood. While there
may be noteworthy effects on New Zealand’s interests
from singular developments, New Zealand’s security
outlook and its expansive maritime environment may be
shaped most powerfully by a combination of forces putting
pressure on the international rules-based order, which will
play out in newly potent ways close to home.

73. New Zealand’s security depends on the maintenance of
this order, which supports an independent foreign policy
and broad access to markets, affords the protection
and support of multilateral institutions and collective
arrangements, and allows for the leveraging of these
mechanisms to contribute to international security. The
order’s respect for the sovereign equality of states both
empowers smaller states and disciplines the power of
large states – a rare condition across history. The laws,
norms, and institutions of a healthy order preserve
stability and safeguard against conflict and uncertainty.


74. Yet today and into the future, the rules-based order is
coming under increasing pressure from three broad
forces and their dynamic interactions:

74.1. The growing importance of spheres of influence,
with some states pursuing greater influence in
ways that, at times, challenge international norms.

74.2. **Challenges to open societies and Western**
liberalism, driven by rising disillusionment with
existing arrangements within these societies,
threaten to reduce the willingness of open liberal
states to champion the rules-based order

74.3. A collection of complex disruptors, including
an array of impacts from climate change, new
technologies changing the nature of conflict,
extremist ideologies, and transnational organised
crime. Many of these disruptors disproportionately
affect open societies and weak states. They are
forces for disorder

75. As these pressures come to bear, the foundation of
international security is shifting. While populism and
nationalism may cause some Western nations to look
inward at the expense of outward engagement, China is
more confident in pursuing its aims, which include striving
for greater connection through a range of new proposals,
such as the Belt and Road Initiative.

76. There is now explicit recognition in both Beijing and
Washington that even with economic inter-dependence
and cooperation, their relationship includes long-term
strategic competition. This has consequences for the
ways countries are forming alignments and balancing
their interests.

###### Three Forces Pressuring the International Order


##### Across geography and domains, challenges once conceived of as future trends have become present realities.


-----

77. In the context of increasing competition among powers,
complex transnational threats will disrupt New Zealand’s
neighbourhood in ways not previously seen. The greatest
uncertainties and effects may lie at the intersection of key
trends, such as climate change contributing to further
resource competition in already contested areas, cyber
technologies’ ability to disrupt through terrorist recruiting
and subversion of democratic processes, and more
sophisticated technologies in the hands of more diverse
threat actors. The nature of these threats and their
complex interplay will challenge states’ capacities
for awareness and monitoring, policymaking at pace,
and effective responses.

###### Pursuit of spheres of influence:  Contested rules and places

78. China is deeply integrated into the rules-based order. It
has invested in its institutions and accrued significant
benefits from free access to the commons and economic
openness. China’s increasing contributions to the
international order have been visible across a variety of
areas from peacekeeping to counter-piracy. New Zealand
and others have encouraged China’s increasing
engagement on international issues, commensurate
with its rising economic stature and in accordance with
existing norms.

79. Yet as China has integrated into the international order, it
has not consistently adopted the governance and values
championed by the order’s traditional leaders. Both
domestically and as a basis for international engagement,
China holds views on human rights and freedom of
information that stand in contrast to those that prevail in
New Zealand.

80. China has set an alternative model of development
– a liberalising economy absent liberal democracy –
challenging conventional wisdom in the West that the
two go hand-in-hand. China’s trade relationships and
economic power have grown significantly, enabling it to
pursue its interests with much greater confidence and
with a wide array of political and economic levers. In Asia,
China’s more confident assertion of its interests has at
times raised tensions with neighbouring states and with
the United States.

81. China seeks to restore claimed historical levels of
influence in its periphery as well as an enhanced global
leadership role. While the world is increasingly multipolar,
and growing roles for a variety of states may be expected
– especially for China as its trade relationships bring
increasing prosperity and connectedness – some actions
in pursuit of these aims challenge the existing order.

82. China’s military modernisation reflects its economic
power and growing leadership ambitions. China’s growing
military capabilities raise the costs of any potential
intervention against its interests and include stronger
expeditionary capabilities, including a military presence
in the Indian Ocean. China has expanded its military and
coastguard presence in disputed areas of maritime Asia.
It has determined not to engage with an international
tribunal ruling on the status of sovereignty claims.


83. The ASEAN Code of Conduct represents an opportunity
for constructive multilateral management of disputes,
while unilateral actions by any claimant escalate tensions
and raise the risks of miscalculation in the region. Where
China has acted to advance its sovereignty claims, it
has generally demonstrated a preference for bilateral
engagement over existing regional architecture.

84. Russia and a number of other countries such as Iran and
Saudi Arabia (countries competing for influence in the
Middle East) have also integrated into the order while
advocating values and views not aligned to those of the
traditional leaders of the international rules-based order.
But rather than following a different model as China has,
Russia has attempted to discredit Western democracy
by challenging its ‘internal coherence,’ leveraging
information operations, and exploiting existing fissures
within Western societies.

85. Russia also seeks to restore claimed historical levels of
influence and its challenges to laws and norms in pursuit
of a sphere of influence have at times been deniable
and below thresholds for response, thus complicating
approaches from states, NATO, and other regional and
international organisations.

86. In its bid for greater influence in former Soviet republics
and further afield, Russia has challenged international
laws and norms through a range of actions, including
cyber-enabled information operations (from Russia’s
2008 invasion of Georgia through to social media
campaigns that amplified political polarisation in the
2016 United States and United Kingdom elections) and
use of military force.

87. Developments in Europe and Asia have crystallised a
sense that non-democratic and democratic systems are
in strategic competition, and that not all major powers’
aspirations can be shaped in accordance with the rulesbased order, in the way that had been hoped until recently.

88. At the same time that rules and norms have been
challenged in pursuit of spheres of influence, there have
been attempts to disrupt and influence Western nations’
political systems from the inside – an aim pursued (and
in some cases achieved) through many varied methods,
from influence via cyber and social media activities to
infrastructure building. This is a risk for open societies,
including New Zealand.


##### In the context of competition among powers, complex transnational threats will disrupt New Zealand’s neighbourhood in ways  not previously seen.


-----

###### Challenges to open societies: Looking inward

89. In Western democracies, nationalist and populist political
movements have reflected an accelerating gap between
the very wealthy and the working poor, as well as cultural
anxiety associated with immigration and demographic
shifts. These are forces broader than any singular election
result. Public distrust of institutions and elites, questions
around the credibility of information, and increasing
political polarisation (in some cases exacerbated by
foreign influence campaigns) have led to a new level of
support for disruption of established norms, institutions,
and systems.

90. Key portions of electorates believe globalisation,
immigration and multilateral institutions have come at
the expense of their prosperity and cultural identity. This
worldview drives inward focus, and is openly sceptical –
and sometimes hostile – to elements of the international
order, including economic openness.

91. Uncertainty about the future international role of the
United States has disruptive implications in itself, as
states re-assess how they should realise interests in a
shifting strategic environment. The United States national
security strategy acknowledges a more competitive
environment that will test its ability to remain a peerless
global military power.

92. Europe has also faced challenges including the economic
fragility of some Eurozone members and in managing
large inflows of asylum seekers.

93. These dynamics undercut the resolve and ability of
traditional leaders of the rules-based order to continue
to act as its central guarantors. If this circumstance
intensifies, opportunistic players may disregard the rules
and norms of the system without fear of penalty, though
others may step up to reinforce the rules and institutions
of the existing order.

94. One implication already being realised involves the
deterioration of governance across the spectrum –
liberal democracies sliding into illiberalism, some
democracies incorporating authoritarian elements as
they centralise power in executives, and authoritarian
countries becoming more authoritarian. States across
the globe have seen such deterioration. The hopes
of the Arab Spring have been largely unrealised
and worse, destabilising. Diverse internal forces are
changing governance for the worse with potentially longlasting, generational effects within countries and for the
international order.


###### Complex disrupters: Global agents of disorder

95. Complex disruptors are transnational trends that
challenge stability in complex ways. While some
offer opportunities to be harnessed, these disruptive
forces often amplify or enable other threats. Many
disproportionately impact open societies and states
with weak governance and low-resilience infrastructure.
Whereas many of these issues were once conceived of
as future trends, several are playing out now, and are
most powerful at their intersections. Some of the complex
disrupters most relevant to New Zealand’s interests
include climate change, cyber, space, advanced military
technologies, transnational organised crime, terrorism,
nuclear proliferation, and migration.

**Climate change**

96. New Zealand and Pacific island countries are increasingly
impacted by a range of compounding, climate changerelated problems stemming from rising temperatures,
rising sea levels, and other changes in weather patterns.
The impacts of these changes will be experienced most
acutely and immediately in the Pacific and the broader
developing world – places comparatively less equipped to
handle these challenges.

97. Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity
of weather extremes such as cyclones, rainfall events,
droughts, and flooding from sea level rise. New Zealand
is already experiencing the erosion of coastlines and
impacts on coastal developments and infrastructure. In
the Pacific, climate change is also exacerbating marine
water pollution and the salinisation of water supplies,
agricultural lands and fresh water ecosystems. Rising
temperature and acidification of the ocean is beginning to
impact on marine and coastal ecosystems important for
economic wellbeing and subsistence.

98. Over time, climate change impacts human security, with
increasing water shortages, food insecurity, and health
impacts such as increased vector-borne and bacterial
diseases, and compromised nutrition. Where livelihoods
are affected, climate change will induce displacement
and migration (both internal and cross-border) and has
the potential to destabilise areas with weak governance,
magnifying traditional security challenges.

**Cyber**

99. Physical distance is no protection in cyberspace, and
New Zealand is subject to a growing cyber threat from
state-sponsored and other malicious actors. The cyber
domain is inherently connected to other domains of
defence and society, including trade and commerce
conducted via the internet. Cyber blurs boundaries
between conflict and peace, and public and private.

100. Technologies in this arena have now proven their ability
to disrupt, sometimes with strategic consequences.
Cyber has been a platform for terrorists to recruit
with global reach, elections to be influenced, funds to
be stolen from central banks, and massive thefts of
intellectual property to be carried out.


###### Governments and militaries will continue to face cyber workforce challenges, competing with the private sector in a limited talent pool.


-----

101. The widespread adoption of social media has led to
challenges around the credibility of information and
amplified political and cultural divisions, especially in
open societies. Russian ‘active measures’ in the 2016
United States presidential election brought to light ‘cyberenabled information warfare’ as a disrupter in liberal
democracies with potential long-term consequences,
beyond single election results. Other countries
continue efforts to limit the availability of information
via the internet through the use of firewalls and
telecommunications regulation.

102. The number of states sponsoring cyber operations is
rising, and governments’ development of offensive cyber
capabilities is becoming increasingly normalised. The
United States and United Kingdom have discussed
cyber operations as part of counter-terrorism campaigns,
and Australia and Canada have affirmed offensive
capabilities in public strategies, conceiving of military
effects in this domain as just as logical as in other
domains. Governments and militaries will continue to
face cyber workforce challenges, competing with the
private sector in a limited talent pool.

**Space**

103. Space systems have become essential for situational
awareness and providing a range of services, including
navigation, telecommunications, Earth observation, and
banking. Denial of these services can have significant
national security implications, from economic prosperity
to public safety.

104. Space-based services are also critical enablers for
military operations – in navigation, communications
with headquarters and other deployed assets, access
to fleet-based broadband for unclassified and classified
systems, environmental situational awareness (including
weather forecasting and ice state monitoring), and even
personnel welfare. As space technologies become less
expensive space is becoming more accessible to state
and non-state actors.

105. The expected proliferation of counter-space capabilities
will increase risks of denial of access to space systems.
Denial via jamming, spoofing, and hacking is becoming
easier, more advanced and more frequent, with many
examples having occurred over the past few years.
Physical counter-space activities, whether kinetic or nonkinetic such as ground-based lasers, are more difficult
to possess but could have catastrophic effects, causing
irreversible loss of space assets as well as risking damage
to other assets through the creation of space debris.

106. Space will become increasingly congested and
competitive. Greater access to space means growing
numbers of satellites being launched and operated,
particularly in Low Earth Orbit, and an ever-growing
amount of human-created space debris. This increases
the risk of collisions and damage to critical space systems.

107. Environmental hazards – from solar flares to celestial
events – can also disrupt or damage space-based systems.

108. A rules-based approach to the responsible and peaceful
use of space by all nations is ultimately necessary
to ensure that access to and use of space can be
maintained.


**Advanced military technologies**

109. Cyber, space, autonomous, and other military
technologies are changing the nature of conflict, at once
enhancing stand-off capabilities and potentially lowering
thresholds for initiating conflict. Capabilities previously
restricted to nation states have become more common
and affordable. This allows poorly resourced nations
and non-state actors to increase the scope, scale, and
lethality of their capabilities.

110. At the high end, robotics and autonomous systems are
becoming ubiquitous across the spectrum of military
operations. Longer-range munitions, paired with powerful
sensor networks and advanced data processing, may
enable more lethal stand-off engagements. Sensors,
communication, and artificial intelligence are becoming
more powerful and integrated.

111. Across military activities, it will become more challenging
to remain interoperable with sophisticated partners
and more difficult to undertake actions without being
observed and targeted.

**Transnational Organised Crime**

112. Connections among transnational criminal organisations
continue to proliferate and drive instability in our region
and globally. Their activity exploits migration, trade,
porous borders, and ungoverned spaces, and blurs the
boundaries between legitimate business and organised
crime, as these organisations utilise legitimate financial,
legal and property services.

113. Transnational crime networks often introduce previously
unseen levels of violence into vulnerable communities,
and corruption of state institutions can threaten
governance. Organised crime also employs violence
as a means of informal contract enforcement in the
domestic illicit drugs market. Drugs and associated
violence are considerably destabilising to communities.

114. These groups are increasingly involved in cybercrime.
This expands their threat across societies, from banking
systems to infrastructure, more broadly perpetuating
insecurity. Advances in technology have favoured
increased anonymity in illicit markets. New Zealand’s
remote geography is no barrier to access to illicit
services, now available online.


###### Robotics and autonomous systems are becoming ubiquitous across the spectrum of military operations.


-----

**Terrorism**

115. Even as an international coalition has largely been
successful in rolling back the territorial gains of ISIS,
terrorism will remain a persistent challenge, fuelled
by sectarian conflict, weak governance, economic
displacement, and opposition to perceived Western
intrusion.

116. Since 2011, tens of thousands of volunteer fighters from
more than one hundred countries have travelled to Syria,
Iraq, and Libya, where they developed lethal skills and
cultivated networks. Their travel away from conflict zones
– to areas closer to New Zealand, including possibly to
South and Southeast Asia – has the potential to project
networks, instability, and conflict to new areas, and is
especially dangerous when it fuses with local grievances.

117. The threats of smaller-scale, home-grown terrorism
around the world has also become more urgent, as
technology and social media establish connections
among lone actors, local affiliates, and global movements.

**Nuclear proliferation**

118. The global nuclear order has been weakened in the
face of a number of states’ investment in increased
capabilities and use of nuclear threat rhetoric.

119. While New Zealand and others have championed the
Nuclear Weapons Ban Treaty, the P5 and NATO states
have argued that the effort fails to take into account
factors around strategic stability. A new wave of missile
proliferation is feeding regional security dilemmas,
and the inter-connectedness of nuclear command and
control and the contested space and cyber domains
may increase the dangers of non-nuclear weapons
triggering the use of nuclear weapons.

**Migration**

120. In 2015, one in every 112 people in the world was a
refugee, an internally displaced person, or an asylum
seeker. Failing states, persistent conflicts, ethnic and
religious tension, and uneven economic development
have driven migration numbers upward, to produce this
staggering statistic – the highest levels ever recorded.

121. People smuggling and human trafficking, which puts
vulnerable peoples’ lives at risk and undermines the
integrity of state borders, will persist based on the major
financial incentives for criminal networks.

Irregular immigration and increasing cultural diversity has
created a backlash in some Western societies, fuelling
populist and national political movements that have
painted an image of ‘Western values under attack’.


###### Global implications: Strategic competition and compounding disrupters

122. The forces challenging the current international rulesbased order have distinct expressions around the world
and across a variety of interest areas for New Zealand.

###### Multilateralism

123. Increasing issue complexity, declining consensus among
states, and diversification of players beyond states are
challenging multilateral institutions in ways that may
constrain small states’ ability to effectively leverage them.

124. Just as populist forces constrain the traditional
guarantors of the order, China is positioning itself as
a leader in a new phase of globalisation, and has
shown positive leadership in addressing a range of
issues, including climate change. However, there is the
possibility that a new set of multilateral priorities may
emerge, potentially to the detriment of values-based
agendas, such as human rights, arms control and nonproliferation efforts.

125. United Nations peacekeeping has become more challenging
as security environments have grown more precarious,
with missions requiring greater intelligence capabilities and
combat-ready forces to face new threat levels.

###### The Asia-Pacific

126. This region, central to New Zealand’s interests, is
increasingly shaped by strategic competition, inter-state
tensions, and nationalism. While the regional order has
accommodated regional states’ preference to pursue
a diverse set of economic and security relationships,
intensifying competition may make such arrangements
less viable. In this context, states may be compelled
to make choices, small and large, in ways they had
previously avoided. Economic tension associated with
strategic competition has the potential to impact the
multilateral trading system.

**An increasingly confident China**

127. China’s influence in the region has grown as its trade
relationships have flourished, and it has proposed bold
investment initiatives. China uses a broad set of levers in
pursuit of its external interests, including in pursuit of its
territorial claims. In 2013, China declared an Air Defence
Identification Zone in disputed areas of the East China
Sea, and more recently China’s air force has publicised
the landing of several long-range bombers, including
nuclear-capable aircraft, on features in the South China
Sea. China also uses military, coast guard, and fisheries
to act in support of its maritime claims.

128. Notably, China has created and extended multiple
artificial island features in the Spratly and Paracel
Islands upon which it has constructed bases. These
posts now feature new radar and communications
arrays, airstrips and hangars, deep water harbours, and
weapons systems, which provide China with the ability
to quickly deploy a range of additional capabilities in and


###### Increasing issue complexity, declining consensus among states, and diversification of players beyond states are challenging multilateral institutions in ways that may constrain small states’ ability to effectively leverage them.  


-----

**Australia**

129. As its 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper describes,
Australia is concerned about stability in the IndoPacific region, major power adherence to international
law and norms, North Korea’s growing missile and
nuclear arsenals, the rise of economic nationalism
and political alienation in many countries, and fragility
in the Pacific. This strategic outlook has prompted a
range of national initiatives and investments, including
increased development of Australia’s defence and
security capabilities, deepening alliance cooperation
with the United States, increased engagement with the
region’s democracies, enhanced defence activities with
Indo-Pacific countries, and bolstered engagement in
the Pacific. Australia continues to value deep, practical
cooperation with New Zealand and emphasises the
value of interoperable defence capabilities and bolstered
intelligence efforts.

**Southeast Asia at the crossroads**

130. As a linchpin between the Indian and Pacific Oceans
and home to the trade-critical Strait of Malacca,
Southeast Asia is at the centre of an expansive
geostrategic area increasingly referred to as the
Indo-Pacific. Based on ASEAN centrality, regional
architecture has grown to ensure the rights of states
and access to commons, reinforce norms, and resist
any single state dictating terms.

131. The consensus-based approach of ASEAN has been
one of the organisation’s greatest strengths, though
this approach may also lead to challenges to unity,
when external powers attempt to exercise influence
over individual member states. ASEAN states also face
issues around countering violent extremism, as well
as human rights challenges and corruption that could
potentially undercut liberal democratic governance.

**Indo-Pacific partners reinforcing the rules-based order**

132. Japan, Australia, and the United States have promoted
Indo-Pacific concepts, with all presenting India as an
important strategic partner. These strategies aim to
reinforce regional peace and stability, prosperity, respect
for the rule of law, and openness through existing
regional architectures as well as more active diplomatic
engagement with a network of democracies, and new
defence forums and trilateral arrangements. Increasing
defence engagement has featured a particular focus on
maritime security and freedom of navigation.

133. Japan’s Free and Open Indo-Pacific Policy has a strong
focus on economic engagement, development, and
infrastructure investment, alongside its imperative to
shape a more favourable environment, from Africa to
the Pacific, for peace, stability, and the rule of law. Japan
has also revised its defence guidelines, potentially
enabling its Self Defence Force to operate in more
conventional defence settings alongside its allies and
partners, relaxing constitutional limitations on the scope
of permissible operations.


134. United States strategy focuses on affirming security
commitments to United States allies, invigorating its
strategic relationship with India and other partners,
supporting strengthened regional architecture centred
on ASEAN, upholding of rules and peaceful dispute
settlement, and sustaining military advantage in Asia,
to continue to promote broad and open access to the
commons and support regional peace and security.
The United States has, however, withdrawn from the
Trans-Pacific Partnership, which marks a significant step
back from involvement in regional trade and economic
rule-making. United States withdrawal from the Paris
Climate Agreement undermines global efforts to mitigate
the impact of climate change, with potentially negative
consequences for security in the region, particularly for
highly vulnerable Pacific Island countries.

135. In addition to deepening engagement with Japan and
the United States, India’s Act East policy includes closer
cooperation with a range of ASEAN states. Its military is
highly advanced and has invested in the most capable
platforms available to it, with an emphasis on air and
naval power.

**Proliferation concern**

136. North Korea’s nuclear and missile development
increases chances for miscalculation and escalation.
It also increases risks of horizontal nuclear proliferation
in North Asia. In addition to dangerous nuclear
developments, North Korea has a substantial store of
chemical and biological weapons, a significant cyber
capability (which it has shown willingness to use),
ballistic missile capabilities and formidable conventional
forces, including significant artillery targeted at Seoul. It
remains to be seen whether high-level diplomacy may
mitigate these threats. Declarations from the recent
Inter-Korean and United States-North Korea summits
are positive steps, but the challenges associated with the
goal of de-nuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula should
not be underestimated.

**Economic vitality**

137. The Asia-Pacific’s economic dynamism is expected
to continue its trajectory, with India and Indonesia
both becoming top ten economies within the next two
decades – a power diffusion that will impact global
economic leadership and underscore the strategic
centrality of the region.


###### Australia continues to value deep, practical cooperation with New Zealand and emphasises the value of interoperable defence capabilities and bolstered intelligence efforts.


-----

###### The Pacific

138. Pacific Island countries are confronting intensifying
challenges around the impacts of climate change,
transnational crime, and resource competition, with a
growing gap in capacity to adequately address them.
A combination of complex disruptors could test local
governance, exacerbate state fragility, and likely require
increased levels of assistance, including operations
beyond humanitarian assistance/disaster relief (HADR).
New Zealand has partnered with Pacific states to
manage internal instability on several occasions in recent
years, including in Timor-Leste, Bougainville, Solomon
Islands, and Tonga. It is possible that such activities will
be required again within the next decade.

139. Concurrently, China is enhancing its influence in the
region, including through development assistance and
support for economic engagement.

###### Antarctica

140. Interest by both state and non-state actors in Antarctica
and its surrounding waters will likely grow over the
coming years. This will lead to increased congestion
and crowding, as well as pressure on key elements of
the Antarctic Treaty System, such as the prohibition on
mineral extraction. States are planning and building new
facilities. The planned Italian runway in Terra Nova Bay
could support broader activities by a range of states
interested in the region. China has begun work on its fifth
base in Antarctica, on Inexpressible Island.

141. While an evolved treaty system is likely to remain the key
framework for governing activities in Antarctica, difficulty
in distinguishing between allowed and prohibited
activities under the Antarctic treaty system could be
exploited by states seeking to carry out a range of
military and other security-related activities.


###### Middle East and North Africa

142. The majority of ISIS territory has successfully been
retaken, but instability is likely in its wake, as the Syrian
civil war enters its seventh year, Iraq continues to
struggle with sectarian division and rebuilding, Turkey
grows increasingly assertive in its response to Kurdish
territory gains in Syria, and foreign fighters travel home
or to other locations.

143. Saudi Arabia and Iran continue to vie for influence along
sectarian lines across the region and beyond. Lack of
an active Israel-Palestinian peace process, the Gulf
Cooperation Council’s internal schism and isolation
of Qatar, and the enduring conflict in Yemen add to
uncertainty and intractability.

144. Instability in this region can have significant
consequences for international security, the global
economy, and New Zealand’s own economic and
security interests. Partners in the Middle East will
continue to look to relationships with Western
countries and other key stakeholders like Japan to
help stabilise the region. These countries maintain a
military presence in the region to continue to counter
and prevent the spread of terrorism, and contribute
to maritime security operations that help protect
international trade routes and access to strategic
energy reserves. This includes operations to counter
piracy, transnational organised crime, and smuggling
that have flow on effects around the world.

###### Europe

145. A major trading partner for New Zealand and source of
like-minded support in multilateral forums, Europe faces
significant challenges associated with the three forces
pressuring the order.

146. While the spike in European populism in 2016 seemed
to wane in 2017, a longer-term analysis reveals steady
growth in support for predominantly far-right populist
parties since the 1980s, with once single-digit fringe
parties graduating to mainstream prominence.

147. The maintenance of European Union cohesion will
continue to be an important preoccupation as the EU
addresses a range of challenges, including institutional
reform, economic stability, immigration policy, and
the persistence of nationalist and populist forces that
impact on Europe’s governments.

148. Europe has also been the target of influence and
coercion campaigns by outside powers, with NATO
focusing anew on countering a formidable Russian
threat. NATO continues to be an important partner for
New Zealand in countering transnational threats.


###### A combination of complex disruptors could test local governance, exacerbate state fragility, and likely require increased levels of assistance.

#### Implications of the Strategic Environment for New Zealand’s security


-----

149. As these forces pressure the international rules-based
order, this shifting in the foundation of security is
confronting New Zealand, our partners, and our key
interests. Many of these dynamic challenges require
a span of high-level statecraft, all-of-government
strategies, and community engagement.

###### Complexity and disruption at home and in our neighbourhood

151. With New Zealand’s large maritime profile, maritime
security—from our shores and territorial waters to our
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and considerable
Search and Rescue Zone, through to approaches
and sea lines of communication—is fundamental
to national security. Challenges in this domain are
likely to intensify in decades to come. Pacific Island
countries, with far less capacity, also confront these
issues, which include (but are not limited to) the
impacts of climate change, transnational crime,
resource competition, and irregular migration.
The intersections of these disruptors underscore
formidable and rising complexities, and the need to
anticipate increased operational requirements across
the EEZ, the Southern Ocean, and the Pacific.

151.1. The impacts of climate change are being
felt acutely in the Pacific as well as in
New Zealand itself. This will necessitate more
HADR and stability operations in our region,
and greater need to plan for and respond
to civil defence emergencies resulting from
severe weather and the impacts of climate
change at home. New Zealand may be faced
with concurrent operational commitments,
which could stretch resources and reduce
readiness for other requirements.


150. Both in areas where Defence is in the lead and in
areas where Defence is in support, it will have to act
with new urgency, in new ways, and at new levels
to protect New Zealand’s interests. The ability to
act alone when required and together with partners
who share our interests and values will remain
fundamental.

151.2. Efforts by New Zealand agencies to counter
**transnational organised crime offshore,**
including with Defence assets, has the potential
to save significant police, social development,
and corrections expenditure onshore, where
community harm associated with drugs, small
arms, and other dangerous commodities can
metastasise. Several Pacific nations will likely
require assistance to counter this challenge,
from information gathering and better awareness
through to interdiction operations. The transit and
transhipment of narcotics through the Pacific,
as well as the growing threat of organised crime
groups from Asia, are destabilising factors in our
immediate region.

151.3. Increasing resource competition and resource
scarcity in the maritime domain will continue to
challenge New Zealand and the Pacific. Ability
to monitor, deter, and protect maritime interests
will be challenged by a more complex and
more competitive maritime domain, especially
given the size of New Zealand’s EEZ and scope
of current resources. This includes illegal,
unregulated and unreported fisheries activity
and whaling in the Southern Ocean.

151.4. While New Zealand’s physical distance buffers
the risk of irregular migration, people smugglers
will continue to test the viability of New Zealand
as an alternative destination. Defence will
continue to play an important role in supporting
all-of-government efforts to deter, provide early
warning, prevent, and respond to a maritime
mass arrival.

152. Steep debt burdens associated with infrastructure
projects have potential implications for influence, access,
and governance. Greater competition for influence in the
Pacific will intersect with the suite of complex disruptors.
Climate change will provide further opportunities for
a range of countries to increase their influence in the
Pacific, with investments in strong infrastructure and
green technology becoming more important.

153. New Zealand’s national security remains directly tied
to the stability of the Pacific. As Pacific Island countries’
relationships with non-traditional partners continue to
develop, traditional partners such as New Zealand and
Australia will be challenged to maintain influence and
have a more positive impact in line with our values.
Enhancing defence relationships and resilience, and
active engagement in support of enhancing regional
architecture, such as the South Pacific Defence
Ministers’ Meeting, will increase in importance.


##### With New Zealand’s large maritime profile, maritime security is fundamental to national security.


-----

-----

154. The Pacific will evolve as the suite of complex
disruptors and impacts of new players come to bear.
As our Government faces complicated decisions,
the urgency for fuller maritime domain awareness
and the ability to respond to incidents when they
arise will further increase. This involves coverage
of large tracts of ocean in regular long-range, longendurance operations. Across challenges, more
resources will be required simply to achieve baseline
security outcomes.

155. In the face of these developments, nations will rely
even more heavily on New Zealand and Australia to
contribute to security. The maritime security focus
of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States
may offer opportunities to cooperate on countering
disruptive maritime challenges.

156. As international interest in Antarctica grows, it
will be critical for New Zealand to ensure peace
and stability on its southern flank and in the Ross
Dependency, as well as the integrity of the treaty
system. It will be in New Zealand’s interest to gain
greater awareness, and like-minded nations may
also look to New Zealand to provide awareness and
advocate for transparency of all parties’ activities.


###### Increasing vulnerabilities and opportunities in cyber and space

157. New Zealand faces potential disruption to critical lines
of communication in space and cyberspace, which may
impact our nation, even when it is not the intended target.
New Zealand’s relative geographic isolation means
it is particularly dependent on two undersea cables
as well as satellite systems and other space-based
infrastructure. These connections are critical for our
increasingly services-focused economy. New Zealand’s
own involvement in space-related activities, including its
emerging space industry, is developing rapidly and our
interest in ensuring access to space should match this.

158. The Defence Force may have to operate in space and
cyber-denied environments and will have to remain
vigilant against a range of malign actors in cyberspace.
Nearly all Defence Force deployments rely on spacebased services in some way, from communications to
navigation and command and control.

159. At the same time, these domains and new military
technologies also represent opportunities for
New Zealand, given the requirement to monitor and
respond within vast maritime spaces. For example, our
investment in Wideband Global Satellite provides global
satellite communications capability for the Defence Force.

160. In addition to a focus on protection, operational effects in
cyberspace could provide Defence Force commanders
with new tools and be a new form of valued coalition
contribution. Satellite systems are critical for secure and
reliable communication between deployed and friendly
forces, as well as with headquarters. They provide
responsive and effective situational awareness, which is
essential when New Zealand exercises responsibility, over
such a large area, from the South Pole to the Equator.

161. Defence does not possess any indigenous spacebased infrastructure and relies on services provided
by our partners. This includes the Global Positioning
System (GPS) operated by the United States. GPS
enhances deployed forces’ ability to make operational
and tactical decisions in real time, enables accurate
positioning and timing for precision weapons systems,
assists in navigation, improves the safety of deployed
personnel and systems, and enhances the air, land
and sea worthiness of platforms.


###### New Zealand Defence’s ability to provide credible contributions to coalition operations in support of the rules-based order is a key component of our strong international reputation.


-----

###### Supporting stability in the Asia-Pacific

162. Southeast Asia may face a growing terrorist threat,
as foreign fighters return from the Middle East, more
experienced terror instigators are released from prison,
and home-grown terrorist elements may be fostered by
deepening religious fundamentalism. Terrorist groups
leverage local grievances, and capitals are challenged to
extend governance to the outer reaches of their borders. It
will be critical to develop and deepen defence partnerships
in Southeast Asia and, where appropriate, assist in
countering violent extremism and counter terrorism
missions, in cooperation with partners.

163. New Zealand continues to invest in strengthening
regional architecture that helps to protect the rights of
small states and enhances stability, security and free
access to global commons. Participation in the ASEAN
Defence Ministers’ Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus) and its
Expert Working Groups remains a priority for Defence,
and close cooperation with ASEAN partners to support
and strengthen that institution is vital to promoting
resilience and New Zealand values in this critical region.
Continuing to invest in bilateral defence relationships
with the countries of ASEAN will also be important.

164. North Korea is a critical disarmament and nonproliferation challenge. It will continue to be in
New Zealand’s interests to support efforts toward denuclearisation, as well as maintain our presence at the
reinvigorated United Nations Command, both of which
are valued by our ally and close partners.

165. Our interests are likely to dictate less flexibility in
managing our relationships with those who assertively
challenge the rules-based order. Defence should be
prepared to cooperate with a range of traditional and
non-traditional partners, in practical terms and in
accordance with our values, on operations such as
HADR in the Pacific and in Southeast Asia. Defence
must also be clear-eyed about the implications of
geostrategic competition, and the range of effects
and insecurities that may impact partners in our
neighbourhood and further afield. Defence should stand
ready to assist partners and multilateral institutions in
ways the Government may direct.


###### Fortifying key defence partnerships and contributing to the rules-based order

166. As forces bring increasing pressure to bear on the
international rules-based order, greater collaborative
efforts by like-minded states will be necessary to
reinforce this order from which New Zealand and so
many others benefit. As challenges to the order intensify,
it will remain in New Zealand’s vital interest to act in
support of the order, from our neighbourhood to the
Asia-Pacific and further afield, at times on our own
and at times with partners. New Zealand has a strong
international reputation as a valued, credible defence
partner and ally to Australia. Partnerships from the
Five Eyes to NATO and the EU are vital to enabling the
realisation of our interests, the promotion of our values,
and the safeguarding of our sovereignty in a complex
and changing world.

167. The Middle East will remain a critical theatre of
operations where, together with our partners, Defence
can act in favour of stability by countering piracy,
terrorism, instability, and transnational crime. These
operations stem the flow on effects that could impact
our partners, our region, and New Zealand. They also
maintain the security of sea lines of communication
critical to New Zealand’s interests.

168. As the strategic environment becomes more
challenging, it will increasingly be in New Zealand’s
interest to act to address a range of complexities. Our
partners will also strive to address greater complexity,
and their expectations of New Zealand are likely to
increase, from the Pacific to Antarctica – where they will
rely on us to a greater degree – and in places further
afield – where we act with them in support of stability
and the rules-based order.

169. New Zealand Defence’s ability to provide credible
contributions to coalition operations in support of
the rules-based order is a key component of our
strong international reputation. Interoperability,
complementary capabilities, unique perspectives,
and regional relationships are critical components of
our alliance and partnerships. Defence can continue
– and potentially bolster – its abilities to demonstrate
value along these lines.

170. As partners acquire ever-more sophisticated
capabilities, contributing to coalition operations
will require high-level network interoperability and
contributions that do not present a defensive liability
to them. In whatever areas our forces conduct
operations, it is likely that more sophisticated
technologies – including autonomous systems – will be
employed, whether by friends or adversaries. To retain
New Zealand’s reputation, freedom to act, and mitigate
risks to mission and personnel, Defence must strive to
keep pace with technological evolutions.

# C h a p t e r 5

#### Principal roles of the New Zealand  Defence Force


-----

171. The Government’s decisions about the capabilities
and operations of the Defence Force are grounded
in a clear set of expectations about the roles and
tasks the Defence Force is to undertake, where, and
with which partners. These roles, and the priorities
that support them, are determined by New Zealand’s
national security interests, and informed by the
evolving strategic environment.

###### Defence priorities

172. The Government’s highest priority for the Defence
Force is its ability to operate and undertake tasks in
New Zealand’s territory (including its EEZ) and its
neighbourhood, from the South Pole to the Equator.
This encompasses a range of activities, including
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations
in the face of increasingly severe and disruptive
weather events, maritime surveillance, and stability
and peace support operations. This priority reflects the
strategic importance of these areas to New Zealand’s
national security and foreign policy.

173. The Defence Force must be prepared to operate
independently – and lead operations – in these areas
if required.

174. New Zealand’s national security and interests also
depend on events further afield. Increasing challenges
to Asia-Pacific security, including the undermining
of the existing regional order, could impact
New Zealand’s security and prosperity. It is important
that New Zealand is able to contribute Defence
capabilities in support of Asia-Pacific regional security
as well as worldwide in support of the maintenance of
the international rules-based order.

175. Defence deployments beyond New Zealand’s
immediate region will most likely continue to be as
part of operations led by New Zealand’s security
partners, or as part of United Nations-mandated
peace support operations. Within New Zealand’s
neighbourhood, such combined operations will be
increasingly likely. The Defence Force must be able
to operate effectively with New Zealand’s key security
partners, including with our ally Australia and our
other Five Eyes partners. This will have implications
for Defence capability choices and for the shape of
Defence’s international relationships.

176. In coming years the Government will face increasing
demands for Defence Force contributions to
operations within New Zealand’s immediate region
and further afield, and across the spectrum of tasks.
Government will maintain a high level of discretion as
to the size and nature of New Zealand’s contributions
to such operations outside New Zealand’s immediate
neighbourhood. Decisions on such operations will
consider New Zealand’s national security interests,
New Zealand’s international relationships, and the
threats associated with any deployment.


###### Principal roles of the Defence Force

177. The principal roles of the Defence Force are enduring,
but are also calibrated to Government’s priorities and
New Zealand’s changing strategic environment. These
principal roles are to:

177.1. Defend New Zealand’s sovereignty and territory,
and contribute to protecting New Zealand’s
critical lines of communication

177.2. Contribute to national, community and
environmental wellbeing and resilience, and
whole-of-government security objectives

177.3. Meet New Zealand’s commitments to its allies
and partners

177.4. Support New Zealand’s civilian presence in the
Ross Dependency of Antarctica, and work with
other agencies to monitor and respond to activity
in the Southern Ocean

177.5. Conduct a broad range of operations in the
South Pacific, including leading operations when
necessary, to protect and promote regional
peace, security and resilience

177.6. Make a credible contribution in support of peace
and security in the Asia-Pacific region, including
in support of regional security arrangements

177.7. Protect New Zealand’s wider interests by
contributing to international peace and security
and the international rules-based order

177.8. Contribute to advancing New Zealand’s
international relationships

177.9. Work with other agencies to monitor and
understand New Zealand’s strategic environment

177.10.Be prepared to respond to sudden shifts in the
strategic environment

178. Together, the Defence priorities and principal roles
describe Government’s expectations for the Defence
Force’s ability to operate. Government’s decisions about
where to deploy the Defence Force and types of missions
to be undertaken within these priorities and roles will be
determined in practice by local, national, and global events.


##### The Defence Force must be able to operate effectively with New Zealand’s key security partners, including with our ally Australia and our other Five Eyes partners.


-----

###### Defending New Zealand’s sovereignty, territory, and critical lines of communication

179. Government expects the Defence Force to be able
to detect, deter and counter aggression against
New Zealand’s sovereignty and territory, enlarge
its forces if required, and provide sufficient time for
New Zealand to seek assistance from its international
security partners, should the need arise.

180. Defending New Zealand as well as the Cook Islands,
Niue and Tokelau requires the Defence Force to
contribute to the protection of New Zealand’s borders
and resources. This protection includes contributions to
New Zealand’s awareness of activities in its expansive
maritime domain and by responding to identified threats.
These contributions by Defence will become more
important over coming years with expected increased
pressure on New Zealand’s domain from a range of
threat actors.

181. The Defence Force is also expected to play an important
role in protecting New Zealand’s connections to the
rest of the world, both physical and electronic. Closer to
home, this could include leading operations to respond
to threats to shipping; further afield the Defence Force is
expected to be able to contribute to international efforts
to combat such threats.

182. New Zealand’s security and prosperity require reliable
electronic communications links, both terrestrial and
space-based. The Defence Force is expected to be able
to work alongside other agencies and New Zealand’s
international partners to promote cyber security and
resilient access to space-based systems.


###### Contributing to national, community and environmental wellbeing and resilience

183. The Defence Force plays an important role, alongside
a range of other Government agencies, in supporting
New Zealand’s overall wellbeing and resilience.
Government expects the Defence Force to be prepared
to contribute capabilities to whole-of-government
responses to a range of hazards and threats.

184. The impacts of climate change, including more frequent
extreme weather events, will likely see increasing
requirements for Defence Force support to domestic
civil defence emergency management planning and
responses, both proactive and reactive. Climate change
may also lead to more extensive Defence Force support
for the Government’s conservation, environmental
protection, and biosecurity efforts.

185. The Defence Force plays an important role in
supporting the New Zealand Police to respond to
a range of domestic emergencies. This support
extends from search and rescue on both land and
water, through to assisting Police’s counter-terrorism
activities. The Defence Force is also responsible for
conducting explosive ordnance disposal (removing
potentially hazardous ordnance from the community),
and enhancing security at events that contribute to
the social and economic wellbeing of communities.
Additionally, Defence supports Police and other
agencies, when requested, by providing specialist
underwater search capability.

186. Through programmes such as the Limited Service
Volunteers and the Cadet Forces, Defence motivates
New Zealand’s youth and provides life and employment
skills. This bolsters individuals’ prospects at critical points
in their life paths and broadly contributes to community
wellbeing. These programmes support the Government’s
broader efforts to manage social challenges and mitigate
future requirements for Government interventions.


##### Climate change may also lead to more extensive Defence Force support for the Government’s conservation, environmental protection, and biosecurity efforts.


-----

###### Meeting New Zealand’s commitments to its allies and partners

187. New Zealand’s relationship with our ally Australia is
reflected in the Closer Defence Relations mechanism,
which brings together a suite of defence-specific
agreements and relationships. But the relationship
is more than the sum of its parts. New Zealand sees
Australia not only as an ally, but a close friend and
confidante. New Zealand is therefore committed to:

187.1. Responding in the event of a direct military attack
on Australia

187.2. Promoting interoperability between the two
militaries

187.3. Developing relationships with the Australian
Department of Defence and Defence Force at
every level

187.4. Maintaining the levels of capability it needs to
work with Australia as part of a coordinated
response on regional security issues, or lead
an independent operation in support of shared
interests in the region

188. Increasing threats to regional and global security are
already affecting New Zealand, Australia and our close
partners. In this context, interoperability, combined
exercises, capability development, defence diplomacy,
intelligence sharing and personnel exchanges with
close partners are fundamental to the Defence Force’s
operating model and critical to our security.

###### Supporting New Zealand’s Antarctic presence, and operating in the Southern Ocean

189. New Zealand has a direct interest in stability on the
Antarctic continent and in the Southern Ocean. It has a
responsibility to contribute to that stability. The Defence
Force has a critical role in supporting New Zealand’s
presence and interests in the region.

190. The Antarctic Treaty System prohibits military activity
in Antarctica, but does allow militaries to carry out nonmilitary tasks in support of civilian activities. The Defence
Force provides logistics and other support that is
critical to the operation of Scott Base. Through the Joint
Logistics Pool, it contributes to the effectiveness of the
New Zealand and United States programmes. Support is
also provided to the Italian Antarctic programme.

191. New Zealand’s responsibilities in the Southern Ocean
include coordination of search and rescue activities
in the Ross Sea, as well as detecting and responding
to illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing. The
Defence Force maintains capabilities on behalf of the
Government that are able to operate in these distant
and harsh environments. The declaration of the Ross
Sea Marine Protected Area highlights the importance of
Defence Force activities – notably maritime surveillance
and patrol – in support of agencies like the Ministry for
Primary Industries and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and Trade in meeting these responsibilities.


###### Conducting a broad range of operations  in the Pacific

192. New Zealand is a Pacific country, linked by history,
culture, politics and demographics to the Pacific
Islands. New Zealand Government agencies are
intensively engaged in the Pacific. This is in recognition
that instability in the South Pacific could have direct
impacts on New Zealand’s security and wellbeing.
The Government has this year announced its “Pacific
Reset” – an updated overall approach to the Pacific
that recognises the changing nature of the challenges
facing the Pacific Islands and the requirement that
New Zealand enhance its contribution.

193. The Defence Force contributes to New Zealand’s
interests in the Pacific across a broad spectrum of
activities, including:

193.1. Contributing to stability and peace support
operations

193.2. Contributing to international and whole-ofgovernment development and capacity building
efforts (for example, supporting the professional
development of Pacific defence and security
forces as part of the Mutual Assistance
Programme)

193.3. Assisting Pacific Island states to monitor and
respond to activity in their maritime domains,
including maritime surveillance, search and
rescue and countering illegal activities and

193.4. Contributing to humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief operations

194. The increasing stresses and challenges facing Pacific
Island countries, including the impacts of climate change,
will likely lead to increasing requirements for Defence
Force operations in the Pacific. The Defence Force must
be prepared both to operate independently in the Pacific,
and to lead operations with other Government agencies
and alongside Australia, international partners, and other
states with Pacific interests.


##### The increasing stresses and challenges facing Pacific Island countries, including the impacts of climate change, will likely lead to increasing requirements for Defence Force operations in the Pacific.


-----

###### Supporting peace and security in the  Asia-Pacific region

195. New Zealand’s security interests are centred in the
broader Asia-Pacific, a diverse region that is facing a
range of acute challenges and going through a period of
potentially fundamental change. Given the importance
of this region to New Zealand, the Government’s
primary focus is on supporting regional peace and
security by developing relationships with countries,
and on contributing to the strength of regional security
arrangements and architecture. In the event of conflict,
the Government would consider a Defence contribution
as part of a broader international response.

196. New Zealand has a long history of defence and security
engagement with states in this region. New Zealand is,
for example, a longstanding member of the Five Power
Defence Arrangements, and will meet its commitments
should Malaysia or Singapore be subject to a military
attack.

197. In addition to exercising and training with regional armed
forces, the Defence Force undertakes capacity building
for militaries in the Asia-Pacific through its Mutual
Assistance Programme.

198. The Defence Force also supports New Zealand’s efforts
to uphold regional peace and security by being willing
and able to assist, alongside a range of partners, in
times of natural or humanitarian disasters, such as the
2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.

199. The Defence Force and the Ministry of Defence
participate in regional security mechanisms, of which
ASEAN forms the core. Since 2010, these arrangements
have been strengthened with the establishment of the
ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus),
which is Defence’s priority for engagement in ASEANcentric forums and includes a range of countries beyond
Southeast Asia including Australia, China, India, Russia
and the United States.


200. These meetings help to mitigate the risk of regional
conflict by bringing states together, entrenching habits of
dialogue and encouraging practical military cooperation
on issues such as maritime security, disaster relief and
counter-terrorism.

201. Defence’s participation in these mechanisms also
supports the other roles the Government expects of
it, including the advancement of security partnerships
and contributing to the rules-based order. The Defence
contribution to New Zealand’s support for Asia-Pacific
regional arrangements will become increasingly
important as the region changes.

###### Contributing to international peace and security and the international rules-based order

202. New Zealand actively supports the international rulesbased order through its support for institutions and
arrangements that reinforce global security, including the
United Nations, in alignment with New Zealand’s values.

203. New Zealand has a long history of contributing to a
range of United Nations peacekeeping operations, and
recently served a term on the United Nations Security
Council. New Zealand’s contribution to the United
Nations Truce Supervision Organization, the United
Nations Command Military Armistice Commission in
the Republic of Korea, and its more recent involvement
in United Nations operations in South Sudan all
demonstrate this long-standing support.

204. Defence Force deployments to Afghanistan, its
contribution to multinational counter-piracy operations,
and the international building partner capacity mission in
Iraq are further examples of New Zealand’s commitment
to international peace and security.

205. As a beneficiary of the international rules-based order,
New Zealand will continue to support international peace
and security through a range of Defence activities.
Government decisions on such contributions will balance
New Zealand’s interests, values and international
commitments with the likely risks and outcomes.

206. The changing global landscape and ongoing
developments in military-relevant technologies will have
implications for the nature and type of operations to
which the Defence Force may be asked to contribute.
It will likely need to deal with increasingly complex
demands and higher threat environments.


##### As a beneficiary of the rules- based order, New Zealand will continue to support international peace and security through a range of Defence activities.


-----

###### Contributing to New Zealand’s international relationships

207. New Zealand’s security and prosperity depend on
its relationships with other states. Defence and
security engagement are important aspects of these
relationships, building trust and confidence that can have
broader benefits.

208. Many of New Zealand’s closest defence relationships
have been forged over long periods of operating
together, in recent times from Iraq to Afghanistan
and nearer to home in Timor-Leste and the Solomon
Islands. Outside of an operational context, both the
Defence Force and the Ministry of Defence play a role,
alongside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and
a range of other Government agencies, in advancing
New Zealand’s international relationships.

209. The nature and extent of New Zealand’s defence
relationships vary. Many feature a mix of engagement
activities including annual dialogues between senior
officials, exchanges of defence personnel, combined
military exercises, high-level visits, and information
sharing. These activities are supplemented by a network
of Defence Attachés and Defence staff who represent
New Zealand overseas.

210. The changing strategic environment will require the
Defence Force and the Ministry of Defence to build
and maintain a more diverse and challenging set of
relationships, to ensure New Zealand is best able to
contribute to international peace and security and
advance New Zealand’s national interests.


###### Monitoring New Zealand’s strategic environment

211. New Zealand builds its understanding of its strategic
environment in a range of ways, from accessing open
source information through diplomatic reporting to the
collection and assessment of intelligence. Defence plays
an important role alongside other agencies in building
this understanding, through both its own capabilities and
via its international relationships. This understanding
is critical to ensure Government decision-making on
Defence matters – including on Defence policy and
capabilities – is well informed.

212. On behalf of the Government, the Defence Force
operates capabilities that provide unique contributions
to New Zealand’s understanding of its environment.
Defence’s ability to support understanding of our
expansive maritime domain is becoming increasingly
important for responding to threats and challenges,
including search and rescue, biosecurity, border security,
and resource protection.

213. New Zealand’s international partners also place great
value on Defence’s ability to contribute to collective
understanding of the global environment.

###### Responding to shifts in the strategic environment

214. The global strategic environment is in transition, with
major shifts in power balances and the increasing
impact of disruptive forces. Strategic shocks may occur.
Defence must be well-positioned to respond and be
able to continue to support Government objectives;
it therefore needs to have adaptive, innovative
people, robust and resilient infrastructure, and flexible
capabilities with broad utility.

215. Defence must, alongside other Government agencies,
support New Zealand’s international relationships to
ensure New Zealand is able to contribute to shaping the
international landscape in line with New Zealand’s values
and interests.

216. Defence must continue to be alert to changes in
New Zealand’s strategic environment and respond by
examining policy settings and operational activities, to
ensure it is best prepared to support New Zealand’s
security and prosperity.


##### Defence’s ability to support understanding  of our expansive maritime domain is becoming increasingly important for responding to threats and challenges.

#### Defence Force capabilities


-----

217. Capability is considered holistically and includes
people, research and development, infrastructure,
systems and technologies, equipment, platforms,
and logistics.

###### Current and planned Defence  Force capabilities

219. The roles that the Government requires the Defence
Force to fulfil, as described in the previous chapter,
determine the capabilities the Defence Force must
develop and maintain. The scope of these roles
requires the Defence Force to possess a broad
range of capabilities that enable both independent
operations and the ability to integrate into coalition
environments.

220. This section provides a high-level overview of the
Defence Force’s existing capabilities and the capability
investments and enhancements currently underway.

###### Combat capable

221. The core task of the Defence Force is to conduct
military operations, in particular combat operations.
The Defence Force maintains a range of capabilities
for the delivery of combat effects on both land and at
sea to enable it to defend New Zealand’s sovereignty,
meet New Zealand’s commitments to allies and
partners, respond to security events in New Zealand’s
neighbourhood, and contribute to international peace
and security further afield.

222. To ensure these combat forces are able to carry out
their missions effectively, Defence Force personnel
must be appropriately trained and equipped for
the likely threats they will face as well as to ensure
New Zealand’s contributions to multinational
operations are credible and valuable.

223. Well-trained and operationally prepared ground forces
provide effective land combat capabilities that the
Government can deploy for a wide range of tasks,
either independently or as part of a multinational
force. These land force elements are flexible and
can be configured to respond to tasks ranging from
humanitarian support through to combat in the form
of a combined arms task group that includes infantry,
artillery and Light Armoured Vehicles.

224. New Zealand Special Operations Forces maintain
a high state of readiness to inform or resolve
contingencies that are of significant importance for
New Zealand. These forces are trained and equipped
to conduct special operations independently or as
part of a multinational coalition, and are able to do
so discreetly or visibly. Special Operations Forces
are innovative adaptive and agile but generalist


218. This chapter sets out at a high level the Defence
Force’s current force structure, the changing drivers
and demands for Defence Force capabilities, and
identifies some areas in which examination of capability
enhancements will be required. More detailed capability
requirements to satisfy New Zealand’s Defence policy
settings will be developed in the context of the Defence
_Capability Plan Review 2018._

These forces are able to support other Defence Force
elements and other Government agencies nationally, in
New Zealand’s neighbourhood and further afield.

225. At sea, New Zealand’s ANZAC frigates – together with
supporting elements such as maritime replenishment –
are able to operate across the spectrum of operations
from constabulary and humanitarian tasks, to combat
roles as part of multinational coalitions. The frigates
can also protect other vessels, and their embarked
helicopters provide extended reach, surveillance
and air-delivered combat effects.

226. The P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft provide a key
maritime combat capability that can also support
other Government agencies on a range of domestic
contingencies, such as search and rescue and
disaster relief. These aircraft enable the Government
to offer a highly valued capability to international
coalition operations. Work is underway to upgrade the
Orion’s underwater intelligence, reconnaissance and
surveillance capabilities. A proposal to replace these
aircraft with a new maritime patrol aircraft, which will
continue to have benefit of the upgraded systems,
is being considered by Cabinet this year.


##### The scope of these roles requires the Defence Force to possess a broad range of capabilities that enable both independent operations and the ability to integrate into coalition environments.


-----

###### Expeditionary

227. The Defence Force must be sufficiently self-reliant that
it can conduct independent operations in and around
New Zealand, from Antarctica to the South Pacific.
This includes the ability to conduct a range of patrol
operations in New Zealand’s expansive maritime domain,
conduct sealift and airlift in support of operations from
disaster relief to security and stabilisation operations in
the South Pacific, and support New Zealand’s civilian
presence in Antarctica.

228. New Zealand’s national interests extend beyond our
region – they are global. The Defence Force must
also be able to operate and deliver a range of effects
far from New Zealand’s shores, and have sufficient
capability depth to sustain these operations to meet the
Government’s requirements.

229. The HMNZS Canterbury provides a sealift capability
that enables the Defence Force to deploy personnel,
vehicles, helicopters and stores.

230. The Defence Force’s fleet tanker HMNZS Endeavour
has recently been retired, and its replacement, HMNZS
Aotearoa, is currently under construction. Once in
service, this new vessel will provide New Zealand with
an ice-strengthened maritime sustainment capability
that can be used to support a range of operations
globally, from replenishment at sea of deployed naval
combat forces, through enabling joint force operations,
to supporting New Zealand Government activities in
Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.

231. The Defence Force fields tactical and strategic airlift
capabilities to support the movement of personnel and
equipment. The C-130 Hercules and the B757 provide a
key airlift capability for the deployment of personnel and
equipment for the Defence Force within New Zealand’s
immediate region and further afield.


232. Defence Force air transport capabilities enable it
to support New Zealand’s interests in Antarctica,
particularly through their contribution to the
New Zealand, United States and Italian Antarctic
programmes as part of the Joint Logistics Pool.

233. Utility helicopters provides logistics support, including
troop transport and sustainment. The NH90 medium utility
helicopter provides the backbone of the Defence Force’s
tactical rotary transport capability. The A109 helicopters
provide a combined rotary wing pilot training and light
transport capability to support a range of Government
agencies. The A109s also can support domestic counterterrorism activities and Special Operations Forces.

234. The Defence Force’s fleet of patrol vessels and aircraft
enables the Defence Force to deliver a range of effects,
including in support of other agencies, in New Zealand’s
expansive maritime domain. This includes fisheries
patrols from the Southern Ocean to the South Pacific,
transport of personnel and equipment to offshore
islands, the protection of New Zealand’s border and
resources, and contributions in support of regional
security. A project to acquire an ice-strengthened ocean
patrol vessel is currently underway, as is a project to
equip the patrol vessels with a ship-borne remotely
piloted surveillance system.

###### Information led

235. Managing and effectively using information is
fundamental to Defence Force operations. The
Defence Force needs to be able to gather and analyse
information from a range of sources, and share that
information with the right people – including other
agencies – to ensure its effectiveness.

236. The P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft provide a wide
area surveillance capability that is critical to maintaining
awareness of activities in New Zealand’s maritime
domain. A replacement capability would continue to
provide that awareness for the Government.

237. New Zealand Special Operations Forces provide discreet
reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities to inform
Defence Force and Government decision-making. These
forces are able to integrate with multinational coalition
operations and are able to work in support of other
Government agencies.

238. The Defence Force is establishing the infrastructure for
a new Strategic Bearer Network that will provide satellite
communications support to a number of capabilities
including maritime patrol aircraft and frigates.

239. The Defence Force is also building an enhanced cyber
protection and support capability to ensure the resilience
of its information systems, and putting in place additional
intelligence personnel to process, analyse and distribute
information.


##### New Zealand’s national interests extend beyond our region – they are global. The Defence Force must also be able to operate and deliver a range of effects far from New Zealand’s shores.


-----

###### Interoperable

240. Whether at home or abroad, the Defence Force will most
likely be operating alongside other Government agencies
and New Zealand’s international partners. The Defence
Force must therefore maintain capabilities that enable it
to work effectively with others, notably Australia and the
other Five Eyes nations. This interoperability amplifies
the Defence Force’s ability to contribute to multinational
operations and facilitates integration with partners’
capabilities, to support New Zealand’s national security
objectives.

241. This interoperability involves the development
and deployment of complementary capabilities as
appropriate, ensuring mutual familiarity at the personnel
level (developed through personnel exchanges and
exercising), and compatibility of communications
systems.

###### Flexible

242. Flexibility in capability terms has several important
facets. Given the breadth of the roles required of the
Defence Force, individual Defence Force capabilities
must, in general, be applicable to a range of tasks.
This aspect of flexibility enables the Defence Force
contributions to New Zealand’s national resilience.

243. The Defence Force itself must be ready to react rapidly
to developing situations, including by moving forces into
(and within) areas quickly. Defence procurement must
adapt quickly to changing operational requirements and
keep pace with advances in technology.

###### Planned capability enhancements

244. On an ongoing basis, Defence manages a set of
programmes to modernise Defence Force capabilities
and ensure the Defence Force is able to operate
effectively. These include projects to upgrade combat
and communications systems on ships and aircraft,
ensure land force elements have access to modern
equipment, systems and weaponry (such as the Network
Enabled Army project), and maintain the effectiveness of
Defence Force communications networks.


###### Capability challenges

 Increasing demands for Defence Force activities in our neighbourhood

245. Chapters Three, Four, and Five set out the drivers for
increases in the scale, scope, and frequency for Defence
Force activities in New Zealand’s neighbourhood from
Antarctica through to the South Pacific. The underlying
drivers for these increases include climate change,
resource competition, the increasing presence of malign
non-state and transnational actors, as well as the
increasing presence and influence of new partners.

246. In coming years the Defence Force will very likely be
called upon to undertake an increasing number of
routine and non-routine interventions in New Zealand’s
neighbourhood to protect and promote New Zealand’s
national security and foreign policy interests. This will
likely include increased resource protection activities,
more frequent and more complex disaster relief
operations in the Pacific, more demanding peace and
stability operations, and more regular engagements
with regional security partners. Underpinning these
interventions will be an increasing requirement to
monitor and understand activities in this region.

247. This increasing number of activities will not necessarily
require a significant change in the nature of Defence
Force capabilities, but meeting these requirements,
particularly in terms of concurrency and sustainment,
will be increasingly challenging.

###### Maintaining interoperability and military effectiveness

248. Interoperability with our traditional partners is a critical
strategic imperative for the Defence Force. The updated
principal roles reaffirm this requirement for the Defence
Force. Advances in technology and the military capabilities
being brought into service by Defence partners will have
significant interoperability implications for New Zealand’s
decisions around Defence capabilities. In general, keeping
in line with New Zealand’s partners will increasingly require
more sophisticated platforms and enabling infrastructure.

249. Similarly, the environments into which the Defence
Force deploys are becoming more complex, with more
capable threat actors that are increasingly using a
range of technologies in novel and challenging ways.
Maintaining operational effectiveness and mitigating
threats to personnel in these environments is
becoming more challenging.


###### Defence procurement must adapt quickly to changing operational requirements and keep pace with advances in technology.


-----

###### Managing major platform replacement

250. A number of the Defence Force’s major capability
platforms are at or approaching the end of their service.
Managing the retirement of these platforms and
introducing replacement capabilities is already and will
continue to be a major Defence focus in coming years.

251. The Defence Force’s fleet tanker HMNZS Endeavour
has recently been retired, and its replacement, HMNZS
Aotearoa, is currently under construction.

252. The Defence Force’s dive tender HMNZS Manawanui
has also been recently retired, as was the hydrographic
survey ship HMNZS Resolution in 2012. Defence is
working toward a diving and hydrographic support
capability to replace these vessels.

253. Cabinet will decide on replacing the Defence Force’s P-3
Orion maritime patrol aircraft capability. Defence is also
in the process of examining options for replacing the
Defence Force’s C-130 and B757 transport aircraft.

254. Looking further out, the ANZAC frigates, which comprise
the Defence Force’s naval surface combat capability, will
be due for retirement in the late 2020s to early 2030s.

255. Separate from these major capability decisions, Defence
must continue to modernise the equipment available
to the Defence Force to ensure mission effectiveness.
Defence must also ensure the infrastructure in place
in New Zealand is appropriate for the tasks the
Government requires of the Defence Force.

###### Particular capability requirements

 Maritime domain awareness and response

256. As previously noted, over coming years New Zealand
will very likely face increasingly challenging
requirements to identify, characterise and respond
to activity in its expansive maritime domain,
encompassing waters from Antarctica to the South
Pacific. Government will expect Defence to contribute
to meeting these requirements, from supporting search
and rescue efforts through to countering overtly hostile
non-state and potentially state actors.


257. The Defence Force will also likely continue to be called
on to support maritime security further afield – as it has
recently with the deployment of P-3 Orion maritime patrol
aircraft to the Indian Ocean region – both to ensure the
security of New Zealand’s lines of communication and to
contribute to international peace and security.

258. Delivering against these requirements will likely mean a
layered approach to characterise potential threats and
best target interventions. Such an approach would bring
together New Zealand and partner naval, air and space
assets, fixed infrastructure, and enhanced data processing
and analytical capabilities. Defence will need to examine its
mix of capabilities to ensure it is best placed to contribute
to delivering against Government’s priorities.

###### A Defence contribution to New Zealand’s secure access to space systems

259. New Zealand’s secure access to space-based systems
will depend on the development of international norms
that influence behaviour in space. A rules-based
approach that promotes the responsible use of space
by all nations supports the protection of New Zealand’s
interests, and matches our broader interest in reinforcing
the international rules-based order.

260. New Zealand is developing its national space policy, and
Defence has an important role to play in this process.
Defence also supports the promotion of New Zealand’s
interests through its engagement on space issues
with a range of international partners, most notably
via the Combined Space Operations initiative and the
Schriever Wargame, which involve Five Eyes states
as well as France and Germany. As New Zealand’s
Defence partners move towards closer interoperability
in space, Defence must ensure it has the right people
with the right expertise to contribute domestically and
internationally on these issues.

261. Given the importance of access to space-based systems
for New Zealand’s security and prosperity, Defence
should also:

261.1. Explore how space capabilities could be developed
and used as part of its capability mix, including as a
contribution to New Zealand’s security partnerships

261.2. Ensure the Defence Force is able to continue to
operate effectively in space-denied or degraded
environments. Space capabilities to be examined
could include supporting communications or
maritime surveillance, or the ability to contribute
Defence staff to support partners’ capabilities that
benefit New Zealand


##### Interoperability with our traditional partners is a critical strategic imperative for the Defence Force.


-----

###### Enhanced Defence cyber capabilities

262. Across all the tasks required of it by Government, the
Defence Force will face an increasing cyber threat and
environments in which cyber activities are increasingly
part of day-to-day military activity. Even non-operational
activities will be subject to cyber threats, as the number
of state and non-state actors with cyber capabilities of
increasing sophistication grows. The Defence White
_Paper 2016 set out an increased capability for protecting_
Defence’s networks, but did not expand the range of
cyber activities Defence was to be able to undertake.

263. To maintain relevant combat capabilities, including
interoperability with close partners, into the future the
Defence Force needs to be able to conduct a broader
range of cyber operations. This would provide military
commanders with a broader set of tools to achieve
military objectives and respond to activities that threaten
both New Zealand’s security and the safety of Defence
Force personnel. Such Defence cyber capabilities would
not replicate the functions delivered by the Government
Communications Security Bureau. Defence will develop
the required policy and legal frameworks to ensure lawful
and effective use of these capabilities in collaboration
with relevant domestic agencies.

###### Approach


###### Review of the Defence Capability Plan

264. More detailed capability requirements to satisfy the
_Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018 and the_
financial implications will be developed in the context
of the Defence Capability Plan Review 2018 to be
undertaken in the second half of 2018.

###### Conclusion

265. To meet Government’s requirements, the Defence Force
will continue to need a mix of capabilities with broad
utility. In addition to delivering tasks in support of national
resilience in New Zealand’s territory and neighbourhood,
the Defence Force will also need capabilities that enable
it to remain relevant and make credible contributions to
international efforts in support of peace and security.


The Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018 has been prepared by the Ministry of Defence, in consultation
with the New Zealand Defence Force. The review process has been guided by a cross-agency Chief
Executive Governance Group chaired by the Ministry of Defence and NZDF and whose members include
the chief executives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of the Prime Minister and
Cabinet, and representation from the Treasury. Throughout this process, the Review Director and team
have been advised by two groups – an internal Defence advisory group, and an advisory group consisting
of stakeholder agencies, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of the Prime
Minister and Cabinet, the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management, the Treasury, the State
Services Commission, the Ministry for Primary Industries, Customs New Zealand, the New Zealand Police
and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Both advisory groups have provided subject
matter input and expertise throughout the review process. The Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018
was approved by Cabinet in May 2018.


##### To maintain relevant combat capabilities into the future the Defence Force needs to be able to conduct a broader range of cyber operations
