LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT PLAN 
2006 - 2015 Zagreb, June 2006 
(The LTDP was adopted in Croatian Parliament on 7 July 2006 and published in the Official Gazette no. 81 of 19 July 2006). 

The Long Term Development Plan of the Croatian Armed Forces (CAF) for the period 2006 - 2105 is a document that puts into operation the vision of the Croatian Armed Forces shown in the Strategic Defence Review. Four basic missions of the CAF are identified in the Strategic Defence Review: protection of the sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia, defence of the Republic of Croatia and its allies; participation in crisis response operations abroad; participation in confidence and security building measures; and assistance to civilian institutions in the country. In order for the CAF to be ready to conduct missions defined in this way, it is necessary to develop the following capabilities: timely availability of forces; command and control capabilities; capabilities for the efficient use of information; deployment and mobility capabilities in areas of operation, efficiency in the engagement of forces, sustainability and capability for conducting long-term operations, survivability and force protection. Considering the fact that the threat assessment for the Republic of Croatia indicates a low probability of a classical military threat and a need to participate in a wide spectrum of military tasks, in this ten year period the Armed Forces will develop their capabilities relying on fully professional personnel, including soldier-trainees and a contract reserve. 

The key CAF capabilities will be developed through a series of projects and tasks in the most important areas of development: human resources, material resources, the logistic system, doctrine and training, international military cooperation, research and development. In the field of human resources the main development goals are achieving a fully professional personnel structure, the contract reserve, soldier-trainees and the new category of personnel - military-specialists. Military education will rely on the civilian education system, complemented with military programmes during the career. 

In the field of material resources emphasis will be given to equipping the Armed Forces services and units with modern weaponry and military equipment as well as to the modernisation of existing weaponry and military equipment that meets the needs for the development of key capabilities. The most important equipping and modernisation project of the Land Forces will be a new armoured personnel carrier. 

The emphasis of equipping in Air Force and Air Defence will be given to a new combat aircraft which will be put into use when the existing aircraft resources expire and a modern radar system. The Croatian Navy will be equipped with a new patrol ship which will ensure the capability for control of territorial waters and the protected ecological fishing zone in the Adriatic Sea. For the needs of the main equipping and modernisation projects in the CAF 8.879 billion kuna has been planned over a ten-year-period. 

A prerequisite for attaining the aimed organizational structure, accommodation standards, personnel and unit training as well as rational resource management is regrouping of accommodation and storage capacities as well as modernisation of facilities and infrastructure. For this purpose 1.920 billion kuna has been planned for a ten-year-period. To ensure capabilities for leadership and command of the Armed Forces in all conditions, it is necessary to provide modern communication-information equipment and resources, and the appropriate capability for maintenance and investment in other operational needs. Modern armed forces are inconceivable without highly motivated professional personnel. This plan foresees adequate resources for their recruitment and professional development In order to achieve such demanding development goals a stable level of allocations are necessary for defence needs at an annual level of 2% of the GDP. This will create stability in financing and the possibility to start with multi-year development projects, without which the desired level of capabilities of the Croatian Armed Forces is unable to be achieved.

# Table Of Contents Introduction

The Croatian Armed Forces (CAF) protect the sovereignty and independence and defend the territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia. To meet these requirements it is necessary that the CAF adjust to the security changes. The need for development of society as a whole requires armed forces that are suitable to security challenges and at the same time, able to be financed by the state. The principal document that directs the development of the CAF is the CAF Long-Term Development Plan (CAF LTDP). In accordance with the Defence Law, the Ministry of Defence prepares this document, which is adopted by Croatian Parliament at the Government Cabinet's proposal. The Programme of the Croatian Government for the 2003-2007 mandate period, declares the need for change and adoption of new strategies (The National Security Strategy, The Defence Strategy, and The Military Strategy). Considering the fact that the development and adoption of the CAF LTDP became *conditio sine qua non* for the continuation of defence reforms in the Republic of Croatia, a need has been imposed to adopt a new starting point for drafting the first CAF LTDP, along with simultaneous adjustment of existing strategies with this starting point. With the development of the first Strategic Defence Review (SDR),
the MoD created the necessary starting point, by proposing basic directions for the continuation of defence reforms and the CAF development. The CAF LTDP 2006-2015 relies upon the findings and recommendations of the SDR, which is the result of a consensus at the top level of state leadership, and at the same time, a result of close cooperation with other government-departments, experts in the area of defence, as well as with future NATO allies. In this way, the SDR represents a "bridge" in a period that requires adjustment of strategic and legal documents, while continuing with the already initiated transformation processes within the CAF. 

The task of CAF LTDP 2006 - 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the "Plan") is to determine the course of the CAF development in the following ten-year period as well as to define the obligations of defence system elements in the fulfilment of the Plan. By adopting this document, the Croatian Parliament shows its determination to conduct defence system reform and obliges the Government to provide the necessary resources to achieve the goals defined in this Plan. The Plan is a starting point for all developmental and implementation plans within the framework of the CAF and the MoD, including defence budget proposals and MoD financial plan proposals. The objective of this Plan is to determine the military capabilities that the CAF will develop and maintain, as well as the financial framework and dynamics for their fulfilment. Following the findings and recommendations of the SDR, future military capabilities will be suitable to meet modern security challenges and available resources. 

The SDR proposed the course of CAF development, by defining their future missions and tasks, as well as the capabilities they must possess for a successful conduct of those missions and tasks and participation within the collective defence system. In accordance with this proposal, the vision of the CAF is as follows: 
- A CAF numerical size that will not exceed 16 000 active military personnel, 2 000 civilian personnel, 2 000 soldier-trainees (overall annual contingent) and up to 6 000 contract reserve members; 
- The CAF will be manned exclusively with a volunteer contingent by 2010; - Abandonment of the present territorial principle of force organization; - the CAF service commands will have a primary role in the preparation of forces, while the CAF General Staff will be responsible for the conduct of operations; 
- a separately organized joint command will provide support in the segments of logistic, health care and personnel; 
- the land forces will be the incumbent of CAF joint operations conduct, by developing and maintaining balanced capabilities to respond to modern security challenges; 
- 8% of the active land component will be deployed or ready to be deployed to international military operations, while 40% will possess capabilities to participate in operations outside the territory of the Republic of Croatia; 
- Members of the contract reserve will prepare to participate in operations inside and outside Croatian territory; 
- Naval forces will develop capabilities for surveillance and protection of the maritime space of the Republic of Croatia, as well as support for the land forces in joint operations; 
- the air forces will maintain capabilities for surveillance and protection of Croatian air space, as well as support for the land forces in joint operations; 
- CAF capabilities will be achieved and maintained through adequate training of units and CAF members, as well as through the procurement of the necessary weaponry and equipment. 

This vision is the result of a realistic assessment of threats and risks, existing and anticipated CAF missions and tasks, obligations assumed within the international framework and the expected resources that the Republic of Croatia will be able to allocate to the defence budget. The first chapter of this document provides a description of tasks that the CAF will conduct in the future, capabilities necessary for their implementation, targeted structure and size of the CAF and their territorial placement. 

The second chapter defines the development goals in the area of personnel, material resources, training and doctrine, international military cooperation and research and development. The third chapter establishes the budget, i.e. the financial framework that will enable the achievement of development goals. The fourth chapter elaborates mechanisms for ensuring implementation of the Plan as well as management of risks that may hinder or even impede the realization of goals. 

# I. **Missions And Tasks, Military Capabilities And Structure Of** The Caf

## 1. Caf Missions And Tasks

The Croatian Armed Forces have four fundamental missions: protection of the sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia, defence of the Republic of Croatia and its allies; participation in crisis response operations abroad; participation in CSBM's; assistance to civilian institutions in the country. The probability of a conventional attack on the Republic of Croatia is very low and the CAF structuring and dimensioning, besides their basic mission in protection of sovereignty and defence of territory, will be adequately influenced by all other missions and tasks. 

For the fulfilment of their basic constitutional mission the CAF will retain the capability for increasing the overall military potential of the country to a necessary level. The capability to increase the military potential will be ensured by preserving the mechanism of general military obligation, by introducing voluntary military service, and by adopting a new reserve concept (contract and non-assigned reserve). 

The reserve component will reinforce the CAF potential for the conduct of operations in the country and abroad. The contract reserve will man reserve units with an active core, ready to be assigned to any kind of operation within 120 days from the day the decision is made. The units manned with non-assigned reservists will be organised, equipped and trained only in the case that the Republic of Croatia were threatened by a potential aggression. The available time for their organization and training will take between 120 to 360 days. The CAF
will keep records of non-assigned reservists (about 40.000) and keep prepared part of the infantry and artillery weaponry as well as critical equipment. The members of the nonassigned reserve will not be called for military service or trained until a threat escalate to such a level as to require a substantial increase of defence capabilities in the country. 

## 2. Key Caf Operational Capabilities

During the transformation of the defence system changes will be made that will increase the capabilities to respond to security challenges and threats. This process will be kept open for new, innovative solutions in areas of doctrine, organization and personnel and training. The transformation of the CAF is focused on reaching the necessary level of military capabilities of the peacetime CAF component to perform all military tasks, as well as on developing capabilities for the adjustment of the defence system to a dynamic security environment. The transformation process will be constantly adjusted to NATO and EU development as well as with processes in our local and global environment. In the event of significant changes, the development of CAF capabilities will be adapted to the new conditions. 

In the future, the CAF will, within the scope of international crisis response operations, play a more significant role outside national territory, in areas where the possibility for reliance on the existing infrastructure is very limited. Such actions will always be carried out within the framework of allied forces, whether NATO, UN, EU or other coalition forces, in accordance with the interests and possibilities of the Republic of Croatia. To fulfil such tasks rules of engagement for units and CAF members abroad will be adopted in accordance with the Croatian legislation and the legislation of international organizations under which Croatian forces will be engaged. 

Keeping in mind the financial resources available for defence, the CAF will not be able to develop the whole spectrum of military capabilities necessary for independent action outside Croatian territory. Should such a need arise the CAF will rely to some extent on allies that possess these capabilities. In order to deter a conventional attack, the CAF will maintain certain capabilities at a level that will enable the increase of the country's defence potential. The development of force capabilities and functional areas in the CAF will be directed toward the ability to plan and conduct joint operations. To attain those capabilities an important role is assigned to adapting the education and training systems of leading and commanding personnel. The key factor for successful and equal participation in future joint international operations is interoperability in all areas of activity. In that respect, the realization of Partnership Goals and f obligations assumed within the framework of MAP and PARP is of the highest priority. 

The new CAF missions and tasks, such as participation in crisis response operations outside national territory, including the fight against international terrorism, require a completely new profile of military capabilities that will be defined through the development of the following seven, mutually conditioned and interrelated capabilities: 
- timely availability of forces; - command and control (C2) capabilities; 
- capabilities for effective use of information; 
- capabilities for deployment and mobility of forces in the area of operation; 
- effective engagement of forces; - sustainability and capability for the conduct of long-lasting operations; - survivability and force protection capabilities. 

## Timely Availability Of Forces

With the aim of developing capabilities for timely engagement of adequate forces, CAF units will have different levels of readiness: Rapid Response Forces will be ready for intervention within 24 hours in various types of emergency situations in the country. This level of readiness will constantly encompass a reinforced mechanised company and a company for special operations a portion from naval infantry units, combat support units and services (engineer platoon, NBC platoon, signals platoon, military police platoon, transport platoon and medical team), Air Force units within the air space protection system (on-duty pair and Air Monitoring and Navigation), two transport/MEDEVAC helicopters, and two PC-9 aircraft, two Coast Guard vessels and Coastal Monitoring and Alarming units. The CAF units included in an actual rotation of NATO Response Forces (NRF), or EU Battle Groups, will stand ready to be deployed abroad within 5 days. Up to 10% of the total CAF active forces will be included in this level of readiness. 

Forces with a High Level of Readiness can reach full combat readiness within 30 days for operations in the country and within 90 days for operations abroad. This level of readiness will encompass a battalion for special operations, a reinforced motorised/mechanised battalion and a naval infantry company with part of the combat support units and services
(two engineer companies, a NBC company, signals company, MP company, air defence units and a battalion for general logistic support from the Support Command). Furthermore, all air force and naval units, as well as CIS (communication and information systems) units in the entire CAF will be able to reach the required level of readiness within this period. About 35% of the total active forces will be included in this level of readiness. Forces with a **Low Level of Readiness** can reach their full combat readiness within a period of 30 to 120 days. They are intended for support to activities and engagement of Rapid Response Forces and Forces with a High Level of Readiness. All units manned with professionals, who are not at one of the previously mentioned levels of readiness, as well as units manned with contract reservists will be at this level of readiness. In the units manned with contract reservists, the active core will have the task of training reserve and active personnel within services. About 55% of the total active armed forces and units manned with contract personnel will be included in this level readiness forces. 

Forces with a Longer Period of Mobilization (forces intended for the increase of CAF potential) can reach the required combat readiness within a period from 120 to 360 days. They are intended for force development for national defence and they will rely upon members of the unassigned reserve. Conceptual definition of these forces demonstrates the capability of the CAF for increasing to the level required for the defence of the national territory within a certain time period. If necessary, all Croatian citizens - draft eligible persons, may be called up for service in the CAF, in accordance with constitutional and legal regulations. 

With an aim to maintain the defined degrees of readiness, the CAF will: 
- structure and equip up to 40% of the active land forces and part of the other forces (primarily the units from combat support branches and services), in a manner that enables their deployment to areas of operation outside the Republic of Croatia, 
- active land forces constantly ready to deploy or already included in operations, have up to 8% of the
- ces necessary to carry out tasks, forces for support, possible reinforcement and evacuation of engaged forces. Plan, along with the for

The type and size of units at a particular level of readiness will depend on the security assessment, planned tasks and assumed obligations. 

## Command And Control **Capability**

The Command and control system within the CAF will be developed in a manner which enables shortening the period necessary for decision making as well as for timely preparation and deployment of forces to the area of operations. This system will be able to simultaneously plan and conduct the following military operations: 
a. one operation for defence of national territory, with or without calling upon Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty, b. Two operations within the scope of international crisis response operations outside Croatian territory (with forces equivalent to one reinforced battalion), 
c. Support for operations reducing the consequences of emergency situations in the country (with forces equivalent to a task-tailored battalion). 

d. Command and lead CAF commands and units in performing regular peacetime tasks. 

Furthermore, the command and control system will have the capability to command and control (national chain of command) all the individuals that participate in international operations, activities, missions or within NATO, EU, UN and other commands. The chain of command in peacetime and in emergency situations (participation in international crisis response operations, accidents caused by human, technical or natural factors and the like) is shown in figure 2 below. The CAF service commands and Support Command will provide and prepare forces required for the conduct of an operation, as well as for the conduct of everyday activities in their own organizational units. 

A particular unit or an individual sent to an operation will be temporarily subordinated to the ![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)

accidents, emergencies etc.) 
The command and control system during conduct of operations in defence of the Republic of Croatia during aggression will not differ significantly from the one in peacetime. The commands of the three CAF services will be dimensioned and organised to exercise peacetime tasks and will be able to provide part of their personnel or individual modules for the forming of task tailored operational commands. By increasing and manning with personnel from all branches, units and services of the CAF the task tailored operational commands will have the necessary number and profile of staff personnel to cover the needs of planning and conducting joint operations. 

## Capability To Effectively Use Information

Rapid development and progress in the area of computer technology today opens the possibility for gathering, transmitting, processing and distributing a considerable amount of information. Based on exact, timely processed and delivered information, it is possible to increase the efficiency of forces to a significant extent, as well as to successfully fulfil tasks with far smaller forces. Therefore, the CAF will in the future pay much more attention to the capability to use information. The command-information and communications systems and the military intelligence system will play the most important role in developing and maintaining this capability. The CAF military intelligence system, in cooperation with other Croatian intelligence and security agencies, will develop the capabilities for gathering information of interest for the CAF, their processing and distribution to users. Within the framework of the CAF intelligence system, an Electronic Surveillance Centre will be organized as a GS Sub-Staff unit, while the military-intelligence battalion will be organized as a unit within the Croatian Army. The CAF will also posses the capability for institutional exchange of intelligence and other information with allied forces. National intelligence elements will be also sent to the area of international operations, with the task to ensure intelligence support to the national contingent engaged in an operation.

## Force Deployability And Mobility Capabilities

The capability for deploying and sending forces to operations outside Croatian territory will be developed only for the portion of units for which this type of activity is anticipated in the future. Obligation of all CAF members to participate, if necessary, in operations outside Croatian territory and the possibility to deploy contract reservists and civilian personnel to such operations will contribute to the overall deployment capability. 

With the aim of increasing deployment capability of forces, the CAF will: 
- direct equipping and modernization of forces (primarily with combat equipment and communication-information systems at all levels) towards equipment and systems that can be transported by air; 
- be structured into modules, which enables separation of a portion of forces necessary for the conduct of operations, as well as their manning and rotation, by applying the same criteria on combat services units and combat support services units; 
- plan and conduct strategic transport and force deployment together with allies, while tactical transport will be conducted with our own forces and resources; 
- ensure units with an adequate level of tactical mobility in the area of operation. 

The mobility of the forces will be significantly increased through the procurement of wheeled armoured personnel carriers, through modernization and expansion of capacities for air transport at the tactical level, as well as through the procurement of other non-combat transport vehicles. All CAF elements taking part in a certain operation or activity will have the required level of mobility. 

## Effective **Engagement**

Effective engagement of forces implies success in the fulfilment of the planned effects of a particular operation. These effects can be combat in character, but are also becoming more and more non-combat in nature. Combat efficiency depends on the successful direct or indirect action against targets on land, on water, under water and in the air, including the capability for the conduct of information and other operations. Due to limited financial resources, the CAF do not have the possibility of applying all the recent achievements of modern technology; however, gradual modernization of existing and procurement of new combat systems will increase the capability for selecting, locating, assigning and neutralizing targets, as well as the capability for functioning under difficult weather conditions, at night and in low visibility. The desired effect can be obtained even before the use of forces, through a credible demonstration of forces and capabilities. The time needed for the deployment of forces will be reduced by increasing intelligence system capabilities and capabilities within the command and control system. Besides possessing capabilities for an efficient use of armed force against an enemy, the CAF will also develop capabilities for a gradual reduction of the intensity of a conflict, as well as capabilities for participation in stabilization and calming the situation in the area activity. Since the CAF are facing a financially very demanding process of a comprehensive modernization and equipping, the possibility for development of forces that can participate in a high-intensity conflict i.e. that can be deployed in the initial phase of a conflict in a joint international operation is very limited. 

Therefore, at the beginning of the process of equipping and modernization the CAF will primarily develop forces and capabilities that can be used in the phase of stabilization and peace keeping. For that purpose, the CAF will declare and place at disposal forces that will be equipped, organized and trained for participation in longer joint international peace support operations, during which low to medium- intensity conflicts can be expected. 

The development of forces that can participate in operations of a very high and high risk, i.e.

in high-intensity conflicts, can be expected after conclusion of the CAF transformation process and after partial modernization and supplying of a portion of units with modern combat, protective and communications equipment, necessary for this type of operations. In this period, Croatian membership in NATO and EU is expected, along with all of its benefits and obligations. 

The Forces that the CAF will prepare for international military operations will be designed for variously led operations (NATO, EU or UN-led operations), in accordance with the Single Set of Forces concept. 

## Force Sustainability And Capability To Conduct Long-Term Operations

The success of forces in performing anticipated tasks will also depend on their sustainability. Sustainability of forces will be secured, no matter how distant the area of operations is, regardless of the climate and infrastructure conditions, length of an operation, intensity and type of activity of deployed units and CAF parts. Logistic sustainability of the CAF for operations and activities within the country will be provided through our own capacities and civilian capabilities in the territory of the Republic of Croatia. Sustainability of forces and capability for the conduct of long-term operations outside Croatian territory will be achieved through: 
- assuming obligations to participate in joint operations outside Croatian territory only with forces for which the CAF can provide sufficient logistic and other support; 
- structuring of task tailored forces, capable for performing anticipated tasks, with a sufficient logistic support and initial self-sustainability over a limited period of time. In principle, CAF units will be organized, equipped, and manned with an aim to develop the capability for initial self-sustainability, in order to operate without manning during a period of 7 to 30 days from the day of deployment to an operation; 
- sending NSE (National Support Element) to the area of operations, which will be dimensioned, equipped and trained for providing logistic support to its own forces; 
- the CAF capability to use various ways of providing the necessary logistic support is recognised in the CAF logistic concept (relying on our own capacities, territory capacities, allied armed forces capacities, contract suppliers' capacities and the capacities of the host country) 
- obligation of all professional personnel and contract reserve to participate in international operations.

## Force Survivability And Protection Capabilities

The capability for survival and protection of forces and removal of danger to life and health of CAF members represents one of the important preconditions for a successful fulfilment of assigned tasks. The CAF will pay special attention to the capability of survival and protection of forces, during the conduct of routine tasks and training, as well as during the fulfilment of the most demanding and most risky combat tasks. 

The CAF will provide passive protection to individuals and units through:
- high-quality and realistic training to carry out tasks under all conditions. Before deploying to operations outside Croatian territory a special pre-deployment training will be conducted, adapted to the specific conditions in the area of operation and to potential threats. 

- equipping with a high-quality, task-adjusted personal and protective equipment, including equipment necessary for survival and functioning under conditions of a NBC threat. Individuals and units will be provided with complete protective equipment in accordance with conditions in an operation; 
- providing units with equipment that meets requirements of ballistic and other protection of personnel; 
- timely implementation of health care, psychological and medical measures in accordance with the anticipated deployment of forces 
- implementation of intelligence-security measures with the purpose of timely discovering of a potential danger and its removal before consequences arise that are damaging to the forces; 
- accommodation for individuals and units in a manner that that provides a sufficient level of passive protection from a possible conventional and non-conventional attack, including camouflage. 

Due to the anticipated reduction in the overall numerical size of the CAF, the system of security and protection of military buildings and infrastructure will be significantly modernized and it will rely to a considerable extent on technical protective equipment.

## Croatian Arm Y

In support of the fulfilment of missions and tasks of the entire CAF, the Army will perform the following main peacetime tasks: 
- n the maintain the optimal levels of readiness with the aim of deterring aggression o Republic of Croatia, 
- develop and maintain capabilities for participation in joint operations and for the conduct of defensive and offensive operations, 
- develop and maintain capabilities for the conduct of non-traditional military tasks and response to asymmetrical threats, 
- develop and maintain capabilities to participate in international military operations and in humanitarian operations within the framework of international forces, 
- participate in international military peace support operations within the spectrum from keeping to enforcing peace 
- participate in providing support to the allied forces in the Republic of Croatia (Host Nation Support), 
- participate in arms control activities and confidence and security building measures, 
- participate in providing assistance to the civilian structures in the Republic of Croatia. 

Dur g in war, the Army will perform the following tasks: 
- The incumbent for conduct of joint defensive and offensive operations in defence and establishment of the territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia, Croatia and her allies according to
- participation in the defence of the Republic of Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty. 

The r country against external threats and the incumbent for the conduct of joint operations. Defence operations can include conduct of counter-attack, in order to re-establish territorial C oatian Army will be the chief force of the CAF, responsible for the defence of the integrity of the Republic of Croatia or to prevent destruction of infrastructure in the country. 

s ly high level of readiness of the ed infantry, cavalry) in combat service support units (artillery, air The defence of the Republic of Croatia still remains the most important task of the Croatian Army; however, the most likely task will be participation in peace-support and humanitarian operations within the framework of the international forces outside the country and task regarding prevention and removal of the consequences of crisis situations in the country caused by natural and technical accidents and disasters. In order to be able to fulfil assigned missions, the Croatian Army must be able to maintain a high level of readiness, manning and training of units, to have capabilities for rapid reaction, high tactical and operational mobility and an appropriate peacetime components. 

Within the Croatian Army and with the aim of achieving the land forces capabilities described in the SDR, the necessary force elements will be organised in combat service units (light, motorised and mechanis defence, engineering, signals, NBC, MP and military intelligence units) and in support service units (supply, transport, maintenance and health care). The signals regiment within the Croatian Army will, apart from its intended task of Army support, provide for the complete functioning of stationary, network-information and encrypted-protected communications system and funct maintaining the communications system a secure and continuous command, control and information system and protected data transfer will be secured. Separate modules from the signals regiment component will provide required and constant information and communications support to the CAF GS and the Operative Command Centre as well as the support command and the Croatian Military Academy. 

The numerical status of the Croatian Army will be reduced to approximately 10.300 active personnel; corps commands will be abolished, while the operational placement will no longer be governed by the concept of territorial defence of th training for the needs of the entire CAF will be conducted at the Centre for Basic Training, while specialised training will be conducted in service units. Combat training of units up to battalion level will be conducted at the Combat Training Centre and command training up to brigade level will be conducted at the Simulation Centre.

# Ii. Caf Development **Goals**

The CAF development goals have been broken down into human resources, military education, material resources, logistic, doctrine and training, international military cooperation as well as research and development. The main CAF development goals for the period 2006 - 2015 are: 
Goals aimed at achieving military **capabilities:** 
1. Establish the targeted CAF organizational and personnel structure. 

2. Equip the CAF with required weaponry and military equipment. 

3. Increase participation in international military operations. 

Goals oriented toward placing the doctrinal normative framework in order: 
4. Establish the targeted system of training and education, 5. Adjust legislative and other regulations to the new defence concept, adopt the required doctrinal documents. 

## Goals Aimed At Increasing The Effectiveness Of The Caf:

6. Man the CAF with volunteers (professional military personnel, soldier-trainees 

and members of the contract reserve). 

7. Achieve the planned placement of units in modern facilities. 

8. Completely care for surplus, obsolete and faulty weaponry and military 

equipment. 

In support of the realization of development goals a series of projects and tasks will be conducted in all areas of development that have been given a priority level following these 

criteria:

## 1. Human Resources Personnel

The recruitment and retaining of quality personnel represents one of the CAF's greatest challenges in the future. It is only possible to answer this challenge by satisfying the needs of the military organization while taking into account the need to offer proper support for every CAF member. The ability of the personnel management system to face this challenge is of utmost importance in order to reach the targeted capabilities of the CAF as a whole. 

Plans, guidance and programmes in the field of personnel management for the period up to 2015, will enable recruitment, development and retaining of personnel capable of contributing to the successful realisation of CAF missions and tasks. The vision of the future CAF requires a re-organization of the personnel management system and the establishment of a unified organization and information system. 

## The Current State

The most important characteristics of the existing personnel structure are: an unfavourable age structure, a relatively high number of management-command personnel in relation to executive personnel, an unfavourable qualifications structure and an inadequate positioning of personnel. The prescribed numerical size of the CAF amounts to a total of 21 113 active military personnel and 4 184 civilian personnel. The status of manning is shown in table 2: 

|                    | CAF    | MOD   | Outside CAF and  MOD1  system   | Total   |
|--------------------|--------|-------|---------------------------------|---------|
| Active             | 18.479 | 552   | 19                              | 19.050  |
| Civilian Personnel | 3.963  | 2.141 | 6.104                           |         |
| Total              | 22.442 | 2.693 | 19                              | 25.154  |

Table 6 The entire numerical size *of active personnel as of December 31, 2005* The *Decision on the CAF Size, Composition and Mobilization Development* stipulates that the CAF, along with its active component also consists of 8 000 conscripts and 32 360 reserves. According to the current age structure soldiers on average are 33 years of age, NCOs to the rank of sergeant on average are 35 years of age and junior officers on average are 38. Higher officers are on the average 43 years old. The average age of a CAF officer is 39 while the average age of active military personnel overall is 36. 

## Direction Of Development

The basic task of the personnel management system will continue to be dual in nature: satisfying the needs of the military organization for quality personnel while at the same time providing adequate support for each CAF member. Personnel management will be conducted according to plan, in four main program areas: recruitment, professional development, personnel support and personnel separation and transition. 

 
1 *Outside the CAF and MOD system: Office of the President of The Republic of Croatia, Agency ALAN d.o.o.,* 
State department for Protection and Rescuing, Committee for revision of Evaluation of Invalid Status and the Croatian Privatisation Fund - «Club Adriatic d.o.o
A unified personnel management system will be established with a Personnel Management Centre in its structure. The targeted CAF numerical size of the active component is at most 16 000 active military personnel and up to 2 000 civilian personnel. 

With an aim to retain and recruit specialised personnel, as well as to ensure that the whole defence system function more efficiently, a new category of active military personnel will be introduced - a military specialist. They will primarily develop in expert-functional areas, and their careers will be clearly separated from the careers of officers and NCOs. 

## Recruiting

With an aim to man the CAF exclusively on a volunteer basis, a model for recruiting of necessary personnel will be developed and constantly updated, based on contract recruiting after conducting a selection. Through cooperation with educational institutions (schools and faculties) and by organising a centre for selection the procedure for recruitment and selection of personnel for service in the CAF will be improved. Special attention will be given to promotion which will attract critical specialties. The CAF will have a minimum of 10% active military women by 2015. 

## Soldiers

A soldier candidate can be any person with basic military knowledge/skills primarily gained through voluntary military service (soldier-trainees). Based on results from medical, psychological and military-expert tests, the best qualified candidates will be offered the first contract for a specified period of time. Based on needs and demonstrated results, service can be prolonged, but not after the calendar year when the professional or reserve soldier turns 35 years of age. 

The planned recruitment of soldiers into active military personnel will be of up to 800 soldiers a year by 2015. 

Non-Commissioned Officers Any person younger than 28 and with an appropriate civilian and military education can become a NCO. The main source of manning will be the best contract soldiers who, after appropriate NCO education, will sign their first NCO contract. 

By 2015 it is planned to introduce up to 275 new NCOs a year. 

Officers Any person younger than 28 years of age who has completed university studies (pregraduate students - bachelor degree as a minimum according to Bologna standards), and who has basic military knowledge/skills can become an officer. The personnel management system will develop a special model for career development for officers who join the CAF 
with completed graduate studies. Manning officers' positions will be done through: 
- Education through an integrated system of civilian-military education ("KADET" 
programme) and education at foreign military academies for the needs of combat services and parts of combat support services, and 
- Admission to service on contract after completing university studies, and by meeting all the described criteria for the manning of combat and support services and specialist personnel. These candidates will achieve the basic military knowledge/skills during selection training.

Before assignment to duty the candidates will have to complete basic military officers' education. 

## By 2015 It Is Planned To Admit 110 Officers Per Year. Military Specialists

Military specialist positions in the CAF will be manned with personnel in the status of officers, NCOs and civil servants as well as civilians from the labor market who have special knowledge, skills and experience of importance to the functioning of the CAF. They will consist of specialists in the following fields: technical personnel, experts in critical specialties, musicians, administrative experts, organizational specialists, medical doctors and similar.

They will not have command authority but may have leadership authority. 

By 2015 the total number of military specialists will be up to 2000, which will be introduced gradually by 200 each year until 2011, while the rest will be introduced by 2015.

## Professional Development

The professional development of personnel will systematically rely on: 
- Growing and successive training/education - within the institution of training and education and unit training, the military organization will provide conditions for professional development of individuals in terms of gaining the necessary knowledge in accordance with the conditions related to the levels of responsibility and rank; and with the required capabilities throughout the career; 
- Assignment of operational duties - through careful career shaping and management ensure the possibility to gradually acquire the appropriate experience throughout functional areas, without skipping levels of responsibility or rank; 
- Self-development - the final responsibility will rest on the individual who will have to set their personal goals in their career alone and have an influence in terms of successful conduct of duties and competition with their equals. 

In support of professional development a new rotation system and a system of militaryexperts specialists will connect the development of the individual with organizational position/duty. With this, the appropriate preparation (education/training) before assignment will be connected with the organizational position/duty for a more efficient use of newly acquired knowledge. Through certification the evaluation of domestic and international military education will be unified. With the concept of military specialists it will be possible to ensure the professional development of individuals who will primarily develop in their specialisation, and to rationalise the capacities for military education. Key personnel from the contract reserve will be able to access military education under appropriate conditions. 

## Personnel Support

In order for human resources management to be completely effective in retaining quality personnel a comprehensive standard of living program will be developed. It will encompass such issues as military personnel standards of living, support to families, care for retired members and models to ensure living and social conditions in the place of duty. Salaries and other material and non-material incentives for personnel will ensure competitiveness on the market recruiting and retaining personnel, having in mind the heavy load, complexity and requirements of military service. 

It is necessary to be more competitive in the labor market so as to retain qualified young officers and NCOs, important for the functioning of the CAF. Since the goal is to transform the existing combined military structure into a voluntary system by 2010, this implies a different approach for human resource management and requires additional effort and resources for recruiting and retaining of personnel. A methodology for monitoring and retaining personnel will be developed, employment procedures will be improved and standardised, the rotation and evaluation systems will be analysed and improved so that their implementation will have positive results. A system of equal opportunity will be developed. Support to families of military personnel in their everyday life will be improved for the period of deployment and post-deployment upon return from a mission. Rewarding with decorations and other stimulations will stimulate development of excellence in work. 

## Transition And Separation Of Personnel

During the process of personnel downsizing, programs for preparation of personnel to be separated will continue to be developed. Programmes developed in this manner will be applied as standard procedures for all personnel preparing for transition into a civilian system. 

The successful completion of a contract will be adequately stimulated with a financial reward. After 20 years of service active military personnel will have the opportunity for early retirement with support for continuing a different career. In this manner retired military experts that have proved themselves will be given the chance to continue a second civilian career in the defence system according to needs. Active military personnel for whom the military calling is a professional career will complete their careers during the calendar year in which they turn 55 years of age. Before the completion of their career they will be included into the program for adjustment to civilian life, coordinated with civilian institutions and organizations.

## Situation

Military education for the needs of the CAF is primarily conducted in the Joint Education and Training Command and at service schools as well as through civil-military programmes at universities in the Republic of Croatia. Inter services schools are located within the Joint Education and Training Command (War College, Command-Staff School, Higher NCO School) where education of personnel is conducted for higher staff and command duties. 

Branch schools education at CAF is conducted for the needs of services and branches. 

At the Foreign Languages School, English, German, French and Italian are taught. STANAG 6001 is used as criteria for successful education in English and German.

The civil-military educational programme "KADET" was launched with an aim to man the CAF with young officers possessing higher education. This programme is primarily used to man officer's positions in units of combat and combat-support services. 

Education abroad supplements all forms of military education for all categories of military personnel. 

Furthermore, key civilian personnel are also sent to individual forms of military education abroad according to professional development needs. 

## Direction Of Development

Taking into account the fact that the Croatian higher education system is in the process of transformation, the CAF will develop an achievable and sustainable model of military education that follows changes in the overall system of higher education. Military education will be conducted at the Croatian Military Academy. The military education system will continue to be linked with the university community and related civilian institutions, taking into account the specifics and traditions within the CAF and experience from the Homeland War. Partner relations will be developed with the educational institutions in other countries, NATO and the EU. This will meet needs for achieving the required knowledge, skills and capabilities that will contribute to the efficient development of the defence system and to the fulfilment of its basic missions and tasks.

In realization of these goals military education capacities will be unified in order to contribute to improvement of education quality and to better connection with the national education system. The selection and assignment for education will be an element in the unified career management and professional development system. 

During the long-term planning period reforms and reorganization will be conducted with a basic aim to build such a capability of the military education system that will be able to qualify military and civilian personnel for the CAF missions and tasks.

## 3. Material Resources Weaponry And Military Equipment

This portion provides a review of the current status of weaponry and military equipment in the CAF, an evaluation of its perspectives, goals and priorities in equipping until 2015 and the amount of financial means required for the main equipping and modernization projects. The review has been elaborated according to CAF organizational bodies and individual groups of resources. Common material resources, such as supplies (clothing, shoes), protection equipment and information and communication equipment have been processed in separate bodies.

Domestic development and production potentials will be used maximally during the process of equipping with weaponry and military equipment, according to possibilities and the level of technological development of the economy in the Republic of Croatia. When acquiring through imports advantage will be given to cooperation with foreign companies through common development and offset programs. The main equipping and modernisation projects constitute 70% of all the means for equipment and modernisation while the remaining 30% is related to other smaller projects which will become necessary in the coming long-term period, that support the introduction of capital equipment into operative use. 

## The Croatian Army

For the main equipping and modernization projects of the Army financial resources will be allocated amounting to 3.6 billion Kuna during a ten year period.

By the end of 2012 professional guards brigades will be equipped with most of the weaponry and military equipment required for achieving targeted capabilities.

## Infantry Weaponry

Infantry weaponry in use in the CAF is mainly of eastern origin while only a smaller portion was acquired from other sources. The average age is over twenty years. Available weaponry has been stored and maintained according to regulation and is mostly in working order. The amount of weaponry in working order in the CAF satisfies the requirements of the proposed structure but is lacking in quality in comparison to militaries of the NATO alliance. 

## Projects And Tasks For The Period 2006 - 2010

- Conduct selection of a new CAF assault rifle of NATO calibre.

- Conduct selection of new CAF light machine guns and universal machine guns in NATO calibre.

## Croatian Navy

Financial resources amounting to 1, 1 billion Kuna are planned to be allocated to equipping and modernization of the main naval combat systems over a ten year period. 

## Current Status And Prospects Of Naval Equipment

The current status of the Navy is characterised by a distinct variety of ships, combat technology and equipment, according to purpose, origin and age. A great portion of the equipment is technologically obsolete and problems concerning regular and prescribed periodic maintenance have not been solved. A cross-section of the current effectiveness of naval resource: 
- RBS-15 missiles are the basic weapons on the three fast missile craft (RTOP-11, 12 and 21) and three mobile coastal launchers (MCL).

- Weapons for anti-air/anti-missile combat are insufficient in amount and quality. - The Croatian Navy does not have the capability for anti-submarine activity. The Croatian Navy has one non-operational submarine at its disposal. It is intended for offensive mine lying and transport of underwater special forces. The CAF will not maintain a submarine capability and it will be withdrawn from use. 

- The Croatian Navy has mine laying ships at its disposal, while for the conduct of countermine combat the navy has a mine-anti-mine diving unit and resources at its disposal. 

Equipping of these units is being conducted according to plan. The building of a small anti-mine ship is in process, expected to be finished in 2006. 

- The Croatian Navy has at its disposal a sufficient type and amount of resources for the conduct anti-sabotage protection. 

- The Croatian Navy does not have the capability to strike targets at the coastal edge or deeper inland. 

## Projects And Tasks For The Period 2006 - 2010

Projects and Tasks for the period 2011 - 2015
- Introduce 4 open sea patrol ships into operational use. - Write off ships that do not fulfil the needs and requirements for conduct of Croatian Navy tasks and ships that cannot be maintained within the existing logistic system or overhaul capacities of domestic shipyards by 2010. 

- Change the propulsion motors on fast missile crafts RTOP-11 and RTOP-12,
- Complete building and equipping the small anti-mine ship by the end of 2006.

- Equip the Croatian Navy with other equipment for special purposes (diving and antimine). 

- Equip the Naval tactical training centre and ground for ships combat resistance 
(MTV and BOB) 
- Establish the functioning of the PEREGRINE radar system ("SEA" project). - Conduct modernization of ship Air Defence systems (for RTOP-11, 12 and 21). - Conduct overhaul of RBS-15 missile - Conduct final equipping of RTOP-12. - Conduct equipping with communication information systems and equip the naval operational centre.

## Croatian Air Force And Air Defence

Financial means up to 2.8 billion Kuna over the next ten years are planned to be allocated toward equipping and modernization of the main combat systems in the Croatian Air Force and Air Defence. 

## Current Status And Prospects

The Air Force and Air Defence is equipped with 8 MiG-21 BIS-D aircraft and 4 MiG-21 UMD's that may stay in operational use until 2010 when their lifespan expires. All other aircraft of the same type are reserves intended for the maintenance of operational aircraft's flight capability. 7 helicopters MI-24Vs are out of operational use and will be written off. Two AN-32B transport aircraft are partially modernized. The completion of their modernization is expected by 2007. 

The transport helicopter fleet will be increased by a new helicopter squadron that will be acquired by solving of the clearing house debt, so that the Air Force will have two helicopter squadrons, Mi-8 MTV1 and Mi-171Š. 

For the training of pilots the Air Force and Air Defence has at its disposal 20 PC-9 and PC9M aircraft, 11 UTVA-75 and 8 Bell-206B helicopters. UTVA-75 aircraft for beginner training are maintained according to a special regime and after the procurement of new aircraft for the same purpose will be written off and withdrawn from service. 

For participating in forest fire fighting the Croatian Air Force and Air Defence posses 4 Canadair CL-415 aircraft and 1 Air Tractor AT-802. The rest of the aircraft on record are faulty, without flight resources, their maintenance is unaffordable and will be written off. Projects and Tasks for the period 2006 - 2010
- Complete the «Sky» project (introducing 5 FPS-117 radars into use) - Put into use a new squadron of transport helicopters Mi-171Š (from the "Clearing" debt) 
- Introduce four (4) planes for selection and basic training of pilots. - Modernise 2 Mi-8MTV1 helicopters; - Conduct the 2nd phase of modernization for 2 AN-32 aircraft. - Conduct selection and preparations for procurement of new combat aircraft by the end of 2009; Projects and Tasks for the period 2011 - 2015 
- Introduce a new combat aircraft into use.

# Command And Control Support **System** Status

## Operational Strategic Telecommunications System

ative strategic telecommunications system consists of two sub-systems: a stationary unications system - the MoD and CAF business network and a tactical mobile telecom formation-communication ystem has been established based on the public telecommunications infrastructure and The oper telecomm munications system. The MoD and CAF stationary in s constitutes the basic network of the MoD and CAF telecommunications network. 

The existing business telecommunications network ensures entirely only the voice transfer, but it does not support the present and future requirements of computer and other non-voice information in support of command and control. A multi-purpose and multi-protocol telecommunications network (WAN network) has been only partly established, wh network is being established inside barracks and facilities. Building the whole multi-purpose and multi-protocol telecommunications network infrastructure (WAN and all LAN networks) is a prerequisite for establishing a modern business information system and partly for integrating tactical and business information systems in the entire command and control operational and strategic telecommunications system. By building an integrated, operative and strategic telecommunications system, it is possible to connect all radars and other sensors and operational centres whether mobile or stationary. The high availability of the public communication skeleton is a result of a well-built optical transfer network. Augmenting the availability of the operational and strategic network is done through redundant transfer capabilities of other owners (Croatian Electric Company, Croatian Railways, Croatian Radio Television Transmitters and Signals) (radio-relays, HF radio and satellite systems). In case the stationary system that is organised in this manner and based on the public communications infrastructure falls, it will not be possible to provide full support for command and control without mobile or stationary reserve transfer systems (radio-relays, HF radio and satellite systems). The present HF radio network can only provide minimum communications of the most important commands. The existing radio-relay equipment is obsolete, difficult to maintain and does not meet international standards with regards to the frequency area. The existing satellite equipment is only terminal and used exclusively for user access but cannot be used for building a network skeleton. 

For the needs to communicate with the Croatian military missions outside the Republic of Croatia, terminal satellites for the INMARSAT public system have been acquired, adapted to low speed voice and computer data transfer with the possibility of connecting an exterior crypto-telep

## Business Information System

The information support with business systems is not developed enough and mostly obsolete. A singular system for e a d and is in the implementation ph s s at higher management and comm Maintenance of existing sub-systems is exceptionally difficult and financially not optimal. 

Maintenance and information systems development experts are lacking and personnel management is inadequate. 

lectronic exchange of business information has been dopte ase. Computer equipment supply and program olution and levels are satisfactory. 

## Tactical Information Systems

Command and management information support is not developed in the hardware or application segment. P m solutions for artillery fire manage p eveloped with insufficient linkage to Computer combat simulations are poorly developed and integrated into the armed forces system. 

## Development Direction

rogra ment systems and anti-vessel missiles have been artly d the command centres in a unified C4I system. 

Improvement and development of the communication-information system for command and control support, the unified business information system and the introduction of new and modern c programs will enable achi Review. 

Equipment will be conducted by giving priority to units planned for engagement within the framework of international military operations. In accordance with adopted tasks and operational requirements, equipment with tactical communications systems will be conducted with an emphasis on equipping forces deployable for NATO and UN led operations.

## 4. Caf Logistics System Current **Status**

The development of the CAF logistics capabilities in defence operations against aggression relied mainly on civilian capacities and a large number of mobilised personnel. Such a concept was based on developed infrastructure, lodging availability and other capabilities over the whole territory. 

The main characteristic of the current organisation is a large quantity of logistics support levels and a sluggish system. Logistics support in filed conditions depends on stationary capacities and a large portion of human resources is engaged in providing logistic support on which readiness the rest of the CAF units do not depend. On the other hand, the operative units are partly engaged in servicing the barracks, which interferes with the conduct of training. 

Logistics personnel in the present structure make up one third of the whole composition and the ratio of management to executive personnel is 1:1.5. This ratio came as a consequence of the change of the reserve concept, which constituted the largest part of the executive personnel in the logistics system. The material resources the CAF is equipped with require significant financial and other resources for their maintenance. With the operative units reduction within the CAF the logistics system stores, guards and maintains a significant amount of weaponry, equipment and lethal materials. The CAF uses a large number of military objects - barracks, warehouses, training fields and shooting ranges requiring large human and material resources for their security and maintenance. 

## Development Direction

The main direction of the CAF logistics system development is the development and maintenance of stationary and field logistics to an extent that it ensures the required level of readiness within the CAF. The stationary logistics system will in a great part rely on services outside the system while the logistics capacities on Croatian territory will be rationalised and concentrated. Logistics support in field conditions will develop towards the establishment of capabilities for continuous and complete logistic support to CAF units in situations where reliance on civilian capacities and infrastructure is limited or even impossible. Therefore, the field logistics units will be mobile and will have the capabilities to be deployed in the area of operation. 

The number of logistics support management levels will be reduced and deployable logistic units will be manned with professional personnel. They will be organised in modules, which will enable them to fully meet the requirements of CAF future missions and tasks. 

## Logistic Support Of Caf Under Stationary Conditions

The Support Command will develop centrally capabilities for ensuring living conditions and for functioning on base facilities for the needs of the whole CAF. They will rely as much as possible on the services of civilian organisations in those activities that do not have a direct influence on the combat readiness of CAF units and commands. 

Units and institutions from the system of stationary logistics will be manned primarily with civil ser vants.

In view of the need to maintain a high level of capabilities of medical personnel that make up that team, they will be mostly manned with members from the contract reserve (especia lly medical specialists in specific areas). To eliminate the consequences of natural and technical catastrophes the military-health centre will be capable of deploying individuals and teams to support the conduct of operations and other specific CAF activities in the country and abroad, especially in cases of humanitarian operations. 

## Projects And Tasks For The 2006 - 2010 Period

# Iii. Financing The Caf Long-Term Development Plan

## 1. Defence Budget

In the 2006-2015 planning period, the defence budget will directly depend on two factors: the real GDP growth rate and the manner of distribution of the defence budget (
defence budget in the GDP). 

portion of the In the document "Guidelines of Economic and Fiscal Policy for the 2006-2008 Period", the Ministry of Finance anticipates a realistic GDP growth from 4,0% to 4,3% in 2008 under the assumption that a 4,0% growth rate will be m The portion of the defence budget in the GDP has been established at 1.77% of the GDP for 2006, at 1.75% of the GDP for 2007 and 1.67% of the GDP for 2008. ("Instructions for Development of the State Budget of the Republic of Croatia for the 2006-2008 Period", dated 4 August 2005). Since after 2008 the portion of defence budget in the GDP has not been defined, this chapter presupposes its increase to as its maintenance at 2% until 2015.

## 2. Defence Expenditures

The defence expenditures have been structured into three main categories: 
1. Personnel expenditures, 2. Operational costs and 3. Acquisition and modernisation expenditures (including research and development costs). 

The defence expenditures have been calculated based on the gradual attainment of the targeted force structure, CAF tasks (including participation in international military operations) and the needs for equipment and modernisation. All figures are realistic and based on 2004prices. 

## Personnel Costs

T
he calculation of personnel costs is based on the following assumptions:
aint at th of 20
- from 2006 to 2010, the numerical size will be reduced to 17 600 in the CAF (16 000 active military personnel and 1 600 civil servants) and in the period 2011-2015 the numerical size will be m ained e level 10;
- the conscript component will be gradually reduced and suspended by 2010; oldie e y wil trod t th l o year (t nne nditur r-trainee will amount to 2000 kuna per month) as well as a ontrac ve at vel 0 pe l ned expendit r ea ember e con reserv l amo per month),

Most of the available funds will become available in the last years of the planning period which is the reason why loans will be used in financing equipment and modernisation. By using loans the equipment process may be intensified immediately in the beginning years of the planning period while the loan burden will rise in the later years. However, since new equipment procurement cannot be done entirely through loans, a portion of equipment will continue to be conducted through the budgets of current years.

# Iv. Caf Ltdp 2006-2015 Execution Mechanisms

The implementation of this Plan is binding for all the institutions that according Defence Law have authority in the area of defence. The realisation of the Plan depends on a disciplined conduct of activities and measures necessary for the achievement defined in the Plan as well as for providing resources for their realisation. The mechanisms for ensuring the execution of the Plan are programming, developing and executin budget according to defined measures in the Plan as well as measures and necessary for the realisation of defined goals and continuous monitoring and evalu achievements. These mechanisms are a component part of the Planning, Programming and to the of goals g defence activities ation of Budgeting System (PPBS). PP efficiency and ansparency of the entire system of defence planning. 

BS will continue to be improved with an aim to increase tr

## R Isk **Management**

The most significant risks (possib le problems) in the realisation of this Plan are: 
- a defence budget below the level determined by this Plan or subsequent reduction of the defence budget, 
- changes in the strategic environment that will require redefining goals and priorities, 
- realisation of projects that have not been planned (indirect reduction of available resources); 
- lack of discipline and inconsistency in elaboration of goals through the execution mechanisms of the Plan; 
- inefficient or late preparation and execution of projects and tasks; - too much constraint of human and material resources; 
- other risks that may come up during the realisation of this Plan. 

The following measures will be taken in order to reduce the influence of risks on the realisation of goals: 
- consequent and continuous adjustment of goals' priorities so as to make it possible the realisation of lower priority goals; to postpone
- elaboration of possible project financing (and realisation of goals) outside the defence budget (forming a separate fund for conducting defence reforms, conversion of facilities the CAF is abandoning, using resources from EU preaccession funds or foreign assistance, initiating mutual production and equipping projects within the framework of international military cooperation, financing through long-term loans or with grace periods) and building solutions into implementation plans and the defence program, 
- precise definition of mechanisms to conduct projects and clear definition of responsibility for the execution of the planned projects, activities, measures and tasks, 
- regular discussion of reports on the implementation of plans at the management level, 
- evaluation of plans in terms of them being realistic as well as initiating their adjustments and incorporating lessons learned into the development of future plans. 

The list of measures for avoiding or reducing a negative effect of every individual risk has not been exhausted here. During the production of planning and programme documents, an elabo agement measures for each
•
ration will be done for conducting concrete measures of risk man planned goal. 

In the event of an unfavourable scenario in the achievement of the defence budget, the achievement of necessary CAF capabilities will depend on the possibility of financing equipment and modernisation from outside the defence budget. Some possibilities for such a type of financing are: 
- procurement of capital equipment (combat aircraft, Coast Guard ships, wheeled combat armoured vehicles) through direct financing from the state budget; 
- mutual investment in a portion of capital equipment within the framework of international
- procuring new or used equipment under favourable conditions from partner countries. 

 military cooperation, Finally, the projections of the Plan's financing shown h a a defined goals of the CAF
ere indicate that the CAF are able to chieve the development of the necessary capabilities along with the realisation of the forementioned assumptions. Non-fulfilment of these assumptions requires corrections of the development, which can be twofold: 
and tasks,
- redefining of the targeted capabilities, as well as of the CAF missions including international obligations, and extending the deadlines for the realisation of targeted capabilities to the following long-term period. 

# Conclusion

The CAF Long Term Development Plan 2006-2015 follows and elaborates the findings and recommendations of the Strategic Defence Review, directing the CAF development towards the capabilities and structure that will be adequate to the needs and possibilities of the Republic of Croatia. 

F operative capabilities will enable participation in various operations, from national territory and participation in crisis response operations abroad to building nce and security and assistance to H m hly prepared and motivated armed forces will be developed through numerical size, anning with volunteers, quality selection and education and training of personnel that will be able to respond to challenges the security environment of the 21st century will bring. 

Key CA defence of confide civilian authorities in the country. 

ig By 2015 most of the CAF will be equipped with equipment and infrastructure required for achieving the targeted capabilities through the following: the stabilization of the defence budget at the necessary 2% of the GDP, the increase of the portion ted to equipment and modernisation and the use of loan possibilities and other means ing. 

xploitation of possibilities to gain extra means through realisation of production and on projects for wea of the defence budget alloca of financ The e acquisiti ponry and military equipment within the framework of cooperation with other friendly countries will be a significant support mechanism for the conduct of this plan. In the first portion of the planning period, capabilities will be developed that enable effective inclusion of the CAF into the NATO system of collective defence and participation in defence activities of the EU while by the end of the planning period (2015) the major part of the overall required CAF capabilities will be realised.

Through the realisation of this Plan the CAF will be capable of fulfilling their constitutional role in the protection of both sovereignty and independence and in the defence of territorial integrity. Through the CAF transformation capabilities necessary for completing missions and tasks as defined in the Strategic Defence Review will be developed. Through the adoption of this Plan, the Croatian Parliament obliges the Croatian Government cabinet and its ministries to execute it. In this respect, the Ministry of Finance will plan a sufficient portion of the defence budget within the state budget. The Ministry of Defence will develop implementation plans and initiate projects necessary for the realisation of this plan while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration will provide full support to the efforts made for the realisation of individual projects within the framework of international military and technical cooperation.
