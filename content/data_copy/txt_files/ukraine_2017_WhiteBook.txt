##### OPENING STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE OF UKRAINE

n the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 2017 has been marked by a further gradual increasing momentum
of the defence reform implementation. In my estimation, this year we have reached the milestone
## I
when the transformation process of our national troops into a powerful tool for ensuring military
security of the State became irreversible. We have laid a solid foundation for Ukraine’s integration
into the Euro-Atlantic security environment.

This is confirmed by tangible progress in the politico-military, military-technical and solely military
areas of activity of the Ministry of Defence and the all of each has been achieved over the past two
years of reforms.

Separately, I would like to emphasize that systemic changes and drastic renewal of the Armed
Forces of Ukraine would have been impossible without the support of civil society, without public
confidence in those in uniform and without the support of the President of Ukraine and the
Government.

Due to this and being aware of our responsibility to the people of Ukraine, we held firm on the
line of delineation in the East of our country, despite provocations from the aggressor and his proxies.
Instead, we managed to significantly improve our tactical position, take control of several populated
areas without violating the Minsk agreements, and bring peace and security to homes in liberated
territories.

We have successfully implemented the main tasks set forth in the Strategic Defence Bulletin for 2017.
The principles of capabilities-based planning have been developed and prepared for implementation as
part of the improvement of approaches to defence planning. The Unified List (Catalogue) of Capabilities
of the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been issued.

The regulatory framework in the defence domain has been improved with the assistance of the
Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, the support of the President of Ukraine and the National Security and
Defence Council of Ukraine. One of the basic documents of defence reform - the State Program for
the Development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for the period up to 2020 - has been endorsed.

In 2017, we proceeded with reform and development of the command and control system of
the Armed Forces of Ukraine, building-up capabilities of military authorities, improving quality of
operational and combat command and control based on Euro-Atlantic principles and standards. Being
guided by these standards measures were taken to optimize the C2 system of forces and assets
engaged in the anti-terrorist operation in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. A transition was made from
three to two task forces, new areas of responsibility, operational order of battle, control procedures,
interaction and comprehensive support were identified.

Sustained attention was paid to maintaining the momentum of the re-equipment of the Armed
Forces with new and refurbished materiel, which made it possible to meet forces’ basic needs in
2017. 21 items were made operational and over 2,500 of new and refurbished items of armament


-----

and military equipment were procured and included in the inventory as a result of the State Target
Defence Program implementation in 2017.

Due to a balanced allocation of resources between the two areas of military training – units
engaged in missions in the area of ​​the anti-terrorist operation (areas of combat operations) and
regional units performing standing tasks – we managed to significantly increase the level of military
training. As a result, the number of brigade-level tactical exercises has increased by 1.7 times
compared to last year.

Exercise Enduring Sustainability-2017, the strategic command and staff exercise with military
authorities and troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, became the main training activity of the
Armed Forces in 2017 with planning activity with reservists being undertaken for the first time.

A stable trend towards the improvement of training facilities for troops (forces) was achieved in
2017. The modern Simulation Centre started its operation as one of the most advanced centres in
Eastern Europe. The construction of a modern permanent brigade camp was launched.

Significant progress has been made in food supply and military uniforms and accessories supplies
to the Armed Forces. The service personnel finally received high quality uniform suited to different
types of activities and to combat. The Armed Forces have much to be proud of in terms of the nutritional system for service personnel based on new approaches. 23 military units were switched to a
new nutritional system according to the Food Products Catalogue.In addition, a new Enhanced Daily
Field Ration Pack (DFRP-E) with seven menu options was tested in military units.

A clear awareness of the positive impact of the declared social guarantees to service personnel
made it possible to raise the level of motivation to commit to military service in 2017. The amount
of supplementary benefits for participation in the anti-terrorist operation, service in assault units,
Marine Corps and Special Operations Forces has increased. The payment of monetary compensation for housing provision and for renting houses was made. The construction of residential areas
to accommodate contracted service personnel is under way. Due to this, the Armed Forces manning
has been successfully sustained and the foundations to retain the most qualified-contracted service
personnel have been created.

The network of military educational establishments and research institutions has been expanded.
The Military Institute of Tank Forces, the State Research and Development Institute for Testing and
Certification of Arms and Military Equipment, and three Military Training Chairs were established.

Practical cooperation with NATO has been enhanced; interaction with foreign advisers from 14
NATO member countries has been continued as well as the implementation of the Comprehensive
Assistance Package for Ukraine, including 8 NATO Trust Funds.

In 2017, measures were taken to increase the efficiency of the use of financial and material
resources, resulting in the Ministry’s of Defence budget being used by 99.9%.

Much has been achieved. However, there are more challenges ahead in 2018, which I personally
consider to be a turning point in implementing reforms.

One of the main tasks set for this year is implementation of the provisions of the Law of Ukraine
“On the Peculiarities of the State Policy on Ensuring Ukraine’s State Sovereignty over Temporarily
Occupied Territories in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts”.

We also expect the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine to endorse the Draft Law “On the National
Security of Ukraine” in 2018. This Law will make it possible to create a solid legal foundation for
the implementation of strategic goals defined by the defence reform as well as to underpin the
legal principles of ensuring state sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and of gaining
membership to the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

First of all I rely on the support of civil society. I am quite confident in the support from democratic
countries of the world in implementing the Euro-Atlantic aspirations of Ukraine. I believe in the
inevitability of our victory over the aggressor and the restoration of the territorial integrity of our
state.

Glory to Ukraine!

General of the Army of Ukraine Stepan POLTORAK

RESULTS OF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE REFORM IN 2017 AND PARTICIPATION IN THE ANTI-TERRORIST OPERATION

Since April, 2014 legal classification of operations in Donetsk and Luhansk as an
anti-terrorist operation has been the main legal instrument for ensuring the repulse
of the aggression of Russia and its proxies in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which
contained the expansion of Russian aggression.

At the same time, the scale, nature and duration of the anti-terrorist operation does
not correspond to the tasks of liberating the occupied territories of separate regions
of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Due to massive clashes, use of heavy weapons and
military equipment by the enemy, the Armed Forces of Ukraine play the key role in the
operations in the area of the anti-terrorist operation.

The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine upon the recommendation of the President of
Ukraine has legally defined Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts as temporarily occupied
territory of Ukraine. The Law defines the purpose and means of state policy on ensuring
the state sovereignty of Ukraine over temporarily occupied territories in the Donetsk
and Luhansk regions, especially the protection of the rights of Ukrainian citizens residing
in these territories[7].

A legal basis has been created for the task of repulsing hostile aggression in
Donbas, and in the long term for restoring the territorial integrity of Ukraine within the
internationally recognized border.

Results of the Armed Forces participation in the anti-terrorist operation
in the separate regions of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts


The Armed Forces focused main efforts on deterring aggression of the Russian Federation, retaining controlled areas
of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and ensuring implementation of the Minsk agreements,
in particular, in terms of keeping certain weapons in disengagement areas at established
distances.

Despite a number of controversial issues in the vicinity of the disengagement line the
Anti-Terrorist Operation Headquarters did not plan to wage active offensive operations
in 2017.

During 2017 illegal armed groups with support from units of the Armed Forces of
the Russian Federation resumed activities aimed at destabilizing the internal sociopolitical situation in the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions,
intimidating and discouraging local population from resisting.

The enemy concentrated its main efforts on advancing its units deep into the “grey”
zone, aggressively shelling Ukrainian positions following the tactics of “waging a war of
attrition”.


###### The Armed Forces have fulfilled all assigned strategic and operational missions with minimal casualties. The main forms of the Armed Forces use in 2017 included joint operations (combat operations) combined with territorial defence.


Due to these offensive actions ATO Headquarters required additional decisions to be
made to maintain combat and mobilization readiness of the Armed Forces military units
and detachments and other military formations of ATO forces and assets at a level that
ensures adequate response to emerging threats.

The Armed Forces have fulfilled all assigned strategic and operational missions with
minimal casualties. The main forms of the Armed Forces use in 2017 included joint
operations (combat operations) combined with territorial defence.

The Armed Forces units have managed to improve their tactical position in the
vicinity of Avdiivka and Bahmut without violation of the terms the Minsk agreements.

capabilities of the task force by reducing their strength from three to two and
redistributing areas of responsibility between them.

The activities on introducing (building-up) the CCTV system over the delineation line
continued.

Application of this system made it possible to obtain video content from video
cameras and enabled the Armed Forces of Ukraine to keep the delineation line under
surveillance on-line, react to the use of weapons, identify enemy’s objectives, fix enemy
gun positions at any time of day or night and significantly reduce losses of manpower
and equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The Dnipro Automated Command and Control System’s (ACCS) network of the Armed
Forces of Ukraine was brought to the tactical (brigade) level of C2 and in some cases - to
platoon and company strong points using digital means.

###### OPERATIONAL LEVEL OF COMMAND


Implementation of NATO principles and approaches continued throughout C2 organizations at the operational
level. The gradual transition of command and control organizations into corresponding
structures (G, A, N type) was organized.

The Armed Forces Services’ Commands, Operational and Air Commands completed
the first stage of restructuring aimed at building a unified and modern chain of
command.[5]

Series of measures were taken to acquire (build-up) operational capabilities of the
two C2 organizations.[6]

The Armed Forces services were not significantly changed in terms of structure and
strength.

The Reserve Corps Headquarters was established within the Land Forces of the
Armed Forces as a supplementary C2 agency of the operational level in order to build
up capabilities of the Armed Forces, reinforce the land component in relation to the
guaranteed fulfilment of tasks of repelling armed aggression as well as to establish a
strategic reserve within the Armed Forces.


Within the Air Forces of the Armed Forces the designated military units were
assigned to the East Air Command Headquarters.[7] An air defence missile battalion
was additionally established within the military unit of the Air Forces to build-up its
operational capabilities. The organizational structure of other combat military units was
improved further.

Within the High Mobility Assault Forces (Assault Landing Troops), the organizational
structures of the Command, assault, airmobile and airborne brigades were refined. In
addition, draft laws and regulations were drafted to allow the High Mobility Assault
Forces to be renamed the Assault Landing Troops.

Even if a sword is

with state-of-the-art weapons is negatively affected by the poor level of scientific and
production capabilities, the aging of fixed assets, of enterprises and the significant
technological lag of the Ukrainian defence industry from leading countries.

In 2017, to minimize the risks to the national security of Ukraine in the face of severe
financial constraints and the continuing armed aggression of the Russian Federation in
the East of Ukraine, the Ministry of Defence took a number of initiatives. In addition to
the procurement of new weapons for the Armed Forces, it focused on the development
of regulations aimed at increasing the effectiveness of military and technical policies,
defence industry development within the allocated resources, long-term planning for
weapons and military equipment development for defence forces components.

UAH 7 billion, which was approximately 10% of the needs or 30% of the indicators of
the State Target Defence Programme for 2017.


Most of the funds allocated in 2017 for the implementation of the State Target
Defence Programme were aimed at modernizing the existing military assets and
purchasing new weapons and military equipment; the smallest part was directed
at financing research and development works for the development of new military

In 2017, UAH 12.7 million, which is 7% of planned expenditures, was allocated to implement the State Target Defence
Programme for Disposal of Conventional Ammunition Unsuitable for Further Use and
Storage in 2008-2017 1 (State Programme for Disposal).

Munitions disposal operations were financed not only from the State Budget, but
also through international assistance programmes (Table 3.4).

In 2017, only Class III of unserviceable missiles and munitions from the inventory of
the Land Forces, Class V from the inventory of the Air Force and Engineer Corps, as well
as surplus Class II obsolete munitions, which are not expected to be operational again,
were passed for disposal.


In 2017, according to the Implementation Agreement between the Cabinet of
Ministers of Ukraine and NATO on maintenance and disposal of small arms and light
weapons, conventional munitions and PFM-1-type anti-personnel landmines, 1,095
tons of ammunition, including 85 tons (448.056 items) of PFM-1-type anti-personnel
landmines were disposed at the expense of international assistance projects of the
NATO Trust Fund. In total, over 1.343 thousand tons of ammunition has been disposed
of during the year (Table 3.4).

1 Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine "On Approval of the State Target Defence Program for Disposal of Conventional Ammunition unsuitable
for further Use and Storage for 2008-2017" No. 940 as of October 22, 2008.

Disposal of Liquid Rocket Fuel Components

The warehouses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine contain 362.6 tons of surplus liquid rocket fuel components, which
require disposal.


Due to the lack of operating licenses for the disposal of surplus liquid rocket fuel
components owned by Ukrainian enterprises, as well as the lack of proposals from the
international community to provide adequate financial and logistical assistance, disposal
of surplus liquid rocket fuel components in 2017 was not carried out.

In 2017, in order to solve this problem, the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine began
to establish a production line on the basis of the State Enterprise of the Ministry of
Defence of Ukraine “Voienkonvers – 43” for the disposal of the Class 1-3 hazardous
waste (including rocket fuel components).

The enterprise put into operation incineration equipment 11G427 and ANDERSEN
2000 and took steps to obtain appropriate permits and operating licenses.

**In 2017, appropriate efforts were made to create a logistics management system of the Armed Forces of**
**Ukraine based on the NATO logistics doctrines and standards.**
**The main tasks that were completed in 2017 and to be completed in the future are:**

  - improving the regulatory framework for logistics support of the Armed Forces, adapting it to NATO
**standards and policies, establishing an effective logistics support system of the Armed Forces integrated**
**with the corresponding logistics support systems of other components of the defence forces;**



- building an automated control system of the inventory accounting and movement that meets modern
**requirements in terms of architecture, scale, functional volume, efficiency and quality of its subsystems,**
**support of a large number of users, methodology and timing of development and implementation, cost**
**of ownership, reliability of data protection; and will have a territorially distributed structure;**

- optimization of functions, composition and deployment of integrated logistics support centres, arsenals,
**bases and warehouses;**

- further transition of the national asset classification system to the classification used by NATO;

- unification of uniform, food and other types of logistics support of the defence forces based on NATO
**standards.**

###### RESULTS OF THE ARMED FORCES’ TRAINING

The inter-service principle was taken as a basis for the Armed Forces’ training in 2017. Combat training was
characterized by its organization and conduct in two main areas:


**1. Military units engaged in missions in the ATO area (area of combat operation) with**
tasks of training related to:

  - training of military units’ headquarters;


-----

ARMED FORCES’ TRAINING


###### Military units engaged in missions in the ATO area (area of combat operation) with tasks of training related to:
 • training of military units’ headquarters;
 • ensuring units’ readiness to perform manoeuvres at a designated position;
 • improving combat teams (crews) cohesiveness in performing combat tasks (combat engagement);
 • improving the level of flight crew training to perform missions.

 Military units performing missions in home stations:
 • acquiring (maintaining) capabilities by the military units headquarters to control subordinated units in the course of combat missions;
 • obtaining skills by military personnel in using organic weapon systems, live firing, tactical use of combat vehicles and terrain.

  - acquiring (maintaining) capabilities by the military units headquarters to control
subordinated units in the course of combat missions;

  - obtaining skills by military personnel in using organic weapon systems, live firing,
tactical use of combat vehicles and terrain.

In the Land Forces military units’ training was provided in three periods (up to
2 months each) taking into account the prior level of unit training, manning and role.

Training of the Air Forces’ units engaged in missions in the ATO area was organized
in a similar way. Training of other Air Forces’ units was provided given the performance
of combat duties. The duration of training periods and their content was determined by
the decision of the Air Force Commander.

Training of the Naval Forces’ units was provided in three periods. The sequence and
duration of periods was determined given peculiarities of training of branches, special
forces, requirements to combat capabilities, conditions, terms of ship repair, combat
duties and the international military cooperation events.

Training of the Coast Guard’s and Marine Corps’ units was provided on the pattern
of the Land Forces’ training, and naval aviation brigade’s training was provided on the
pattern of the Air Forces’ training.

The average flight hours for one crew of naval aviation in 2017 grew by a factor of
almost 1.2.

In total, within the Armed Forces in 2017 the following activities were held:
35 brigade tactical exercises, 168 battalion (division) tactical exercises, 605 company
tactical exercises, 12 squadron flight tactical exercises, over 39.000 parachute jumps.

of the Armed Forces.

Totally, 111 practical activities were conducted at 11 training ranges of the Armed
Forces and 74 designated areas (lines).

In the course of Enduring Sustainability-2017 strategic command and staff exercise
headquarters and units operated in areas with spatial-temporal characteristics being
completely on a par with the real one (Figure 4.1).

The drill meetings with reservists were held for the first time in the course of the
strategic command and staff exercise[2]. The exercises resulted in the following:



- acquiring capabilities by the command points’ operational personnel of planning
the deployment and control over forces during the completion of operational
deployment and in the course of strategic operation to repel the armed
aggression;



                - high level of cohesiveness and training of the majority of personnel.

ARMED FORCES’ TRAINING


The conducted complex of operational training activities made it possible to virtually
launch a multivariate search of appropriate methods of conducting Armed Forces’
operations to repel the armed aggression; calculate the composition of units for the
repression of a large-scale aggression against Ukraine and determine the methods
of their use; start the goal-oriented training of the Reserve Corps Headquarters; and
deploy the territorial defence command and control system supported by the territorial
defence areas headquarters.

###### MULTINATIONAL EXERCISES IN THE GENERAL ARMED FORCES TRAINING SYSTEM


The Armed Forces’ units’ participation in multinational exercises contributed to study and assimilation of the NATO
training methods and standards to build-up their own combat capabilities and develop
interoperability with the armed forces of NATO member countries.

Furthermore, multinational exercises contributed to the increase of efficiency of the
reforms process of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and continuation of introducing NATO
standards to the day-to-day activity.


In 2017 the Armed Forces’ units took part in 19 multinational exercises[3], including
5 – in Ukraine[4] and 14 – overseas. Altogether over 3 600 service personnel of the Armed
Forces of Ukraine, about 300 military vehicles, over 25 ships, 27 aircraft and helicopters
were involved in multinational exercises (Figure 4.2).

In the course of multinational exercises, the national units performed tasks to
improve combat experience of personnel, test units’ capabilities to perform the assigned
missions in coordination with the armed forces of NATO member countries, use NATO
administrative procedures as well as to improve functional capabilities of the training
centres of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In addition, some elements of inter-service and
inter-agency cooperation were worked out.

At the same time, particular attention was paid to ensure the effective performance
of tasks by different levels of headquarters according to NATO administrative procedures
during multinational command and staff exercises. In 2017, representatives of the
Armed Forces of Ukraine took part in 12 exercises including staff officers, observers or
military intermediaries.

An Action Plan (Roadmap) was approved for the implementation of the Concept
of Military Personnel Policy. This Action Plan identifies a set of practical measures to
implement the main objectives of the Concept of Military Personnel Policy, which will
enable the creation of a comprehensive, effective, cost-effective and justified system of
manning the Armed Forces with highly qualified personnel based on NATO standards.


Results of improving regulatory framework on military service in 2017

In 2017, a number of normative legal acts and planning documents on military service of citizens of Ukraine and
manning of the Armed Forces were developed and issued, which allowed:



- simplify the procedure of recruiting conscript personnel and reserve personnel
for military service under the contract, which increased the efficiency of manning
the military units engaged in the anti-terrorist operation;

- regulate the authorities of commanders and officials of the personnel
departments in peacetime and during special period, which increased the
efficiency of personnel decision-making, especially in terms of manning units
involved in the ATO. For the first time in the history of the Armed Forces of
Ukraine, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine delegated the respective powers to
the heads of the personnel services of the Ministry of Defence and the General
Staff, which allow the appointment of certain categories of servicemen;[2]

- form a list of candidates for promotion according to the rating principle based
on the results of integrated assessment of military personnel and to appoint
servicemen to higher positions exclusively from the list. In 2017, this list included
over 15.500 candidates for promotion;



               - improve the process of secondment of military personnel of the Armed Forces,
other military formations, special-purpose law enforcement agencies to

Development of the Professional NCO Corps of the Armed Forces

In 2017, in order to create a professional NCO Corps of the Armed Forces, appropriate measures were taken in
the areas defined by the Professional NCO Development Concept[8] and the Roadmap
developed for its implementation.


Since the beginning of 2017, the modern NCOs Multi-Level Training System of
the Armed Forces of Ukraine with curriculum being developed according to the
requirements of the NCO PME Reference Curriculum (adopted by the Alliance in 2014),
has been implemented to achieve interoperability with the Armed Forces of NATO
member countries.

The training and education process for the NCOs starts with a basic leadership
development course; followed by an average level; an advanced level; and culminates
with senior level course.

8 Approved by the Order of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine No. 426 as of August 16, 2016.


-----

ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL RECRUITMENT

Instructor training courses were developed according to the Instructor Training
Concept[9] and for this purpose the three NCO Training Centres were established in 2017.

Bilateral international military cooperation activities under the NATO Defence
Education Enhancement Programme (DEEP NCO Ukraine) and the Multinational Joint
Coordination Committee (MJC) continued to evolve. In 2017, within the framework of
these programmes the following activities were prioritized:

Providing training to Non-commissioned Officers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by
NATO specialists in Ukraine and abroad;

Providing advisory assistance to the Armed Forces of Ukraine by sending to Ukraine
groups of experts on reforming the NCO training system, and the presence of NATO
military advisers in Ukraine on a permanent basis.

The coordinated work of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, the General Staff,
command and control structures, as well as the assistance of foreign partners, is a
reliable ground for the creation of a professional NCO corps in the Armed Forces of
Ukraine until 2020.


###### INTRODUCTION OF SERVICE IN MILITARY RESERVE

Mandatory enrolment of personnel (with a combat experience and discharged from military service) to operational
reserve for a special period has allowed to have more

than 140,000 reservists in the operational reserve in

Forces of Ukraine in 2014-2017, thousand people

2014-2017 (Diagram 5.4).


Starting from 2017, reservists of the operational
reserve have the opportunity to sign contracts
for their further service in reserve with the
commander of the military unit to which they
were assigned. This helps to keep the required
number of trained reservists to complete the entire
spectrum of national defence tasks not only during
a special period, but also after its completion.

During 2017, the number of large-scale military
training camps for reservists of the operational
reserve was almost doubled.

Such military training camps were conducted
in combat brigades with the involvement of up to
18,000 reservists (Diagram 5.5).

A distinctive feature of these military training
camps from previous ones was the involvement of
up to one thousand reservists in each brigade, as well
as an increase in their duration from 13 to 30 days.

80% of reservists involved in military training
camps in 2017 were trained in training centres, and
20% of them were retrained to receive critical skills
as crew members.


The existing number of reservists of the

The Chaplain Corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was created in two stages.[6]

At the first stage (by June 1, 2017), 67 military chaplains were assigned to designated
combat brigades of the Land Forces, Air Force, Naval Forces, High-Mobile Airborne
Forces (Air Assault Forces) of Ukraine and medical facilities of the Armed Forces, where
Ukrainian wounded and sick combatants undergo treatment and rehab.

At the second stage (by December 30, 2017), another 35 military chaplains were
assigned to designated military units at the level of a separate battalion.

###### GENDER POLICY IN THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE


The democratic society that Ukraine is building today is giving equal rights for men and women to realize their
capabilities. This also applies to the activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Implementation of Gender Equality Principles in the Armed Forces is a purposeful,
systematic, multidirectional activity of the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff
of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to improve the model of mutual behaviour between
men and women in the modern Ukrainian army, which should have a gender-sensitive
organizational culture and comfortable conditions of service for both male and female
soldiers.

The peculiarity of gender policy in the Armed Forces of Ukraine is to achieve gender
equality in institutional-optimal forms, which will contribute to the development of
national defence capabilities.

In 2017, in order to implement the National Action Plan for Implementation of UN
Security Council Resolution 1325 - Women, Peace and Security until 2020[7], the number
of female staff employed in the Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces of Ukraine has
increased.

An increase in the number of female soldiers is only one indicator that demonstrates
the systematic implementation of gender policy in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

About 300 private and NCO positions, including “combat positions” (driver,
grenade launcher, reconnaissance group deputy commander, infantry combat vehicle
commander, machine gunner, sniper, shooter, etc.) became available to female soldiers.

The estimated number of military positions for which women soldiers are allowed to
be appointed is more than 90 thousand (earlier, before the changes were made, there
were about 38 thousand).


Over 55 thousand women are in military service and work in the Armed Forces of

7 Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine “On Approval of the National Action Plan for Implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 Women, Peace and Security until 2020” No. 113-r as of February 24, 2016.

Ukraine (about 22% of the total number of personnel), about 24 thousand of them are
uniformed personnel (about 11% of the total number of military personnel), including
about 3,100 officers, 5,300 non-commissioned officers, 15,300 privates, 600 cadets and
31 thousand civilian personnel.


###### Over 55 thousand women are in military service and work in the Armed Forces of Ukraine (about 22% of the total number of personnel), about 24 thousand of them are uniformed personnel (about 11% of the total number of military personnel), including about 3,100 officers, 5,300 non- 22% commissioned officers, 15,300 privates, 600 cadets and 31 thousand civilian personnel.


The number of female soldiers in the Armed Forces of Ukraine corresponds to
average statistics in the armed forces of other countries, in particular: France - more
than 22%, Canada - more than 15%, Spain - more than 14%, United Kingdom - about 10%,
Germany - more than 10%.

Female soldiers can be assigned to all officer positions, except those for which
specific labour protection requirements are introduced by the current legislation and
related to the protection of reproductive health.

Active engagement of women in the military opens new opportunities, in particular,
it promotes the most effective use of human resources, social injustice in terms of the
distribution of leadership powers disappears, new opportunities for more sustainable
management of material resources appear, and, moreover, it helps to reduce a variety
of conflicts at all levels.

Equal opportunities for both male and female soldiers, including the possibility of
developing a military career, today are among the top priorities of military leadership.

Focusing on the gender component in the development of the Armed Forces will
increase the efficiency of their activities.


###### The formation of a gender balanced Armed Forces through the development of an effective gender policy is not only one of the conditions for Ukraine's approach to European society, but also the internal need of a modern Ukrainian army.


The formation of a gender balanced Armed Forces through the development of
an effective gender policy is not only one of the conditions for Ukraine's approach to
European society, but also the internal need of a modern Ukrainian army.

###### WELFARE PROVISION FOR SERVICE MEMBERS  AND THEIR FAMILIES


The successful activities of the Armed Forces in general, including in the ATO area, require a high level of
motivation, in particular, adequate social guarantees and conditions for uniformed
personnel and their families. That is why increasing the efficiency of social protection
for military personnel remains a priority task in the activity of the Ministry of Defence
of Ukraine.

Starting from 2017, the Ukrainian Armed Forces
introduced a catering system based on the Food
Catalogue.[15]

The Food Catalogue is an assortment of foodstuffs,
where each food item has a specific price and calorie
value per unit (determined by bidding process) used
for feeding troops while complying with the following
requirements: the maximum price and caloric content
may not be less than those indicated in the Food
Catalogue. The Food Catalogue is to be approved by the
Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.

23 military units (organizations) of the Armed Forces
have been transferred to the new catering system using
the Food Catalogue.

According to the plans, the rest of the military units
(organizations) will switch to the new catering system
during 2018 - 2019.

The new catering system has shown its effectiveness,
feasibility and received positive feedback from end
users – service members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

15 Order of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine “On the transition of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to catering system with the use of the Food Catalogue” No.
157 as of March 21, 2017.

An important result, unlike the current outsourcing catering system, is the
involvement of regular kitchens and dining room service personnel, which increases
combat readiness, the ability of military units to operate autonomously, and relieves
military personnel from performing functions that are not inherent to them.

This significant step in reforming the Armed Forces of Ukraine has already proved
its effectiveness, increasing the combat capability and autonomy of troops in combat
conditions.

Clothing support of the Armed Forces personnel.
Activities aimed at aligning clothing support with NATO standards


The procurement of military clothing and related items for service personnel (including those performing tasks in
the ATO area) is carried out in accordance with established standards[16]. The rules for
wearing military uniforms are regulated by an order of the Ministry of Defence[17].

In accordance with NATO standards, 17 military documents have been implemented
in the military clothing procurement system, including 16 NATO Standardization
Agreements and 1 reference document.

Specifically, 62 specification requirements and 82 technical specifications for military
clothing and related items have been approved. More than 100 new military clothing
items have been introduced and security standards have been clarified (Figure 6.11).
Military personnel are fully provided with combat uniforms (Figure 6.12).

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, PEACEKEEPING ACTIVITY AND ARMS CONTROL

Ukraine's contribution to peacekeeping is an important part of the country's
contribution to the consolidation of peace and security throughout the world. At the
same time, in view of the existing military, political and economic situation in Ukraine,
and also taking into account the possible scenarios, the main efforts in peacekeeping
activities were aimed at preserving the existing level of Ukraine's contribution to
international missions and continuing the implementation of Ukraine's international
commitments by attracting the minimum necessary amount of material and financial
resources.

According to the planned reduction of the military component as part of the UN
Mission in Liberia and the decision of the President of Ukraine, the 2 Mi-8 helicopters,
55 personnel, and 13 vehicles of the 56th Separate Helicopter Wing were returned to
Ukraine from February 2017 to April 2017.

In 2017, the three National Contingents and 43 National Personnel as part of
international peacekeeping missions carried out their rotations.

Ukraine, as a State party to international processes and the European security system, meets to contemporary
challenges and threats, fulfils its obligations under international treaties and agreements
on arms control, and commits to transparency and confidence-building in defence
activities. A consistent policy in these areas provides Ukraine with support from the
international community, primarily in defending its independence, territorial integrity
and the sovereignty of the State.

###### In 2017, the Armed Forces of Ukraine ensured compliance with the international military and political commitments of the State through the implementation of the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE), the Treaty on Open Skies, the 2011Vienna Document on Confidence and Security-Building Measures and through the implementation of bilateral intergovernmental agreements on additional confidence and security-building measures with neighbouring countries (Slovak Republic, Republic of Poland, Republic of Belarus, Hungary and Romania).
