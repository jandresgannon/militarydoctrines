# Introduction 

![4_Image_0.Png](4_Image_0.Png)

Under the Defense Planning Law no. 203/2015, the White Paper on Defense, heretofore the White Paper, is the document of defense planning at the departmental level whose purpose is to implement the National Defense Strategy and the defense objectives established by the Program of Governance. The White Paper is drafted by the Ministry of National Defense, accepted by the Government, cleared by the Supreme Council of Defense, and approved by the Parliament, for the timeframe 2015-2019. Specifi cally, this document considered the National Defense Strategy for 2015-2019, approved by the Parliament on 23 June 2015, the Program of Governance 2013-2016, the Action Program of the Government for 20142016, and relevant NATO and EU documents. A number of important factors were considered in drafting the White Paper, i.e. 

developments in the security environment, lessons learned during current military operations, 6 NATO's Strategic Concept, and other allied political-military documents, the European Union's strategic vision under the Treaty of Lisbon and other relevant EU documents, the impact of the economic-fi nancial situation on the state budget, and the Defense Strategic Review in the Program of Governance. The current White Paper is the fi rst defense planning document drafted on the basis of the new law which establishes the objectives of defense policy - the sectorial policy in the area of national defense, the measures and actions required to fulfi l these objectives, the specifi c missions and requirements for the Romanian Armed Forces, the main directions of development of capabilities, the policies on integrated defense resources management, and the strategic spending plan which describes the fi nancial resources which will be provided during the current Cabinet's term in offi ce. In the area of fi nancial aspects, the document considers the NATO Statement adopted after the Summit in Wales in September 2014, and the National Political Agreement on Increasing Defense Spending, which stipulates that a minimum of two percent of GDP will be allocated for defense for a period of ten years as of 2017. The White Paper's role is to emphasize the signifi cant changes in the international security environment. As such, the fact that Romania is part of the European and Euro-Atlantic space required a continuous transformation of the Romanian society and of the Romanian military organization. This led to the Defense Strategic Review, which is a process of political-military analysis and evaluation required to make defense decisions and achieve established objectives based on a pragmatic approach of the role of the military in the context of the new security environment which has been affected by profound and complex changes, and by fi nancial restrictions. The Defense Strategic Review Process sought to identify adequate solutions to provide the capabilities required by the Romanian state to promote and protect its national interests in the face of current, developing and future risks and threats to meet the security and defense obligations within NATO and the EU, within other international organizations, and to national public authorities. In this context, the revised force structure will meet operational requirements in line with the Program on the Transformation, Development, and Procurement of the Romanian Armed Forces to 2027 and Beyond, and with NATO standards. The document contains elements of strategic continuity and emphasizes the relevance of NATO and EU membership from the standpoint of actual operational commitments, participation in the initiatives on the development of defense capabilities under the two organizations, and contributions in the European and Euro-Atlantic decision-making process. An important section of the document is reserved for defense resources management. This area is presented in a modern, multiannual approach, with emphasis on integrated defense planning in order to establish military capabilities and to coordinate the implementation/development, and preservation of such capabilities, in order to meet the defense policy objectives. The national security interests, as defi ned by the National Defense Strategy, include guaranteeing the national character, sovereignty, independence, unity, and indivisibility of the state; defending the integrity and territorial inalienability of the country; defending and strengthening constitutional democracy and the rule of law; protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of all citizens and guaranteeing their security; guaranteeing the right to the preservation, development, and expression of ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and religious identity of members of ethnic minorities; the use of our country's resources and geostrategic location to attain the level of well-being to which citizens are entitled; reducing the gap in the development and rebuilding of major public systems; ensuring the irreversibility of membership in the collective and transatlantic defense system; strengthening the European Union and active participation in the processes of integration therein. The national objectives in the area of defense as established by the National Defense Strategy are to strengthen the national defense capability required to defend the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence of Romania, and the security of the Romanian people; to have a working justice system and to ensure the rule of law; to ensure effective national crisis prevention and crisis managements systems, whether domestic or foreign, military or civilian; to strengthen the security and protection of critical infrastructure - energy, transportation, 7 cyber; to develop capabilities to counter asymmetric threats, to promote national identity, to include the preservation and use of the cultural and national heritage; to strengthen Romania's standing within NATO and the EU through both conceptual and operational contributions; to observe the fundamental principles and values of the European Union; to strengthen strategic partnerships, especially the one with the United States of America; to ensure security in the Black Sea region; to enhance cooperation with neighboring countries and with those on the eastern fl ank of NATO; to intensify regional cooperation on defense; to support the European path of the Republic of Moldova; to promote our political, economic, and security interests in regions of strategic relevance to our country. National security interests and national defense objectives constitute the basis of the **objectives of defense policy** and of **the missions** 
established for the Romanian Armed Forces.

In the context of the implementation of the extended national security concept, national defense must be approached from an integrating and multidimensional perspective, in interdependence with other areas of security - law enforcement, intelligence and counterintelligence, crisis management, education, health, and demographics.

## Evaluation Of The Security Environment

At the global level, the security environment is undergoing constant change and that is refl ected in the ever-growing interdependence in international relations and the diffi culty in distinguishing classic from asymmetric and hybrid risks and threats. The low degree of predictability in the evolution of regional crises and non-compliance with international law by some state or non-state actors complicates the regional security situation and leads to increasing risks and threats.

## The International Security Environment

According to the evaluations in the National Defense Strategy for 20152019, the global security environment is in an accelerated dynamic, which makes it diffi cult to distinguish between classic and asymmetric, or hybrid risks and threats, and the increasing interdependence, instability, and unpredictability in international relations are aspects which defi ne the current security and defense paradigm. Evolutions in the global security environment will be dominated by complex and signifi cantly important trends, i.e.: the reconfi guration of regional and global geostrategic games; the reaffi rmation of military force and a factor of power in international politics; the development of 9 information technology; the resurgence of nationalism and extremism; the ethnic and religious fragmentation and the ideological radicalization, with implications for the enhanced terrorist phenomenon; the adjustment of critical infrastructure to current requirements. In anticipating and preventing international security issues an important role is played by international organizations, both in consultations, and in making decisions on resolving regional crises. Violations of the international regime of arms treaties and agreements, of the deployment and stationing of military capabilities, and of confi dence-building measures and security at the regional and international levels, may generate violent reconfi gurations at the level of international relations. Regional confl icts and crises in areas such as Eastern Europe, the Western Balkans, the Middle East, and Northern Africa tend to interconnect and generate cumulative effects which require the adjustment of security and defense strategies at the level of states and regional and international organizations. The aggressive posturing of state or non-state actors continues to manifest itself through actions which generate insecurity and imbalance at the regional and global levels. Long-term strategies pursued by such actors are underpinned by unpredictability and could lead to strategic surprises. The economic and fi nancial crisis and security crises in the Middle East 

![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png) and Northern Africa led to aggravating social problems, and generated an intensifi ed fl ow of immigrants to the EU countries. Such phenomena 

10
have a direct impact on the growth of terrorism and trans-border organized crime, especially on illegal arms smuggling, drug traffi cking, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and nuclear technologies and materials. In this complex context, security and defense exceed the area of responsibility of any one state. Therefore, measures are required to assure the predictability, coherence, and consistency in the use of national instruments of power, both independently and in an allied and EU framework, and for crisis management. At this time, as part of the Euro-Atlantic system of values, Romania has the strongest security guarantees in its entire history. The main guarantee for Romania's security remains NATO, whose policies and capabilities are based on the principles of allied solidarity and indivisibility, on maintaining a strong transatlantic relationship, on the fi rm U.S. commitments in Europe, and on the strengthening of Alliance partnerships. NATO is currently faced with a number of unprecedented challenges in the past two decades as a result of new security crises in areas such as Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Northern Africa. In Eastern Europe, the Russian Federation makes efforts to strengthen its great power status at the regional level thereby affecting the European and Euro-Atlantic aspirations of countries such as Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia. In the extended Black Sea region, the actions in violation of international law by challenging the international order, the preservation of frozen confl icts, the illegal annexation of Crimea and the enhanced military presence in the region have once again brought to NATO's attention the need to strengthen its fundamental mission - collective defense and the validity of security arrangements concluded with Russia at the end of the 20th century. The Western Balkans is marked by a trend to perpetuate instability in spite of nations' aspirations for European integration. The preservation of a certain destabilizing potential at the regional level, with ethnic and religious roots, favors the emergence of extremism on the backdrop of a possible return of foreign fi ghters who are active under the fl ags of terrorist organizations in the Middle East and Northern Africa.

11 As a NATO and EU member, Romania must continue and intensify its national efforts in the areas of security and defense, in coordination with the other allies and partners, to respect its international commitments in order to increase its credibility and regional profi le, and to maintain its status as a security provider.

## Risks And Threats

![11_Image_0.Png](11_Image_0.Png)

The main risks and threats against national security, with an impact on the area of defense, aim at a broad approach in the context of a mix of conventional and unconventional components. The risk of a conventional, low-intensity, but persistent military aggression has a low degree of probability, but it can have a major impact on Romania or its allies, and is an element of interest for national defense. The creation and deployment of military structures in the proximity of Romania by some non-NATO countries, at the same time with the processes of reorganization, modernization and procurement of modern weapons systems and equipment, of development of high-mobility special forces capabilities, of military infrastructure and of intensifi ed large-scale un-notifi ed military exercises, represent factors of risk against regional security. The existence of frozen confl icts in the extended Black Sea region and the possibility of new such confl icts in the proximity of Romania have the potential to project negative effects at the regional level. At the same time, the existence and perpetuation of inter-ethnic tensions and of regional or local unrest in Romania's proximity and area of interest can lead to confl icts. At the present time, Romania does not face a direct, imminent, and explicit terrorist threat. Nevertheless, the geographic proximity to areas in which terrorism is rampant and our country's participation in actions to stabilize/rebuild areas of crisis and confl ict are factors that favor possible unconventional actions against our country.

12 The national contigents which take part in missions overseas under commitments made by Romania will continue to face conventional and unconventional risks and threats generated by the actions of extremist and terrorist forces, organizations, and groups. Radicalism with origins in the Middle East and Northern Africa and connections with organized crime activities in Europe will intensify with the return of "European fi ghters" to their countries of origin/residence. In close connection with the means and forms of manifestation of terrorism, trans-border crime generates the risk of arms and ammunition traffi cking. The development of the potential to use chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear vectors as an instrument of dissuasion and promotion of political or ideological interests remains an important preoccupation of state and non-state actors. The combination between weapons of mass destruction and vectors of classical ammunition is estimated as one of the most signifi cant risks to Euro-Atlantic security. Cyber-attacks are at an all-time high and represent an important category of threats with a global reach which are diffi cult to identify and fi ght. The increase in the frequency and complexity of such attacks can generate serious damage to information systems with a direct impact on critical infrastructure, to include security and defense. It is very likely that, in order to amplify results, cyber-attacks will be combined with specifi c actions, especially with subversive campaigns, acts of espionage or sabotage.

## Objectives Of The Defense Policy

The objectives of the defense policy for 2015-2019:
¾ **Develop robust defense capabilities.**
¾ **Enhance strategic credibility within NATO and the EU.**
¾ **Strengthen strategic partnerships, especially with the United** 
States of America.

¾ **Develop international cooperative relations at the bilateral** 
and regional levels, and within international organizations.

¾ **Support other public authorities in the management of** 
emergency situations.

The defense policy represents a coherent and coordinated set of measures and actions which seek to achieve national security objectives and international defense obligations through the use of all political, diplomatic, and military instruments mobilized by the Ministry of National Defense for that purpose. The fundamental purpose of defense policy is to ensure decisions and actions in the area of defense which would guarantee the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Romania. In order to achieve that, it is necessary to operationalize the national security objectives circumscribed to the area of defense as established within the National Defense Strategy, in the Program of Governance, and in the defense planning documents issued by NATO and the European Union.

15 Based on the principle of cooperation and dialogue adapted to the requirements of the current security environment, the defense policy objectives are based on the need to strengthen political-military cooperation and to continue the process of modernization of the Romanian Armed Forces. To achieve the defense policy objectives, the following will be taken into account with priority:
@ Use of geostrategic position in order to enhance Romania's geopolitical role within NATO and the EU;
@ Strengthen the relations within strategic partnerships, especially relations with the United States of America;
@ Use the opportunity to promote Romania as a regional pillar of stability on the eastern fl ank of the Alliance;
@ Promote security through cooperation, development of strategic dialogue and of exchange of defense intelligence;
@ Implement the interagency model of ensuring national security; @ Manage all available resources (human, fi nancial, and material) in an effective manner.

## Development Of Robust Defense Capabilities

The fi rst objective of Romania's defense policy is to develop and optimize 

![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png)

![15_image_1.png](15_image_1.png) the defense capabilities as an essential requirement in order to implement and meet the other objectives. In this respect, the fundamental purpose is to achieve credible, fl exible, and effective capabilities designed to deter aggression against Romania and to articulate an adequate response to 

16
the current and future challenges of the security environment. Romania's NATO and EU membership led to a change in the role and missions of the armed forces. Optimization of defense capabilities 

![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png) will be achieved through the implementation of the *Program on* the Transformation, Development, and Procurement of the Romanian Armed Forces to 2027 and Beyond which will result in a force structure and capabilities with an increased degree of sustainability and interoperability, and which are fl exible, robust, mobile, superior from the technological standpoint, rapidly deployable in theater and capable to engage in operations. The development process of military capabilities will seek to use available resources effectively by establishing priorities, both in terms of the capabilities which can be achieved through national efforts, and in those achieved in common with other member or allied countries in a multinational format (NATO, EU, or other formats agreed in an allied or European context). Prioritization of the allocation of resources in order to develop defense capabilities will seek to strengthen Romania's profi le within NATO and the European Union through national contributions according to the priorities agreed in common within the two organizations.

## The Enhancement Of Strategic Credibility Within Nato And The Eu

According to the National Defense Strategy, one of the national security objectives seeks to strengthen our country's profi le within NATO through operational and conceptual contributions.

17 Consequently, in order to enhance our strategic profi le in NATO the following directions of action will be taken into account:
@ Coherent implementation of the measures included in the Readiness Action Plan (RAP), and training and providing NATO with capabilities for the Enhanced NATO Response Force (ENRF);
@ Intensifi cation of actions to ensure operationalization and adequate functioning of allied command-and-control structures in Romania (Multinational Division South-East Headquarters/MND SE HQ, NATO Forces Integration Unit/NFIU; and NATO Deployable C4I Module) at the same time with emphasis on the importance of these structures within the Alliance;

@ Enhancement of the Black Sea strategic profi le in NATO, mainly through enhanced specifi c cooperation with NATO countries, with the main objective to ensure allied naval presence in this region and to emphasize the importance of the region to the Euro-Atlantic security;
@ Meet Romania's commitments as a NATO member by achieving 

![18_image_0.png](18_image_0.png)

the capabilities stipulated by the allied defense planning process, at the same time with identifying the most adequate ways to contribute to reducing the capability defi cits identifi ed during this process; 
@ Continued participation in initiatives of capabilities development in a multinational framework (Smart Defense and Framework Nation Concept); also, optimization and improved participation in these initiatives, through identifi cation and engagement in new projects in response to national interests;
@ Optimization of national contributions to major Alliance capabilities 
(Allied Ground Surveillance - AGS; Strategic Airlift Capability - SAC; NATO Airborne Early Warning - NAEW); 
@ Ensuring a substantial contribution to the implementation and functioning of the NATO Command Structure - staffi ng positions allocated to Romania with personnel trained to take part in Allied command duties;
@ Honoring fi nancial obligations derived from Romania's NATO 
member status;

@ Continued participation in joint training exercises and activities 
- active participation in the Connected Force Initiative/CFI, and in exercises which are part of the Military Training & Exercise Program/
MTEP; identifi cation of national exercises which can be connected to those planned at the NATO level to carry them out jointly with NATO allies;
@ Intensify the efforts at the national and allied levels to ensure the infrastructure required to meet the conditions for the prepositioning of allied military equipment. Within the EU Romania will seek to enhance its profi le including in the 

![19_image_0.png](19_image_0.png) view of the Romanian presidency of the EU Council in the second half of 2019, both through active participation in the decision-making process within the Common Security and Defense Policy, and in the process of capabilities development in the formats of multinational cooperation offered by the European Defense Agency, and through contribution to the operations and missions under the EU.

20
@ Strengthen the contribution within NATO partnership through focusing on the effort to meet the commitment assumed through the Defense Capacity Building/DCB for the Republic of Moldova and Georgia, seeking to identify a level of ambition regarding the development of capabilities for consistent engagement in this area;
Directions of action in this area will seek to:
@ Consolidate Romania's position within the decision-making mechanisms with an impact on the Common Security and Defense Policy through promoting and supporting the national viewpoints on issues generated by the new geopolitical context and the security situation dynamic at the regional, European, and global levels;
@ Provide contribution with military and civilian forces and capabilities to the EU operations and missions through balancing national efforts in accordance with Romania's strategic interests and with other international commitments;

@ Continue and adapt the participation in EU rapid crisis response, including through the optimization of the conditions of EU Battle Groups (EUBGs) employment. 

Strengthening the Strategic Partnerships1, Especially the Strategic Partnership with the United States of America Strategic partnerships are a solid basis for building strong and comprehensive relationships with countries with common security and defense interests. The Ministry of National Defense will continue to contribute through specifi c actions in the development of privileged cooperative relations within these formats of cooperation. 

1At this time, Romania has strategic partnerships and special relations with: the United States of America, Azerbaijan, China, South Korea, France, Germany, Italy, India, Japan, the United Kingdom, Poland, Spain, Turkey, and Hungary. 
The development of the strategic 

![21_image_0.png](21_image_0.png) partnership relations in the area of defense will pursue the following lines of action:
@ Deepening of the U.S. - 
Romania Strategic Partnership for the 21st Century. This represents an extended framework for cooperation between the two countries designed to strengthen bilateral relations and contribute to promoting Romania as a vector of stability and security in Southeast Europe. The partnership provides a framework for the excellent relations between the armed forces of the two countries. Military cooperation with the U.S. armed forces represents by far the most consistent segment of Romania's bilateral military relations. Alongside NATO and EU membership, the partnership relations with the U.S. offer an essential guarantee for national security, with increased importance in the current diffi cult and complex regional and international security environment. A strengthened U.S. military presence in Romania within the European Reassurance Initiative/ERI, the European Activity Set/EAS, and Operation Atlantic Resolve will contribute to ensuring security and stability in the region and to countering the risks and threats to which countries on NATO's eastern fl ank are exposed. The constant and substantive U.S. commitment to strengthening the privileged relationship with our country represents a fundamental element for the enhancement of Romania's profi le as an active member of the transatlantic community. Strengthened defense cooperation with the U.S. will focus on:
Intensifying cooperation at the political-military level (with an emphasis on the dialogue in the High-Level Defense Group (HLDG), U.S. - Romania Joint Committee, and at the military, bilateral, and NATO levels; Continued support provided to U.S. forces for activities on the territory of Romania under the U.S. - Romania Status of Forces Agreements signed in Bucharest on 6 December 20052 (Defense Cooperation Agreement-DCA);
Fulfi lment of obligations per the U.S. - Romania Ballistic Missile Defense Agreement3 - BMDA;
Intensify planning and develop joint activities in cooperation with USEUCOM, to include the participation of partners, in areas of strategic interest for Romania; Continue the development process of the legal framework for the implementation of bilateral agreements, mainly through the conclusion of Implementation Agreements (IAs);
Implementation at the national level of the measures agreed with the U.S. under the coordination of the Interagency Committee4.

@ **Deepening of the Strategic Partnership with France,** with special emphasis on the projects of bilateral cooperation included in the Defense and Security Chapter of the Road Map, with the following priorities:
Development of cooperation in order to achieve interoperability of forces through actions of cooperation at the level of service branches; Development of cooperation in training through the exchange of interns, development and consolidation of the partnership between educational institutions; Encourage cooperation in the area of weapons systems through the implementation of industrial partnerships.

2 Signed in Bucharest on 6 december 2005 and ratifi ed by Law no. 268/2006. 3 Signed in Washington on 13 september 2011 and ratifi ed by Law no. 290/2011. 4 Government Decision no. 565/2007 on the creation, organization, and functioning of the Interagency Committee for the implementation of the U.S. - Romania Status of Forces Agreements, signed in Bucharest on 6 december 2005, ratifi ed by Law no. 268/2006.
23 The existing political-military dialogue, in bilateral formats, in a multilateral context, with countries in the region, and in an allied framework; Direct partnership relations between service branches and military education institutions in the two countries.

@ **Development of the strategic partnership with Turkey,** in order to implement the military and security component of the *Action Plan* for the implementation of the *Joint Statement*, with emphasis on:
The intensifi cation of the political-military dialogue, both within NATO, and on the bilateral level, taking into account that both are Black Sea countries, and in the process of stabilizing the security situation in this region; Continued cooperation in the area of force training through joint exercises, exchanges of cadets and didactic personnel in military education institutions.

@ Intensifi cation of efforts to strengthen relations of cooperation within the partnerships with the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain, seeking to: 
Strengthen high-level political-military dialogue; Develop multinational capabilities; Deepen practical cooperation in areas of common interest 
(education and training, logistics, technical-military).

24
@ **Strengthening the strategic partnership with Poland,** which is already in an advanced stage of development, based on the converging interests of the two countries within NATO, the EU, and the Eastern Neighborhood, by amplifying: 
@ **Intensify relations of cooperation with Germany**, in the main areas pursued by both countries - development of capabilities, technicalmilitary, education and training. Special emphasis will be placed on participation in the Framework Nation Grouping coordinated by Germany, as an important way to intensify cooperation between European allies to ensure the forces and capabilities required by the Alliance in order to adapt to the new security context .

Development of International Cooperative Relations at the Bilateral and Regional Levels and within International Organizations International cooperation in the area of defense seeks to strengthen the credibility of the Romanian Armed Forces as a partner recognized for continuity and predictability in meeting its commitments. The development of bilateral cooperation, both with strategic partners, with other NATO/EU allies, and with neighboring countries and with countries in area of strategic interest for our country contributes to the support provided to the national security interests. Continued active participation in initiatives of regional cooperation and the 

![24_image_0.png](24_image_0.png) development of the legal framework of international defense cooperation underpins the process of strengthening Romania's profi le as a provider of regional stability. Also, an important contribution to Romania's enhanced profi le on the regional level is made through effective management of the political-military issues addressed in treaties, initiatives and regimes in the area of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and arms control. Furthermore, continued participation in UN and OSCE missions and operations, and effective management of the political-military issues addressed in the treaties, initiatives and regimes in the area of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and arms control will contribute to meeting Romania's commitments within these organizations. The objectives of international defense cooperation are circumscribed to the purpose of achieving Romania's general objectives of foreign policy. Relations of bilateral and regional defense cooperation, and within international organizations, are addressed gradually, within the restraints of allocated resources. The main directions of action for 2015-2019 are the following:
@ Strengthen bilateral cooperation with NATO and EU countries;
@ Strengthen relations with neighboring countries, and with countries in areas of strategic interests for Romania, i.e. the extended Black Sea region, the Western Balkans, the eastern fl ank; 
@ Strengthen the durable bilateral relationship with the Republic of Moldova through fi rm and unequivocal support of Moldova European roadmap, through active and constant involvement within international organizations for full compliance with Moldova's commitments;
@ Enhance cooperation with partners with whom Romania develops joint programs of strategic interest;
@ Enhance regional defense cooperation through continued participation in projects developed within the Southeast Europe Defense Ministerials (SEDM), in training exercises and activities as part of the Multinational Engineers Battalion and the Joint Romanian-Hungarian Peace-Keeping Battalion;
@ Ensure security in the Black Sea region through continued participation in Operation Black Sea Harmony;
@ Offer support and assistance for the implementation of NATO 
partnerships with countries in the region;
@ Continue active participation in UN/ OSCE missions; 26

@ Continue cooperation in order to implement the provisions of various regimes of non-proliferation and export control;
@ Participate in activities to negotiate international documents on the trade of conventional weapons, ammunition, and other relevant initiatives in the area of arms control.

## Support Provided To Other Public Authorities In Emergency Management

Participation of the Ministry of National Defense in the process to eliminate the consequences of civil emergencies is based on the need for interagency coordination and cooperation and takes place under the legal framework5 which regulates specifi c conduct in such situations. The forces and means of the Ministry of National Defense take part in emergency interventions, according to the plans of cooperation concluded 

5 Law on National Defense no. 45/1994, with subsequent amendments; Government Emergency Order no. 21/2004 on the National Emergency Management System, approved with amendments and additions by Law no. 15/2005, with subsequent amendments; Government Decision no. 94/2014 on the organization, functioning, and composition of the National Committee for Emergency Situations, with subsequent amendments; Government Decision no. 2288/2004 on approving the assignment of the main support functions provided by ministries, by other central agencies and non-government organizations regarding the prevention and management of emergency situations; Government Emergency Order no. 1/2014 on measures in the area of emergency management, and to amend and complete Government Emergency Order no. 21/2004 regarding the National Emergency Management System, approved by Law no. 104/2014, with subsequent amendments. 

27
at the national and local levels, 

![27_image_0.png](27_image_0.png)

![27_image_1.png](27_image_1.png) according to the support functions established by legislation in effect. 

These functions are searchand-rescue missions, air, land, maritime, or river transportation of rescued individuals, and to provide the infrastructure required by search-and-rescue resources of other agencies. Support provided to national or local authorities can also take the shape of assistance or services provided with military personnel and equipment.

Measures and actions in the area will include:
@ Strengthened relations with specialized national and local agencies, and with non-government organizations;
@ Participation with forces and logistic support in removing the effects of natural disasters or technological accidents;
@ Actions in support of the population (transportation, lodging, food, medical care, facilitating access to isolated areas, including the distribution of humanitarian assistance);
@ Protection of cultural sites and civilian populations, at the request of public authorities. An interagency integrated approach of the issue of civilian emergency management requires the use of cooperation opportunities with similar NATO and EU structures, and with regional initiatives. This level includes cooperation within NATO with the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Center (EARDCC), and the contribution of the Ministry of National Defense to the EU database with relevant and specifi c military capabilities for the protection of civilians during disaster relief operations.

# Main Development Directions Of The Defense Capabilities

On the basis of the principles of the NATO defense planning process, of the similar EU process, and on specifi c requirements stipulated in relevant NATO and EU documents, the Romanian Armed Forces include the following capabilities: command, control and communications, engagement, intelligence, force protection, and support. In order to create, develop, and maintain capabilities, they must meet specifi c requirements and perform specifi **c actions in the** following areas: doctrine, organization, training, equipment, command, personnel, infrastructure, and interoperability.

In order to achieve adequate defense capabilities to carry out established missions and tasks, the Romanian Armed Forces continued to align their defense planning system with NATO and EU requirements, by passing Law no. 203 of 2015 on Defense Planning. The capabilities development process6 is aimed at developing modern forces, adequately equipped, deployable, interoperable, self-sustainable and with a multidimensional protection capability, with a fl exible and 

6Capability is the ability to execute actions in order to achieve objectives. The creation of capabilities includes a set of measures and actions from a broad perspective, with elements of: doctrine, organization, training, equipment, command, infrastructure, personnel, and interoperability.
effective command-and-control system. The process is systemic and interdisciplinary, and envisages a medium and long term approach and the effective use of available resources. As a part of this process, the defense capabilities required to carry out the missions and tasks were established according to the Program of Governance for 2013-2016 through a defense strategic review at the level of the Ministry of National Defense, which resulted in the Program on the Transformation, Development, and Procurement of the Romanian Armed Forces to 2027 and Beyond. The capabilities identifi ed as necessary to carry out the full range of specifi c tasks and missions at the national and international level must ensure:

## ¾ **In Peacetime:**

Ð Surveillance and early warning; Ð Immediate response and engagement in low-intensity military actions; Ð Participation in counter terrorism activities; Ð Support of civilian authorities.

# Defense Resources Integrated Management Policies

The effective functioning of the integrated management of defense resources is one of the essential conditions providing for the Romanian Armed Forces ability to carry out their missions. A real corollary in this regard is the need to ensure an adequate level of resources. The components of defense resources integrated management: 
¾ **Human resources management**
¾ **Financial resources management** ¾ **Defense procurement management** ¾ **Research and development system management** ¾ **Defense infrastructure management**
The efforts of the Ministry of National Defense to develop a coherent system of management of defense resources were intertwined in an effective manner with Romania's process of accession to NATO. The resources allocated to national defense defi ne in a qualitative and synthetic manner the Romanian defense policy, and emphasize the political objectives and the imperatives of effi ciency and effectiveness which must be taken into account in the implementation of these objectives. The economic development of the past few years and the fi nancial diffi culties at the European level underpinned the need to rethink the allocation of resources, and especially the use of resources, where effi ciency is the main factor. The opportunity to develop multinational approaches in the area of defense was emphasized at national, allied, and EU levels , i.e. Smart Defense, Connected Forces Initiative, Framework Nation Concept, Pooling and Sharing, which require innovative solutions in the optimal management of resources by prioritizing investments and through the multinational funding of capabilities of common interest, all aimed at strengthening the security of member countries. Under these circumstances, **the general objective of the defense resources** integrated management process is to optimize the process of planning, allocation and use of the Ministry of National Defense resources. In order to implement this objective, in the short and medium term, the following aspects are taken into consideration:
@ Improve the response capability of the defense planning system in order to provide options and solutions in support of the decision-making process in case of additional requirements or budgetary constraints;
@ Optimize the Ministry of National Defense Planning, Programming Budgeting, and Evaluation System in correlation with the system of development, coordination and planning of public policies at the level of the national public administration;
@ Improve the activities planning process, especially through a better correlation with the resources available, and the evaluation process of necessary resources;
@ Improve the resources inventory and allocation system with emphasis on material and fi nancial resources.

## Defense Planning

Defense planning, as an essential attribute and component of defense policy, represents a set of activities and measures aimed at protecting and promoting national interests, and defi ning and achieving Romania's national security objectives in the area of defense. 

40 Consequently, defense planning is the process at the basis of defense transformation and modernization and includes all the programs, actions, and measures initiated by Romania to identify, develop, and set up the military and non-military capabilities required to carry out missions and to implement defense objectives, in order to:
@ Fulfi l its constitutional and other legal obligations;
@ Fulfi l Romania's obligations in the area of collective security and defense within NATO;
@ Ensure Romania's participation in the EU Common Security and Defense Policy;
@ Fulfi l its commitments in the context of international military cooperation with other countries and its obligations undertaken through participation in the activity of international organizations or in other situations stipulated by international law. Defense planning and defense resources management within the Ministry of National Defense is achieved through a modern, integrated, and multiannual approach. The quintessence of this approach is integrated defense planning, which represents the process to establish military capabilities and to coordinate their implementation, development, and preservation, in order to accomplish the defense policy objectives. In order to accomplish the defense policy objectives the Ministry of National Defense establishes specifi c objectives and priorities relevant to the areas of defense planning, which are harmonized in the process of integrated defense planning. Defense planning is achieved through the coherent integration of specifi c objectives and actions in the following areas: force planning; armament planning; command, control, communications; logistics; civilian emergencies; resources; air defense; air traffi c management; intelligence; medical care; research, development and standardization. An important role in this process is played by the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Evaluation Process, which represents a robust 41 and effective management tool capable to ensure both the elaboration and the implementation of defense policy, and effective auditing of the implementation of objectives, the execution of major programs, and the use of resources allocated to the Ministry of National Defense. Decisions on the planning and allocation of defense resources, including the Defense Planning Directive, are approved by the Defense Planning Council of the Ministry of National Defense.

## Human Resources Management

The strengthening of the national defense capability requires continued efforts to achieve a high-performance human resources management system capable to provide the military structures with the military and civilian personnel required to achieve the missions and strategic objectives of national defense. Human resources management pursues the following areas of priorities: 

![41_image_0.png](41_image_0.png) promotion of the military profession, personnel career management, transformation of military education, and improved quality of life. 

42

## The Promotion Of The Military Profession

Attracting and recruiting valuable human resources represent a strategic area with a strong impact on the capability to respond to the new challenges of the security environment, and on the plan for defense training and preparation of the population and territory. The attraction of the military profession is an indicator of the way in which the military reacts and adapts to the circumstances of a highly competitive environment which characterizes the market of educational and professional offers. The downward trend in the attraction of a military career to potential candidates, which is evident throughout Europe, indicates the need for a strategy to promote the military profession which must take into account the developments in the labor market, the size and social demographic characteristics of target groups, and the changes in the size and composition of the force structure, in the level of skills and attitudes required to reach the performance standards specifi c to the military missions and operations, and the impact of new technologies on the complexity of military specialties. In this regard, a new *Strategy to Promote the Military Profession for* 2016-2020 will therefore be developed in order to support the recruitment of human resources through the use of proactive methods specifi c to marketing and communication. The efforts in the area of military profession promotion will focus on three main directions:
@ Continue and intensify the direct actions of promotion based on interpersonal communication;
@ Develop messages and actions designed to prevent the erosion of specifi c military values;
@ Use the Internet as a recruitment tool. 

## Personnel Career Management

The development of a high-performance human resources management system is possible only under the circumstances of an integrated approach of all planning, advising, selection, training, promotion, 43 and management activities of 

![43_image_0.png](43_image_0.png) armed forces personnel career development making the best use of their training, experience, potential and performance. The accomplishment of defense policy objectives regarding the human resources management requires a focus of efforts on the following lines of action: 1. Thorough planning of human resources, in order to improve the medium and long-term predictability of available positions and qualifi ed personnel, in accordance with the main requirements for defense capabilities development is achieved through:
@ Review of the occupational spectrum specifi c to national defense; @ Redefi nition of the objectives and processes of training and education;
@ Scientifi c planning of human resources.

2. Optimization of personnel career management seeks to develop fl exible and effective career management procedures correlated with the current and future needs of the military and with the demands of increasing the readiness of the armed forces, through: 
@ Development and adoption of a new *Military Career Guide* to ensure an adequate framework for career planning and development;
@ Outline of military positions by types of military structures, differentiated by hierarchical levels, and redefi nition of military personnel positions in accordance with the volume and importance of work;
@ Adjustment of normative and organizational frameworks to support differentiated selection process by military branches and services upon joining the military system;
@ Implementation of the new system of military personnel evaluation based on quantifi ed objectives in accordance with the professional standards in order to achieve a performance management system focused on skills.

44 In addition to these measures, the motivation of personnel will be a 

![44_image_0.png](44_image_0.png) permanent objective through professional development and attractive career prospects under competitive circumstances based on professional performance, to include the identifi cation and use of opportunities to generate motivational, fi nancial, and non-fi nancial arguments. 3. **Strengthen the reserve of human resources** as a result of recent changes in the global and regional security environment. 

## Transformation Of Military Education

Transformation of military education seeks to achieve an integrated, high-performance, competitive, fl exible and effi cient system adapted to the operational requirements of the armed forces and capable to provide highly-qualifi ed human resources, and convert educational capital into a source of knowledge and competitive advantages. Efforts in this area focus on the following lines of action: 
@ Conceptual, architectural, normative and curricular renewal of the 

![44_image_1.png](44_image_1.png)

military education system;
@ Correlation and adaptation of military education to the permanent dynamic of threats and challenges in the current security environment;
@ Institutional reorganization of the military education system to respond to the needs and developments in military realities;
@ Improvement of the quality of education and scientifi c research;
@ Increased cooperation with similar education institutions from NATO and EU countries and welcome international expertise in the development of educational products in online format, in didactic personnel training, and in the organization of mobile classes.

## Improved Quality Of Life Of Personnel

The main objectives are:
@ To ensure living conditions for armed forces personnel who carry out their activity at locations other than their place of residence by improving the legal and institutional framework regarding monthly rent compensation;
@ To improve medical care provided to armed forces personnel and their families, and to military retirees; 
@ To amend and complete the legal and procedural framework on veterans, injured, invalids, and family members of deceased personnel in military actions, in order to harmonize these frameworks with relevant national legislation, and with the practices/trends in NATO countries;
@ To improve social dialogue in order to achieve a more effective mechanism of communication with armed forces personnel;
@ To achieve and implement an integrated management system of social issues of armed forces personnel and their families, with an emphasis on veterans affairs, and affairs of injured/invalids and family members of deceased personnel in military actions; 
@ To develop benefi cial partnerships with government and non-government entities able to contribute to social projects of interest to the Ministry of National Defense through the use of foreign funding or other resources which do not impact the defense budget; 46
@ Sustained review of the specifi c normative framework of military education in correlation with national, European, and Euro-Atlantic approaches;
@ To improve the legal framework on the armed forces personnel remuneration as part of the standardized system of remuneration of government personnel in accordance with national social and economic realities and taking as reference the practices of the armed forces of NATO countries.

# Financial Resources Management

The management of fi nancial resources of the Ministry of National Defense seeks to fund specifi c actions and measures as included in the *Law no. 203/2015 on Defense Planning*. This is achieved in strict compliance with the provisions of relevant national legislation, i.e. Law no. 500/2002 on public fi nances, with subsequent amendments and additions, Law no. 69/2010 on fi scal and budgetary accountability, with subsequent amendments and additions, annual state budget laws and the social security budget, and other specifi c legislation. Furthermore, in relations with NATO, EU, and other international organizations, fi nancial resources management takes into account the general fi nancial rules of these organizations, and the specifi c rules of agencies, programs, or other formats of cooperation functioning on the basis of joint memoranda or agreements. 

## Defense Procurement Management

Defense procurement management is designed to ensure the effective use of public funding allocated for the acquisition of goods and services required by the military in a competitive framework based on the economic criteria of public acquisition contracts aportioning and on principles provided by current legislation. The general objective of defense 

![46_image_0.png](46_image_0.png) procurement management is to acquire the weapons systems and military equipment integrating adequate modern technology in order to meet the needs of armed forces branches and services and to ensure interoperability with NATO and EU forces, all of these in correlation with allocated defense resources and according to the requirements of every stage of procurement. 

47
The accomplishment of this objective requires:
@ Improvement of the integrated management system of defense procurement;
@ Harmonization of defense procurement policies with defense planning and with resources made available through the budgets allocated for this purpose;
@ Compliance with the regulations on public defense and security acquisitions, according to valid national and European norms;
@ Improvement of the implementation of regulations in the area of defense acquisitions;
@ Enhanced cooperation and involvement of security industry companies in the development of the military equipment required for procurement according to the requirements of the Romanian Armed Forces and to the NATO and EU standards, and the development of their capabilities to provide equipment maintenance, personnel and mentor training;
@ Planned procurement investments in compliance with the Romanian Armed Forces missions within NATO and the EU, and with the internal security requirements;
@ Participation in the NATO and EU projects/programs to develop 

![47_image_0.png](47_image_0.png)

![47_image_1.png](47_image_1.png)

weapons systems and military equipment;
@ Participation in NATO 
Smart Defense , and EU Pooling and Sharing projects;
@ Coordination of Romanian investments with those provided by the U.S. Government and the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP);
@ Acquisitions through NATO's specialized agencies;
@ Continued improvement of training of personnel with responsibilities in acquisitions;
@ Preservation and development of the research, expertise, technical and technological consulting potential for the military, and development of Ministry of National Defense testing and evaluation capabilities ;
@ Achieve specifi c control of imports and exports of special items;
@ Standardization and optimization of the defense contractors quality control process and provision of weapons and equipment compatibility with that of NATO countries. In order to accomplish these objectives, the Ministry of National Defense is implementing the Integrated Defense Acquisitions Program, a modern instrument designed to monitor procurement programs, similar to that of NATO countries which identifi es and establishes both the needs and requirements of new weapons systems, the priorities regarding the necessary resources, and the coordination and control of the procurement process.

## Management Of Research, Development And Innovation (Rdi)

The area of scientifi c research, technological development and innovation contributes to the acquisition of high-performance weapons systems by participating in the implementation of major procurement programs in cooperation with domestic or foreign strategic partners and by transfering of state of art technologies to the national defense industry. Defense research, development, and innovation provides the scientifi c and technological support required to carry out the missions of the Romanian Armed Forces by developing our own scientifi c and technological potential in order to effectively manage the allocated resources and to attract resources from the domestic and international civil sector. Scientifi c and technological research is achieved by the Ministry of National Defense specialized institutions, superior military education institutions, and other structures nominated by norms and guidelines. The objectives of defense research, development, and innovation seek to:
@ Improve performance through:
Implementation of objectives and priorities on the development of operational capabilities for armed branches and services; Maintaining and developing national scientifi c and technological defense expertise.

@ Ensure own resources through:
Increased funding for scientifi c research as part of major MoND 
programs; Development of RDI infrastructure, to include the use of EU 
structural funds; Development of the human resources involved in research and enhancement of the attractiveness of research for young specialists.

@ Intensify the actions to use the results of research through cooperation in product development with security industry contractors;
@ Promote involvement in the multinational defense research and development programs and projects through participation in multinational consortiums in order to draw funding based on competitive contracts allocated through EU programs;
@ Ensure national contribution to NATO and European Defense Agency (EDA) objectives in the areas of long-term capabilities, counterterrorism, early warning by participating in joint NATO or EDA-coordinated programs and initiatives;
@ Engage the private sector in RDI activities by drawing the scientifi c community from the private and government sectors in the implementation of RDI projects of interest to MoND funded from the defense budget.

## Defense Infrastructure Management

The aim is to preserve the integrity and develop the real estate assets of the military at a level that meets the necessary requirements in order to carry out specifi c missions, all in accordance with efforts to comply with required standards.

50 In this context, we will continue the process to adjust the legal framework relevant to construction, which is required in order to comply with critical construction quality requirements, and to allocate human and fi nancial resources required to meet the objectives. Another aim is to regulate land sale activities in order to preserve the real estate assets of the military in the property of the state and under the administration of the Ministry of National Defense. The objectives on defense real estate infrastructure The objectives intend to:
@ Optimize the policies of real estate infrastructure development in accordance with the real needs of the users of such infrastructure by establishing the necessary priorities;
@ Improve the capacity to anticipate the needs for real estate facilities through better collection of information on the status and needs to repair the buildings within ministry units. Optimization of the policies to develop the real estate infrastructure of the Ministry of National Defense requires compliance with a minimal set of requirements to preserve the stability of the legal framework applicable to the area of publicly funded real estate investment because any changes at the national level lead to a domino effect with a negative impact on deadlines in completing infrastructure objectives. To fulfi l these objectives, short and medium term priorities seek to:
@ Correlate military infrastructure with revised missions and force structure, development of military capabilities, and requirements for a balanced posturing/deployment of forces on the national territory;
@ Decommission infrastructure and relocate, where possible, forces to other locations and resort to the joint use of the same facilities with the goal to reduce the number of buildings in use;
@ Adapt national legal framework in the area of implementing real estate investment objectives for the Ministry of National Defense to the provisions of NATO's administrative and legal framework in order to have projects under NSIP unfold in a timely manner; 51
@ Reduce functioning expenses of units by identifying, testing and implementing alternate solutions. In the long term, activity will focus on:
@ Implementing real estate investment objectives through publicpublic and public-private partnerships;
@ Initiating effort to create the necessary legal framework so that the Ministry of National Defense can receive EU funding through operational regional/sectorial programs for the rehabilitation of buildings under its administration. We will give special importance to the implementation of real estate infrastructure projects which derive from the Strategic Partnership with the United States of America, and to those which ensure the prepositioning of allied military equipment on the national territory.

## Financial Resources

The planning and programming of defense fi nancial resources are implemented according to the National Defense Strategy, the guidelines in the Program of Governance, and the defense policy objectives herein, through major Ministry of National Defense programs. Effective allocation of fi **nancial resources is the key to the** development of future capabilities required to the transformation of the military into a modern structure. 

Romania is in full process of development of its defense capabilities required to meet international and national defense commitments, and the allocation of less than 2% of GDP for defense affects our country's capability to meet its commitments and planned objectives. In the context of budgetary constraints facing all member countries, Romania had to fi nd effective solutions, both by establishing strict priorities in budget planning for the Ministry of National Defense, and in participation in allied programs of joint funding to achieve capabilities. In order to gradually achieve capabilities, we seek to ensure conditions to implement the Program on the Transformation, Development, and Procurement of the Romanian Armed Forces to 2027 and Beyond, approved by the Supreme Council of Defense in June 2015. In the case of fi nancial resources, the phrase *ensuring conditions to implement* this program translates through compliance with the National Political Agreement on Increasing Defense Funding, i.e. a gradual increase and achievement of 2% of GDP in 2017, a level to be sustained for the following ten years. The allocation of resources forecasted for the transformation, modernization, and procurement of capabilities/structures of the Romanian Armed Forces will be accomplished **in order of priorities** as stipulated in the *Program***, in order to develop the capabilities of** the Romanian Armed Forces, to include the creation/completion of stockpiles. The allocation of fi **nancial resources** for the modernization of procurement through new acquisitions, modernizations, and/or capital repair will be accomplished by taking account of the following **groups of** military equipment:
@ Wheeled and tracked combat vehicles - armored personnel carriers, tanks, infantry combat vehicles and derivatives of the above; 
@ Land artillery systems - RPG launchers, 155 and 105 mm selfpropelled howitzers and relevant ammunition; 
@ C4ISR systems - integrated communications and information systems, division and brigade-type command posts, specifi c equipment for tactical air control teams, satellite communications systems, network security equipment, strategic stockpiles of IT equipment, software, etc.;
@ Individual and group armament and equipment - detection systems, individual and collective CBRN protection equipment; NATOtype individual weapons and specifi c equipment, to include special forces, portable anti-tank missile systems, advanced individual combat system;
@ Engineers and explosive device demolition equipment; 
@ Armored and non-armored all-terrain vehicles; 
@ Multifunctional transportation platforms;
@ Combat and airlift aircraft, to include specifi c communications and transponder equipment; 54
@ Land-based air defense systems - short, medium, and longrange surface-to-air systems, air target systems for surface-to-air and sea-to-air fi re, deployable radio-relay modules;
@ Combat ships - type T22R frigates, turbines, anti-submarine torpedoes, anti-piracy mission capabilities, multifunctional corvette, missile boats, mine hunters, river boats, mine layers and sweepers, assault boats and other naval platforms;
@ Support ships –special operations forces support ship, maritime harbor towboat, river towboat, and logistic support ship;
@ Fixed and mobile reconnaissance, surveillance and electronic countermeasure systems - optical and optical-electronic equipment, ISTAR equipment, radars, mobile land-based electronic warfare system for the Air Force, SCOMAR system, CBRN data reconnaissance and processing equipment, maritime surveillance equipment, hydrographic and weather forecasting system, etc.;
@ Other material items in support of structures, to include integrated systems to secure military facilities, equipment acquisitioned through specifi c programs with the U.S., ROL 2 highly maneuverable medical facility, and security containers. The fi nancial resources estimated to be allocated between 2016 and 2026, based on the *National Political Agreement on Increasing* Defense Funding and refl ected in the *Program on the Transformation,* Development, and Procurement of the Romanian Armed Forces to 2027 and Beyond, are presented in the appendix. 

# Final Considerations

The White Paper on Defense presents the perspective of the Ministry of National Defense on strengthening the operational readiness of the Romanian Armed Forces and the development of required capabilities necessary to carry out missions, as a result of the short-term defense strategic review process for the timeframe 2015-2019, and medium-term guidelines until 2027. In the short term, the Romanian Armed Forces must be capable to maintain a high level of response for national defense, to develop the capabilities required for participation in NATO's collective defense and in the mutual assistance for EU partners, to contribute to missions and operations under international organizations with responsibilities in the areas of security and defense, to provide support to public authorities in emergency situations, and to provide disaster relief assistance to the population of Romania. In the medium-term, the Romanian Armed Forces will become a modern force structure capable to confront unpredictable threats to repel surprise aggression and to constitute the safeguard of national sovereignty and independence. The Romanian Armed Forces will contribute to maintaining the credibility of the Alliance as part of NATO's collective defense system, and to regional and international security.
