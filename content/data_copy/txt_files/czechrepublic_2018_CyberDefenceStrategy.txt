# Cyber Defence Strategy
 of the Czech Republic

## 2018 – 2022

##### National Cyber Operations Centre

### Introduction

Ensuring security of citizens, protecting sovereignty, territorial integrity, principles

of democracy and the rule of law belong to the state’s fundamental roles. To sustain these

values, the state also needs a complex system of state defence based on a long-term vision.

Substantial social and technological developments have generated the need to change

routine forms and methods applied in the field of defence. Current conflicts are increasingly

waged by asymmetric warfare methods, with many activities taking place in cyberspace.

In this context, also fast development of artificial intelligence and robotic systems must be

mentioned.

The Czech Republic considers build-up of defence capacities in cyberspace vital, also with

respect to its NATO membership, since NATO acknowledges cyberspace as a planning and

operational domain and a cyber attack as a potential activator of Article 5 of the North Atlantic

Treaty. Therefore, in accordance with terms of Article 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty,

the parties to the Treaty should maintain and develop individual as well as collective

capabilities to resist even cyber attacks.

The Czech Republic responds to the above mentioned facts and gradually adopts necessary

measures. Yet, handling of cyber attacks has been hampered by system shortcomings. Even

though cyber security has reached a high level, a system solution of cyber defence is at the

beginning only. Moreover, understanding and definition of these terms differ.

For the explanation it is convenient to say that according to the government’s approach,

cyber defence is an autonomous and specific branch of a wider cyber security concept.

In this context, cyber defence is perceived as part of state defence ensured on the basis

of the Act on Ensuring Defence of the Czech Republic. The Act defines state defence

as a complex of measures taken to ensure sovereignty, territorial integrity, principles

of democracy and the rule of law, and to protect the lives of citizens and their property from

an outer attack. This defence includes building-up of an efficient state defence system,

preparation and engagement of relevant forces and means and participation in the collective

defence system.

Compared with that cyber security is perceived as a complex of tools aimed at ensuring

cyberspace protection. These tools can be of varied nature – legal, organizational,

1


-----

educational, technical, etc. To put it simply, cyber security is supposed to ensure

confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and data in the cyberspace.

Cyber defence differs from cyber security mainly in the nature and intensity of attacks, with

no possibility to define exact criteria. Therefore, readiness for cyber attacks must be complex

and must not focus on the security field only. The state must develop also its capabilities

to resist even such attacks that might activate the state defence. Thus, cyber defence would

be activated only in case of the most intense attacks. A specific feature of cyber defence will

be the fact that it will be active not only in emergencies – mostly in cooperation with other

defence bodies of the Czech Republic, but also permanently in non-emergency situations.

A cornerstone of developing an efficient cyber defence system in the Czech Republic

was a Government’s requirement anchored in the Action Plan for the National Cyber Security

Strategy 2015–2020, where a requirement for building-up and strengthening of cyber defence

capabilities was set forth. The responsibility for cyber defence has been assigned

to the National Cyber Operations Centre (hereinafter NCOC). The concept has been based

on conscious understanding of differences between cyber security and cyber defence.

Conceptual conditions of proper state defence in cyberspace are defined by this Cyber

Defence Strategy, divided into a public and a non-public part. The public part includes basic

visions and, generally, also individual objectives, describing the planned end state

of individual areas of the problem concerned. The public part is more general due to the

nature of the matter at hand, whereas the non-public part brings a list of specific measures

planned to be taken to meet individual objectives. The defined measures stem from defence

policy principles of the Czech Republic, reflect current trends of modern defence doctrines

and are in full compliance with basic rules of a democratic state. The preparation of these

measures respected the premise that the defence is here to maintain and protect basic rights

and freedoms of individuals as well as the above mentioned principles and values, since

security and freedom do not contradict one another. There is no freedom without security.

There is no security without freedom. Thus, the defence measures have been prepared

on the proportionality principle to ensure that the Czech Republic is a democratic and safe

state with capabilities to protect these values.

### Cyber defence key challenges in the Czech

 Republic 

There is a rather huge number of potential attackers able to carry out a cyber attack that

would activate cyber defence of the Czech Republic, including both state and non-state

actors. Cyber attacks are namely ideal tools for damaging political, business or other targets,

and also a strong tool for the attackers to enforce their own will. At the same time, it is often

very difficult to identify the attacker, mainly in real time, which decreases the risk

of a potential adequate response. These facts along with relative absence of geographic and

similar limitations offer a great advantage to the attacker.

Primary targets of these cyber attacks can be especially systems closely interconnecting the

computer environment with the real infrastructure, for example in water management,

energetics, _etc. The attacks can even directly target components of the defence_

infrastructure.

As to cyber defence of the Czech Republic, the most important threat stems from growth

of offensive cyber capabilities in potentially hostile states. Other significant threats include

a growing threat of cyberterrorism and systematic strengthening of cybercrime structures

as well as mutual interconnection of state and non-state attackers.

Priorities in the field of cyber vulnerabilities overlap to a great extent in both cyber security

and cyber defence. The most crucial vulnerabilities are low digital literacy and insufficient

awareness of individual users of security rules to be observed in cyberspace, mainly

in connection with the growing number of the Internet of Things (IoT) appliances.

Furthermore, cyber defence sees increasing vulnerability in growing dependence of the state

security forces on information and communication technologies.

**Most important challenges in detail:**

**New trends of influence promotion**

Recently, the role of non-conventional and unprecedented methods used to achieve political

and strategic goals has been growing permanently. The battles have been fought

in asymmetric forms. It has become increasingly difficult to distinguish outer attacks from

inside ones. Tools of power influence enforcement frequently shift from typical military

campaigns to information operations. In this context, the cyberspace plays an important role

as part of a broader concept of influence promotion. A real threat stems from engagement

of modern robotic military, but also non-military systems or artificial intelligence for these

purposes. The threats posed to sovereignty, territorial integrity, principles of democracy and

the rule of law have amplified significantly.

**State actors**

The past decade has repeatedly witnessed cyber attacks worldwide. Given their

sophistication and scale, they have been directly or indirectly ascribed to state actors.

Individual states have built strong cyber capacities in different forms, from offensive military

capabilities to groups covertly working for the states concerned. They focus on industrial

espionage, intelligence collection, disinformation spreading, but also on attacks causing

casualties and damage to health and property. This threat is a priority of cyber defence, since

the attackers get sufficient material and financial backup to carry out the most intensive

attacks.

**Cyberterrorism**

A terrorist attack is mostly perceived as a physical threat. However, various terrorist groups

more and more frequently declare to enhance their cyber activities. So far, they have used

cyberspace mainly as a recruitment or information platform. Nonetheless, we expect them to

master the skills to carry out even relatively sophisticated cyber attacks soon.

**Growing number of IoT appliances**

In late 2017, about 20 billion appliances were connected to the Internet worldwide.

Predictions suggest that the number might grow up to 30 billion by the end of 2020, with

subsequent further exponential growth. The direct threat does not stem from the number

4

of IoT appliances, but from their often weak or none protection, which enables the attackers

to gain control over these appliances and use them for cyber attacks.

**Low digital literacy and insufficient awareness of users of security rules to be**

**observed in cyberspace**

This has been a long-known problem. However, growing dependence of the society

on information and communication technologies has made it more visible. With regard

to cyber defence of the Czech Republic, it is necessary to mention only poor knowledge

of behavior rules in cyberspace and proper operation of the cyberspace among senior state

or military officials. The mostly used methods of attackers operating at all cyberspace levels

include spear phishing campaigns, malware attacks, compromising of systems through social

engineering or manipulation of legitimate user accounts.

**Growing dependence of national defence bodies on information and communication**

**technologies**

The national defence bodies have become increasingly dependent on information

technologies. They use them, for example, for communication, in support of planning and

decision-making processes, or as basic part of combat systems. Therefore, development

of cyber defence capabilities, but also active operation skills in cyberspace is of growing

importance for these defence bodies.

### Vision 

The Cyber Defence Strategy has been prepared with the prospect that the Czech Republic

must become able to handle even the most serious cyber attacks. To meet this vision,

the state must fully develop its cyber defence capabilities and engage them both in defence

and in support of its military campaigns. Therefore, it is essential to perceive cyber defence

as part of complex defence of the Czech Republic. It will be further necessary to establish

strong international bonds in the cyber defence field to enhance the capacity to avert and

handle potential cyber attacks. We must also get ready to actively aid our international

partners within the framework of obligations stemming from our membership in international

organizations.

### Main strategic vector 

The global objective of the Cyber Defence Strategy is to reach a state, in which NCOC

becomes able to guarantee cyber defence of the Czech Republic, carry out military

operations in cyberspace and play an active role in the international environment.

**The global objective will be achieved if following strategic goals are met:**

**1. Definition of legal framework**

**2. Building-up and development of NCOC infrastructure**

**3. Development of defence capabilities in cyberspace**

**4. Establishment of cooperation and performance of education and training**

**5. Engagement in ensuring cyber security within the Ministry of Defence**

6


-----

#### 1. Definition of legal framework 

Arrangement of cyber defence is at its very beginning in the Czech Republic. In this phase,

tools of administrative legal regulation must be used to define basic competence and

authorities of individual public authorities involved, mainly the NCOC, as well as rights and

obligations of individuals performing the above mentioned powers. It will also be necessary

to establish an efficient control system over activities connected with arrangement of cyber

defence of the Czech Republic. Subsequently, follow-up legal norms must be adopted

to create a complex legal framework. The aim of the adopted legal framework will be support

to development of all other spheres and skills needed to ensure cyber defence of the Czech

Republic. Fulfilment of this objective will define basic legal aspects of cyber defence.

An important step will also be our participation in legal regulation of cyber defence

on the international level.

#### 2. Building-up and development of NCOC infrastructure 

A crucial step to fulfilment of the global objective will lie in building-up of NCOC. The priority

in this field will be to staff NCOC with high-quality personnel, directly followed by measures

to train and retain such high-skilled and experienced personnel. Another priority will

be acquisition and development of top-class technologies facilitating efficient engagement

of human resources. Given cyberspace interconnection, it will be also necessary to use

external sources, mainly in personnel and technological spheres. Fulfilment of this strategic

goal will help build an adequate background for NCOC activities.

#### 3. Building-up of defence capabilities in cyberspace

To ensure defence of the Czech Republic, it will be vital to develop capabilities enabling

to conduct operations in cyberspace. They will be carried out both within cyber defence of the

Czech Republic and as part of military operations. It will be also crucial to develop

capabilities to predict potential attacks, better localize ongoing attacks, and analyze possible

responses to fight them off. Achieved capabilities will be subsequently embedded

in a doctrinal framework. It will be also important to develop a “cyber deterrence” strategy

within cyber defence of the Czech Republic. Fulfilment of the third strategic goal will help

NCOC gain capabilities to actively operate in cyberspace.

#### 4. Establishment of cooperation and performance of education and training 

Efficient cyber defence of the Czech Republic can be achieved only in cooperation with state

and non-state entities, both on national and international levels. Isolation itself would pose

a high security risk, since handling of asymmetric threats and cyber attacks must be complex.

Therefore, NCOC will take active part in arrangement of cyber security in the Czech

Republic. It will also establish strong alliances in the international environment, mainly within

NATO, the EU, and with its neighboring countries. It will develop cooperation with private

entities, especially in the field of science and research, to ensure efficient cyber defence

of the Czech Republic. Within cooperation efforts, preparation of and participation in various

exercises and educational activities will be essential, since they offer an important source

of information and experiences regarding the technical and legal consequences

for arrangement of cyber defence of the Czech Republic. Fulfilment of the fourth strategic

goal will bring significant enhancement of cyber defence of the Czech Republic. At the same

time, NCOC capabilities will contribute to improvement of cyberspace security in the Czech

Republic and its allied countries.

#### 5. Engagement in ensuring cyber security within the Ministry of Defence 

Dependence of the national security bodies on information technologies has been

permanently growing. Thus, all bodies subordinate to the Ministry of Defence must generally

strive to increase the cyber security level. NCOC’s priority task will be to ensure cyber

security of its own means and networks. NCOC’s special skills, however, will be also used

to reinforce defence capabilities of other bodies and employees of the Ministry of Defence.

Fulfilment of this goal will bring reliability and credibility of NCOC information systems as well

as other information systems within the Ministry of Defence.

### Objectives of individual strategic spheres 

#### 1. Definition of legal framework

**1.1. Definition of competence and authorities**

First, we must clearly and indisputably define competence and authorities of public bodies

engaged, in particular the NCOC, as well as rights and obligations of individuals

implementing these powers. It will be also crucial to define conditions, under which the Czech

Republic would activate its cyber defence. Only after this basic definition, we can further

develop efficient cyber defence, with all regards to constitutional principles and the rule

of law. Thus, it will be necessary to prepare required changes to the law to ensure full

operational capabilities of NCOC and pass them successfully through the entire legislative

procedures.

**1.2. Definition of authorities within the decision-making process connected with**

**engagement of cyber defence capabilities of the Czech Republic**

Efficient cyber defence of the Czech Republic must be based on unambiguously defined

powers, which will influence particularly the decision-making process connected with

engagement of cyber defence capabilities of the Czech Republic in the future. Therefore,

rules must be set to define these mechanisms. First, we must prepare a plan of cyber

defence of the Czech Republic. At the same time, we must approve statutory regulation and

conclude cooperation agreements with individual partners. Subsequently, we will approve

particular crisis management or cooperation documents to define, among other things,

specific conditions of cooperation with our national as well as foreign partners.

**1.3. Preparation and revisions of NCOC internal regulations**

Also preparation of consequent internal regulations of NCOC will be important. They will

specify in details fulfilment of individual tasks, mutual relations, interconnection with internal

legal norms of the Ministry of Defence, and responsibilities of individuals engaged in cyber

defence of the Czech Republic.

9


-----

**1.4. Participation in preparation and revisions of the law in the field of cyberspace**
**regulation**

Knowledge and experiences learnt from NCOC operation will be used for revisions and

preparation of statutory amendments connected with cyber security of the Czech Republic

and cyberspace in general. It will be important to actively discuss interpretations and

meanings of cyber security and cyber defence concepts in the Czech Republic.

**1.5. Participation in preparation of cyber defence regulation on the international**

**level**

Given the cyberspace characteristics, an important factor influencing cyber defence

of the Czech Republic is also the issue of international regulation. Therefore, we will have

to actively participate in preparation of legal regulation defining cyber defence

on the international level, especially in the fields of jurisdiction, responsibility, and right

to self-defence.

#### 2. Building-up and development of NCOC infrastructure 

**2.1. Achievement of high technological level of NCOC assets**

Introduction of first-rate technologies is vital for efficient implementation of cyber defence

of the Czech Republic. Thus, one of NCOC priorities will be to monitor new trends in the field

of technological development and subsequent fast purchase for advantageous prices and

implementation within NCOC’s infrastructure. In the fields, in which commercial products

cannot sufficiently cover NCOC needs, the emphasis will be put on investments

in development and subsequent introduction of own technologies.

**2.2. Hiring of sufficient number of well-qualified personnel**

NCOC, just like many similar institutions in the Czech Republic, will have to face shortages

of qualified personnel. Thus, another NCOC priority will be a more efficient recruitment. The

hiring process will also have to meet modern HR trends in the IT field. It will be also further

necessary to set and maintain competitive job conditions as regards remuneration and

modern benefits. In the long term, NCOC will focus on alternative recruitment methods.

Currently, the biggest challenge, mainly in IT field, is to retain and motivate the personnel.

10


-----

The precondition is to create a system of remuneration and quality systematic education.

It will be also important to develop a motivation system of rewards and promotions, based on

the staff performance, which will be further connected with application of modern

management methods.

**2.3. Maintaining infrastructure**

A crucial step will be to ensure a suitable infrastructure and necessary logistic support, which

will enable to implement efficient performance of cyber defence of the Czech Republic.

**2.4. Use of external resources**

Exchange of valuable experience between civilian experts and NCOC employees might be

very useful to increase qualification of NCOC personnel. Thus, the effort will focus on

establishment of various exchange programs with civilian companies. One of the forms how

to use external resources will lie in engagement of active reserves and preparation for their

potential deployment. NCOC will also strive to use external assets and facilities to develop

new technologies or train its personnel.

#### 3. Building-up of defence capabilities in cyberspace 

**3.1. Building-up of operational capabilities in cyberspace within defence of the**

**Czech Republic**

To ensure cyber defence of the Czech Republic, first we must be able to carry out operations

that could be launched in case of necessary defence against large-scale cyber attacks. The

NCOC will create a set of capabilities offering a broad spectrum of possible responses

to various cyber attacks.

**3.2. Building-up of operational capabilities in cyberspace in support of military**

**campaigns**

Besides cyber defence of the Czech Republic, NCOC will have to develop its capabilities

to support military operations. They will cover operational up to tactical levels and will include

both combat support in other spheres and operations carried out exclusively in cyberspace.

11


-----

**3.3. Enhancement of cyberspace attacks’ prediction and analysis capabilities**

To identify an attack in cyberspace, correctly define the enemy, and reveal his motivations,

tactics and operational methods is one of the most difficult, but also one of the absolutely

crucial tasks. NCOC will strengthen its capabilities of information collection and analysis

concerning threats, risks and cyberspace attacks. These capabilities will be based on three

main pillars – complex analysis of cyber threats (“Cyber Threat Intelligence”), advanced

forensic analysis, and activities of NCOC’s Cyber Defence Security Operations Centre.

Acquired information will become an indispensable basis for efficient implementation of cyber

defence of the Czech Republic. Selected information can be shared with other relevant

national as well as international entities.

**3.4. Preparation of a doctrinal framework for engagement of cyber defence**
**capabilities of the Czech Republic**

Development of operational capabilities must be interconnected with integration of all newly

acquired skills in doctrines on strategic, operational as well as tactical levels.

**3.5. Development of cyber deterrence strategy**

It is also important to discourage potential attackers from conducting of hostile activities.

Cyber deterrence embraces a number of factors, such as the ability to reveal an attack and

identify its perpetrator, the overall level of cyber defence, or punishments in case

of apprehension. However, efficiency of these individual factors if applied independently

is much lower than in case of a complex and systematic approach. Since the issue is broad,

covering many spheres, it would be suitable to prepare a separate national strategy in this

context.

#### 4. Establishment of cooperation and performance of education and training 

**4.1. Cooperation within the Ministry of Defence**

Key cooperation will certainly take place within the Ministry of Defence as part of complex

defence of the Czech Republic. Close cooperation will be developed with the Army of the

12


-----

Czech Republic in support of military operations. It will be also necessary to build secure

communication channels in cooperation with other parts of the Ministry of Defence.

**4.2. Cooperation on national level**

NCOC will participate in development of an efficient system of cooperation among

organizations engaged in ensuring cyber security of the Czech Republic, with the core

emphasis put on the National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÚKIB), the Police

of the Czech Republic – National Centre for Organized Crime (NCOZ), national CERT and

other CERT/CSIRT authorities. Given the fact that cyber threats have been emerging

in many forms, compliance of civilian and military approaches to protection of critical activities

should be increasing. These efforts must be further fueled by closer cooperation among

NCOC, the private sector and the academic sphere. Also cooperation in science and

research activities will be of crucial importance. Cooperation on the national level will

be backed up also with appropriate strategic communications.

**4.3. Cooperation on international level**

Given global characteristics of cyberspace, NCOC must build strong and close alliances

in the international environment. Main cooperation will focus on NATO and EU structures,

within which active involvement of NCOC personnel is expected. Close cooperation will

be established mainly with CCD COE. Naturally, the Czech Republic will also enhance

partnership cooperation with its neighboring countries. Another crucial aspect will

be to develop cooperation on a much broader global scale.

**4.4. Exercises**

Importantly, the cooperation will also include organization of and participation in exercises.

The exercises will help to test and improve our capabilities to deal with real threats. They will

focus not only on readiness of technical structures, but also on legal aspects and

decision-making processes. These activities must be implemented on national as well

as international levels.

**4.5. Education**

Individuals engaged in cyber defence of the Czech Republic must have access to appropriate

education, other individuals involved must be educated by NCOC personnel. Typically, they

will attend courses, seminars and conferences. A crucial aspect will be support and

13


-----

cooperation in establishment of educational programs focusing on cyber defence. Also in this

field, the activities must be developed both on national and international levels.

#### 5. Engagement in ensuring cyber security within the Ministry of Defence 

**5.1. Ensuring NCOC cyber security**

NCOC will very probably become a target of differently motivated cyber attacks, which will try

to acquire information, and to discredit or directly eliminate NCOC to weaken the general

defence capabilities of the Czech Republic. Therefore, NCOC must take all measures

available to ensure maximum level of its own cyber security.

**5.2. Participation in detection of threats and vulnerabilities of the Ministry**
**of Defence networks**

NCOC will possess detailed information on cyberspace threats, based on which it will issue

recommendations concerning measures to be adopted in order to ensure cyber security

of the Ministry of Defence. NCOC’s operational capabilities will be also used as one

of the means to detect cyber vulnerabilities within the Ministry of Defence. For this purpose,

the Ministry of Defence can also apply modern methods based on cooperation with

the general public.

**5.3. Participation in ensuring cyber security of the Ministry of Defence networks**
**and personnel**

NCOC’s Cyber Defence Security Operations Centre must establish close cooperation with

similar offices within the Ministry of Defence, mainly with the CIRC Centre of the Ministry

of Defence. This cooperation must include active information exchange and coordination

of activities of its individual participants. NCOC must also take active part in definition

of cyber security standards planned to be introduced. Another measure would

be participation in protection of the Ministry of Defence personnel, who might become

a target of cyber attacks carried out in different forms and with various motivations. This effort

might focus, for example, on training, but also on active aid to individuals directly threatened

by cyber attacks.

14


-----

**5.4. Participation in training of ICT experts within the Ministry of Defence**

NCOC members will get above-standard training and will also learn exclusive experience

during their activities. Subsequently, they will pass their acquired knowledge and experiences

via training to relevant employees of the Ministry of Defence to generally increase digital

literacy of the personnel.

15


-----

### Implementation 

The Strategy has been developed up to the level of specific goals, described in a way

enabling their release to the expert and general public. The above mentioned goals serve

as a basis for development of a non-public Action plan, which specifies measures aimed

at fulfilment of individual goals, responsibilities, implementation time limits, and evaluation

methods.

Implementation of the Strategy will be continuously reviewed and evaluated. Given the

dynamics of modern technologies development, it will be necessary to permanently monitor

whether the Strategy reflects the latest situation developments. Also public discussion will

be of concern. For this purpose, a publicly available contact point in form of an e-mail

address will be established. Thus, the Strategy is expected to be reviewed, if necessary.

The implementation will be continuously evaluated in form of annual reports submitted by the

Director of Military Intelligence to responsible authorities.

### Conclusion 

The nature of the prepared Strategy is rather organizational. It will help establish an efficient

cyber defence system of the Czech Republic. Information and experience learnt from

ensuring cyber defence of the Czech Republic will become a cornerstone of plans of future

development and strategic orientation. Subsequently, a follow-up Strategy might be more

ambitious, potentially even with the Czech Republic’s focus on a potential effort to become

one of the most important actors in the field of global cyber defence.
