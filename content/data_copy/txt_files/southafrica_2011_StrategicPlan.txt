##### Foreword by the Honourable Minister of Defence and Military Veterans, L.N. Sisulu, MP

In the 2010 budget Vote, we pro� led the conscious development of reliable,
dependable human capital base within the Defence Force. To this end, we
announced the establishment of the National Defence Service Force Commission,
revitalisation of the Defence Reserves and � nalisation of the non statutory
Force Military Veterans Pension, to mention but a few. Auditable outputs have
been recorded in so far as these are concerned and are evidenced by the
Promulgation of Defence Amendment Act 22 of 2010, whose object is to provide
for the establishment of the National Defence Force Service Commission charged
with a role to create a separate dispensation for the Defence Force, creating a
paradigm that prescribes contracts for Defence Reserves whilst protecting them
from discrimination by employers and creditors.

Stemming from the President’s announcement at a special Cabinet meeting on
25 October 2010, a new growth path for the country has been agreed upon. This
path places people’s employment at the centre of government’s economic policy. Defence commits itself
to support government’s intent in terms of inherent available Defence capabilities and initiatives such as the
MSDS and National Youth Service system in contribution to national skills development and job creation.

Notwithstanding the auditing standards that are continually being enhanced, the Ministry will earnestly pursue
the realisation of a quali� cation free Audit. Some auditable strides have been registered which are a result of
the multi-pronged strategy to realise the quali� cation free audit, of which operation “Clean Audit” is but one.
Deepening in establishing internal controls that will help to proactively mitigate functions and processes that
could lead to an audit quali� cation will be prioritised. A strong monitoring and evaluation capability will be
enhanced.

The role of Defence within the Government Cluster system in the International Co-operation Trade and
Security (ICTS) Cluster, will continue to receive priority attention in order to strengthen South Africa’s support of
international and regional peace, security and stability.

The SANDF contributes with contingent force of 1229 men and women under the Mission dubbed MONUSCO in
the DRC and 634 soldiers under the Mission code named UNAMID in Sudan. Apart from the troop contribution
in the Peace Mission in the DRC, SANDF troops also provide post con� ict reconstruction in that country with the
view to strengthening the weak state apparatus and institutions. In this respect the focus areas are integration
and team building training, transformation process and general military training of the Armed Forces. On the
basis of bilateral arrangements with Central African Republic, SANDF has deployed 49 men and women with
the view to providing general military assistance in the form of training to the Armed Forces of said country.

Internally, the SANDF has since April 2010 deployed for border safeguarding along the borders of RSA and her
neighbouring countries. Currently, SANDF has already set its footprint along RSA/Zimbabwe Border and RSA/
Mozambique border and due to deploy along RSA/Lesotho border on 1 April 2011. State resources need to
be mobilised more aggressively to ensure the stable roll out of Operation CORONA (border-safeguarding).
Currently, Defence is furthermore exploring possibilities to ensure security against piracy prevails in the SADC
waters on a bilateral and multinational basis. The piracy threat is real and therefore they is a need to ensure
in accordance with safe guarding territorial integrity that we need to develop a plan on how to deal with this
problem and ensure that our trade lines remain safe and secure.

At the time of writing, the SANDF has joined forces with National Disaster Management Centre for humanitarian
assistance community affected by � oods national. To this end, the SANDF has deployed air assets to airlift
entrapped people to safety, as well as delivering food parcels for those in need. The mandate of the Defence
remains that of Defence and protection of the, Republic, its territorial integrity and its people in accordance
with the Constitution of the Republic and the principles on international law regulating the use of forces.

We have entered into a Delivery Agreement (DA) with the President to facilitate service delivery in terms of
selected Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) outcomes. In the meanwhile Defence has implemented
the outcomes based strategic planning approach in order to ensure that high performance levels are


-----

and 5 and as such obligations that � ow from these delivery agreements must � nd expression in the planning
instruments of the Constitutional institutions that service the Defence mandate, with the Defence Secretariat
providing the essential norms and standards to guarantee implementation.

The Strategic Plans are developed to give effect to the two constitutional entities that service the Defence
Mandate which are the Defence Force and the Defence Secretariat re� ect, amongst others, the essence
of the Delivery Agreement (DA) entered into, between myself and the Commander in Chief in terms of
applicable Outcomes and provide parameters and expectations that I consider achievable for Defence. The
alignment of Defence with the Constitutional and legislative mandate is re� ected through the pursuance of
our identi� ed Outcomes, Outputs, Vision and Mission which will ensure that Defence remains relevant to the
dynamic circumstances.

Finally, allow me to re� ect a little on impact assessment of my Portfolio. During the Budget Vote 21 of
both FY2009/10 and FY2010/11, I outlined the institutional reforms that will form the strategic levers of my
transformation Agenda. In the FY 2009 Budget Vote, I indicated the need to provide a visible reward and
recognition to all those that sacri� ced their well being to help us realise the freedoms that we now enjoy. As
such Military Veterans were consciously my transformation agenda. To date the Department is indeed in
place. The coming years will thus be characterised by initiatives to maximise the functionality of the organ of
State by widening the footprint of a reliable and dependable service delivery focused Department.

The execution of the Constitutional and legislative Defence mandate of both the Defence Secretariat and
the South African National Defence Force are provided in the strategic and annual performance plans
accompanying this Overarching Statement. These documents provide the required detailed information on
the functioning of these two Defence entities.

I am con� dent that through these planning instruments, distinctive features of the Defence Force will be
protected whilst delivery to the citizens will be enhanced.

##### THE DEFENCE FUNCTION IN CONTEXT
###### DEFENCE CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE

The primary object of the Defence function is to provide for the Defence and protection of the Republic, its
territorial integrity and its people. The Constitution provides that the rendition of the Defence function should
be done in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Constitution and the principles of international law
regulating the use of force.

The Department of Defence (DOD) derives its mandate primarily from section 200(2) of the Constitution[1] as
well as section 227 of the Interim Constitution of the Republic of South Africa[2]. The Defence mandate is given
substance by the Defence Act[3], the White Paper on Defence (1996) and the Defence Review (1998).

The DOD comprises of the Defence Secretariat which is established in terms of Section 204 of the Defence Act
and the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) established in terms of Section 200 (2) of the Interim
Constitution[4].

###### VISION

Effective Defence for a democratic South Africa.

###### MISSION

To provide, manage, prepare and employ Defence capabilities commensurate with the needs of South Africa
as regulated by the Constitution, national legislation and Parliamentary and Executive direction. The above
will be provided through the proper management, provision, preparedness and employment of Defence
capabilities, which are in line with the domestic and global needs of South Africa.

###### THE DOD MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGIC FOCUS

In the medium to long term, the DOD will execute its mandate through focusing on the following:

�� To defend and protect South Africa, its sovereignty, its territorial integrity, its national interests and its
people in accordance with the Constitution and principles of international law regulating the use of
force.

�� To contribute to freedom from fear and want, including the promotion of human security, both nationally
and internationally.

�� To contribute to a better life for the people of South Africa.

Whilst emphasising its obligation, the DOD embraces Government’s initiatives and priorities to alleviate poverty
and underdevelopment. The DOD support to these Government initiatives requires that:

�� Defence capabilities are enhanced and maintained.

�� Peace, security and con� dence-building in the SADC region and the rest of the continent are promoted
through constructive dialogue aimed at nurturing sound Defence diplomatic relations and projecting
South Africa’s foreign policy principles and objectives;

�� The Government’s policy to resolve con� icts peacefully through recognised international instruments
and mechanisms be supported by deploying the SANDF in international peace missions;

�� The Government’s diplomatic engagements are supported through participation in multilateral
institutions such as the SADC, AU and UN.

1 Act 108 of 1996.
2 Act 200 of 1993

###### THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE AND MILITARY VETERANS (MOD&MV) PRIORITIES

For the period ahead, the Minister has made a determination of matters considered important for the DOD to
pursue as strategic priorities. The execution of these strategic priorities will enhance the effective realisation of
the Defence mandate. Monitoring and evaluation of performance against these identi� ed strategic priorities
will test the extent to which the Defence function has been able to “do things differently and achieve more
with less”. The strategic priorities identi� ed are as follows:

�� Execution of the Border Safeguarding Function. The safeguarding of the borders of South Africa remains
one of the key functions of the SANDF. The phased in approach, adopted by the SANDF in undertaking
this function, will continue in FY2011/12 with the � nal phase completed in FY2012/13.

�� Establishment of the New Service Dispensation. The Defence Amendment Act, 22 of 2011, has been
enacted. As intended, the Defence Amendment Act has created a new service dispensation for the
SANDF members. In FY2011/12 the DOD shall focus on the implementation of the afore-mentioned
amendment in order to realise this dispensation. Consequential amendments to other Acts will also be
taken into account.

�� Enhancement of the SANDF’s Landward Defence Capabilities. In order to undertake all required missions,
the enhancement of the Landward Defence Capabilities is essential. For the Landward Defence
Capability to operate jointly with the Air Defence and Maritime Defence Capabilities, this enhancement
is considered a priority. The Landward Defence Capability has not enjoyed the advantage of being
part of the Strategic Defence Packages and is thus lacking technologically advanced Primary Mission
Equipment.

�� Maritime Security. The Defence and security of South Africa is inextricably linked to that of the region
and the continent. Being a littoral country, South Africa needs to have a balanced maritime capability
to effectively respond to arising maritime security threats affecting South Africa.

�� Job Creation. In support of the government initiative on job creation, the DOD plans to create job
opportunities in the following areas:

�� Filling of all 1 401 vacant funded positions in the DOD.
�� Recruitment of 5 700 young South Africans per year to the Military Skills Development System (MSDS).
�� Call up of 16 400 Defence Reserve members per year to undertake speci� c tasks over speci� c
periods of time.
�� The enhancement of the DOD Works Capability to create opportunities for people with technical
skills within the SANDF. This in turn will allow for the SANDF intakes to increase with the same number
of the SANDF members transferred to the DOD Works Capability.
�� Creation of job opportunities in the Defence Industry through approved DOD projects.

�� Enhancement of the SANDF’s Peacekeeping Capability (SANDF Deployability). The role of the SANDF
in promoting peace and security in the region and the continent necessitates the enhancement of the
SANDF’s peacekeeping capability that will include the SANDF’s Forward Deployment Capability.

�� National Youth Service. The implementation of the National Youth Service by using core Defence
capabilities to provide initial training to the youth prior to absorption into service delivery departments.

�� Revitalisation of the Reserves. As part of the One Force concept, the Reserves must be transformed and
revitalised to ful� l the various important Defence roles allocated to them.

�� Restructuring and Support of the Defence Industry. The restructuring should focus on Defence capability,
the interactive framework and function alignment in order to properly synchronise these with the
requirements and mandate of Defence. The emphasis should be on Governance, Risk Management,
Compliance and Accountability framework applicable within Defence Portfolio.

�� Department of Defence Works Capability. The state of the DOD facilities portfolio calls for the review of
the existing arrangements for the repair and maintenance of Defence facilities. The establishment of
the DOD Works Capability seeks to achieve an end state where the DOD will have an in-house capacity
that will ultimately assume the full responsibility of the Defence facilities repair and maintenance. The
DOD Works Capability will at the same time create job opportunities in the DOD, thus contributing to the
Government’s priority of job creation.

###### DEFENCE OUTCOMES

The Defence outcomes relate to the medium term results that are the consequence of achieving speci�c


-----

�� Enhanced Civil Control of the Department of Defence.

�� RSA is Defended and Protected.
###### DEFENCE OUTPUTS

Defence outputs relate to the DOD’s � nal products, or goods and services produced for delivery. Outputs are
de� ned as “what we produce or deliver”. The Defence Outputs are as follows:

�� Conduct ordered defence commitments in accordance with government policy and strategy.

�� Provide mission ready defence capabilities.

�� Provide sound defence direction.

�� Ensure defence compliance with Regulatory Framework.
###### DEFENCE ACTIVITIES

Defence activities are the processes or actions that use a range of inputs to produce the desired outputs
and ultimately achieve the intended outcomes. In essence, activities describe “what we do”. The following
Departmental activities are relevant:

�� Administrate the DOD.

�� Enable the DOD.

�� Employ the SANDF.

###### DEFENCE INPUTS

�� Provide professional & Supported DOD Human Resources.

�� Provide appropriate & sustained Materiél.

�� Provide integrated & reliable Defence Information & Intelligence.

�� Provide sound Financial Management of the DOD.

###### BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE (REJUVENATION)

�� Ensure Appropriate Strategic Reserves.

�� Renew DOD Main Equipment and Doctrine.

�� Undertake Defence Research & Development.

�� Promote & appropriate Defence Industry.

�� Ensure Consensus on Defence.

###### DOD STRATEGY MAP

As a whole, the DOD has made progress with the implementation of the Balanced Score Card (BSC) as a
performance management framework. Although the performance management system has not reached
maturity in the DOD, it has established a profound footing in the Department’s planning process.

###### INFORMATION SYSTEMS SUPPORTING DOD PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

Since 2005, the DOD has developed an information system called “GEJIMA” which provides for one-stop-shop
capturing of performance information. The aforementioned system is managed by the State Information,
Technology Agency (SITA), and is utilised to conduct gap and trend analysis with regards to performance
information. Notwithstanding the challenges with the current local area networks experienced in certain
domains within the DOD, the Department is determined to improve on the integrity, currency and reliability of
the performance information. In cases of infrastructural failures, capturing of data on the system as it relates
to planning and performance data is undertaken at the SITA of� ces and the consolidated information is
con� rmed by Departmental planning authorities.

###### FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN ALLOCATION OF THE DEFENCE PROGRAMMES

The composition of the Defence’s Budget Programmes as published in the Estimates of National Expenditure
(ENE) 2011, Vote 22 is as provided the Table below.

5 Data as reported for the � rst two quarters of the FY2010/11.
6 The indicator has been changed from 2011/12 to only re� ect “large-scale” operations, as the requirement for general military assistance and smallscale operations cannot be accurately projected. Currently the requirement is for two large-scale (Battalion + [More than 800 members]) operations,
but contingency planning is being done to be prepared for a third operation of limited duration, should it be required.
7 The large number in 2010 was due to operations in support of the 2010 FIFA World Cup and the gradual increase from 2011/12 onwards is the result of

###### DOD EXPENDITURE TRENDS
The detail of DOD’s estimated expenditure is re� ected in Government’s Estimate of National Expenditure 2011
and is included in the Appropriation Bill 2011 tabled in Parliament on 23 February 2011.

###### DEPARTMENTAL RECEIPTS

Departmental receipts are mainly from the sale of redundant or obsolete equipment and Defence matériel,
the rental of accommodation to personnel, and board and lodging. The reason for the � uctuations in real
departmental receipts, speci� cally � nancial transactions in assets and liabilities, is due to the unpredictable
nature of reimbursements for peace support operations. Revenue collection projections are also hampered
by the unpredictable nature of the potential buyers of SANDF equipment, and by international treaties,
protocols and licence agreements. Between FY2009/10 and FY2013/14, revenue is expected to increase from
R676.7 million to R885.9 million, at an average annual rate of 7.7 percent.

## DEFENCE SECRETARIAT STRATEGIC PLAN

###### “Doing things differently to achieve more with less”

#### FOR THE FISCAL YEARS 2011/12 – 2015/16

###### Date of tabling: 09 March 2011


-----

#### INTRODUCTION BY THE SECRETARY OF DEFENCE

The mandate of Defence remains the protection of the territorial integrity of the
RSA. The mandate is executed through Section 200(1) that establishes a disciplined
South African National Defence Force (SANDF), whose functions are articulated in
Section 224(1) of the interim Constitution of South Africa. In delivering this mandate,
the collateral utility of Defence capabilities has been demonstrated with the various
service delivery projects in support of other government departments.

Equally so, Section 204 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, has
institutionalised sound civil–military relations through a civilian Secretariat. In terms
of Section 204 “A civilian secretariat for Defence must be established by national
legislation to function under the direction of the Cabinet member responsible for
Defence.” Giving substance to this Constitutional mandate are Sections 6 to 9 of
the Defence Act, No 42 of 2002 that establishes, as well as spells out the scope of
operations of the Defence Secretariat. The task directive encapsulates the provision
of policy advice to the Minister, enhances civil control and oversight. In addition to this, the Secretariat is
responsible for issuing comprehensive instructions and ensuring SANDF compliance to MOD directives.

In September 2009 at a work session, the Defence Secretariat, developed a blueprint that would inform a vision
of building a responsive and dependable Defence Secretariat for the third decade. The blueprint culminated
in the ground breaking September 2010 Margate DOD Resolution that formalised the recommendation for
adoption by COD. The aforementioned Resolutions were aimed at the achievement of the MOD priority on
alignment of the Defence Secretariat with its Constitutional and Legislative Mandate. Further work on the
Repositioning of the Secretariat will form the basis of the Defence Secretariat programme in 2011.

Furthermore, the President of the Republic of South Africa, adopted the outcomes based approach to strategic
planning, implementation and performance monitoring and evaluation so as to achieve auditable evidence
of improvement of the quality of lives of citizens. The prioritisation of the identi� ed outcomes that impact on
and are a requirement of the Defence Secretariat will also constitute an critical part of the programme in
2011. More importantly, our ability to measure appropriate performance indicators will most surely ensure
the Department is able to gauge the successes it is achieving and areas which may require intervention and
support to ensure the outputs are achieved and ultimately, outcomes are realised.

The development of an oversight reporting framework to give structure and content to the role of the Defence
Secretariat, de� ne the elements of Civil Military relations and promote devolution of appropriate functions to
the SANDF to enhance effectiveness in implementation. This will be coupled with the strengthening of the
Internal Audit Functions and the enhancement of compliance levels throughout the Department of Defence.

The Defence Secretariat remains seized with the responsibility of providing the latest and � t-for-purpose
policy and legislative instruments to support a Defence Force that functions within the legal framework that
appreciates the role of civil authority within a democracy.

The role of the Department of Defence as the secretariat and the coordinator of the ICTS Cluster presents an
opportunity for substantive contribution to the work of the cluster, in support of South African Foreign Policy.
In this, the ICTS cluster pursues and protects the National Interest of South Africa and this is re� ected in the
Defence diplomacy and Peace Support Operations led by the Department of Defence.

South Africa pursues Defence diplomacy initiatives in furtherance of the peace, stability, con� dence building
and meeting the security objectives of government. For political, strategic and geographic reasons, Defence
cooperation with other states in the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Continent
and the World beyond, is a priority for the achievement of peace and security. Consequently, Defence will
engage in cooperative ventures with its counterparts throughout the region and continent in areas of training
and education; Defence planning; exchange visits; multinational exercises and procurement of military
equipment.

The signing and implementation of international Defence agreements is a critical policy action. These are
placed at the disposal of Defence to ensure the implementation of governmental direction aimed at the


-----

international engagement framework supported by an annual updated international engagements plan
which will guide Defence efforts will be developed.

In pursuit of the promotion of international and regional peace, security and stability, the Republic of South
Africa is a signatory to a number of international peace and security protocols, including, inter alia, the
United Nations (UN), African Union (AU) and SADC Peace and Security Protocols, and bears constitutional
responsibility to meet these international obligations.

Within the context of regional peace and security architecture, on one hand, and the country’s legislative
framework, on the other, the RSA externally deploys and employs its state resources in pursuit of her national
security interests and foreign policy objectives, and in the same vein, to advance collective interests of the
region. It is also within this same context that RSA military resources are pledged to the SADC Standby Force
with the view to employing them in the protection of hard earned regional peace, security and stability.

The phased implementation of border safeguarding has since April 2010, seen the Defence Force deployed
for border safeguarding along the borders of the RSA and her neighbouring countries. Currently the Defence
Force has already set its footprint along the RSA/Zimbabwe and RSA/Mozambiquan border and are due
to deploy along the RSA/Lesotho border on 1 April 2011. As such, State resources are to be mobilised more
aggressively to ensure the stable roll-out of Operation CORONA (border safeguarding).

In embracing the government priority of creating decent jobs, the enhancement of the Military Skills
Development System (MSDS) has seen at least four thousand youth enrolling during the � rst semester of 2011
for the MSDS programme. Further partnerships with other organs of state, notably Sector Education and
Training Authorities (SETAs), and the Department of Higher Education and Training), will be explored in the
quest to create decent jobs.

Another initiative that pro� les the Defence’s commitment to the creation of decent work, is the National Youth
Service Concept (NYS). In re� ning the implementation of the concept in collaboration with other Government
Departments, a pilot project has, in collaboration with the Department of Rural Development, commenced
in Bloemfontein during the FY2010/11 year. It is believed that the lessons learned from the pilot project will be
used to re� ning the concept further and ensure the establishment of the Policy and regulatory framework for
the National Youth Service Programme and its implementation.

Foregrounding all the aforementioned efforts will be the strengthening of civil-military relations so as to deepen
the pillars on which the Policy Review and Strategy are anchored as well as to guarantee the ef� cacy of
implementation. It is against this backdrop that the Defence Secretariat has developed its Strategic Plan and
the accompanying Annual Performance Plan.

Honourable Minister, I submit to you this Strategic Plan that provides evidence of the commitment to the MOD
and MV priorities and other aspects as outlined within the approved FY11/12 DOD Overarching Strategic
Statement which form the basis of this Plan and all links thereto. This Plan further serves as a means of building
a responsive and dependable Defence Secretariat for the third decade. It is hoped that, through this
Strategic Plan, the strengthening of civil-military relations will be achieved that will help realise a modernised,
responsive, resilient, relevant and reliable Defence Force.

#### PART A: STRATEGIC OVERVIEW

###### CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION

The Defence Secretariat is established in terms of Section 6 of the Defence Act 42 of 2002, designed to give
effect to the mandate of the Defence Secretariat and execute its functions within the parameters of section
8 of the Defence Act 42 of 2002.

The Secretary for Defence is the Head of the Department, the Accounting Of� cer, the Information Of� cer and
the principal advisor to the Minister of Defence on Defence policy matters. The Secretary for Defence is also
the Head of the Defence Secretariat and acts within the areas of responsibility to provide strategic direction
to the DOD by operating under the direction of the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans.

The development of norms and standards that enhance compliance with the appropriate regulatory
frameworks to promote accountable mobilisation and utilisation of resources is the principal task of the
Defence Secretariat, which is at the heart of an accountable administration.

The Defence Secretariat will strive to enhance sound civil control and robust legislative oversight over the
SANDF, as well as compliance with the national policy and regulatory frameworks. In this regard, the Strategic
Plan aims to carry out its mandate, focus on the two outcomes of Defence and contribute to the governmental
outcomes.

This Strategic Plan is packaged into four chapters. Chapter 1 provides the Strategic Overview of the Defence
Secretariat which includes the constitutional and legislative mandate, the policy mandate, planned policy
initiatives and the vision, mission and values.

Chapter 2 provides the medium term strategic focus of the Defence Secretariat and focuses on the situational
analysis which consists of the performance and organisational environment of the Defence Secretariat.

Chapter 3 provides the translation of the Defence Secretariat’s mandate into Defence outputs in a logical
framework approach with the accompanying exposition on the � nancial resources. The detailed performance
information is provided in the tables.

Chapter 4 concludes with the resource plans that support the Defence Secretariat Strategic Plan. This Plan
provides an overview of both entities and organs of state that currently report to the Executive Authority
through the structures and mechanism located within the Defence Secretariat.

#### CHAPTER 2

###### DEFENCE SECRETARIAT MEDIUM TERM STRATEGIC FOCUS INTRODUCTION

This chapter provides an overview of the current changing situational environment which may impact directly
or indirectly on the Defence Secretariat performance environment and organisational environment. Further,
it re� ects the departmental strategic planning process and the development of the Defence Secretariat
Strategic Plan. Finally, it links the Defence Secretariat outcomes to Government’s medium-term strategic
focus.

###### SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS PERFORMANCE ENVIRONMENT

Contribution to Government’s Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF). The Government’s Medium-Term
Strategic Framework (MTSF) is a statement of intent that identi� es the development challenges facing South
Africa. This outlines the medium-term strategy for improvements in the conditions of the lives of South Africans
and for the Defence Secretariat’s enhanced contribution to the cause of building a better Africa and a better
world. The Defence Secretariat plays a role in contributing to the MTSF outcomes.

Human Resources (HR). A contributing factor to the human resource challenge, is the current deviation by the
Department from the structural blueprint articulated in the White Paper on Defence and the Defence Review
regarding the relationship between the Regulars and the Reserves. The ongoing participation of the MSDS
currently compounds the human resource funding and personnel in� ation � gure of the DOD. A current review
of the Defence Strategy will provide direction in terms of a projected Defence footprint and blueprint, thereby
creating future Defence capabilities, force design and force structure which will endeavour to address the
current organisational challenges.

Defence Research Capability. The declining research capability of Defence is currently placing a threat
on the sustainability of development and the situation is exacerbated by the inability of Defence to harness
existing sector research capabilities currently residing within Defence Training Institutions, Defence Industry as
well as leveraging partnerships with international stakeholders.

Intellectual Property and Patents. Over the short and medium term, interventions to manage the Intellectual
Property (IP) of the DOD will be strengthened in collaboration with Armscor who is mandated through the
Armscor Act as the custodian of such IP.

Further, the short and medium term will see the management of the current patents, copyrights and trademarks
of products developed by Defence, which are essential to enhance its knowledge base and reduce the
unit cost. It will also see the development of appropriate de� nitions of military strategic IP with the requisite
protocols and regimes for its protection from direct and indirect infringement both domestically, continentally
and globally.

Infrastructure/Facilities. A backlog in current DOD facilities’ maintenance has resulted in an ongoing decline
in the state of Defence facilities, exacerbated by the inability of the Department of Public Works (DPW) to
service its maintenance mandate as the custodian of state infrastructure. A phased-in strategy to relocate
the facilities’ maintenance function from the DPW to the DOD is being pursued.

Information Management. The DOD currently does not possess an integrated information management
system. To improve this situation, electronic interfaces between the DOD and its suppliers will be prioritised to
align with the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) which will furthermore enable the integration
between current DOD information systems and the � nancial management system (FMS). Ageing and obsolete
technology continues to hamper the effectiveness of the Department.

Contribution to Government Clusters. In the International Cooperation, Trade and Security (ICTS) Cluster, the
DOD chairs the Cluster at a Director-General level and the Minister is the chairperson of the Cluster, responsible
for the co-ordination of the work of the Cluster and reporting to the President. By virtue of the Minister’s and
the Secretary for Defence’s positions in the Cluster, the DOD carries out the secretariat function of the Cluster,
ensuring that the documentation and content for meetings are adequately prepared and presented.


-----

The Government’s New Growth Path. In contributing to the Government’s new growth path, the Defence
Secretariat commits itself to supporting Government’s intent in terms of inherent available Defence
capabilities and initiatives such as the MSDS and the National Youth Service system in contribution to national
skills development and job creation. The employability of young future leaders, within both the private and
public sectors, will be of great advantage to those members who graduate from the ranks of the Department
of Defence.

Stakeholder Engagement. Stakeholders with a legitimate interest in the Defence Secretariat should be able
to obtain a full, fair and honest account of the DOD’s performance and challenges. Society demands greater
transparency and accountability regarding reports and communications. Issues such as social responsibility,
environmental responsibility and sustainability may be considered to be addressed with stakeholders as part
of good corporate governance in the Defence Secretariat. The MOD&MV has also placed an emphasis on
this aspect in the Minister’s Strategic work session that convened in March 2010.

Corporate Governance. Corporate governance refers to the formal and informal relationships between the
DOD and its stakeholders and its formal system of accountability. The DOD embraces corporate governance
by aligning its own goals with those of its stakeholders/society, which impacts on the strategic direction of the
organisation. The DOD approach to corporate governance is re� ected and enforced by its values, actions
and standards. In terms of the King III Report, seven characteristics of good corporate governance have been
identi� ed and the DOD strives to adhere to such characteristics, which are:

�� Discipline.

�� Transparency.

�� Independence.

�� Accountability.

�� Responsibility.

�� Fairness.

�� Social responsibility.

Strengthening Regional and Continental Organisations. The DOD’s stance with international and regional
security organisations amongst others, the AU and SADC are to be clearly pronounced in the Department’s
Foreign Relations Strategy. The DOD supports these organisations by adequately representing the DOD and
the country at these organisations.

###### ORGANISATIONAL ENVIRONMENT

Explanatory Indicators. The introduction of Delivery Agreements with National Ministers by the President has
provided the basis of performance expectations and indicators to be purposed during the MTEF period. This
Strategic Plan re� ects performance indicators and targets with the responsible authority which will be pursued
during this period.

Organisational Structure. The approved organisational structure of the Defence Secretariat is re� ected in the
� gure below.

###### Figure 1: The Defence Secretariat as a Component of the DOD Macro-Structure


-----

###### THE DEFENCE SECRETARIAT STRATEGY MAP

As a whole, the DOD has made progress with the implementation of the Balanced Score Card (BSC) as a
performance management framework. Although the performance management system has not reached
maturity in the DOD, it has established a profound footing in the Department’s planning process.

The Defence Secretariat Strategy Map as a sub-set of the DOD Strategy map is re� ected in Figure 2. It is a
visual expression of the Defence Secretariat’s Strategic Plan which will form the basis for strategic planning.

The strategy maps will form the framework for the development of the annual performance agreements of
the Accounting Of� cer with the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans. Hence, when implemented, the
BSC will form the basis of the performance management system at organisational and individual levels within
the Defence Secretariat. These depicted strategy maps and scorecards will, in future, play a pivotal role in the
strategic planning and reporting process.

**Figure 2: Defence Secretariat Strategy Map**

###### DESCRIPTION OF THE STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS

The medium-term strategic planning process in the DOD is initiated annually with the Environmental Analysis
(EA).

The Executive Authority provides the ministerial direction in terms of key deliverables for the Medium Term
at the MOD and MV Strategic work session (January/February) and at the Annual Planning and Budgeting
Seminar (August).

A DOD Strategic Planning work session is held under the guidance of the Secretary for Defence and the
CSANDF with a view to translating the Minister’s guidelines and instructions for departmental purposes.

Thereafter, the Secretary for Defence and the Chief of the SANDF re� ne and cascade the guidelines received
further down during their individual work sessions. Functional guidelines are developed and Services and
Divisions are thus able to analyse the strategic implications on their areas of responsibility.

Divisions of the Secretariat develop their Annual Performance Plans in line with the Defence Secretariat
Strategic Plan and submit them during April of the following year. The plans are technically evaluated in May
in preparation for the Departmental Programme and Budget Evaluation Committee (DPBEC) in June, where
the individual Services make presentations and the Accounting Of� cer makes evaluations.

These revised plans are submitted in August and inform the corporate Strategic Plan. The Defence Secretariat
Strategic Plan is mapped out from the DOD Overarching Strategic Statement The Defence Secretariat SP is


-----

The approved document is submitted to the Auditor-General (AG) and National Treasury (NT) and the
Presidency in November for quality assurance and inputs regarding compliance with the regulatory framework.

The Accounting Of� cer presents the approved document to the Minister. The publication process then
commences and culminates in the tabling of the document in Parliament in March of every year. The
plans are executed at the start of the new � nancial year i.e. 1 April. The Defence Secretariat Strategic Plan
introduces the development of the Defence Secretariat Annual Performance Plan. The execution of the
Defence Secretariat’s Annual Performance Plan is monitored through Quarterly Reports (� rst three quarters)
and the Annual Report.

###### GOVERNMENT MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK (MTSF)

The Government’s Medium-Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) is a statement of intent that identi� es the
development challenges facing South Africa. This outlines the medium-term strategy for improvements in the
conditions of the lives of South Africans and for our enhanced contribution to the cause of building a better
Africa and a better world.

Government has agreed on 12 outcomes as a key focus of work between now and 2014. Each outcome has
a limited number of measurable outputs with targets. Each output is linked to a set of activities that will help
achieve the targets and contribute to the outcome. Each of the 12 outcomes has a delivery agreement that,
in most cases, involves all spheres of government and a range of partners outside government. Combined,
these agreements re� ect Government’s delivery and implementation plans for its foremost priorities.

The MTSF requires Government Departments to immediately develop their � ve-year strategic plans and budget
requirements, taking into account the applicable medium-term imperatives. These � ve-year strategic plans
should be aligned with the applicable ten priorities of Government which then translate to the 12 Government
MTSF outcomes as listed below:

�� MTSF Outcome 1. Improved quality basic education.

�� MTSF Outcome 2. A long and healthy life for all South Africans.

�� MTSF Outcome 3. All people in South Africa are and feel safe.

�� MTSF Outcome 4. Decent employment through inclusive economic growth.

�� MTSF Outcome 5. A skilled and capable workforce to support an inclusive growth path.

�� MTSF Outcome 6. An ef� cient, competitive and responsive economic infrastructure network.

�� MTSF Outcome 7. Vibrant, equitable, sustainable rural communities contributing towards food security
for all.

�� MTSF Outcome 8. Sustainable human settlements and improved quality of household life.

�� MTSF Outcome 9. A responsive, accountable, effective and ef� cient local government system.

�� MTSF Outcome 10. Environmental assets and natural resources that are well protected and continually
enhanced.

�� MTSF Outcome 11. Creating a better South Africa and contributing to a better and safer Africa in a
better world.

�� MTSF Outcome 12. An ef� cient, effective and development oriented public service and an empowered,
fair and inclusive citizenship.

Essentially, whilst the delivery of the Defence mandate � nds expression in selected MTSF Outcome areas,
focused effort has been adopted and delivered with regards to outcomes 2, 3, 5, 11 and 12.

The DOD will support the initiatives of Outcomes 2, 3, 5 and 12 while executing its secretariat and coordinating
role in terms of Outcome 11.

As such the trendable and non-trendable indicators which inform the Estimate of National Expenditure (ENE)
will re� ect on the information developed in this regard for the DOD and which includes the Defence Secretariat
indicators.


-----

###### THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE AND MILITARY VETERANS (MOD&MV) PRIORITIES

For the period ahead, the Minister has made a determination of matters considered important for the DOD to
pursue as strategic priorities. The execution of these strategic priorities will enhance the effective realisation of
the Defence mandate. Monitoring and evaluation of performance against these identi� ed strategic priorities
will test the extent to which the Defence function has been able to “do things differently and achieve more
with less”. The strategic priorities identi� ed are as follows:

�� Execution of the Border Safeguarding Function. The safeguarding of the borders of South Africa remains
one of the key functions of the SANDF. The phased in approach, adopted by the SANDF in undertaking
this function, will continue in FY2011/12 with the � nal phase completed in FY2012/13.

�� Establishment of the New Service Dispensation. The Defence Amendment Act, 22 of 2011, has been
enacted. As intended, the Defence Amendment Act has created a new service dispensation for the
SANDF members. In FY2011/12 the DOD shall focus on the implementation of the afore-mentioned
amendment in order to realise this dispensation. Consequential amendments to other Acts will also be
taken into account.

�� Enhancement of the SANDF’s Landward Defence Capabilities. In order to undertake all required missions,
the enhancement of the Landward Defence Capabilities is essential. For the Landward Defence
Capability to operate jointly with the Air Defence and Maritime Defence Capabilities, this enhancement
is considered a priority. The Landward Defence Capability has not enjoyed the advantage of being
part of the Strategic Defence Packages and is thus lacking technologically advanced Primary Mission
Equipment.

�� Maritime Security. The Defence and security of South Africa is inextricably linked to that of the region
and the continent. Being a littoral country, South Africa needs to have a balanced maritime capability
to effectively respond to arising maritime security threats affecting South Africa.

�� Job Creation. In support of the government initiative on job creation, the DOD plans to create job
opportunities in the following areas:

�� Filling of all 1 401 vacant funded positions in the DOD.
�� Recruitment of 5 700 young South Africans per year to the Military Skills Development System (MSDS).
�� Call up of 16 400 Defence Reserve members per year to undertake speci� c tasks over speci� c
periods of time.
�� The enhancement of the DOD Works Capability to create opportunities for people with technical
skills within the SANDF. This in turn will allow for the SANDF intakes to increase with the same number
of the SANDF members transferred to the DOD Works Capability.
�� Creation of job opportunities in the Defence Industry through approved DOD projects.

�� Enhancement of the SANDF’s Peacekeeping Capability (SANDF Deployability). The role of the SANDF
in promoting peace and security in the region and the continent necessitates the enhancement of the
SANDF’s peacekeeping capability that will include the SANDF’s Forward Deployment Capability.

�� National Youth Service. The implementation of the National Youth Service by using core Defence
capabilities to provide initial training to the youth prior to absorption into service delivery departments.

�� Revitalisation of the Reserves. As part of the One Force concept, the Reserves must be transformed and
revitalised to ful� l the various important Defence roles allocated to them.

�� Restructuring and Support of the Defence Industry. The restructuring should focus on Defence capability,
the interactive framework and function alignment in order to properly synchronise these with the
requirements and mandate of Defence. The emphasis should be on Governance, Risk Management,
Compliance and Accountability framework applicable within Defence Portfolio.

�� Department of Defence Works Capability. The state of the DOD facilities portfolio calls for the review of
the existing arrangements for the repair and maintenance of Defence facilities. The establishment of
the DOD Works Capability seeks to achieve an end state where the DOD will have an in-house capacity
that will ultimately assume the full responsibility of the Defence facilities repair and maintenance. The
DOD Works Capability will at the same time create job opportunities in the DOD, thus contributing to the
Government’s priority of job creation.

###### DOD POLICY PROPOSALS IN SUPPORT OF THE PRIORITIES OF THE MOD&MV

In support of the MOD&MV by the Defence Secretariat in the achievement of the above-mentioned ministerial
priorities, the Defence Secretariat will undertake the following planned policy proposals.

�� Development of a policy framework to form the basis of the Defence Amendment Act 22 of 2010 and
its implementation.

�� Development of the Defence Security Strategy contributing to the National Security Strategy. This
development will set the broad context for the development of a National Security strategy.

�� Defence contribution to the Crime Prevention Strategy of Government which will include support to the
JCPS Cluster priorities and requirements.

�� Finalisation of the DOD Border Management Strategy which includes Border Safeguarding.

�� The National Youth Service Conceptual and policy framework to set the norms and standards which
the DOD will follow in order to ensure the achievement of the targets (DOD representation) as set in the
delivery agreement of MTSF Outcome 5 namely “Skilled and capable workforce to support an inclusive
growth path”.

�� Establishment of research capacity in the Policy Division in order to inform policy development and
formulation. This will include international benchmarking and best practice analysis with other Defence
sectors.

�� Review of the White Paper on Defence Related Industries and development of a Defence Industry
Strategy to strategically position the Defence function to maximise the responsiveness of the Defence
Industry in supporting the delivery of the mandate.

�� Defence Related Public Entities Strategy to include the transformation of Armscor and proposals on the
Repositioning of Denel.

�� Assets and Facilities Management Policy Framework to enable the DOD to assume full responsibility for
the management and maintenance of facilities and � xed assets.

�� The repositioning of the DOD “Shared Staffs” functions to allow for the execution of the Defence
Secretariat and the SANDF distinct yet complimentary roles.

�� Development of an HR Development Policy and Skills Development Plan which will include the � nalisation
of a DOD Skills Audit.

�� Development of a Defence Fiscal and Defence Capability Framework.

�� An Armed Forces Day policy Framework that facilitates armed forces engagements with the national
citizenry is to be developed.

The Defence Secretariat will furthermore ensure that the Ministerial priorities are executed within the framework
of governance, risk, compliance and accountability management principles. The strategic resourcing of the
above-mentioned priorities will underpin Departmental funding initiatives if and where so required to ensure
full support to the Executive Authority.

###### DEFENCE DIPLOMACY INITIATIVES

In the ever-changing and unpredictable international environment, the use of military means for
diplomatic purposes is an established practice and norm in South Africa. South Africa’s Defence diplomacy
approximates a military adjunct to diplomacy rather than a distinct type of diplomacy. This is within the
strategic contextualisation of the DOD Defence policy which links the Defence function to foreign policy
and speci� cally emphasises strategic Defence co-operation through Defence diplomacy. This approach
points to the utilisation of military instruments, their non-coercive and co-operative use as a particular type
of diplomacy in a democratic South Africa. The DOD continues to employ Defence diplomacy foremost to
strengthen alliances against common challenges, strategic engagement with regional and global strategic
partners, encourage multilateral regional cooperation, support the democratic norms of civil-military relations
and assist states in the African continent in developing peacekeeping capabilities, security sector reform and
military professionalism.

While the primary focus has been on advancing the African Agenda, such an approach would be ineffective
if, given South Africa’s geo-strategic role in global affairs, the DOD does not extend its Defence diplomacy
beyond the continent. Thus the DOD through its implementing instrument, the SANDF, engages in a wide range
of activities with other friendly countries beyond the continent ie IBSA states individual EU member states and


-----

the conduct of strategic security dialogues that enable understanding of the common and partner concerns,
the identi� cation of areas of common interest, goodwill visits at the level of the Service Chiefs, professional
Defence and military expert exchanges, military training, combined exercises, reciprocal visits of warships,
observers for exercises, sports and adventure activities, disaster management and humanitarian assistance;
and cooperation in UN Peace Keeping Operations where necessary.

On the African continent, the underpinning thrust of pursuing Defence diplomacy is the recognition that South
Africa through its armed forces should project an image of a none aggressor and pursue con� dence and
collective security building initiatives. On the other hand, in the rest of the world, Defence relations continue
to be nurtured on the understanding that the DOD has become a member of the broader international
community and therefore has to develop its capacity to meet international standards and develop reliable
partnerships and sound relations with states that are in� uential in the global security environment.

At multilateral fora the DOD continues to focus energies and resource on the
achievement of the goals of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), the
Africa Renaissance objectives, strengthening the peace and security structures of the African Union
Commission, the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation (OPDSC), the interstate Defence
and Security Committee (ISDSC) and more pointedly the SADC Standby Force.

Efforts to deploy DOD personnel, both military and civilian, to strategic planning and management structures of
both the AU and SADC provides opportunities to export South Africa’s expertise, experience and knowledge. Apart
from advancing strategic engagement and fostering co- operative relationships with former or potential
adversaries, these Defence multilateral interactions also contribute to global and regional security by focusing
on co-operative security and advancing the institutionalisation of multilateralism at regional and sub-regional levels.

The DOD’s conduct of Defence diplomacy activities shall be viewed in the context of evolving foreign policy
priorities. This evolution acknowledges the country’s geo-strategic role since the advent of democracy as a
peace broker in the continent and an in� uential voice in policy determination on African issues. Admittedly,
the experiences of the past 16 years have compelled the government to rethink its strategy on international
engagements as evidenced by the formulation of a draft International Relations Strategy (IRS), the
conceptualisation of South Africa’s national interests and a conceptual framework for the identi� cation of
anchor states, all of which are in discussion in the International Co-operation Trade and Security (ICTS) cluster.
These policy changes are premised on the recognition of the opportunities and constraints facing South
Africa in its policy quest to contribute to the “creation of a better South Africa and contributing to a better
and safer Africa in a better world”. The natural response of the DOD would be to formulate a Defence Foreign
Relations Strategy buttressed by qualitative Defence diplomacy activities implementable annually.

###### INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN SUPPORT OF DOD PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

The DOD has, since 2005 developed a system (GEJIMA) that provides for a one-stop shop capturing of
performance information. The aforementioned system is managed by SITA and is utilised to conduct gap
and trend analysis with regards to performance information. Notwithstanding the challenges experienced
in certain domains within the Department of Defence with the local area networks, the Department is
determined to improve on the integrity, currency and reliability of the information. In cases of infrastructural
failures, capturing of data on the system as it relates to planning and performance data is undertaken at SITA
of� ces and thereafter the con� rmation of consolidated information is veri� ed by corporate strategic planners.

###### BALANCED SCORE CARD (BSC)

DOD has also developed one central system of performance information and targets which cascade into
the Department to ensure full alignment of effort and strategic direction at all levels. Reporting (quarterly and
annual) will now be fully aligned within the Department. Performance indicators are in the process of being
captured in terms of the Balanced Score Card (BSC) Cognos System in conjunction with SITA to enable the
DOD leadership to have visibility of the Departmental performance at all levels of the organisation. Roll-out
of BSC Cognos system is expected to be undertaken during 2011/12

###### RESOURCE CONSIDERATIONS

The following resource considerations were taken into account:

�� Expenditure Trends. The required funding requirements will increase in the short to medium term due to
increases in operating cost and a decline in the real value of the DOD budget vote.

�� Trends in the Numbers of Key Staff.  Loss of scarce skilled, knowledgeable and experienced personnel
continues to increase at an unacceptable rate.

�� Trends in the Supply of Key Inputs. Prepared forces are not suf� cient to satisfy ordered commitments
according to doctrine.

###### RISK MANAGEMENT

The DOD fully understands its statutory obligations in respect of Enterprise Risk Management. To that end,
the DOD will continue to enhance the risk management culture as contemplated in Section 38(1) (a) (i) of
the PFMA, (Act 01 of 1999) as amended. For the MTEF period (FY2011/12 to 2013/14), the DOD’s focus will
be on the roll-out of the approved DOD Enterprise Risk Management Framework and the enhancement of
the Enterprise Risk Architecture through the revision of the current risk management into planning, execution,
reporting and decision making.

The DOD is guided by the Public Sector Risk Management Framework 2008 which aims at supporting Institutions
to improving and sustain their performance by enhancing their systems of risk management.

The main Def Sec risks that could impact on the realisation of the outputs are tabulated below:

|Col1|Table 17: Defence Secretariat Risks|Col3|
|---|---|---|
||Enterprise Risk|Mitigation Strategy/Action|
||Full Compliance with Regulatory Framework. The DOD’s inability to fully comply with the regulatory framework requirements in respect of accounting and supply chain management.|Implementation of best practice supply chain and life cycle management. The acquisition of a single logistic information management system that is compliant with National Treasury and Auditor- General reporting requirements is being investigated. Until then, manual work-around and enhancements of legacy Defence logistics systems are being implemented.|
||The DOD Infrastructure and Facilities State of Disrepair. Continued deterioration of DOD infrastructure, facilities and equipment due to insufÀ cient funding. This situation constrains the DOD from executing its mandate effectively.|The veriÀ cation of the DOD asset portfolio is underway. The closer management of the DOD and Public Work Department’s respective rights and obligations on infrastructure and facilities maintenance. The DOD’s Internal maintenance/works capabilities being enhanced.|
|||Close monitoring of DOD projects.|
||The Non-Integration of DOD IT Systems. The non- integration of information systems (Finance, Supply Chain Management and Human Resources systems) and inadequate information technology network infrastructure resulting in negative impact on the DOD’s performance.|Analysis of all DOD IT systems for integration options. Seek National Treasury permission for the procurement of a single logistic management system that will allow for integration with other IFMS modules. The IFMS roll-out plan to be implemented to mitigate reliance on manual controls or other external systems.|

###### LINKS TO THE ICT (DEIS MASTER PLAN)

The DEIS Master Plan serves as the primary mechanism through which the DOD Information Strategy is realised.
It facilitates the strategic alignment between the information requirements of the DOD, on the one hand,
and the enabling of information solutions for DOD requirements on the other. The DEIS Master Plan therefore
directs and co-ordinates all ICS&S investments being made across the entire DOD, in order to ensure that the
DOD gains the best value from money spent on ICS&S in accordance with DOD Strategies, Plans and Priorities.

###### LINKS TO THE DOD HUMAN RESOURCES PLAN

The HR Plan ensures the most effective, ef� cient and economic HR composition of the right quantity, quality
at the right place and time to meet the strategic and operational objectives of the HR Division in the DOD.

The intention of this plan is to derive the delta between human resource supply and demand, and to propose
broad remedial strategies. Thus, essentially the plan depicts the “what”. This human resource plan has
undertaken an appreciation of both internal and external factors in order to delineate the delta between
human resource supply and demand. Through this process it has become readily apparent that focussed and
directed intervention is required in order to optimise, inter alia, the work-force composition, the attainment of
representivity, and the management of the personnel � ow.
