## Australia’s National Security: A Defence Update Foreword

This statement follows from the Government’s
consideration of Australia’s strategic interests two years
after the release of the Government’s Defence White
Paper, _Defence 2000: Our Future Defence Force. It_
recognises and sets out our responses to the salient
features in our changing security environment: the
emergence of new and more immediate threats from
terrorism and increased concerns
about the proliferation of
Weapons of Mass Destruction.
This statement also addresses our
continuing concerns about
developments in our immediate
region which have consequences
for Australia’s interests.

Since the horrific attacks of
September 2001 and October
2002, the Government has taken
steps to improve security, both
domestically and internationally.

_Senator the Hon Robert Hill_
_Minister for Defence_ These actions, which include

increased funding to intelligence
agencies, improved immigration controls, new Defence
capabilities to combat terrorism and improvements in
airline security, have quickly and effectively responded
to some of the major threats which have emerged.

This statement reviews the implications for Australia’s
defence posture. It concludes that while the principles
set out in the Defence White Paper remain sound, some
rebalancing of capability and expenditure will be

necessary to take account of changes in
Australia’s strategic environment. This
rebalancing will not fundamentally
alter the size, structure and roles of the
Defence Force, but it will inevitably
result in increased emphasis on


readiness and mobility, on
interoperability, on the development and
enhancement of important new
capabilities and, where sensible and
prudent, a reduced emphasis on
capabilities of less importance.

Minister for Defence

# Introduction

On releasing the 2000 Defence White
Paper, the Government undertook to
review our defence posture periodically
to ensure Australia continues to have
the appropriate mix of concepts,
capabilities and forces to meet new
challenges as they arise.

In just over two years since the Defence
White Paper was released, we are in no
doubt that the strategic landscape has
changed. The question for Defence is
whether the strategic tasks which have
underpinned Defence planning and
capability development - the defence of
Australia, operations in the immediate
neighbourhood, coalition operations
further afield and peacetime national
tasks - still provide a sufficiently firm
but flexible foundation for planning and
capability development, particularly
when addressing today’s threats.


What is already clear is that while the
Defence White Paper focused on the
development of capabilities for the
Defence of Australia and its National
Interests, two matters - terrorism and the
spread of Weapons of Mass Destruction,
including to terrorists - have emerged to
new prominence and create renewed
strategic uncertainty. In addition, some
adverse trends in our immediate
neighbourhood have continued.

The changed strategic and security
environment requires responses from a
number of government agencies. This
update considers mainly the challenges
posed by these changes in our strategic
environment and the implications for
the Australian Defence Force (ADF).

# A Changed Strategic Environment


While strategic competition between
nations has not gone away, major power
relations have generally become more
stable. The combination of US military
and economic might and converging
national priorities in eliminating
terrorism have increased the focus of the
major powers on cooperating to advance
shared interests. Russia and the United
States have put their Cold War
confrontation fully behind them with a
new framework for cooperation, based
on shared security interests and
reductions in their strategic nuclear
capabilities. Russia’s acceptance of
NATO enlargement, and its improved
relationships with the EU and other
Western treaty organisations, bode well
for continued stability across much of
the European continent.

regional stability could be greater if

breakdown within China.

The potential for conventional military
conflict remains in North Asia.
Notwithstanding progress towards
improved relations between North and
South Korea over recent years, the
Korean peninsula remains a potential

# Global Terrorism

### The Threat


The numerous recent terrorist attacks,
both pre and post September 2001,
demonstrate that terrorism is more than
a transitory phenomenon and is likely
to last for years. A critical strategic and
security dimension for Australia is that
militant extremists in Southeast Asia are
prepared to take up the Al Qaida cause
and that Australia has been identified as
a target.

Twenty-first century international
terrorism, as represented by Al Qaida
and its regional offshoots and affiliates,
differs from the terrorism of the
seventies and eighties. The new
terrorism is more strategically focused.
Its objective is to roll back Western
values, engagement and influence, and
to weaken and ultimately supplant
moderate Islamic governments.


demonstrated both willingness and
capability to inflict massive casualties
on civilian targets as a strategic end.

It is not just increased lethality that sets
Al Qaida apart, but that it draws on
personnel, money and equipment
organised across national borders. Since
September 2001, the international
community has made concerted efforts
to trace international terror networks
and identify the often-shifting alliances
and associations between them. There
is still much work to be done to find and
destroy terrorist leaders and cells, but
even though the main force of terrorist
attacks will often be felt at the national
or regional level, it is a global conflict. It
may eventually be seen as the most
violent phenomenon of the information
age. Al Qaida cells or operatives have
been identified in many countries across
the Middle East, Europe, Southeast Asia,
Africa and the United States, and it is
almost certain
that others have
yet to be found.

this is not a barrier to strategic effect. The
reality is that terrorism has gained
strategic advantage by turning the
strengths of tolerant and open societies
into weaknesses, and then striking at
vulnerable points to devastating effect.

### Australia’s Response

The Australian Government’s response
to international terrorism acknowledges
that the terrorist threat to Australians
and Australian interests has increased, both
domestically and overseas. The problem
cannot be managed by one country alone a targeted bilateral, regional and global
approach is also needed.


The coalition against terrorism - which
includes over 60 countries - is not just
about a shared sense of outrage, but also
about a shared sense of threat. This was
why the Australian Government
invoked the ANZUS Treaty immediately
after 11 September, for the first time in
the treaty’s 50-year history.

has lost its unhindered access to terrorist

actions in disrupting Al Qaida’s
operations in Afghanistan are just the
first step. Much remains to be done and
some further resort to military force is
likely to be needed.

The links between extremist

cooperation within the region. During

these arrangements was highlighted by
the joint investigation into the Bali

Indonesian police with support from the
Australian Federal Police.

The Australian Government is aware
that the majority of Muslims hold
moderate views and that they are no less
victims than other religious, ethnic or
national groups. Moderate Muslims face

to capture the heart of one of the world’s
great religions.

# The Threat of Weapons of Mass Destruction


There have been some post-Cold War
achievements in arms reduction, notably
to US and Russian nuclear stockpiles.
Yet the threat of proliferation, especially
among rogue states and terrorists,
remains a significant security challenge.

The end of Soviet communism and the
growth of globalisation created an
environment in which the proliferation
of nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons could flourish. WMD
precursors, many of which are dual-use,
are available on the world market, as is
technical expertise. The increased flow
of goods and information around the
world, one of the results of globalisation,
has made it easier to match WMD
demand with potential suppliers.
Biological and some chemical weapons
can be manufactured largely with dualuse equipment and materials.


Asia, is actively pursuing longer-range
ballistic missiles and a developing
nuclear weapon capability. Countries
like Iraq and North Korea see WMD as a
source of international leverage and
domestic legitimacy. The prospect that
Saddam Hussein might threaten to use
WMD against his enemies in the region
or supply WMD to terrorists reinforces
the international community’s efforts to
ensure Iraq is disarmed. Since September
2001 the world community has
become less tolerant of rogue states’
WMD ambitions.

The strategic consequences of WMD
proliferation are profound. If the
international community’s determination
to combat proliferation were to wane
and known rogue states were allowed
such weapons programmes, others
would try hard to emulate them.

threat. WMD allow weak states miscalculation to underestimate the

capability. In Afghanistan coalition
forces found clear evidence that Al Qaida
was actively pursuing biological,
chemical and nuclear weapons.

### A Layered Response

The international non-proliferation and
export control frameworks remain an
important first line of defence against
WMD. But the frameworks are only
credible and effective if they keep pace
with international developments and
are enforced. Australia is working hard
internationally to ensure this happens
but we recognise the aggressiveness of
determined proliferators. Therefore we
need a comprehensive response - a
layered defence.

Diplomacy is at the forefront.
Strengthening the various multi-lateral

states or terrorists, where peaceful
efforts have failed.

Collective responsibility for meeting
such threats to peace and security has
already emerged as a test for the
international community in the twentyfirst century. In deciding whether to
participate in such coalitions, the
Government will look to Australia’s
national security and the extent of our
global interests at stake.

For Australia, prevention of
WMD proliferation is a high priority
for our intelligence agencies and a
specific focus of their cooperation
with our intelligence partners. A
focus of our intelligence efforts in the
region is to monitor trade
in dual-use technologies. The Australian
Government is encouraging regional
governments to

has particular knowledge and skills to

Regiment has an important role in
supplementing State and Territory
capabilities to respond to a nuclear,
chemical, biological or radiological
incident.

The events of September 2001, North
Korea’s current brinkmanship, and
concerns over Iraq’s capabilities have
reinforced the resolve of the US to push
ahead with establishing an effective


missile defence system. Given the
prospect of the ADF operating more
often with our allies and friends in
regions under threat of WMD
delivered by ballistic missiles, Australia
supports the development of effective
missile defences to protect deployed
military units.

In relation to strategic missile defence,
the US is looking to involve its allies and
this will be an increasingly important
priority in the twenty-first century. We
are continuing our close dialogue with
the US on missile defence, particularly
given our close cooperation on Ballistic
Missile Early Warning.

# Implications for Defence


Compared to 2000, the significance of
the global strategic and security
environment for Australia’s defence and
security has become much more
evident. The global reach of terrorism
was demonstrated by the horrific
attacks in September 2001 and October
2002. The strategic environment of
2003 is being shaped by the threat of
terrorism and the determination to
counter it. This determination extends
as well to another major global threat the proliferation of WMD. In these
international endeavours, the US with its
combination of economic and military
might, is increasingly dominant. These
are some of the ways in which
Australia’s strategic environment is
different from what it was when the
2000 Defence White Paper was released

For the present, the prospect of a
conventional military attack on
Australian territory has diminished,
because of the stabilising effect of US
determination and willingness to act,
the reduction in major power tensions


and the increased deterrent effect of the
US-Australia alliance flowing from US
primacy. The implication is that for the
near term there is less likely to be a need
for ADF operations in defence of
Australia.

Southeast Asia and the South Pacific face
major challenges due to political
weakness, decline in governance,
difficulty in grappling with terrorism
and the economic effects of terrorism. If

of WMD or to otherwise enhance global
security and stability.
