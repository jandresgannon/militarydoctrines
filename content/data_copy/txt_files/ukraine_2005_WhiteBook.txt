###### THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE,
 SUPREME COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF
 OF THE ARMED FORCES
 OF UKRAINE

 PREFACE TO THE INTERNATIONAL
 EDITION OF THE UKRAINIAN WHITE BOOK
 ON DEFENCE POLICY

The Ukrainian Armed Forces have a long and proud tradition. The bravery and daring exploits
of our Cossack fighters are world famous and our forebears considered it an honour to serve
Ukraine through military service. They were also keenly aware that it was not just bravery and
weapons that could win the bitterest battles – strategy and clear thinking were paramount.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces today also face many challenges. Some of these, like an

Armed Forces bigger than the economy can sustain – despite years of continuous downsizing –
and huge stockpiles of outdated and dangerous munitions, are a legacy inherited from Soviet
times. Other challenges are more recent – the result of over a decade of financial and political
neglect by the political leadership of independent Ukraine. As a result, the same Armed Forces
that serve as a guarantee of national independence and sovereignty found themselves lacking
training and equipment to meet the most basic missions, lacking clear political guidance as to
priorities for their development, and suffering from ever-lower morale that undermined the
Armed Forces’ most precious resource – its people.

When I took the oath of the Presidency in January 2005, I committed myself to serving

the citizens of the independent and democratic Ukrainian state. To me, that oath requires that
I work to help Ukraine build a strong and modern Armed Forces that can defend Ukraine’s
sovereignty and promote our interests, both on their own and working together with the Armed
Forces of our country’s allies and partners.

It means that my administration has ensured that the Armed Forces have clear guidance on

missions, tasks, and future development that truly match the needs of our young democracy. It
means that we have provided a budget that allows the Armed Forces to dramatically increase
its training and begin capital investment in needed equipment. It means that we have put
people first, by giving those serving today the chance for real professional accomplishment
and growth, and those who have completed their service the respect and compensation that
they deserve. And finally, we have increased transparency and ensured civilian democratic
leadership of the Ministry of Defence to ensure that the Ukrainian Parliament and public are
informed and involved in efforts to rebuild the security of Ukraine and its people.

This White Book represents a part of that commitment to transparency. It is the first in an

annual series of open reports by the Ministry of Defence that are intended to reach the widest
possible audience: primarily the Ukrainian Parliament and people, but also our allies and partners
in the international community. It outlines the vision of the government for the Armed Forces
within the context of our national security and defence policy and provides honest explanations
of the challenges that we face and assessments of the progress that we are making.

I will leave the detailed reporting to Minister Grytsenko and his civilian and military team

at the Defence Ministry, who have done a superb job in putting together the contents of the
White Book. But I would like to highlight a few achievements in which I have been personally
involved.

Last year I said that the Minister of Defence of Ukraine would not be a serving general but

a civilian. This promise has become reality, and because of this we can say that Ukraine now
meets the standard of international democratic best practice.

In today’s complex international security environment, Ukraine needs a clear and credible

security and defence policy to play its part in the world community as a mature democratic


-----

state. The National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine made a considerable step in that
direction on December 9, 2005, with recommendations – which I have followed – to approve
the State Programme for Development of the Armed Forces and the draft Law on the Marginal
Strength of the Armed Forces. These documents provide clear strategic guidance for the
development of the Armed Forces for the next six years – through 2011.

This is a first, and a real accomplishment, but I am convinced that Ukraine needs this kind

of strategic clarity to spread beyond the Defence Ministry to other parts of the security sector.
To that purpose I ordered the establishment of a State Commission for the Reform of the Armed
Forces, Other Military Formations and the Defence Industry Complex of Ukraine.

My team is particularly concerned with the welfare of people in the Armed Forces. We

cannot expect people to risk their lives and commit themselves to a professional career unless we
demonstrate that they will be treated with fairness and respect. We have endeavoured to improve
conditions of service wherever possible during the last year; let me provide a few examples:

   - As early as February 2005, conscripts, cadets and pupils of military lyceums had a
three-fold increase in their unfairly low pay levels.

   - From April 2005, all officers have been receiving a pay incentive for special conditions of
service. In addition they now receive a decent severance pay upon transfer to the Reserves.

   - Throughout 2005, we worked to gradually equalise the difference in pensions for
servicemen retired in different years; as a result by January 1, 2006, all disproportions
in military pensions were eliminated, thereby remedying an injustice that had existed
for many years.

A year ago I promised that the term of conscript service in our Armed Forces would be

reduced to 12 months. This promise has now been delivered; in November 2005 the last soldier
called up for military service the previous autumn returned home. I also promised Ukrainian
citizens that by 2010 there would be a transition to fully professional Armed Forces, operating
on a contract basis. By Presidential decision, three experimental brigades have been chosen as
the first to be fully manned by contracted professional servicemen by the end of 2006. Work is
progressing rapidly on re-shaping the rest of the Armed Forces to meet the 2010 target date.

I promised to withdraw the Ukrainian peacekeepers from Iraq and they celebrated the New

Year amidst their families. We withdrew our contingent from Iraq in a responsible manner
according to a careful plan that was agreed in advance with our allies in the Coalition Forces.
As a result, our withdrawal was not detrimental to the coalition effort and we left with an
enviable record of achievement in prepared a fully trained brigade of the new Iraqi armed
forces. Ukraine can be rightfully proud of our soldiers – 28,000 since independence – who have
performed abroad in NATO-led operations like Kosovo and in UN-led efforts in places like
Liberia and Lebanon. In addition to their important peacekeeping missions, these servicemen
served as unofficial ambassadors from Ukraine to the international community.

In addition to improving welfare and conditions of service I assigned the Minister of

Defence the key objective of improving readiness, morale and professionalism. I am pleased
to note that training levels have increased considerably across all the branches of the Armed
Forces and that from 2006 all military units will be trained to perform clear and realistic
missions. This new approach has been positively received by the military.

A key element of efforts to provide increased professional opportunities is our continuing

close co-operation with NATO in the Partnership for Peace Programme and under the NATOUkraine Charter. I believe it is in Ukraine’s national interest that this co-operation continues
to deepen, even to the point of receiving the full protections, privileges, and responsibilities
provided by membership. Of course, such a step would require majority support amongst
Ukraine’s people, and I expect the Defence Ministry will continue to play an important role in
educating the public about the advantages to Ukraine’s security and development that would
result from NATO membership.

I wish to congratulate the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces on the rapid progress

that they have made in transforming our defence sector into a modern democratic model. We
still have some way to go but I am confident – as I am sure you will be after reading this White
Book – that we are on the right path to meet our objectives.

###### OPENING ADDRESS
 OF THE MINISTER
 OF DEFENCE OF UKRAINE

he strategic national direction set for Ukraine by the President and the Cabinet of Ministers on the
formation of the new government early in 2005 also provided clear direction for me as the new

## T

Minister of Defence. An important component in taking Ukraine forward in its national development
will be the reform and modernisation of the security and defence sectors and my intention is to build on
the good progress that has already been made on this task since independence. My duty as Minister of
Defence is to meet the strategic defence targets set by the President as Supreme Commander-in-Chief
and take forward the policy objectives for future development that have been agreed by the Cabinet
of Ministers. The aim is to create modern Armed Forces capable of safeguarding our sovereignty and
territorial integrity and able to protect our national interests both at home and abroad.

The publication of this White Book provides me with the opportunity to report openly and fully

on the progress that we are making and set out the agenda for the future. It is intended to publish a
White Book on an annual basis so as to provide a continuing narrative on the direction being taken
by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and the Armed Forces. It is vital that we build the widest possible
national consensus on defence policy at both the political level and in the minds of ordinary citizens.
It is my intention that the White Book will play an important part in this process of building national
consensus. This first volume will focus on explaining the provisions of the State Programme of the
Armed Forces of Ukraine Development for 2006-2011. In the longer term the introduction of this
annual publication will help establish a direct dialogue between society and the Armed Forces together
with a mechanism to inform the international community about defence policy in Ukraine. This will
help make it possible to fully meet society’s expectations of the Armed Forces and introduce proper
and timely adjustments to current and future plans. In addition the White Book contains information
that could assist Ukrainian citizens who are considering joining the Armed Forces to make a career of
serving their country. We need to attract the brightest and best of new generations to serve voluntarily
in the new professionally manned Armed Forces.

Since Ukraine gained independence our Armed Forces have undergone a continuing process of

complex reform and development. As a result I believe that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are now
reaching a high level of ability and professionalism and because of this they are well respected by
society when compared to many other state institutions. Armed Forces that are under effective civilian
control are an important part of a modern democracy and in this respect the defence sector is leading
the way in progressing the political commitment that has been made on the part of Ukraine towards
seeking NATO accession. To make that ambition a reality requires a renewed and invigorated final
level of defence reforms to ensure that we are fully aligned with internationally accepted standards.
I believe that 2006 will mark a significant new stage in defence reform and the development of the
Armed Forces. It will be the first year of the new State Programme of the Armed Forces of Ukraine
Development covering the medium term period 2006-2011. We will be able to place defence reform
within the context of an overall National Security Policy which is being prepared on the instruction
of the President.

The changes in the Armed Forces within the next six years will be of a systemic nature and

embrace a large spectrum of issues. In particular we need to eliminate the discrepancies between the
objectives being set and the resources and capabilities available to meet them. To achieve this we
will seek a balance between the requirements for operational capability and the conditions of service
for people serving in the Armed Forces. To illustrate the progress we are making in achieving this


-----

balance I would like to emphasise just a few of the key achievements of the past year and point out
some important objectives for the future, you will be able to read about these in more detail in the text
of the White Book:

**•** **Iraq. As mentioned in the President’s address we met the election pledge to withdraw our**
contingent from Iraq in a well planned manner. What was most important was the fact that the
Ukrainian contingent of 1,600 peacekeepers trained a total of 2,700 Iraqi servicemen – that
is a fully capable brigade of three battalions. Only the Ukrainian contingent has managed to
train from scratch an entire brigade for the armed forces of Iraq and this brigade has now been
transferred in a fully operational capacity to the zone of responsibility previously guarded by
Ukrainian peacekeepers.

**•** **Volunteer/Professional Forces. Three brigades – one from each service – were selected to**
be part of the thrust towards all volunteer professional manning. The target is to have these
brigades fully manned by volunteers by the end of 2006. These brigades are receiving priority
funding to ensure the success of the initiative and the lessons learnt will be extended across
the Armed Forces to help with meeting the strategic target of all volunteer professional Armed
Forces by 2010.

**•** **Training.** Professional training in the Armed Forces is essential for combat readiness and
the maintenance of morale and I am pleased to report that levels of training have increased
across all branches of the Armed Forces. To capitalise on this increased training command
and staff exercises are now being conducted under realistic scenarios with clear achievable
missions, this was not the case previously and this new approach has been well received by
the military.

**•** **Equipment and Logistics. We face considerable challenges in equipping our Armed Forces**
with the modern weapons platforms and equipment required to operate effectively particularly
for overseas deployments where state of the art communications are necessary to ensure the
integrity of command and control and provide real interoperability with partner nations.
We are restructuring our logistics and support areas to meet the new challenges and we are
rationalising the defence industrial complex to achieve balance and sustainability within our
growing market economy. It will be important for us to make new partnerships across the
international community in relation to the production of defence equipment and to broaden
our traditional customer base. More details on this issue are contained in Chapter 6 of the
White Book.

**•** **Defence Management.** It is essential in the modern environment to ensure that defence is
managed efficiently on behalf of the state and we are continuing to develop capacity within
the MOD and General Staff to deliver high quality management in areas such as strategic
planning; financial management; policy development and personnel management. All of these
functions have major projects running to achieve rapid progress in moving us to the forefront
of international standards. Our benchmark in many respects will be NATO compatibility and
we have a number of joint programmes running with NATO HQ and allied nations from
which we are receiving technical assistance and advice. Of particular note is the new Civilian
Professional Development Project which was launched at the High Level NATO/Ukraine
Consultations held in Vilnius in October 2005. We also have projects aimed at key issues
such as the creation of integrated planning and budgeting functions through capability based
planning and resource accounting. Details of these and other major co-operation programmes
are contained in the White Book and I would like to express my appreciation for the support
and co-operation that we are receiving on all levels from our NATO Partners.

As we take forward the six-year State Programme of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Development

for 2006-2011, I am confident that we are well placed for implementing all the key objectives that
the government has set for us. We face many challenges but we also have great opportunities. My
vision is to achieve fully professional Armed Forces that are well equipped and operating under
civilian democratic control. They will then be able to play an increasingly important role within
the world community on vital issues such as peacekeeping operations and maintaining regional and
international stability.

###### CHAPTER 1

##### GENERAL SUMMARY OF REFORM
 AND DEVELOPMENT
 OF THE ARMED FORCES
 2001-2005

he year 2005 saw the completion of the third stage of the Armed Forces development launched in

#### TJuly 2000 with the adoption of the State Programme of Reform and Development of the Armed

**Forces of Ukraine up to 2005 (hereinafter – State Programme up to 2005)*. Its main goal was to design**
a modern model for the Armed Forces based on the principle of defence sufficiency – optimal in strength,
mobile, well armed, adequately supplied and trained forces capable of performing their mission, and at
the same time not too burdensome for the state to maintain.

The Programme was intended, in particular, to improve the legislative framework for the operation

of the Armed Forces and their structure and control, reduce troop strength as well as weapons and
equipment, improve training of forces, and introduce the contractual principle of manning.

In December 2005 the implementation of the Programme was analysed at an enlarged session of the

Ministry of Defence Board. The session showed that the main measures had, on the whole, been carried
out, thereby creating sufficient foundation for the next stage of military reform.


LEGAL FRAMEWORK
FOR THE OPERATION
AND REFORM
OF THE ARMED
FORCES


The measures under the _State Programme up to 2005 required adequate legal_
framework, and that was achieved by the process of developing a legal basis for the
reforms.

In the period from 2001 to 2005 a total of 37 laws were adopted to launch the

transition to a three-service structure of the Armed Forces, man units and elements
with servicemen under contract, substantially reduce personnel strength, initiate
a system of defence planning, and improve the welfare support for demobilised
servicemen and members of their families (Figure 1.1; see also Annex 1).

In order to align the national system of defence planning with the standards of the

world’s leading nations and identify ways of further developing the Armed Forces,
a defence review was carried out in 2003-2004. Its results were published in the
**Strategic Defence Bulletin of Ukraine for the period up to 2015. The review was**
made with the methodological and consultative assistance of the experts from NATO
International Staff and Allied countries.

In June 2004, a Presidential Decree approved a new **Military Doctrine of**

**Ukraine, which** was to serve as the basis for drafting and making military-political
and military-strategic decisions as well as designing programmes and drawing up
plans in the military area. However, the political situation during that pre-election
period made it difficult to clearly define any doctrine for Ukraine’s military-political
orientation and thus considerably complicated the formulation of the missions of the
Armed Forces and the general view of its future model.



- Stage I of the Armed Forces development is dated 1991-1996, when the groundwork for the Armed Forces of Ukraine was laid; during Stage II –
1997-2000 – the State Programme of Building and Development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, initially designed for 1997-2005, was implemented.
However, in view of the changes that occurred in Ukraine and the world at the end of the 20th century, the Programme was modified, and in July 2000
another State Programme of Reform and Development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine up to 2005 was adopted. Its implementation became Stage III of
development of the Armed Forces. See Annex 1 for details.

IMPROVEMENT
OF THE STRUCTURE
AND CONTROL OF THE
ARMED FORCES


During 2001-2005 the structure of the Armed Forces and the system of its

control underwent substantial changes. In particular, during the reform a functional
approach to the development and employment of the Armed Forces was taken. The
Joint Rapid Reaction Forces, Main Defence Forces, and the Strategic Reserves will
be the functional structures of the Armed Forces. Priority will be given to activating
the Joint **Rapid Reaction Forces (see Chapter 3 for details).**

The disbandment of the 43 Missile Army in 2002 was an important step in

restructuring the Armed Forces. By taking this action Ukraine demonstrated to the
world community that it faithfully adhered to its international commitments as far as
its non-nuclear status was concerned.

In 2004 in accordance with the amendments introduced to the Law of Ukraine

_On the Armed Forces of Ukraine the transition from a four-service to a three-service_
structure was launched by merging the Air Force and the Air Defence Forces into a
**single Air Forces comprised of three Air Commands (“West”, “South” and “Centre”)**
and the Task Force “Crimea” (Figure 1.2).


-----

chapter 1


G E N E R A L S U M M A R Y O F R E F O R M

This enabled the Armed Forces to concentrate under a single command and

control all the capabilities to conduct air missions, improve the structure, combat
and numerical strength of the Armed Forces, bring their quantity of weapons and
equipment in conformity with their requirements, and raise the efficiency of logistic
support.

The Main Commands of the armed services were reformed into Armed Service

Commands, while their structure and strengths were streamlined accordingly. Of the
three Operational Commands two Commands remained (Western and Southern),
while Northern Operational Command was reformed into Territorial Directorate
“North”. The numerical strength of the departments of the Western and Southern
Operational Commands was cut down by 35%, while their status was reduced from
operational-strategic to operational level.

To optimise the system of operational (combat) and logistic support the Support

**Forces Command** was established to include over 50 units and elements of
operational, technical and logistic support.

On the whole, about 16,000 restructuring activities were carried out in 2001-2005

(Table 1.1).

DOWNSIZING


**The restructuring activities increased the efficiency of command and control**

**of forces, released substantial human and material resources, created the**
**necessary foundations for the next stage of the defence reform, and speeded up**
**the introduction of a modern model for the Armed Forces of Ukraine.**

During the past five years the overall authorised strength of the Armed Forces was
reduced by almost 171,000 positions – from about 416,000 in early 2001 to 245,000
in late 2005 (Figure 1.3) – of which 138 were positions of generals, about 29,300
officers, 27,100 praporschyks (warrant officers), 69,100 sergeants (soldiers), 8,800
cadets and 36,500 civilian employees.

However, the downsizing of the Armed Forces

(especially in 2003-2004) did not fully take into
account the pace of restructuring of their components,
the reduction in the stocks of weapons and equipment,
as well as the disposal of missiles and ammunition.
This created an imbalance in the ratio between
combat units and combat service support units
(Figure 1.4).

The situation was especially critical in early 2005

in the Land Forces where every combat unit had two
or three service support units, while to every piece of
combat materiel there were over two surplus pieces.

**Experts of the Ministry of Defence and the**

**General Staff believe that the process of the**

**accelerated and large-scale reduction of the Armed Forces at the cost of their**
**combat components has exhausted its possibilities. Further downsizing of the**
**Armed Forces will continue primarily through the reduction of the strength of**
**support units and bringing their structures into conformity with the assigned**
**missions.**

Despite the shortage of resources, a number of operational-tactical and staff exercises
were carried out in the period between 2001 and 2005 (Figure 1.5; for details about
the exercises in 2005 see Chapter 5 and Annex 2).

**The force training activities of the past five years have not significantly**

THE ARMED FORCES

GENERAL SUMMARY
OF THE 2001-2005
DEFENCE REFORM


Within the scope of implementation of the State Programme up to 2005, the Armed Forces
discarded over 2,000 pieces of obsolete and inoperable weapons and equipment, including
over 870 tanks, about 380 armoured combat vehicles, over 289 artillery systems (calibre
over 100 mm), 299 combat aircraft, 58 helicopters and 28 ships (Figure 1.6), since their
repair or modernisation was decided to be economically unsustainable. Additionally,

56,300 pieces of surplus weapons and equipment as well as
97,800 tons of missiles and ammunition have been disposed
of. However, these results are far from satisfactory as the
existing stocks of materiel exceed the real requirements of
the Armed Forces by anything between 20% and 120%, and
even more in certain categories.

The introduction of a single military and technical

policy required the development of the State Programme
**of Development of Weapons and Equipment up to**
**2015, approved with a Presidential Decree. However,**
it failed to reach a balance between the requirements in
modernising the Armed Forces equipment and the real
funding capacity of the state, for which reason the goals
under the Programme proved to be unachievable.

**In 2001-2005, substantial results were achieved in reducing surplus stocks**

**of armaments, equipment, missiles and ammunition. The military units which**
**determine the combat potential of the Armed Forces are mostly equipped with**
**combat-effective weapons. At the same time, modernisation and procurement of**
**new armaments remains a problematic issue.**

The period of 2001-2005 marked the onset of manning the Armed Forces with
contracted servicemen. The decision was made for the Armed Forces to completely
switch over to contractual

military service from 2015.
Compared with the changes in
the overall force strength, the
growth of contracted servicemen
in 2001-2005 was, on the whole,
positive (Figure 1.7).

**The changes in the system**

**of manning the Armed Forces**
**promoted the development and**
**consolidation of the professional**
**force component and positively**
**influenced combat readiness of**
**units and formations.**


**The implementation of the State Programme of Reform and Development of**
**the Armed Forces of Ukraine up to 2005 has laid down a proper foundation for**
**further development of the Armed Forces.**

However, the projected qualitative modernisation of the Armed Forces has

**not been fully achieved. This was due to the fact that over a long period of time**
Ukraine lacked a clearly defined military-political policy from which the missions of
the Armed Forces could be determined. In addition, there was no well-coordinated
mechanism for the solution of development problems. The chronic shortage of
financial resources added significantly to the problem.

**Despite tremendous efforts and some positive results, the efficiency of the**

**military reform carried out in 2001-2005 was lower than had been planned. In quite**
**a few areas, the goals of the Programme were not fully achieved, which has hindered**
**the pace of Armed Forces reform and will require radical changes in the future**
**implementation of military reform plans in order to achieve full effectiveness.**

new and more decisive approach to defence problems was required on the part of the President,

#### A Parliament, Government and central executive bodies. This would enable the more efficient use of

the previous stage of Armed Forces reform by removing its shortcomings and achieving a proper pace
for military reforms.


PRIORITY MEASURES
OF NEW POLITICAL
LEADERSHIP


Such an approach was proposed and introduced in 2005, while the resulting decisions
made it possible to define more clearly the place and role of the Armed Forces in the
national security system.

**Far-reaching amendments were introduced to the mechanisms of formulating**

**strategic goals and priorities for the development of the Armed Forces and this**

enabled the drafting of policy documents with specific
timeframes for mission performance and adequate
resource support.

**Priority objectives**

(1) The new political leadership clearly defined

**Ukraine’s military-political orientation and declared**
accession to NATO as the final goal of the country’s
Euro-Atlantic integration. One of the top priorities
of both foreign and national policy was identified
as the profound reform of national defence, based
on European standards and taking into account real
economic and social problems in Ukrainian society,
and particularly, in the military environment.

(2) There has been a transition to appointing

predominantly civilian employees to the main managerial offices of the Ministry of
Defence in line with the principles of democratic civilian control over the military
organisation of the state (see Information on Leadership of Ministry of Defence
and the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine). To date, civilian employees

account for about 80% of the overall staff of the
Ministry’s Central Office.

(3) A number of key **initiatives** have been

introduced **by the most senior military-political**
**leadership** through the programmes of the Cabinet
of Ministers of Ukraine, the Ministry of Defence, and
other structures involved in defence activities. The
initiatives concerned, _first, reduction of the period_
of active conscript service, and, _second, complete_
transition of the Armed Forces to the contractual
principle of manning. These initiatives also introduced
realistic threat assessment, determination of missions
(see Annex 3), resource potential and restrictions and
identified priorities in the development of weapons and
equipment.

(4) Within a short period of time a number of important decisions were made and

implemented without unnecessary delay in co-ordination procedures and keeping
cost to the minimum, namely:

**• a proper level of state budget appropriations for 2005 was ensured with**

**the support of the President of Ukraine for welfare and financial support**
**of servicemen;**

**• a more logical pace of reductions in the number of combat units of the**

**Armed Forces was introduced. According to expert assessment of the**
Ministry of Defence and the General Staff, the combat component of the
Armed Forces has practically exhausted its reduction potential, so further
reductions are only possible through the disbanding of arsenals, bases and
depots. According to the Law of Ukraine On the Strength of the Armed Forces
_of Ukraine for 2005, only 40,000 personnel were to be released (from 285,000_
to 245,000) instead of the planned reduction by 75,000-85,000 personnel


**Figure 2.1. Decree of the President of Ukraine**


as stipulated in the Strategic Defence
Bulletin for the period till 2015;

  - in pursuance of the Presidential

Programme Ten Steps to Meet the People,
**the** **length of military conscript service**
**was reduced, as stipulated in the 2005**
Law On Introducing Amendments to the
_Law of Ukraine “On Universal Military_
_Duty and Military Service”. Now active_
service lasts only twelve months (18
months on ships, vessels and in the
coastal combat support units of the Naval
Forces), and nine months for University
graduates. The transition to reduced
active service did not have any negative
effect on the level of combat readiness
nor did it weaken the combat efficiency
of the forces. **Within a short period**
**of time the conscription system was**
**changed, as well as the curricula at the**
**training centres, and the organisation**
**of daily routine. Objective measurement**
of military efficiency has proved the
decision to adopt contractual manning to
be fully justified.

**• the deadline for a complete**

**transition to contractual manning was**
**moved from 2015 to late 2010. By order**
of the President, three pilot projects
were launched at three brigades, one for
each armed service, and additionally, the
Large Amphibious Ship “K.Olshansky”;
by the end of 2006 these units will be
fully manned by contracted servicemen.
Adequate resources were allocated to
support this initiative (Figure 2.1);

**increase the pay for specific categories of servicemen (see Annex 4 for details). It**
will be raised threefold for sergeants, conscript service soldiers and sailors, cadets
and pupils of military lyceums. As of April 2005 money incentives of UAH 100-300
were introduced for contracted sergeants, soldiers and sailors serving in positions
that require higher combat readiness status, i.e., commanders of tanks and combat
vehicles, signalmen, drivers, and others. This measure had a positive effect on the
prestige of military service;

**• new regulations relating to the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff**

**were developed to identify their tasks and functions more clearly. In the new**
structure of the Ministry of Defence (Figure 2.2), the number of command
levels was reduced, thereby simplifying decision-making and improving the
interaction between the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff;

**•** **in order to ease the pressure on the State Budget, the Ministry of Defence**
**has dramatically revised the procedure for providing the Armed Forces with**
**mobilisation resources – human, logistical, weapons and equipment. As a result,**
the number of officers required decreased and budget appropriations were cut
for reserve officer training programmes covering approximately 6,000 students
per year at military training departments of civilian educational institutions.
Proposals were also put forward to review mobilization objectives which had
been burdening the country’s economy and had not been revised for many years.

**• combat training has been intensified. The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine**

approved the decision to allocate for training an additional sum of UAH 100
million derived from the sale of surplus weapons and equipment. This decision
coupled with the enhanced responsibility of commanders has significantly

improved the quality and increased the efficiency of
force combat training (see Chapter 4);

**• service conditions for officers have been**

**regulated.** Psychological pressures were created in
many units by the unsatisfactory working conditions
for officers caused by the constant long hours as a
result of which officers were deprived of a normal
family life and rest. The practice of engaging officers
in constantly supervising the order and discipline in
units was terminated, with exception of commanders
and duty officers. Thousands of officers used to be
regularly given such unnecessary tasks before. The
practice of holding meetings outside duty hours except
in emergencies was also forbidden.

**• a mechanism was developed and introduced to overcome corruption and**

**other negative practices in the Armed Forces.** A sizable amount of orders and
contractual documents on the transfer and sales of military property were suspended
and amendments were introduced to the state procurement procedures in order to
enhance the fight against corruption and control of the use of budgetary funds. The
Deputy Minister of Defence and the Chief of the General Staff now head Bidding
Committees.

On the whole, the high-priority decisions and efforts of the Ministry of Defence

laid the groundwork for further large-scale changes in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To translate them into reality, it is necessary to formulate a long-term strategy of
development of the Armed Forces, secure a sufficient amount of resources and
target their use. It is also necessary to sometimes make harsh unpopular political
decisions.


IDENTIFYING THE
PROSPECTS FOR
DEVELOPMENT OF
THE ARMED FORCES


The Ministry of Defence has abandoned the practice of developing one-year defence
plans and adopted a programme-targeted method of strategic planning according to
NATO standards. The basic documents that identify the strategic goals and objectives
for building modern and combat capable Armed Forces have been adopted or are
being drafted (The State Programme of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Development
for 2006-2011, The State Programme for Development of Weapons and Equipment
for the Armed Forces of Ukraine for the period till 2009, the Strategy of Military
Security of Ukraine).

One such basic document is the State Programme

**of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Development for**
**2006-2011 (hereinafter – the** _State Programme for_
_2006-2011). It was designed on the basis of President_
Yuschenko’s Programme Ten Steps to Meet the People,
the Action Programme of the Cabinet of Ministers,
_Meeting the People, and the Strategic Defence Bulletin_
_of Ukraine up to 2015 which identify the main targets_
for socio-economic development and the next stage of
military reform in Ukraine.

The Programme has been designed by experts of

the Verkhovna Rada, the Cabinet of Ministers, the
Central Office of the National Security and Defence
Council, the Ministry of Defence, and other central
executive agencies, as well as the General Staff and
individual services of the Armed Forces. Experts

most importantly, the level of available resources.

development. On those grounds, with due regard to the
availability of resources, the missions of the Armed
Forces were substantiated and clearly identified. This
meant that the Armed Forces were fully prepared to
perform their stipulated role.

Previously only the general objectives of protecting

the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine had
been identified as the primary task of the Armed Forces.
Now a more detailed list of objectives has been drawn
up relating to a whole range of scenarios, with clearly
set timeframes for mission training and the required
capabilities. The comparative analysis of objectives
in the _State Programme up to 2005 and the new_ _State_
_Programme for 2006-2011 can be found in Annex 3._

The underlying foundations for achieving the

assigned objectives are the **principles of multi-**
**functional force employment and specialisation of**
**training.** Most of the formations, units and elements
will be trained to perform several missions and they
will be equipped with corresponding weapons and
equipment. Certain units, mostly special-purpose ones,
will be exclusively committed to special missions.
Given such an allotment of efforts, every commander
will know what mission his unit or element will
be charged with and how to perform it in cases of
conflicts, terrorist threats, emergencies, and the like.

Such an approach makes it possible to effectively plan the training of forces,

provide them with corresponding weapons and resources, and check their readiness
for designated missions.

On the whole, the introduction by the new Ministry of Defence of the programme

and objective methods for strategic planning has resulted in the following:

**• first, better alignment of the structure and combat strength of the Armed**

Forces based on studies of possible variants of conflict development and force
engagement scenarios;

**• second, improvements to the current system of combat and mobilisation**

training of the Armed Forces and their preparation for
real force engagement conditions;

**• third, significant reduction of mobilisation**

requirements, e.g., commissioned weapons and
equipment have been reduced by three times, materiel
by three to four times, human resources by four times,
the number of draftees has been reduced by 2.5 to 3.0
times, over 1,500 categories of materiel have been
removed from the defence commission list, and the
state requirement to train reserve officers at the cost of
the State Budget has been cancelled.

The main areas for development of the Armed

Forces, as set out in the _State Programme for 2006-_
_2011, provide solutions for the systemic problems_

inherent in defence reform which could not be effectively resolved during the
preceding years (Table 2.1).

**The priority efforts of the Ministry of Defence laid down the necessary**

**foundations for accelerating the pace of military reform and making it**
**successful. The negative trends in military reform have been removed, and**
**development programme for the Armed Forces has been intensified.**

**The new State Programme for Development of the Armed Forces for 2006-**

**2011 is realistic from the viewpoint of the existing and potential threats,**
**the missions of the Armed Forces, and resource capacities of the state. Its**
**implementation should lead to a gradual build up of modern Armed Forces in**
**Ukraine, well adapted to the new security challenges.**

Described below are the main measures to improve the system of command and

control, training, manning, logistics, supply of weapons and equipment for the forces,
economic activities, development of the humanitarian sphere, as well as international
activities and funding of the Armed Forces.

GENERAL
DESCRIPTION OF
THE STRUCTURE
AND PERSONNEL
STRENGTH OF THE
ARMED FORCES


The organisational structure of the Armed Forces is set forth in the _Law of_
_Ukraine on Introduction of Amendments to Article 3 of the Law of Ukraine on the_
_Armed Forces of Ukraine,_ _2004. The organisational structure of the Armed Forces_
comprises the General Staff, three armed services – the Land Forces, the Air Forces,
the Naval Forces, and formations, forces, units, military educational institutions,
establishments and organisations that do not come under direct control of the Armed
Forces (Figure 3.1).

**Functionally the Armed Forces consist of the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces, the**

Main Defence Forces and the Strategic Reserves (Figure 3.2).


-----

chapter 3


ARMED FOR C E S O F U K R A I N E

The personnel strength of the Armed Forces is

determined by Ukrainian legislation. This legislation is
passed by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine annually.

By the end of 2005 **the total personnel strength**

**of the Armed Forces** comprised 245,000 personnel,
including 180,000 military servicemen. In accordance
with figures indicated in the _State Programme up to_
_2005, by the end of 2005 the personnel strength was to_
comprise 375,000 and 295,000 respectively.

The ratio of armed services’ personnel is mission
driven and determined by the scope of missions to be
performed by the respective forces. The personnel ratio
is as follows: Land Forces – up to 40%; Air Forces – up
to 24%; Naval Forces – up to 8%; military command
and control elements, formations, military educational
institutions, establishments and organisations that do
not belong to the armed services of the Armed Forces
– up to 28%. Differences between the priorities set for
other nations’ armed services and Ukraine account for
the variation in ratios between the figures of Ukraine and
other countries (Figure 3.3).

The ratio between the Armed Forces personnel

**strength and the general Ukrainian civilian population**
is similar to the figures common amongst NATO nations
(Figure 3.4).

1. Turkey 0.81%

2. France 0.55%

3. Ukraine 0.52%

4. Germany 0.46%

5. Poland 0.39%

By estimates of the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff, the high rate of

personnel reduction undertaken recently is not feasible for the next stage of the
Armed Forces transformation process. Therefore, the State Programme for 2006_2011 makes provisions for reduction of approximately 102,000 authorized positions_
during the next six-year period (Figure 3.5).

This rate of downsizing of the Armed Forces is well-grounded and based upon

the following:

              - realistic estimates for reduction and upgrading of equipment, disposal of

excessive stockpiles of weapons, missiles and ammunition;

              - the necessity to comply with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation

pertaining to state guarantees for the welfare support of servicemen, retired
servicemen and their family members;

               - the need to relate the reduction of military educa­
tional institutions, including military training depart­
ments, training centres, junior specialist schools, and
training ranges to the training timeline of cadets who
were enrolled in the previous 4-5 years;

               - economic capacity of the state;

               - alignment with international and European standards.

**Thus, the reduction in personnel strength of**

**the Armed Forces will be more controlled and**
**fully resourced in the future. Downsizing will be**
**facilitated, in particular, by the transition of the**
**Ministry of Defence to programme-based and**
**target-driven planning methods. As a result the**
**personnel strength of the Armed Forces will be**
**identified for the full period of the State Programme**
_for 2006-2011, with possible annual adjustments._

**This approach will provide an opportunity**

**to plan administrative activities in advance, develop detailed plans for officer**
**transfer, allocate required resources for these processes, and introduce changes in**
**a timely manner. The National Security and Defence Committee of the Verkhovna**
**Rada, the Government, and the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine**
**support the position of the Ministry of Defence in this policy.**

The Land Forces are the largest armed service within the Armed Forces. Due to the
wide range of their assigned missions and scope of their functions they participate in
the execution of the entire mission spectrum assigned to the Armed Forces.

The Land Forces consist of the mechanized infantry, armour, airborne, missile

and artillery troops, army aviation and air defence troops of the Land Forces
(Figure 3.6).

By the end of 2005 the personnel strength of the Land Forces comprises

approximately 97,000 personnel, including 78,000 servicemen. They are supplied
with 100% of their major weapons and equipment requirements. The supply level of
other major materiels (food, fuel etc.) is at 70-75%. The organisational structure and
combat strength of the Land Forces are shown in Figure 3.7.

In 2006 the disbandment of two Operational Commands will begin. In the

previous plans this disbandment was planned for after 2010. It is no longer necessary
to maintain their role as operational strategic formations responsible for operational
tasks, mobilisation missions, and territorial defence missions. The equipment,
logistic, medical and other support they used to provide to the forces located on their
territory is no longer required.

Overall, in 2006 one mechanised infantry brigade, four regiments and a significant

number of arsenals, bases and depots of the Land Forces will be disbanded.

By the end of 2011 the Land Forces will comprise 16 brigades (Figure 3.8); the

personnel strength will be approximately 60,000, including 52,000 servicemen.

The Air Forces are a new service within the Armed Forces. It was established as

a result of the Air Force and Air Defence troops’ merger accomplished in May 2005.
It allowed the Armed Forces to transit to the modern three-service structure.

The Air Forces are the most mobile service within the Armed Forces. Its mission

is to defend strategic state facilities and military formations against enemy air strikes
and to strike enemy forces and facilities. It will also land airborne units, airlift troops
or cargoes and perform special missions.

The Air Forces consist of the following branches: bomber aviation, fighter

aviation, ground attack aviation, reconnaissance aviation, transport aviation, air
defence and radar troops (Figure 3.9).

At the end of 2005 the personnel strength of the Air Forces is approximately

59,000, including 50,000 servicemen. The Air Forces are equipped with all the major
aviation weapons and equipment that they require. However the condition of some of
the equipment is considered unsatisfactory due to inadequate rates of modernisation.
The organisational structure of the Air Forces is shown in Figure 3.10.

Beginning from 2006, it is planned to establish an Automated Command and

Control System for aviation and air defence units within the Air Forces and to develop

a Common Automated Radar Field within
the automated command and control system,
which will correspond to NATO standards.

As soon as the Automated Command and

Control (C2) System is operational, an Air
Operations Centre will be established along
with C2 and Warning Centres. The ground
attack, fighter, bomber and reconnaissance
aircraft brigades will be reorganised into
tactical aviation brigades. Additionally, the
air defence units will also adopt a brigade
structure.

By the end of 2011, it is planned to

have 16 brigades within the Air Forces
(Figure 3.11); the personnel strength will be
approximately 35,000 personnel, including
32,000 servicemen.

Naval Forces are fully provided with major weapon systems and equipment. However,
only a quarter of the systems are currently of a modern type. The organisational
structure of the Naval Forces is shown in Figure 3.13.

By the end of 2011, it is planned to have four brigades, two naval bases and

four divisions within the Naval Forces (Figure 3.14). The personnel strength will be
approximately 11,000 personnel, including 9,000 servicemen. The Naval Forces will
have 15 combat ships.

**The development of the Armed Forces is determined by the needs of support**

**and maintenance, day-to-day overall support to training, and the required**
**combat readiness of the forces. The armed services of the Armed Forces are the**
**backbone for the development of combined formations which will be assigned**
**to missions in response to scenarios resulting from potential conflicts.**


FUNCTIONAL
COMPONENTS OF
THE ARMED FORCES


The Joint Rapid Reaction Forces (JRRF) are a combined operational formation.
Their mission is to provide immediate response to threats and armed conflicts in
order to contain, neutralise and prevent the escalation of conflicts to wars. The JRRF
comprise Land, Air and Naval components.

The JRRF units are manned at approximately 95% level (including 30% contracted

servicemen on average). They are provided with weapons and equipment resulting in
average resource levels of 95-100%. The level of aviation equipment readiness needs
to be improved and some unit materiel support levels should be increased.

The **Main Defence Forces** are the most numerous functional component of

the Armed Forces. Their mission is to reinforce the JRRF during the time they are

containing small-scale armed conflicts in threat areas as well as to deploy units
within a determined timeline in case of a large-scale armed conflict. In peacetime
the Main Defence Forces will maintain a lower level of combat readiness, when
compared with the JRRF, and will require more time to deploy.

The Main Defence Forces consist of the military command and control elements,

formations and units from the Land Forces, the Air Forces and the Naval Forces.

The mission of the Strategic Reserves is to reinforce the Main Defence Forces.

They can be deployed prior to or during a major armed conflict.

This functional division in the Armed Forces does not yet fully correspond to

the newly assigned missions and possible scenarios for force engagement (See
Chapter 2, Figure 2.1). As a result the Ministry of Defence has initiated changes
to the composition and personnel strength of the functional components. Within
the JRRF and Main Defence Forces some components will be separated according
to their assigned missions and their different manning methods, weapons and
equipment, as well as different timelines required to generate an alert status of their
forces. The Strategic Reserves will be generally excluded from the main functional
components.

Beginning from 2006, the JRRF and Main Defence Forces will have two

components each. The JRRF will have the _Immediate Reaction Forces_ and _Rapid_
_Reaction Forces._ The Main Defence Forces will have the _Augmentation Forces_
and _Stabilisation Forces. Their personnel strength and missions are described in_
Figure 3.15.

Special attention will be focused on accelerated development of the JRRF. In

particular, during 2006-2011, it is planned to allocate for their needs UAH 23.3
billion with UAH 15.8 billion designated for the Main Defence Forces. The backbone
of the JRRF will consist of the multifunctional air mobile and airborne units that
are equipped with medium and light equipment. They will be primarily trained for
participation in peacekeeping operations, and they will also be engaged in counterterrorism operations, and natural and man-made emergency relief operations.

**The development of the Armed Forces functional components will be**

**determined by the need to increase the operational capabilities of the forces.**
**Considering the changes to be introduced in 2006, their structure will correspond**
**to missions and objectives (scenarios) of combined force engagement, and it will**
**support Ukraine’s aim to become a NATO member.**

**Generally, the State Programme for 2006-2011 sets forth realistic tasks for optimis­**

**ing the quantitative and qualitative profiles of the Armed Forces and their structural**
**reorganisation. The Programme aims at establishing Ukrainian Armed Forces that**
**will be combat capable, mobile, small in number and economically sustainable.**


COMMAND
AND CONTROL OF
THE ARMED FORCES


The President of Ukraine exercises military and political command and control of
the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He is the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed
Forces of Ukraine. The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, the Cabinet of Ministers of
Ukraine, the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, and the Ministry
of Defence of Ukraine exercise military and political command and control of the
Armed Forces of Ukraine within the established limits of their authority.

The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine exercises military and political command

and control of the Armed Forces. On the strategic level authority is exercised jointly
by the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Responsibilities for direct operational control of the Armed Forces rest with the Chief
of the General Staff. He is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

**Command and Control System of the Armed Forces**

As stated above, the command and control system of the Armed Forces has a fivelevel structure: the General Staff – armed service of the Armed Forces – Operational
Command – Army Corps (Air Command) – formation or unit, as described in
Figure 3.16.

This system of operational and administrative control basically ensures reliable

command and control of the forces during routine activities, preparation for and
control of military operations if required and tactical or special warfare operations.

However, one of its principal elements, i.e. operational command and control,

is not fully ready to efficiently control combined formations (force groupings) and
peacekeeping contingents. In this respect, _The State Programme for 2006-2011_

outlines methods for accelerated improvement of the command and control system
of the Armed Forces during 2006-2008. The first step is to change management
philosophy by focusing on the control of the combined formations (force groupings)
both in Ukraine and other regions of the world during combined operations conducted
jointly with partner nation forces.

Structurally, this will require a phased transition from the current five-level operational

control system to a three-level operational control system: the General Staff – Joint
Operational Command – Combined Formation, Army Corps, and Air Command.

As a result, during 2006 a new element of operational command and control – a

**Joint Operational Command –** will be established. It will have the C2 structure
common to many of the military systems of NATO countries (Germany, the
Netherlands, Poland, UK etc.). In November 2005, in accordance with a Directive
issued by the Minister of Defence, the General Staff commenced establishing the
Joint Operational Command. In 2006 the Joint Operational Command will assume
the responsibility for planning, command and control of peacekeeping operations.
The planning and decision-making procedures used by this control element will fully
correspond to the procedures of NATO nations.

In 2006 the command and control elements of operational commands will be

released from responsibilities for operational planning of force engagement. In order
to accelerate this process the General Staff has planned to place the command and
control elements of two army corps, along with their respective troops, under direct
control of the Land Forces Command during 2006.

In 2008 the **Armed** **Service Commands** will be reorganised to **Directorates.**

They will be mainly responsible for training their respective forces. The overall
reduction of personnel strength in the Commands of the three armed services will
total over 1,000 authorised positions.

It is also planned to reorganise the Air Commands into C2 and Warning Centres

**of the Armed Forces. They will be linked by the Single Automated Command and**
Control System and, possibly, in the future – to the Unified NATO Warning System.

After the implementation of the above mentioned package of measures, the

operational control system will adopt the three-level structure (Figure 3.17).

**Figure 3.18. Structure of Joint Support Forces,**
_by the end of 2006_


**Beginning from 2008, the Joint Operational**

**Command will provide operational planning; the**
**territorial defence planning will be provided by the**
**Territorial Directorates established on the basis of**
**the Operational Commands.**

After the implementation of the aforementioned

decisions, the command and control elements of
the operational commands will not be responsible
for force combat and mobilisation readiness; they
will instead focus their efforts on disbandment of
formations and units, disposing of the infrastructure
of disbanded military garrisons, management of
disposal of excessive stocks of weapons, equipment,
missiles or rockets, ammunitions, and other assets
as specified by _the_ _State Programme for 2006-2011._
Personnel strength of these command and control
elements will be reduced by 300-350 officer positions
(approximately 30-40% of the authorized strength),
the number and personnel strength of support units
responsible for supporting the departments of the
operational commands will also be minimized.

The **Joint** **Support Forces** will be responsible for

logistic system management within the Armed Forces.
The Joint Support Forces will be established in 2006 on
the basis of the Support Forces Command (Figure 3.18).

Changes in the Armed Forces command and control

system have been carefully calculated, and they will be
implemented in a well-planned and consistent manner.
They will not affect negatively the force combat readi­
ness and efficiency of command and control. The effec­
tiveness of this approach was proved by the structural
changes implemented in 2005. For example, the dis­
bandment of the Northern Operational Command based
in the city of Chernihiv took place simultaneously with
the establishment of the Territorial Directorate ”North“
responsible for organisation of territorial defence,
maintaining the records of mobilisation resources and
mobilisation call-up. These processes were carried out
according to a carefully planned schedule, so that they
supplemented each other and did not decrease the level
of operational control or command efficiency.

In order to increase operational efficiency of the

command and control system, it is planned to introduce
modern communication and information exchange
equipment. In particular, beginning from 2006, the
Command and Control Centre will exercise control of
the peacekeeping contingents in conference call mode.
Additionally, it is planned to establish in the near future
direct information exchange channels with command
and control elements of NATO member nations.

**In general, the planned improvement of the**

**Armed Forces command and control system will**
**increase the speed of decision-making and efficiency**
**of force command and control. It will also foster**
**alignment of staff procedures to the standards used**
**by NATO member nations.**

GENERAL STAFF
OF THE ARMED
FORCES OF UKRAINE


In order to adjust the General Staff organisational structure to the assigned missions
and to meet the requirement to bring the military command and control system in
line with NATO standards, the General Staff will adopt the J structure, used by
NATO countries (Figures 3.19, 3.20). This structure will help to eliminate excessive
command and control levels, increase the share of direct executive officer positions
and enhance their level of responsibility.

In order to accomplish this task, a detailed and well-structured plan of events has

been developed. According to the plan, the following changes in the organisational
structure are envisaged:

  - the Main Directorate of Personnel (J-1) will in future include the organisational

elements of the Main Department for Humanitarian Policy and Welfare
Support of the Armed Forces;

  - the Main Intelligence Directorate (J-2) will be established in the General

Staff;

  - the activities of the Main Operations Directorate (J-3) will be focused on

military strategic analysis, development of proposals pertaining to strategic
deployment of the Armed Forces and development of training policies;

  - organisational structure and personnel strength of the Main Directorate of

Defence Planning (J-5) will be improved through elimination of irrelevant
functions related to support of the General Staff Bidding Committee.

chapter 3


ARMED FOR C E S O F U K R A I N E

As previously stated, Joint Support Forces will be established on the basis of the

Support Forces Command (J-4).

Simultaneously with the changes in the General Staff organisational structure

a fundamental change will take place in the decision-making procedure for force
engagement. The procedure will be based on scenario assessments that take into
account both the threat and the resources needed to meet the threat as opposed to
generally identifying possible threats or only relying on the economic potential of the
state (see Chapter 2, Annex 3). This approach has proved its effectiveness in NATO
countries. With its introduction, the necessity to approve cumbersome plans for
Armed Forces engagement by the President of Ukraine will be eliminated. Instead, a
mechanism will be introduced to adjust plans to enable specific units to be engaged
in missions under various scenarios.

**The General Staff transition to the structure that is close to NATO**

**standards will allow it to simplify the command and control decision-making**
**mechanism, clearly identify the levels of responsibility and authority of various**
**officials, eliminate unnecessary functions from the structural components and**
**significantly cut down the amount of redundant paper communications between**
**military command and control elements.**


**The organisational changes and modernisation of the command and control**

criteria for the rational implementation of the operational elements of military budgets. It is also a
determining factor in raising the level of confidence that society has in the Armed Forces and it enhances
Ukraine’s prestige in the sphere of international security.

In the past the Armed Forces have not been able to effectively organise full-scale force training. In

2005 some positive changes occurred when the annual plans for combat training were fulfilled. The
training indicators for the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces were improved and a new system of Armed Forces
training was introduced.


FORCE TRAINING
SYSTEM, ITS STATE
IN EARLY 2005

ACTIONS TO IMPROVE
FORCE TRAINING
IN 2005


Until recently the force training system had remained unchanged since the Soviet
Army times and basically consisted of the multiple repetition of individual training
cycles and was only co-ordinated at the local unit level. The large-scale use of combat
equipment and other resources for training could not be sustained in the absence of
proper funding and logistic support. As a result, the efficiency of the training system
was low and negatively influenced the level of force training.

C2 elements were trained mostly at their permanent

location without the experience of deployment to
command posts. In addition, the training was only
concentrated on theoretical issues. In consequence,
staff officers of all levels were losing their skills in
practical command and control of operations and of
force formations.

The efficiency of professional and command

training decreased. The content of its programmes did
not take into account the evolution of modern methods
of warfare or the changes that had occurred in the
nature of armed conflicts in the world within the past
few years.

Moreover, there had been no modernisation in the logistics of force training. As a

result, there were no simulation instruments based on modern computer technologies,
and the available equipment at the ranges and classes had actually exhausted their
service life and could not meet all the requirements of training programmes.

**Fundamental changes in the organisation of force** **training were introduced**

**throughout 2005. It was one of the first items to be discussed at the session of the**
Ministry of Defence Board and declared to be a high-priority category.

Despite restricted funding for force training programmes, the Ministry of Defence
managed to redistribute the available material resources and commit them primarily
to training the units of the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces (JRRF).

This has yielded positive results in the form of significant improvements in the

combat training characteristics of the Armed Forces services:

_• in the Land Forces: JRRF units and elements have completed fire shooting_

programmes and combat vehicle driving programmes, while the parachuting
programme has exceeded planned targets by 15%; the average number of

FORCE TRAINING


flying hours per army aviation crew has increased by 2.5 times in the JRRF,
from 40 hours in 2004 to over 90 hours in 2005, and by 1.3 times in the Main
Defence Forces, from 17 hours to almost 24 hours respectively;

_• in the Air Forces: the flight training plan has been completed at the level of_

86%, while the figure for 2004 had been 56%; the average number of flying
hours per crew has increased by 1.5 times in the JRRF, from 56.5 hours to
almost 86 hours, and by 1.3 times in the Main Defence Forces, from 18.5 hours
to 23 hours; pilot training programmes now include tactical manoeuvres and
joint actions for air flights and squadrons that were missing in recent years;

  - in the Naval Forces: combat training plans have been completed at the level of

100% for the land component and 90% for the ships, boats and JRRF units; the
period of training at sea has gone up by 1.1 times for JRRF ships, from 23 days
to 25 days, by 1.5 times for the Main Defence Forces, from eight to twelve
days; the average number of flying hours per Naval aviation crew assigned
to JRRF has increased by over 6.5 times, from about 10 hours to 67.5 hours;
and special attention has been paid to achieving JRRF units and elements
interoperability with NATO forces for participation in combined operations.

**The main event in force training in 2005 was Reaction-2005, the integrated**

**operational-tactical exercise with the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces, at which**
**the President of Ukraine was present.** The exercise involved 6,500 servicemen
using 590 pieces of weapons and equipment, including over 100 tanks and armoured
personnel carriers, 20 aircraft, 12 helicopters and 9 ships.

The missions of the exercise were performed simultaneously at different test

grounds of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: a series of tactical and tactical flying
missions was carried out at Zhytomyr all-services range; the Black Sea and the Opuk
amphibious range was the site of tactical training in amphibious and air landing
operations; a tactical flying exercise was conducted at Kyiv-Olexandrivka Air Forces
range; while tactical exercises of airborne and paraborne elements were carried out
at the Shyroky Lan all-services range (see insertion _Exircise_ “Reaction-2005“ for
details).

The exercises made it possible to test new forms and methods of deploying the

Joint Rapid Reaction Forces, evaluate their efficiency and identify the areas for
improvements in force training.

Changes have been introduced into the training system that take account of the
revised missions of the Armed Forces stemming directly from the operations in
which they may be engaged, such as counter-terrorist actions and relief operations
for natural or man-made emergencies. Other reasons for introducing the changes are

the reduction of conscript service to twelve months and
the transition to contractual manning arrangements.

Force training has already been reorganised to include

one annual training cycle of 11 months (Figure 4.1).

From the beginning of the 2006 academic year,

significant attention will be focused on individual
professional training of soldiers and sergeants to help
them adapt quickly to unit operations. Another focus
will be the training of units, i.e. sections, platoons and
companies.

Tactical exercises for these elements will be carried out

once a year upon completion of the co-ordination stages.

The number of tactical exercises for all the types

of elements will be reduced by 50%. Brigade tactical

promotion of command personnel will directly depend
on the training levels of their subordinate elements.

The new system of combat training has already


been tested at the units where 100% contractual
manning experiment is under way and it has proved to
be effective.

Concurrently with the introduction of the new


force training system **an experiment was launched**
**to appoint reservists to certain positions and give**
them on-the-job training in their specialties at the
military units, which is a widely applied practice
in NATO countries. As an example, some reservists
in Air Forces units are former pilots from the same
units, and they require much less time to restore their
flying skills. When necessary, this principle can be
used to man peacekeeping units and transport aviation

elements.

###### CHAPTER 5

##### PERSONNEL POLICY
 AND MILITARY EDUCATION

ersonnel policies in the Armed Forces are aimed at providing the forces with highly professional and

#### Pmotivated people capable of performing all the tasks assigned to them.

The main goals of Armed Forces personnel policies are the manning of the Armed Forces (including

manning of the reserves) to the correct levels and the development of a high-quality officer cadre. This
will require a high-quality system of military education.


MANNING
THE ARMED FORCES


In manning the Armed Forces a mixed method of recruitment is currently used,
including both fixed-date conscripted servicemen and those recruited on a contract
basis. As mentioned above, the term of compulsory military service has been reduced
to 12 months (18 months in the Naval Forces and 9 months for University graduates).

By 2010, it is intended to fully revoke conscription in
favour of manning the Armed Forces with contracted
servicemen, which should improve the Armed Forces
combat efficiency and considerably decrease the
time required for preparation for assigned missions.
The preparations for the transition are currently
underway.

In 2005, the Ministry of Defence abandoned


**Figure 5.1. Predictable pace of the Armed Forces transition to**
contractual manning, by year’s end, personnel number


the practice of gradually increasing the numbers of
contracted personnel due to the lack of adequate
resources and legislation. **According to the latest**
**plans of the Ministry of Defence, within the next**
**two years there will be a number of amendments**
**to the laws that regulate financial and economic**
**conditions, subsistence and other provisions for**
**would-be contracted servicemen. This will ensure**
**that improved standards of service are available to**
**contracted servicemen. New training programmes**
**for contracted servicemen will also be developed**
**and** **experimentally** **tested.** **Following** **these**

**improvements, from 2008 the next stage of increased**
**contracted manning will begin (Figure 5.1.)**

At the same time, in 2005 the outflow of contracted

personnel that previously amounted to approximately
6,000 persons per year was stopped. The number of
servicemen willing to prolong their contracts for
the second and third terms increased significantly
(Figure 5.1.) The Chief of the General Staff,
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,
issued an order in October 2005, adopting regulations
for the establishment of Sergeant Councils in the units

of the Armed Forces. This measure should enhance
the responsibility levels of servicemen, help improve
morale within military groups and foster a culture
that will not tolerate abuse or violation of military
discipline.

In 2005, **the Centre for Contract Manning was**

established together with 26 territorial centres. The
Centre branches will be set up in districts and towns in
2006 (Figure 5.2.)

The activities of military units under new contract

manning conditions are being thoroughly studied
as part of a pilot project where each Service of the
Armed Forces is represented by a brigade plus a large
amphibious ship for the Naval Forces. The dynamics
and the overall result of the pilot project are positive,
i.e. combat efficiency has improved in the above
mentioned formations where the numbers of contracted
personnel have increased (Table 5.1.) For example, the
tests and exercises that evaluated combat readiness of
the 7 Bomber and Reconnaissance Aviation Brigade
proved that the Brigade was at a high state of readiness
for practical missions.


Branches of territorial

manning centres


Beginning from 2006, the principle of contractual recruitment will also be

applied to the reserves. Force manning with reservists will be achieved by civilians
combining their professional jobs with their service duties in the Armed Forces
Reserves in exchange for a financial reward and/or benefits, such as priority
admission to educational institutions, free education, free health care, etc.

To provide a legislative framework for service in the Armed Forces Reserve, a

number of principal legal documents have been developed, in particular, the draft
law of Ukraine “On Reserves Service” and the draft Presidential decree “On the
Structure of Military Reserves in the Human Resources”. It is also planned to launch
an experiment for manning certain positions with reservists and training the latter in
specific military skills. Some 1,200 reservists are to be trained at military educational
institutions and centres in 2006, with necessary costs being allocated in the Defence
Budget.

**The improvements in the system of manning of the Armed Forces and**

**training of the stand-by reserves will have a positive effect on the development of**
**a rational personnel management structure, increasing the prestige of military**
**service and improving the combat efficiency of the Armed Forces.**

DEVELOPING
THE OFFICER CORPS


To date the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been unable to develop a fully integrated
system for career development and support for professional military servicemen.

In 2005, the Ministry of Defence launched a project aimed at establishing

a centralised system of personnel management which will comply with NATO
standards.

A working group headed by the First Deputy Minister of Defence was set up

to develop an appropriate legal framework and provide scientific, methodological,
technical and financial support for the new personnel management system. The
group is currently active.

In 2005, significant efforts were taken to bring the ratio between the main officer

categories in line with the standards applied in the world’s leading armed forces
(Table 5.2.)

Reduction of the overall number of officers in the Armed Forces in 2006 and

projected to the end of 2011 is shown in Figure 5.3.

After introduction of the full list of officer positions and respective military

ranks and levels of education in the Armed Forces of Ukraine on January 1,
2006, the number of senior officer positions will decrease by 1,131. The

number of junior officer positions will increase
proportionately. During the period 2006-2011,
changes in the ratio between senior and junior
officers will be determined by the overall reduction
of officer numbers resulting from organisational
restructuring measures.

Welfare support will be provided to the affected

officers through a series of measures aimed at providing
adequate financial support. For example, officers who
have been downgraded or whose positions have been
abolished as a result of organisational restructuring
will retain their previous salaries.

In line with the legal maximum age of officers

in military service, new minimum terms of service
and maximum terms for holding a military rank are
expected to be introduced in 2006 (Figure 5.4.).

**and downsizing in the Armed Forces and the creation of new career and social**
**incentives for officers will help to ensure a more efficient service.**

Currently, servicemen are trained in over 60 military higher educational

institutions and military educational departments of civilian higher educational
institutions (Figure 5.5A). In the course of 2005, the number of personnel working
in the military education system was reduced by 5,360 persons, including 3,810
servicemen and 1,550 civilian employees, allowing the Ministry of Defence to cut
down its annual expenditure by UAH 20 million.

By the end of 2005, the number of personnel within the military education system

was 31,000 persons, or 11% of the total Armed Forces strength, including over
3,000 teachers and instructors, of whom 164 are doctors of sciences and 1,209 are
candidates of sciences.

Following the refinement of the main goals of the Armed Forces and the resulting

downsizing and restructuring, there has been a corresponding decrease in the demand

for military experts. There is also a need to review the
training these experts receive and specializations they
hold. This, in turn, will lead to significant changes in
the system of military education.

In order to improve the system of military

education and bring it up to the standards set by the
new tasks and structure of the Armed Forces, the
_State Programme for 2006-2011 suggests streamlining_
the network of military educational institutions and
combining their capabilities with those of civilian
educational institutions (Figure 5.5B)

Thus, it is planned that by the end of 2011 the

Armed Forces will comprise 12 military educational
establishments and departments (figure 5.5C) with
the number of personnel amounting to approximately

10,000 persons, or 7% of the total Armed Forces
strength, including some 7,000 servicemen and 3,000
civil employees.

From 2007, the Land Forces specialists will be

trained for all specialties at a single specialised
educational establishment to be set up at Lvivska
Polytechnika National University, Lviv Military
Institute.

This decision was made after careful consideration

by the Ministry of Defence Board. Preparations are
currently continuing for the establishment of this
educational institution. Vacancies will be partially
filled by the operational command officers whose
positions will have been cut. This approach enables
the Armed Forces to retain experienced officers.
The National Defence Academy of Ukraine will
start a special course to improve the level of their
qualifications.

Along with streamlining of the network of military

educational establishments, the state demand for
trained military experts is being downsized overall.
Approximately 1,200 cadets were admitted to military
educational establishments in 2005, which is half the
number of graduates from the same year. This figure
will meet the requirements of the Armed Forces
for officers in 2009-2010 and ensure the necessary
rotation of officers for the period up to 2015.

The capabilities of civilian educational

establishments are utilised to introduce the practice
of training tactical level military specialists using the
model ‘civilian student for four years, and military
cadet for one year’. Some 1,230 persons are currently
part of that educational programme. This has allowed
the Ministry of Defence to reduce its expenditure for
training junior officers by UAH 57.8 million.

Beginning from 2006, the period for training

operational and tactical level specialists will be reduced
from two years to one year, as is the practice in most
NATO member nations. The standards of education
for officers at the battalion, brigade, and corps levels
will undergo significant adjustments. For example, for
brigade commanders, the standards of education will
be raised to the operational and strategic level, and for

battalion commanders they will be raised to the operational and tactical level.

In order to improve the selection of the best candidates for military educational

institutions, the Ministry of Defence Board made the decision to conduct an
experiment in 2005. External evaluation and assessment of the education level
and professional qualification for military service was made by the Main Selection
Committee in the town of Yavoriv, Lviv Oblast. Following the results of the
experiment, external assessment will be conducted on an ongoing basis for all
specialties, except for pilots and the ”civilian student for four years, and military
cadet for one year” model of training.

Beginning from 2006, the number of teachers and instructors at the National

Defence Academy of Ukraine is to be reduced, and the released scientific and

pedagogical potential will be engaged in training officers of battalion and brigade
levels at the Qualification Upgrading Centre of the National Defence Academy of
Ukraine.

A new system of officer training at the Qualification Upgrading Centre will

be introduced in 2006 to provide officers with an adequate level of theoretical
knowledge and practical skills prior to promotion to higher ranks and/or when the
officer in question has held a position for a long time (Figure 5.6).

Officers will be trained both at the National Defence Academy of Ukraine and

higher educational establishments of the armed services. In addition, every officer
will have to take a qualification upgrading course several times during his period
of service. This is stipulated in the Directive of the Minister of Defence of Ukraine

“On Qualification Upgrading of Officer Corps and Civilian Employees within the
Structure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine” issued on December 30, 2005, which
clearly defines the terms and frequency of training and lists authorized institutions
where qualification can be upgraded.

A rating system will be introduced to control the quality of training with the

purpose of applying a unified objective method of measuring the individual level of
qualification and relative rating of every serviceman.

Beginning from 2006, the obligatory rotation of teachers and instructors in military

higher educational institutions will be introduced. Career promotion for officers who
work solely as educational workers is being gradually abolished. Vacancies at the
departments of tactical and technical profiles will be filled either by graduates of the

National Defence Academy of Ukraine or experienced army officers, while military
educators will be appointed to various positions in units and headquarters.

In 2006, the number of officers receiving military education in higher educational

establishments in NATO nations will be significantly increased. The quality of
selection for enrolment of officers for these education opportunities will also be
improved. Selection will be performed entirely on a competitive basis, with candidates
to be approved by the High Evaluation Board of the Ministry of Defence.

Diplomas of certified foreign military higher educational institutions will be

officially accepted in Ukraine, and persons who have graduated from these institutions
will not be required to complete their education at the National Defence Academy in
order to obtain their Master’s degree. This is a step toward acknowledging, together
with NATO countries, the single standards of education for the operational-tactical
and operational-strategic levels provided by the above mentioned educational
institutions.

**The ultimate objective of military education reform is the development of**

**a modern, economically viable and scientifically grounded system for training**
**highly qualified military specialists for the Armed Forces and other military**
**formations of Ukraine. The qualitative parameters of training will match NATO**
**standards.**


**Upon completion of the reforms, personnel policy in the Armed Forces,**

**development of high-quality officer corps and military education together will**
**make up an integrated, efficient, economically viable, and scientifically grounded**
**system for training highly qualified military specialists who will determine the**
**professional level of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.**

he combat capabilities of the Armed Forces and their mission effectiveness are largely dependant

#### Tupon effective logistical support. This conclusion is justified by the experience from a wide range of

conflicts including the most recent examples of multinational military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Inadequate logistic support and infrastructure in the Armed Forces of Ukraine will require swift and

decisive actions on the part of the Ministry of Defence leadership to ensure more effective use of existing
budget funds and the identification of additional resources. The latter can be generated, in particular, by
revenue generating economic activities being undertaken by the Ministry of Defence.

The establishment of an efficient logistic support system is an integral part of the efforts being made

to reach interoperability between Ukrainian military units and NATO forces during joint peacekeeping
operations.

The existing support system for the Armed Forces (Figure 6.1) is founded upon
military doctrine that dates from the middle of the the last century. It does not take
into account the dramatic changes that have taken place in national political military
policy is generally ineffective.

The stockpiling of materiel exceeds the real needs of the forces resulting in the

maintenance of unnecessary storage facilities and an excessive number of vehicles
for transportation purposes.

Attempts were made in 2004 to create a modern logistics system by redistributing

functions as appropriate between the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff and
establishing a Support Command by transferring over fifty arsenals, bases, and depots
under its authority. Unfortunately it did not produce the desired results and efforts to create
a unified troop support system based on the territorial principle have not been completed.

**Private sector business potential has not been used effectively through the**

**outsourcing of troop support as a result the important objective of achieving**
**direct material supplies to the formations and units has not been implemented.**

A number of key decisions were made in 2005 to address the urgent need to

improve the logistics system for the Armed Forces, and a number of them have
already been implemented.

At the initiative of the Ministry of Defence, the General Staff to radically review

the situation and define new more realistic requirement levels for the Armed Forces

in terms of material support. As a result proposals have been developed to reduce
material stocks by up to 75%. At the end of 2005 those proposals were submitted for
the consideration of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.

Beginning from 2006 after the Operational Commands have been disbanded, the

logistic support system will gradually improve as a result of the reduction of command
and control entities responsible for operational level logistic and technical support.
This will significantly simplify planning and troop support. The roles and functions
of the eliminated C2 organisations, as well as the subordinated arsenals, bases, and
depots, will be gradually transferred to the Support Forces Command, and in the
future to the Joint Support Forces, established on the basis of this Command. The
facilities that are subject to downsizing will remain under the Operational Commands
until the Commands themselves are completely disbanded.

As the Armed Services Commands undergo reorganisation into respective Staffs,

they will retain the function of supplying the troops with the types of materiel that
will be specific for their subordinated forces. For instance, the Naval Forces will
maintain authority over supplying mines and torpedoes, and search and rescue
equipment, while the Air Forces will supply navigation equipment, airfield ground
support equipment, etc.

Thus, the future supply system, built around the Joint Support Forces, will be

based upon the above-mentioned **Joint Supply Centres for Special Equipment,**
**Weapons and Equipment, Missiles, Ammunition, and Materiel (Figure 6.2).**

In order to find ways to improve food supplies for the armed forces by making use

of the market economy and to bring support systems closer to the western European
models, an experiment has been conducted in the Armed Forces whereby private
businesses have supplied foodstuffs to several military units (see Annex 5 for food
supply standards). Based on the results of this experiment the Cabinet of Ministers
of Ukraine resolved to source at least 10% of the total food supplies required for
military personnel from competitive private sources, beginning January 1, 2006.

This decision has already been supported by practical steps. A tender has been

held to select firms and companies with experience in food supply services and,
capable of offering a good service at a competitive cost. An obligatory condition was

to provide food supplies in field conditions as is the
practice in most NATO countries. In the near future
combat unit commanders will see none core functions,
such as supply, taken away so that they can focus on
their core activities such as personnel training and
mission preparation.

In total, the Bidding Committee of the Ministry of

Defence completed 460 competitive procedures for the
procurement of goods and services in 2005. Of these
299 covered the area of logistic support and 161 were
for technical support in total 929 contracts and 715
additional agreements were signed. The Committee
enhanced quality control of contract obligations and
implementation and as a result sanctions were imposed
following 137 claims of non-compliance.

These new approaches are increasing the efficiency

of logistic support. For example the delivery times for the supply of fuel to army
units in 2005 has been improved by a factor of five as compared to 2004 – from
80-90 days down to 18-20 days.

For the first time in recent years, the Ministry of Defence paid all its outstanding

debts to contractors (totalling UAH 26.8 million) at the beginning of the year. This
consisted of UAH 1.2 million for food supplies and UAH 25.6 million for materiel
procurement.

**The aim of streamlining logistic support is to bring it as close as possible to**

**modern market economy models. The gradual involvement of small and medium**
**sized businesses in troop supply programmes will steadily increase the quality of**
**food and other types of supplies, making it possible for commanders to focus on**
**combat readiness and mobilisation training.**

**The introduction of the territorial model of troop support coupled with**

**electronic accounting for goods and services will enable the Armed Forces to**
**reduce personnel and technical equipment devoted to the logistics system.**

Military infrastructure includes military and technical facilities, engineering
facilities, buildings, communications, and land plots on which military units and
agencies are located.

The infrastructure of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine currently comprises over

2,000 military bases, approximately 44,000 buildings, and 455,000 hectares of land.

During 2000-2005, 281 military bases with 7,700 buildings and facilities

(Figure 6.3) were transferred from the Ministry of Defence to the central executive
and municipal authorities.

Due to insufficient funding, the construction of over 570 planned military

facilities has not been completed.

**Military bases. During 2005, the Government developed and adopted, at the**

initiative of the Ministry of Defence, over 30 resolutions, instructions, and directives
that were aimed at solving the numerous problems related to the transfer or sale of
military installations and individual buildings and facilities. As a result the proceeds
of the sales of redundant assets increased significantly throughout 2005. While some
100 separate contracts for the disposal of redundant assets were signed during the
four years prior to 2005 with proceeds amounting to UAH 20 million in 2005 just
five contracts were concluded but they resulted in greatly increased revenue receipts
of UAH 200 million.

In the course of 2005, 55 military bases were sold, and over 4,000 hectares of land

were transferred to the central executive authorities. This is almost 2.5 times more
than in 2004.

The most attractive military installations are sold at open auctions, with the

proceeds used to construct and buy housing for the military personnel.

Over the course of 2006, significant changes will be introduced into sales

procedures for the disposal of surplus military infrastructure. The proceeds received
by the planned sale of 420 military installations will be used to directly support the
development of the Armed Forces and solve social issues related to military personnel.
The new procedures will enhance control of the sales of surplus military installations
and the Armed Forces will be relieved of redundant assets and non-core functions.

Almost 1,300 military bases are to be vacated by 2011 and over 21,000 buildings and

facilities among which 13,500 will be released by the Ministry of Defence and transferred
to the management of other executive authorities, while 7,500 facilities are to be sold.

**Arsenals, bases and depots. In early 2005, the Armed Forces infrastructure**

included 159 arsenals, bases, and depots where missiles, ammunition, and other
types of explosives were stored. Most of these facilities were overloaded by 130%
and almost a third of them were in an unserviceable condition.

During 2005, measures were taken to improve the status of the arsenals, bases,

and depots storing missiles, ammunitions, and other types of explosive and dangerous
substances. In order to ensure their survivability, safety, and improve storage and
maintenance conditions, over UAH 100 million were allocated in 2005. As a result,
storage conditions improved at 30% of the facilities.

In addition, 2005 saw the initiation of the construction of 38 military technical

and engineering facilities. A total of 10 facilities were placed into operation during
the year these were all located in the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces garrisons.

**Utility Services. In 2005 funding for the maintenance and operation of the**

Armed Forces utility services was increased by UAH 1.5 million (4.9%). Leased
military property resulted in proceeds of approximately UAH 8.8 million, which was
2.9 million more than in 2004.

Beginning from 2006, a number of efforts will be taken to improve housing

programmes for the Armed Forces. Thanks to the centralization of command and
control and establishment of four territorial commands, the number of housing
committees will be reduced by over a third.

The housing support system for the Armed Forces will be based on sound financial

management principles including: conducting competitive tenders, concluding legally

binding agreements, improved quality control, and faster timeliness for services.
Intermediate levels will be eliminated from some areas of housing operations and a
new support system will be introduced. Utility services will be provided by commercial
organisations and state-owned enterprises of the Ministry of Defence.

Implementation of these planned improvements will ensure that the infrastructure

of the Armed Forces will correspond more closely to operational requirements and be
managed in accordance with modern market economy methods.

The economic activities of the Ministry of Defence are directed toward meeting the
requirements of the Armed Forces by the production and sale of equipment and the
supply of services through a number of subordinate enterprises and organisations.
The other important area of this activity is the disposal of surplus military materiel
owned by the Armed Forces. These commercial operations and sales are a funding
source necessary to support the defence budget. There was a 39% increase in
centralized funding volumes resulting from these economic activities during 2005.

**Improvement to production capabilities.** The Ministry of Defence possesses

considerable technical, intellectual and production potential which allows it not only
to help meet Ukrainian Armed Forces requirements but also to maintain a domestic
civilian defence capability and be competitive with foreign defence suppliers.
The Ministry of Defence manages 193 state-owned enterprises. Some of them
are considered to be unique not only in Ukraine but world-wide because of their
production capabilities and the quality and range of services they provide.

In 2005, the Ministry of Defence conducted a realistic assessment of the economic

viability of continuing to maintain such a wide range of production capabilities. As
a result of this assessment starting from 2006 the enterprises and organisations that
do not have sustainable development prospects will be gradually closed down, while
some 20 state-owned enterprises will be transferred to other executive authorities.

Five state-owned economic associations were established in 2005 based on

functional alignments to enable the Ministry of Defence to more efficiently use its
enterprise assets they are:

  - _Military Construction Industry_ Consortium — for the implementation of a

comprehensive housing programme for military personnel;

  - _Tekhnovoyenservis Concern_ — vehicles, armour, and material repair services

commissioned by the Government;

  - _Aviavoyenremont_ Concern — aviation equipment repair, and air transport

services commissioned by the Government;

  - _Voyenpromservis Concern_ — repair of air defence, artillery, and communication

equipment, ships refits, etc.;

  - _Vijsktorhservis Concern_ — operation and maintenance of military commercial

enterprises, providing personal and rehabilitation services, military resorts
and recreation facilities as well as hotel services.

The establishment of these associations had a positive impact on the economic

indices for the Ministry of Defence in 2005. As compared to 2004, the stateowned economic enterprises of the Ministry of Defence increased the value of
their production and services by UAH 71.7 million (8.4%) amounting to a total of
UAH 924.2 million. For comparison, the production volumes of the national defence
industrial complex as a whole increased by 3%.

At the same time, the sales volumes for products and services increased by

UAH 159.7 million (15.1%) and totalled UAH 1,217.9 million. The net profit
reached UAH 27.8 million, as compared to UAH 20.3 million in 2004.

Taxes and obligatory payments, including those made to the National Budget and

the Pension Fund increased by UAH 41.9 million (22.1%), and the exports production
level grew by UAH 74 million (19.3%), totalling UAH 456.8 million (Figure 6.4).

In 2005, the number of unprofitable enterprises decreased from 59 to 46 (by 22%), as

compared to 2004. As at November 2005, there was a total of 34,2% enterprises within
Ukrainian industry that were unprofitable.

The future economic activities of the Ministry

of Defence will be focused upon the preservation,
efficient operation, and development of the most
profitable enterprises, capable of meeting the
requirements of the Armed Forces and working in the
interests of the nation in general.

**The economic activities of the Ministry of**

**Defence will gradually adapt to the market economy**
**environment. This will promote improvements in**
**the technical status of the Armed Forces, foster**
**modernization and provide additional revenues for**
**force development and alleviating the welfare issues**
**affecting military personnel as a result of defence**
**reforms.**

**Sales of surplus military property. Surplus military**

property released by the Armed Forces is sold in accordance with the appropriate
legislation and under clearly defined procedures. Proceeds from the sales go to the
revenue part of the State Budget and are exclusively used for defence needs.

Proceeds from the sales of military equipment (Figure 6.5) has tended to decrease

as a proportion of the national budget in the recent years.

In 2005,the procedures for sales of military property changed considerably.

2005


A complete list of military assets is published on the web-site of the Ministry
of Defence. A new procedure for selling surplus property at open auctions was
introduced and such auctions have already taken place in many regions of Ukraine.

A total of 193 contracts were concluded in 2005 for the sale of MOD assets

bringing proceeds of UAH 202.3 million, which exceeded the figure for the previous
year by 4.9%.

An improved mechanism for the disposal and sale of surplus military property has

been developed. The mechanism is simple and more transparent and it provides for
the following:

  - Centralised management by the Ministry of Defence of surplus, written-off,

and obsolete property of the Armed Forces;

  - Establishment of a single automated system for accounting and control of

contracts at the Ministry of Defence and the enterprises and/or organisations
authorized by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine; improvements to the
database on available surplus military assets and their technical status;
exchange and storage of information on the key characteristics of regional
markets, potential purchasers, etc.;

  - Use of a single standard contract form both for foreign and domestic markets,

simplification of the mechanisms for co-ordinating the inventory of military
property to be disposed of, as well as streamlining of the relevant paper work;

  - Independent expert assessment of the value of surplus military property based

on competitive principles, and the sale of military property that has any
general economic value at fair and open auctions.

**Surplus military property and stocks are a source of additional funding**

**that is important for ensuring the full funding of operations and the continuing**
**development of the Armed Forces. The introduction of new mechanisms for**
**thedisposal and sales of military property will require further improvements in**
**the economic structures within the Armed Forces and the associated legal base.**

**The efforts being made by the Ministry of Defence to establish a more effective**

**logistics system, streamlined military infrastructure and improved economic activities**
**are aimed at meeting the requirements of running the Armed Forces efficiently in a**
**modern market environment and supporting defence reforms at every stage of their**
**development. The aim is to meet corresponding NATO standards in these areas.**

###### CHAPTER 7

##### MILITARY AND TECHNICAL
 POLICY AND MILITARY SCIENCE

he military and technical policy of the Armed Forces is primarily aimed at ensuring the provision of

#### Tstate-of-the-art weapons and equipment and maintaining operational readiness in line with Armed

Forces missions. Military science plays a crucial role in developing national economic and technological
capabilities.

Military science not only meets the current requirements of the Armed Forces, but it also has to

anticipate changes and new trends in defence matters in order to concentrate assets in a timely manner
in the priority areas and search for most effective warfare methods and techniques.

The current stage in the development of military and technical policy and military science is significant

as it will be necessary to overcome negative trends that have emerged in these areas during the previous
phases in Armed Forces transformation. The problems include: deterioration of the technical state
of weapons and equipment; accumulation of large amounts of excessive weapons, equipment and
ammunitions to be disposed of and a disconnection between applied research and force requirements.


EQUIPPING
THE ARMED FORCES


The Armed Forces are equipped at 100% levels with the major types of weapons and
equipment required. The numbers are shown in Figure 7.1, and their characteristics –
in Annex 6.

As at early 2005, over 60% of weapons and equipment had been in service for

over 15 years, including 55% of the Air Forces combat aircraft and air defence missile
launching systems, 97% of the Naval Forces combat ships, 84% of missiles and
artillery systems, 11% of armoured vehicles and equipment and over 97% of wheeled
vehicles. 53% of automated C2 systems and 45% of radio electronic equipment are in

need of repair. 80% of the guided anti-aircraft missiles
and medium-range launching systems do not meet
operational requirements.

That was the situation in which the Ministry of

Defence started its work in 2005. With the authority of
the President of Ukraine, the next three years should
see a comprehensive upgrade of the Armed Forces. To
implement this large-scale project, the 2006 national
budget has appropriated the necessary funds of UAH
491.5 million (in 2005 – UAH 167.6 million).

The Ministry of Defence now has exact status

data on every single weapon and equipment piece,
in particular regarding its operational service life and
necessary repair timelines. This makes it possible to
plan the future life cycle of every weapon type and
allocate resources required to extend it.

Throughout 2005, the Ministry of Defence restored

its contacts with leading national defence industrial
complex enterprises and thoroughly examined their

The 2005 contracts with defence industries for procurement of weapons and

equipment for the Armed Forces amounted to UAH 57.8 million. Seventeen _Bulat_
Т-64 tanks were modernised, 19 _Barsuk reconnaissance stations were upgraded_
and over 550 units of automotive, engineering, navigation and computer equipment
were repaired. The Ministry of Defence repair shops provided repair and regular
maintenance services to some 1,700 equipment units of the Land Forces and over
1,000 of the Air Forces.

Negotiations are under way with _SAGEM, France, for a Мі-24 helicopter_

modernisation project and Iveko Fiat, Italy, for the supply of engines for armoured
vehicles.

During 2005, some difficult decisions have been made to suspend a number of

research and development projects relating to weapons and equipment that were
found to have no future requirement. Beginning from 2006 new more relevant projects
will be launched, mainly for S-300 Surface-to-Air Missile Systems and MiG-29 and
Su-25 combat aircraft upgrades. It is also planned to complete the development of a
new guided air-to-air missile in 2006.

The development of a corvette type combat ship will be launched in 2006 in order

to strengthen Naval Forces capabilities in the future.

A Joint Rapid Reaction Forces brigade will be equipped with modern digital

communication equipment and new AN-70 transport aircraft will be fielded to the
Air Forces in 2006.

Taking into consideration that Ukraine is not self-sufficient in terms of having

a self-sustaining cycle of weapons production, the Ministry of Defence is going to
focus on some key weapons and equipment development priorities.

The weapons and equipment development will comply with the following

priorities:

  - Development of new automated C3I systems and upgrading the existing

ones; development of systems for intelligence gathering, electronic warfare,
protection of facilities against high precision weapons; high precision
weapons and artillery systems; weapons that are based on unconventional
physical principles; aviation weapons and equipment; air defence weapons

and equipment; frigate and corvette type ships;

**Design of a new corvette-type ship**

                     - Upgrading other weapons and equipment in order

to enhance their operational capabilities and to extend
their service life;

                     - Development of new high precision aviation

means of destruction, radar equipment and automated
C2 systems, enhancing combat capabilities of the air
defence missile launching systems, their survivability,
mobility and intelligence resistance capabilities;

                     - Enhancing military technical co-operation with

leading countries relating to weapons and equipment,

**Design** **Building** **building, UAH m** maintaining a balanced level of exports and imports of

2006-2010 2010-2015 700 military and dual use products.

Within the Armed Forces, the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces and peacekeeping

forces are considered to be the top priority for equipping with modern and upgraded
weapons and equipment.

It is planned to develop a national operational-tactical surface-to-surface missile

system (this measure will facilitate the revival of the Missile Forces of the Land
Forces). It is also intended to equip the Naval Forces with modern missile weapons
systems.

**The current situation with procuring modern weapons and equipment for**

**the Armed Forces of Ukraine is problematic. On the one hand, the Ministry of**
**Defence has to carry out a huge amount of urgent equipment upgrades; on the**
**other hand, there are stringent resource and time limitations. The Ministry of**
**Defence believes that the best way forward lies in setting realistic military and**
**technical policy priorities and improving management quality.**

The Armed Forces arsenals, bases and depots store a great number of surplus
weapons, equipment, missiles and munitions that are physically obsolete and some
are unusable on moral grounds. From almost 7 million small arms and light weapons
stored by the Armed Forces, 1.5 million pieces, or over 20% of the total stocks, are
due for disposal. Almost 1.2 million tons, or 70% of the present 1.7 million tons of
missiles and ammunitions, should be disposed of as a result of the expiry of their
serviceable life and the deterioration of their technical status. A serious problem is
caused by the need to dispose of 16.2 thousand tons of liquid propellant oxidant as
there are no environmentally friendly technologies to achieve this.

Storage of such amounts of excessive weapons, equipment and ammunition

requires extensive budget expenditure – over UAH 76 million per annum, significant
human resources – more than 12 thousand personnel, and most importantly, it
presents a risk to the population and creates social tension at storage locations.

Disposal of these stocks will meet the objectives of
improving the Armed Forces and it is in line with
Ukrainian commitments under international arms
control and non-proliferation agreements.

In 2005, the existing legislation was amended and

expanded and transparent and universal procedures
for munitions disposal were established. Authorised
by Government organisations, special state-owned
enterprises, private companies, as well as military
repair shops were involved in the disposal programmes.
There are positive achievements to report in disposing
of surplus, unserviceable or obsolete missiles and
ammunition. In 2005, 23,100 tons of ammunition
underwent disposal. This figure exceeds that of 2004
by almost 15,000 tons.

A draft national **Disposal Programme for**

**Unserviceable Conventional Ammunition and Missiles for 2006-2015** has been
developed to take care of such issues as improving the required technological
capabilities, accelerating the disposal rate and securing adequate funding for the
whole process. The total project funding will amount to approximately UAH 3.9
billion.

The Ministry of Defence has actively sought the assistance of NATO, EU, OSCE

and other international organisations in order to attract additional technologies and
funding for the disposal of weapons, equipment and liquid propellants.

On the basis of a NATO study of the present Ukrainian stocks of surplus weapons

and ammunition, a €75.5 million twelve-year project has been proposed to dispose
of 133,000 tons of ammunition and 1.5 million pieces of small arms and light
weapons.

In November 2005, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and NAMSO (NATO

Maintenance and Supply Organisation) signed an Implementation Agreement under
which over €7.5 million of Western funding will be committed by a NATO TRUST
Fund (Together Reducing Unsafe Surplus Tools of War) to implement the disposal
programme.

The agreement provides funding for the first stage of the project to dispose of

15,000 tons of ammunition, 400,000 pieces of small arms and 1,000 portable antiaircraft missile systems. The list of parties that have agreed to contribute to the
project is presented in Table 7.1.

Additionally, a European Union project is being implemented in Ukraine to

destroy 6.5 million anti-personnel mines, for which the European Commission
intends to allocate some €7 million up to the end of 2008.

In July 2005, the Ministry of Defence initiated, jointly with OSCE, the first stage

of a rocket fuel components disposal programme, for which the OSCE Co-ordinator
in Ukraine has allocated €30,000.

**Acceleration of the disposal programme for surplus weapons, equipment, and**

**ammunition will contribute significantly to improving the security of the general**
**population; it will help the Ministry of Defence to release and rehabilitate**
**the areas of the military units subject to disbandment or reorganisation in**
**the process of transformation of the Armed Forces; it will reduce the cost of**
**maintaining excessive equipment, infrastructure and personnel costs; it will also**
**increase the level of confidence in Ukraine’s plans for disarmament, promote**
**better partner relations and attract additional funding.**

MILITARY
SCIENCE


The main tasks of military science are to develop a theoretical basis for national
military security and practical methods for its implementation, to formulate military
doctrine and force deployment practice, to create solutions for military development
problems and develop weapons and equipment.

The military research system is composed of command and control elements,

consultation and advisory boards, and research institutions.

**The Military Education and Science Department,** and the **Weapons** **and**

**Equipment Development and Procurement Department of the Ministry of Defence**
are responsible for managing scientific and technical activities as well as conducting
research and development commissioned by the State for national defence.

**The Military Science Directorate of the General Staff is responsible for**

managing scientific and technical activities within the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

On all structural levels of military science and research consultative and advisory

boards have been created and they work to validate and co-ordinate decisions made
on the most important issues of military science development which affect current
activities and the future development of the Armed Forces. The boards promote
collective decision making and their proposals and recommendations provide the
basis for scientific and technical activities.

Scientific and technical research in the Armed Forces is carried out in the

following main areas:

I – Military security of Ukraine;
II – Armed Forces of Ukraine development;
III – Ways and methods of training and engaging the Armed Forces;
IV – Military technical policy, defence technologies, development of modern

weapons and equipment, as well as equipping the Armed Forces.

Within these areas, the key scientific problems are identified and tasks are

assigned to 16 research institutions and centres. They employ over 480 researchers,
including 51 Doctors of Science. The leading scientific establishments of the Armed
Forces of Ukraine are the Central Research Institute of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,
National Research Centre of Defence Technologies and Military Security of Ukraine
and the Central Research Institute of Weapons and Equipment of the Armed Forces
of Ukraine.

In 2005, a total of 354 research and development projects were performed in the

main scientific areas (Figure 7.3).

Ukraine’s military science institutes have actively

contributed to the development of a number of
strategically important papers for the Armed Forces.
They include the Fundamentals of the Theory of Military
Security of Ukraine, Fundamentals of the Armed Forces
Training and Engagement, Basic Principles of Joint Rapid
Reaction Forces Training and Engagement, Humanitarian
Policy Concepts for the Armed Forces, methodologies
for testing weapons and equipment, recommendations
on adoption of the contractual principle of manning the
Armed Forces, and many others.

However, a detailed analysis of the performance

of the research institutions has shown that military
science is not closely enough aligned with the real
processes taking place in the Armed Forces of Ukraine
and, therefore, does not provide sufficient direct
scientific support to Armed Forces reform. Issues such


as defence budget development, defining Armed Forces missions, establishment of a
new troop logistic support system, force training and manning are currently beyond
the focus of military scientific institutions.

MILITARY AN D T E C H N I C A L P O L I CY

Therefore, the Ministry of Defence is reforming the military research system. Its

objectives were reviewed in 2005 and more relevant priorities were assigned.

Beginning from 2006, powerful military science centres will be established by

accumulating scientific potential at the leading scientific institutions and at the same
time their number and personnel strength will be decreased. A number of units that
are not directly involved in scientific research will be closed down.

Following a review of all research projects, the unpromising ones were closed

down and the ones that had a similar subject matter were merged. Over 80 research
and design projects running in 2005 will be closed down in 2006. The terminated
projects were researching methodologies that proved their effectiveness a long time
ago, or were dealing with theories that could no longer be implemented by the Armed
Forces. Some were working on the modernisation of obsolete weapons. Six studies
were merged into a single project under the subject “Basic Principles of Training and
Employment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine”.

The research institutions will focus on the following priority subjects:

              - Improving ways and methods of force deployment;

               - Assessing combat capabilities of the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces;

             - Development of an automated command and control system for the Air

Forces;


**Figure 7.4. Areas and Subjects of Research and Development**



- Development of operational and tactical level

requirements for future reconnaissance and attack
(fire) systems;

- Improving ways of employing the Naval Forces in

modern military conflicts;

- Development of a methodology to assess the

cost effectiveness of the Ministry of Defence budget
programmes;

- Development of a methodology to optimise

organisation, combat and authorised strength, and
operational capabilities of the Armed Forces of
Ukraine relating to real and potential risks and threats
to national security;

- Improvement of methods to evaluate performance

of the Armed Forces of Ukraine units participating in
international peacekeeping and anti-terrorist coalition
activities.

**Applied research in the area of modernisation**

**and development of new weapons** **and equipment**
**has been identified as a top priority.** In 2006, it


is planned to conduct fundamental research in this area as part of over 70 design
projects and six research projects (Figure 7.4).


**Restructuring of the military research system will improve its efficiency and**

**cost effectiveness and assist in finding solutions to the transformation problems**
**of the Armed Forces.**

###### CHAPTER 8

##### WELFARE POLICIES

rimarily welfare policies for the Armed Forces are aimed at safeguarding the constitutional rights and

#### Pfreedoms of servicemen and their families. In addition, they provide the framework for the training

and development of people serving in the forces and help improve army discipline. They also assist with
increasing recreational opportunities for personnel and so foster improved morale.

Welfare policies also have an external dimension, as they serve to promote a positive image of the

Armed Forces and help present military service in the best light to civil society. They also ensure a level
of military education for pre-conscripts and seek to maintain the credibility of the Armed Forces with the
local community.

Safeguarding the constitutional rights of military personnel focuses primarily on providing appropriate

social guarantees such as pensions, health care and housing. The level at which social guarantees are
provided to the military contributes significantly to the image of the Armed Forces and the appeal of
military service.


WELFARE POLICY
IMPLEMENTATION IN
THE ARMED FORCES


Welfare policies in the Armed Forces are implemented by the chain of command and
the relevant units in concert with government authorities, citizens associations and
religious organisations, other establishments and institutions for the advancement of
culture and arts, and mass media (Figure 8.1). Civil-military co-operation does not


**Figure 8.1. Welfare policy system in the Armed Forces**


only promote the objectives of well grounded personnel
and welfare policies for servicemen, but also makes the
Armed Forces more open and transparent for society.

In 2005, a process was initiated to introduce a

proactive form of socio-political information and legal
education for servicemen, which supported the key
objectives of their training and development. The main
objectives for welfare policies are supporting the morale
of service personnel and helping to achieving higher
levels of commitment from people the key elements are:

- raising the levels of morale amongst Armed Forces

personnel, taking preventive measures against criminal
activities and preventing, where possible, loss of life and
injuries;

- promotion of a positive national image for the

Armed Forces;

- explaining to all Armed Forces personnel the main

thrust of government policy and the consequent effect on
defence policy such as achieving the aim of the integration
of Ukraine into the European Union and NATO;

- the improvement of the prestige of military service

in the view of society

- seeking improvements in standards of military

education

- providing for the wide use of the national language in all

the areas of activities of the Armed Forces and developing a
shared set of tolerant and inclusive cultural values

Information support for the Armed Forces is provided by the military media

(Figure 8.2) and agencies responsible for liaison with civilian media. An important
step towards openness and transparency was the introduction of the official Ministry of
Defence web-site www.mil.gov.ua which is visited by over 20,000 persons every month.

The agenda of welfare training and development activities and of the military

media are all aimed at making armed service personnel more aware of general legal
issues relating to their service in the Armed Forces. In addition, specific information
is provided on important policy issues such as Euro-Atlantic integration leading to
the possibility of NATO membership.

An increase in the distribution of military publications is supporting the agenda of

raising awareness to illustrate the improvement the number of copies of the magazine
“Viysko Ukrainy” was increased from 750 to 4,500, the newspaper “Narodna Armia”
increased from 3,500-4,000 to 10,000-12,000 copies. The circulation of regional
newspapers also increased approximately two-fold.

Experimentally, a modernised mobile system designed to provide video/broadcasting/

full-colour printing services in field conditions was used to provide news and information
support to “Response-2005 Exercise”, a joint command and staff exercise with the Joint
Rapid Reaction Forces. Another experiment has been launched to establish unit halls of
fame in the living quarters.

In 2005, to maintain the right of servicemen to

freedom of conscience and to provide adequate welfare
support, chaplains were attached to the Ukrainian
military contingent in Iraq.

In 2006, to promote substantial improvement in

welfare activities, it is planned to:

                     - develop a Concept Paper on Welfare and Support

**for Enlisted Personnel (as from the date of contract to**
the date of retirement);

                      - establish a psychological support service within

the personnel branch of the Armed Forces; draft new
regulations for improved provision of military education.

In 2006, within the framework of a pilot project

associated with the transition to manning the Armed Forces with contracted personnel,
it is planned to stage an experiment in three brigades concerning the organisation of
cultural, educational, social and recreational activities for enlisted personnel.

**Essentially, welfare policies help promote greater**

**efficiency within the Armed Forces through improved**
**levels of morale and discipline. They also provide a focus**
**for the education and development of servicemen.**

With a view to **promoting a positive image of the**

**Armed Forces and increasing the appeal of military**
**service to young people, traditional methods are used:**
e.g. guided tours of military units for pre-conscripts,
particularly, when they are celebrating national

military occasions; public ceremonies and military
band performances; and _Best Marching Song contests_
and _What Do You Know About the Army? quizzes for_
students. Secondary schools are provided with assistance
in furnishing their pre-conscription training rooms with
visual aids and army promotional material and also
information on military academies and contract service.

In 2005, for the first time in the history of the nation’s Armed Forces, a central

source was established to supply schools, executive authorities and military units
with posters promoting activities of the Armed Forces (armed services). A kit of
24 posters was published to enhance the appeal of military service for young people.

A special pilot project has been launched to improve the education of young people

**in military matters. The project, implemented in conjunction with the municipality**
of Ukrainka, Kyiv Oblast, envisages that servicemen will teach classes on the history
of the Armed Forces, drill training, learning marching songs at the city’s schools and
provide some basic information on types of weapons and defence technologies.

The national children’s picture contest, _How I will Defend my Homeland,_

organised jointly with the Ministry of Education and Sciences of Ukraine and the
Ministry of Culture and Tourism, had a positive feedback from the general public.
32,000 children from all regions of Ukraine have participated in this contest.

An important part in educating civil society about military history is played by the

museums operating under the auspices of the Armed Forces. In 2005 the Central Museum
of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and its branches (the Balaklava Naval Memorial Site,
Strategic Missile Troops Museum, Volyn Regional Museum of the Ukrainian Army and
Defence Technologies) hosted over 58 thousand visitors and gave 2,250 guided tours.

Members of the public were especially keen on seeing

the international exhibition _The Red Army Trophies, as_
well as the exposition Golden Treasures of Old Ukraine,
displayed at the Central Museum of the Armed Forces of
Ukraine, and the Hiroshima-Nagasaki exhibition shown at
and created jointly with the Hiroshima Memorial Museum,
Japan, and the Museum of the Strategic Missile Forces.
In 2005 the Balaklava Naval Memorial launched its first
topical exposition dedicated to the history and present day
of the Ukrainian Naval Forces. During that same year,
several photo exhibits were shown, e.g., _Combat Training_
_2005, We Serve Ukraine, Yalta Conference, For the Sake_
_of Peace on Earth, War Children, and The Armed Forces_
_of Ukraine: Past and Present._

An important contribution to the cultural development of military personnel and

to the promotion of the army’s positive image is made by its cultural branches. For
instance, the Armed Forces Song and Dance Ensemble gave a total of 125 concerts
in 2005. The artists were applauded by audiences at many garrisons. The ensemble
made a laudable presentation of Ukrainian national art at the opening ceremony of
the 2005 _Eurovision Song Contest. It also won awards at the international festival_
dedicated to the 60[th] anniversary of the end of World War II that took place in the
People’s Republic of China.

The Armed Forces own 850 sports grounds, over 500 open-air physical training
facilities, 210 gyms, 78 stadiums, 27 swimming pools and 15 shooting ranges. Every
year competitions are held in Olympic sports and army-related sports, contests are
conducted for best organisation of physical training and mass sports events in units
and military educational institutions, and competitions for young people of preconscription age are carried out on the district, city, regional and national levels.

Co-operation is developing with the sports committees of the CIS countries.

Ukrainian military athletes won two first awards, three second awards and a third
award in six events at the 2005 Games in St.Petersburg.

The Armed Forces are a participant of the International Military Sports

Organisation (International Council for Military Sports) that has over 110 member
nations. The Council organises regional championships, World and European
championships and the World Army Games.

Ukrainian military sportsmen won 97 gold, 127 silver and 100 bronze medals at

the World and European championships in 2005.

**Welfare policies are intended to promote a positive atmosphere inside**

The most important social guarantees in the Armed Forces as of today are health

care and housing for all personnel.

**Health care**

Health systems in the Armed Forces are aimed at meeting the medical needs of
military personnel, their families and military veterans. They also maintain the health
status of personnel at the levels required for the effective discharge of their duties.

At present, the Armed Forces of Ukraine run 27 military hospitals, including

the Main Clinical Military Hospital, 4 central military clinical hospitals, 9 basic
military hospitals and 13 garrison hospitals. The health care system has a territorial

To meet the legislative requirements of Ukraine relating to the medical support

of servicemen, veterans of the Ministry of Defence and their families and other
individuals entitled to treatment in the Ministry’s health institutions, the existing
network of treatment institutions in the Armed Forces is undergoing improvement.
As a result, military hospitals are being restructured rather than disbanded in order
to comply with the objectives and standards of health services which should be
provided to their customer base.

Day care centres have now been introduced as an efficient alternative to in-patient

institutions, which ensures adequate standards of care at lower cost.

In view of current requirements, the Armed Forces have reorganised its system

of treatment and health-improving facilities for personnel and the veterans of the
Ministry of Defence. Currently, resort and spa treatment is provided by 10 military
health centres (Figure 8.4).

HOUSING


Provision of housing to the servicemen of the Armed Forces remains a priority of
state social policy, as implemented in compliance with the Programme of Housing
for Retired Servicemen and Reservists and the Integrated Programme of Housing for
Servicemen and their Families.

In spite of these programmes, earlier attempts at solving the problem not only

failed (Figure 8.5), but made the situation even worse because of deferred obligations
and the growing number of dissatisfied personnel.

In 2000-2004, the waiting list of servicemen without housing was reduced by a

mere 9,900 persons.


**Figure 8.5. State of provision of housing to the servicemen of the**
Armed Forces and their family members


The total number of servicemen and veterans

legally entitled to their own dwelling is over 60,000.

As of beginning of 2005, a total of 44,200 persons

were on the Ministry’s waiting list for housing. Of
those 13,000 have been waiting for over 10 years. In
addition, 17,200 persons discharged in 2004-2005 are
entitled by law to receive housing within three years.

Another 17,000 families of persons discharged

with honours are on the waiting lists managed by
local councils, 3,800 of them being military veterans
of 60 years of age and over. Housing issues of this
category of citizens are in the competence of the State
Department for Retired Servicemen and Reservists and
Conversion of Military Bases. In 2005 the Department
was subordinated to the Ministry of Defence.

During 2005, the Ministry of Defence took a

number of effective measures in order to significantly
improve the housing status of servicemen.

As a result of an inquiry into the legality of the waiting list for servicemen

without housing, the list was reduced by 1,638 persons. Thus, an illegal channel
of non-entitled use of defence budget funds reaching nearly UAH 160 million was
eliminated.

A number of measures have been taken to institute rigorous supervision over

allocation of housing to servicemen. Nowadays, the process of allocation is
transparent and well managed. The list of servicemen without apartments and the
names of those who are given housing is posted on the official web-site of the
Ministry of Defence and published in the military media.

UAH 638.4 million were allocated to housing

construction in 2005. The amounts invested into
housing construction have almost tripled when
compared to previous periods. A considerable number
of dubious transactions concerning the allocation of
land or reassignment of property were terminated,
which helped save almost UAH 1 billion.

In 2005, a total of 6,537 apartments were built and

purchased through the well-planned use of allocated
resources, which was 2.3 times more than the figure
for the previous year, i.e. 2,811 apartments.

Of the said number, 6,002 apartments were used

to provide housing for the servicemen on the Ministry
of Defence waiting list. In addition, 535 apartments

were purchased by the State Department for Resettlement of Servicemen and Persons
Transferred to Reserve or Retired, and Defence Conversion for the persons on the
waiting lists with local governments.

The Ministry of Defence intends to solve the housing problem for the servicemen

in Kyiv, Lviv, and Odessa in the course of the coming three years. Particular
attention is being focused on setting up a service housing stock to provide dwellings
to servicemen before they have reached 20 years of service. By the end of 2009 it is
planned to provide additional service housing to nearly 7,000 servicemen.

In 2006, the Ministry of Defence will initiate the development and adoption of a

state housing savings program. This will enable the accrual of funds in personalised
accounts of servicemen (due to Ministry of Defence target subsidies and voluntary
individual contributions of servicemen), so that by the end of 20 calendar years of
service the serviceman will be able to acquire a standard home in any region of
Ukraine. In case of the extension of service over 20 years, the funds in such accounts
will continue to accrue, enabling the holders to buy a higher quality home.


**The Ministry of Defence plans to solve the problem of housing in the Armed**

**Forces in a 3-4 year period by setting up a large pool of service housing and**
**providing housing to persons seeking retirement.**

**The Armed Forces will ensure the observance of the fundamental rights and**

**freedoms of servicemen and their families. The Ministry of Defence will further**
**intensify the welfare and social components of its work. Accountability will**
**become a key requirement of military command and control – senior officers**
**must respect the rights, freedoms and interests of their subordinates and they**
**must protect and improve their conditions of service wherever possible. Troop**
**morale is deemed to be of the highest importance. Compliance with that ethos is**
**essential for the credibility and effectiveness of the Armed Forces.**

##### INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION,
 PEACEKEEPING ACTIVITIES
 AND ARMS CONTROL

nternational co-operation is an essential activity of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine. During 2005 its

#### Iexternal contacts have considerably intensified, in particular at the top level. More than 30 international

events were held in the course of the year which the Minister of Defence of Ukraine attended signing
seven international intergovernmental and interagency agreements. Over 15 working visits and meetings
took place with the participation of the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine resulting
in bilateral arrangements on military co-operation.

Major achievements are noticeable in the development of relations with NATO and the European Union.

Ukrainian policy has become more transparent and understandable for our partners. The new format of
relationship with NATO creates real prospects for Ukraine to acquire membership of the Alliance. Contacts
with CIS member-states, as well as bilateral relations with other foreign countries, are also expanding.

The peacekeeping activities of the Armed Forces are a very important element of Ukraine’s foreign

and defence policy and Ukraine has received considerable international recognition for its positive role
in peacekeeping. In addition Ukraine continues to meet a wide range of other international obligations
and commitments in a responsible manner through international conventions on disarmament and nonproliferation. As a result, Ukraine’s international prestige keeps growing and more partnerships within the
framework of global and regional security are being established.


INTERNATIONAL
CO-OPERATION


The international co-operation policy of the Armed Forces aims at strengthening
confidence among nations, reducing the threat of the use of military force,
implementing a European and Euro-Atlantic integration policy and enhancing the
capabilities of the Armed Forces through interoperability. The ultimate objective of
these policies will hopefully be the accession of Ukraine to NATO.

The key areas of Armed Forces international co-operation

are the following:

          - development of relations with NATO and the EU within the
context of Euro-Atlantic and European integration;

          - co-operation with the CIS member-states in military and
technical spheres;

           - development of bilateral relations with other nations.

**Development of relations with NATO. Co-operation with**

NATO is being developed through a number of activities such
as reciprocal visits, consultations, meetings at the top military
command level; implementation of the NATO-Ukraine Action
Plan and Target Plan; Ukrainian participation in the Partnership
for Peace Programme and in the Planning and Review Process.

During 2005, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine took part in meetings of the

NATO-Ukraine Commission, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council and NATOUkraine consultations at the Defence Ministers level. They resulted in bilateral
arrangements on a number of important aspects of military policy and development
and on agreement for the implementation mechanisms for the NATO-Ukraine Action
Plan. The defence policy of Ukraine and the reform of its Armed Forces were also
discussed in the context of attaining NATO membership.

NATO-Ukraine consultations at the Defence Ministers level were conducted in

Vilnius on October 23-24. Following that, Ukraine and 13 NATO Allies signed a
Letter of Intent confirming support for the NATO-Ukraine Joint Working Group on
a Defence Reform Programme for Professional Development of Civilian Personnel
Employed in Ukrainian Security Institutions.

In December 2005, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine was present at the

Washington session of the South-eastern Europe Defence Ministerial Council

INTERNATIO N A L C O - O P E R AT I O N

where it was declared that Ukraine was joining the organisation whose members are
Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Macedonia, Romania, Slovenia, Turkey
and the USA. The South-eastern Europe Defence Ministerial Council is a connecting
link for the countries of the region with NATO. Through this initiative Ukraine has
demonstrated its willingness to participate fully in regional security systems and
taken another step towards membership of NATO.

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine intensified its international

contacts in 2005. **The Chief** **of the** **General Staff** participated in more than 15
working meetings and visits to Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany,
Hungary, Spain and the USA, which resulted in bilateral agreements on military
co-operation. In June and November 2005, the Chief of the General Staff took
part in meetings of the NATO-Ukraine Military Committee and the Euro-Atlantic
Partnership Military Committee for Chiefs of Staff in Brussels, Belgium.

In 2005, official visits to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were

made by NATO Military Committee Chairman, Commander of Joint US Forces
in Europe, Commander of Joint US Navy in Europe; Chiefs of Staffs of Italy and
Poland, as well as other military officials.

A significant step in development of relations between Ukraine and NATO was

the adoption, in November 2002, of the NATO-Ukraine Action Plan and the annual
NATO-Ukraine Target Plans. The plans were developed and implemented jointly by
the National Security and Defence Council headed by the President of Ukraine and
involving the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as other
central state power agencies.

The main outcomes of the 2005 Target Plan implementation were the development

of the State Programme for the Development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for
2006-2011; restructuring of the Ministry of Defence Main Inspection; establishment
of the Ministry of Defence Public Board; placement into force of the Regulations
“On Adoption of Operational Procedures for the Air Defence Stand-by Forces of the
Armed Forces of Ukraine in Peacetime”, etc.

A new stage in the NATO-Ukraine relationship started in April 2005 when

**Intensified Dialogue was launched. It envisaged that Ukraine’s membership issues**
would be put on the agenda of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council sessions, and
Ukraine would participate in the sessions. Ukraine will also attend the periodic North
Atlantic Council Ambassadorial sessions and hold meetings with the International
Staff and other NATO organisations.

In June 2005, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine drafted and submitted

to NATO the Initial Discussion Paper which was a mandatory condition and the first
stage of Ukraine’s engagement with NATO on Intensified Dialogue.

A working group has been set up at the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine to foster

implementation of the Intensified Dialogue objectives. The Group is to work on defence
issues within the context of Ukrainian Euro-Atlantic integration policy and participate in
drafting the first Annual National Programme of Ukraine’s Membership Action Plan.

Contacts with Bulgarian, Estonian, Lithuanian, UK and US experts as well as

NATO Liaison Office in Ukraine were intensified in order to ensure effectiveness
of the Working Group. The current plan is to invite in 2006 Czech, French, German,
Lithuanian, Polish and Slovakian experts as advisors on development of the abovementioned National Programme.

Ukraine pays significant attention to the participation of its Armed Forces in the

**NATO Partnership for Peace Programme (PfP). It includes, in particular, efforts**
to enhance the capabilities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to ensure interoperability
between partner forces, provide language training to the military and adapt retired
servicemen to civilian life.

Approximately 40% of the 298 events planned for the Programme in 2005 dealt

with the participation of Armed Forces units in multinational military exercises
(Figure 9.1).

INTERNATIO N A L C O - O P E R AT I O N

Nearly 30% of PfP activities in 2005 were aimed

at achieving interoperability of command, control and
_communication systems, logistics, and adoption of_
_NATO staff procedures and standards_ which allows
Ukraine to extend involvement of its Armed Forces in
NATO combined operations and implement provisions
of the Programme.

Another 30% of the activities were related

to _training servicemen of the Armed Forces at_
_professional centres and language schools at Allied_
_and Ukrainian military educational institutions with_
their subsequent internship in command and control
elements.

Nearly 800 officers took language and professional

courses abroad in 2005. A total of 24 representatives

of the Armed Forces worked as interns at the structural departments of the National
Defence Ministry of the Republic of Poland in September 2005 with the purpose
of upgrading the professional level of Armed Forces servicemen, primarily those
serving in the experimental brigades and studying the Polish Army’s experience in
the adoption of NATO standards.

Ten advanced English learning groups have been planned for 2006, with a

12-week course. The network of English language courses to be set up in the Armed
Forces will allow the teaching of up to 1,170 servicemen annually.

NATO-Ukrainian co-operation programmes pay special attention to the problem

of the _adaptation of former servicemen to civilian status. Almost 440 reserve or_
retired servicemen took resettlement courses in 2005. The related NATO expenditure
in this area increased by 30% in 2005 compared to the previous year.

Language courses and professional resettlement centres are currently functioning

in Dnipropetrovsk, Kyiv, Lviv, Odesa and Khmelnytskiy. Further courses and centres
will be started in Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv and Kharkiv (Figure 9.2). Nearly 400 former
servicemen have been provided with jobs as a result of these initiatives, including
75 persons finding work abroad.

_The Project on Disposal of Surplus Weapons and Munitions in Ukraine (see_

Chapter 7 for details) is a particular area of NATO-Ukraine PfP co-operation. NATO
Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer and US President George Bush declared
at the NATO-Ukraine Commission meeting on February 22, 2005 that a PfP TRUST
Fund project on disposal of munitions, small arms and man-portable air defence
systems had been launched.

In November 2005, an Implementation Agreement between the Cabinet of

Ministers of Ukraine and NATO Maintenance and Supply Organisation (NAMSO)
was concluded at the meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Joint Working Group on
Armaments. According to the Agreement, eleven NATO member-states are providing
funding to the project at present and the EU joined the project in December 2005.

Ukraine has been actively participating in the Planning and Review Process

(PARP) since 1995. In all, 54 partnership goals were planned within the Process for
2004-2005, including 10 for the Land Forces, 10 for the Naval Forces and 7 for the
Air Forces.

A meeting of the NATO Political-Military Steering Committee took place on

November 21, 2005. At the meeting NATO experts expressed their appreciation of
the Armed Forces of Ukraine for their achievements in implementing PARP goals.
Fifteen Ukrainian units are currently on the list of PARP-designated capabilities
(Figure 9.3). Eleven of them have been assigned to the Joint Operational Capabilities
Fund within the framework of the NATO Operational Capabilities Concept.

surface sabotage capabilities

Training of these units has been a priority for the Ministry of Defence and the

General Staff since 2005. Thus, an airmobile company, a marine company and a
warship of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were tested in 2005 and the results proved
their readiness to accomplish tasks within NATO multinational formations.

Ukraine is a major contributor to **NATO-led peacekeeping operations. It is**

currently enhancing its participation in the UKRPOLBAT multinational battalion
in Kosovo, and the funding for the Ukrainian component has been provided since
January 1, 2005, by the State Budget. An agreement on supporting the NATO “Active
Endeavour” counterterrorist operation in the Mediterranean has been concluded.
Ukraine has participated in NATO operations in Afghanistan, the Training Mission
in Iraq and the NATO-African Union’s peace-support operation in Sudan.

Ukrainian transport aircraft have provided airlift for cargo and peacekeepers of

Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, UK
and the USA.

**Relations with the European Union are developing within the framework of the**

EU-Ukraine Action Plan. A liaison officer for co-ordination with the EU Military
Staff Group has represented the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine in the European
Union since 2004.

INTERNATIO N A L C O - O P E R AT I O N

Among the aspects Ukraine and the EU discussed within the framework of

**EU-Ukraine Action Plan in 2005 was participation of the Military Service of Law**
and Order units in the EU-led peacekeeping operations in the Balkans as a part of the
International Military Police Battalion.

The Minister of Defence of Ukraine had a meeting with Javier Solana, EU High

Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy during the Ninth EUUkraine Summit in Kyiv, in December 2005. The parties declared that the European
Union would support Ukrainian involvement in the European collective security
system and agreements on Ukrainian participation in the air traffic system and the
global navigation satellite system were signed at the Summit.

In 2005 Ukraine and the European Union concluded agreements on security

implementation procedures for classified information exchange as well as on the
general plan of Ukrainian participation in EU-led crisis response operations.

**Co-operation with the CIS Countries.** Ukraine

makes every effort to maintain a stable level of
constructive co-operation with the CIS. In 2005 a
Ministry of Defence delegation took part in two
meetings of the Defence Ministers Council of the CIS
Member-States (June, Dushanbe; November, Moscow).
As the CIS is being transformed into a mechanism
for negotiations and political consultations, Ukraine
is concentrating its efforts on developing positive
relations with the member-states. Thus, during the
above-mentioned Moscow meeting, the Minister
of Defence of Ukraine met Defence Ministers of
Azerbaijan, Russian Federation, and Tajikistan, and
signed bilateral co-operation plans. An agreement on
co-operation in the area of National aircraft flight
safety was concluded at the bilateral meeting with

the Russian Federation Defence Minister. Plans for bilateral co-operation between
Defence Ministries were also signed with Belarus and Kazakhstan.

**Bilateral Relations with other Countries. As of late 2005, Ukraine has concluded**

international co-operation agreements with nearly 50 countries of the world.

The Ministry of Defence delegation visiting the Republic of Iraq in November

2005 signed a Letter of Intent on co-operation between the Ministries of Defence of
Ukraine and the Republic of Iraq. The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine implemented
the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine to hand over to the Iraqi
Security Forces surplus weapons, equipment and materiel owned by the Ukrainian
Peacekeeping contingent of the Multinational Forces in Iraq.

In July 2005, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine paid an official visit to **the**

**State of Israel for the first time in recent Ukrainian history. As a result of the visit an**
Implementation Agreement on Co-operation in the Military Sphere was signed.

**The implementation of a wide range of international military co-operation**

**plans in 2005 contributed to Ukraine’s national military policy in the context of**
**European and Euro-Atlantic integration.**

International military co-operation is one of the key factors in supporting an

appropriate security policy for Ukraine and in restructuring its Armed Forces. In
view of this, the Ministry of Defence makes every effort to intensify levels of cooperation. It intends, in particular, to turn to medium-term and long-term models for
the planning of international military co-operation. The Armed Forces Military Cooperation Concept and the Regulations on International Co-operation Organisation
in the Armed Forces of Ukraine are being drafted with due regard to national foreign
policy priorities and the requirements of the State Programme for Development of
the Armed Forces of Ukraine for 2006-2011.

PEACEKEEPING
ACTIVITIES


Peacekeeping activities by the Armed Forces of Ukraine are very important and
underpin the Government’s policy regarding the further intensification of Ukraine’s
involvement in international security systems.

Participation by the Armed Forces of Ukraine in international operations and

peace-support missions helps Ukraine gain prestige in the international community
and maintain an adequate level of combat readiness for the Armed Forces. It is an
essential factor for turning the Armed Forces into a professional army.

In 2005 Ukrainian military units and personnel took part in peace-support

missions in nine countries (Figure 9.4). Detailed below is a description of the most
important operations.

**International Forces in Kosovo. A national force formed on the basis of the**

1 Separate Special Battalion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine started operating in
Kosovo in 1999. At present the Ukrainian unit performs its duties as a component of
the Ukrainian-Polish Peacekeeping Battalion within the Multinational Brigade East.
Since early 2005, resource support for the Ukrainian unit has been coming from the
budget appropriations of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.

In 2005, the Battalion personnel escorted about 16,500 motor convoys carrying

humanitarian goods and nearly 100,000 local residents. The Battalion carried out
27,000 patrol missions providing medical and humanitarian aid to about 30,000
residents of the settlements located within the area of responsibility of the Ukrainian
unit. Ukrainian servicemen in Kosovo helped the local population fix 30 kilometres of
power lines and repair ten schools, three hospitals and first-aid centres.

INTERNATIO N A L C O - O P E R AT I O N

In June 2005, the Defence Ministers of Ukraine, Poland

and Lithuania signed the Letter of Intent on the establish­
ment of a joint Ukrainian-Polish-Lithuanian peacekeep­
ing battalion that is to be a component of the Multinational
Division of the Kosovo Peacekeeping Force (KFOR). In
view of the coming restructuring of the International peacesupport forces, the parties are studying the possibility of
setting up a large multinational formation.

**The UN Mission in Lebanon. The 3 Separate Engineer**

Battalion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been operating
as a component of the UN Mission in Lebanon since 2000.
It supervises the territory of some 850 sq. km to the South
of the Al-Litany River with more than 60 settlements.

The personnel of the battalion has destroyed over 6,500 explosives including

3,400 anti-personnel mines, nearly 100 anti-tank mines, 330 shells and more than
1,000 hand grenades. They have checked almost 400 km of roads and about 540,000
sq. m of the territory for explosives, developed 14 helicopter landing sites and
rendered medical assistance to nearly 10,000 local residents.

**The UN Mission in Sierra Leone. The peacekeeping force of the Armed Forces of**

Ukraine in Sierra Leone participated in this mission from 2002 until February 2005. It
comprised the 4 Separate Repair Battalion and the 20 Separate Helicopter Unit.

In the course of the UN peacekeeping operation, the Ukrainian units transported

nearly 175,000 tons of goods, escorted about 120,000 local residents and repaired
4,000 pieces of equipment. It is notable that 100 servicemen from these units have
received Ukrainian State awards, UN awards and Minister of Defence of Ukraine
decorations for exemplary service.

**The UN Mission in Liberia.** The 56 Separate Helicopter Unit of the Armed Forces

of Ukraine has been participating in peacekeeping operations as a component of the UN

Mission in Liberia since 2004. The unit provides air escort for
UN peacekeepers’ movements, it transports cargoes and provides
medical and humanitarian aid. In 2005, it made more than
12,000 flights transporting significant amounts of humanitarian
equipment and more than 44,500 persons. Military pilots of the
unit have flown for about 12 thousand hours.

**Republic of Iraq.** The mission of the Ukrainian

peacekeeping force in the Republic of Iraq ended in 2005.
The 7 Separate Mechanised Brigade of the Armed Forces
of Ukraine had served as part of the Multinational Division
Centre-South from the beginning of the military operation
in Iraq (2003) until May 2005. Later it was reorganised into
a 81 Task Force. The Ukrainian contribution to peace and
stability in Iraq was much appreciated by the coalition allies

and the Iraqi Government. Ukrainian peacekeepers returned to their home country
in December 2005, following the pre-election commitment made by the President of
Ukraine, the Supreme Commander-in-Chief.

Ukraine transferred the area of responsibility of the 81 Task Force to the control

of the 3 Brigade of the 8 Division of the Armed Forces of Iraq. The brigade, with a
strength of 2,700 personnel, was trained by Ukrainian servicemen and certified, with
the participation of American and Polish Command of the Multinational Forces in Iraq,
as ready to perform designated missions. It is worth mentioning that the Ukrainian
peacekeeping contingent in the Republic of Iraq is the only one to have managed the
training of a fully capable formation at a brigade level for the Iraqi Armed Forces.

Ukraine will keep fifty representatives of its Armed Forces in Iraq during 2006 –

to share expertise, co-ordinate training of the Iraqi Security Forces, carry out projects
in reconstruction of the military and civilian infrastructure and render assistance in
training Iraqi law enforcement agencies.

ACTIVITIES IN ARMS
CONTROL AND
NON-PROLIFERATION


Units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are trained for peace-support operations

in Yavoriv Training Centre where the International Centre for Peacekeeping and
Security is currently being organised.

From 2006, specially trained regular units will be assigned to international

peacekeeping operations after they are tested and certified by international experts.
This will enable the officers of command and control elements to master NATO
standard staff procedures and gain experience in co-ordination and co-operation with
the host nation’s civil authorities.

**Ukraine’s peacekeeping co-operation with international organisations is**

**becoming ever more intensive and dynamic. Peace support activities of the**
**Armed Forces are shaping a positive image of Ukraine as a welcome partner for**
**international organisations and leading countries of the world. Ukraine’s efforts**
**offer an important contribution to global and regional security.**

**The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine will continue paying considerable**

**attention to developing the functional potential of its peacekeeping units to**
**promote peace and security.**

Ukraine fully meets its obligations and commitments undertaken within the
framework of international agreements on arms control and non-proliferation. Upon
joining the Australia Group in April 2005 (export control of sensitive chemical and
biological products), Ukraine became a participant in all the international export
control instruments without exception.

Ukraine makes a significant contribution to ensuring international security

Ukraine consistently supports co-operation projects in the areas of non
proliferation, disarmament, counter terrorism operations and nuclear security within
the framework of the Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and
**Materials of Mass Destruction.**

By the end of 2005, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are actively participating in

the implementation of more than 30 international treaties and agreements in the
security and arms control spheres. They support inspection activities of the member
nations within Ukraine, undertake supervision activities abroad and participate in the
exchange of relevant information as stipulated by the international agreements.


**Ukraine’s active participation in arms control and non-proliferation**

**contributes to the establishment of its reputation as an open and reliable**
**partner.**

**To sum up, one can be sure that Ukraine will continue to enhance the**

**international co-operation and peacekeeping activities of the Armed Forces as**
**well as maintain involvement in arms control and non-proliferation, thereby**
**gaining more authority in the world as an influential participant in international**
**security systems.**

**Active participation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the development**

**of multilateral and bilateral military relations will help the country reach its**
**objectives in military reform and development, ensure interoperability between**
**Ukrainian units and those of NATO, strengthen relations among the soldiers of**
**different nations and create a climate of confidence and co-operation.**

##### FUNDING
 OF THE ARMED FORCES

he Law of Ukraine “On Defence of Ukraine” states that national defence needs are to be covered by

#### Tthe State Budget in the amount of not less than 3% of the planned gross domestic product (GDP).

Such a level of funding would provide for all necessary maintenance; restructuring of the Armed

Forces; improvement of command and control and logistic support systems; procurement and upgrading
of weapons and equipment and the welfare support of servicemen. However, the size of the annual
defence budget has never fully complied with the provisions of the Law.

In the past five years the budget appropriations for the Ministry of Defence amounted to 1.37-1.76% of

the GDP. As a result, the actual funding of the Armed Forces was much lower than the stipulated minimum
requirements and did not reach the levels determined in the State Budget.

In 2005, for the first time, the defence budget was fully appropriated. Moreover,
there was a 2% additional allocation (Figure 10.1).

The Armed Forces were funded at up to 50% during 2000-2002,
and at 60-70% during 2003-2004


State budget appropriations

Real funding


The surplus capacity of the Armed Forces resulted in spending more than 80%

of the total budget on fixed overheads. The ability to increase the defence budget
was severely limited by the relatively modest GDP of Ukraine: the World Bank
estimates of purchasing power for Ukraine was nearly $5,000 per capita (compared
to Germany and France – nearly $27,000; Poland – more than $10,000). Under such
conditions only minimum funding was allocated for the development of the Armed
Forces, while most of the defence budget was required to meet existing obligations.

chapter 10


**Figure 10.2. Comparative assessments of cost sharing for needs of**
the Armed Forces in 2005


This resulted in an accumulation of unresolved financial
problems and the continuation of a negative trend that
was common to previous years.

Therefore, the defence budgets for 2000-2004 were

not well balanced and left no headroom for development
or investment as most of the money was committed to
meeting the major fixed cost of personnel.

The experience of developed countries proves

that a well balanced budget should allocate not more
than half of overall appropriations to personnel costs
(Figure 10.2). The critical limit is 75% for personnel
support, anything beyond that can be considered to be
unsustainable in the long term.

As a result of this unbalanced budget approach,

the Ministry of Defence has been unable to provide
adequate resources for key issues such as: weapons
and equipment repair and modernisation; force
training; welfare support; disposal of surplus weapons,
equipment, missiles and munitions; restructuring the
military education system. These problems have now
built up to a critical level in the Armed Forces and
require urgent resolution.

As amendments were introduced to the Law of

Ukraine _On the State Budget of Ukraine for 2005, the_
President, the Government and the Verkhovna Rada
supported the move to increase appropriations for the
Armed Forces from the previously approved level of
UAH 5,294.1 million to UAH 5,925.7 million, or 1.37%
of GDP.

These funds were distributed in the following way:

81.5% were assigned for personnel costs; 12% for
training and reform of the Armed Forces; 6.5% for the
development of weapons, equipment and infrastructure
(Figure 10.2). This scheme of allocation was appropriate
at that point because the overall budget limitations ruled
out any immediate downsizing of the Armed Forces.
Therefore, there was no possibility to redistribute funds
to the priority areas of force training and modernisation
of weapons and equipment.

However, by the imposition of strict fiscal controls

and the elimination of inappropriate expenditure, a more
effective use of budget resources was made possible. As


a result, funding was reallocated to intensify force training and renew some types of
weapons and equipment.

**While drafting the State Programme for 2006-2011, the Ministry of Defence**

**significantly revised the procedure for planning the Armed Forces financial**
**requirements. The Ministry of Defence changed the method of strength-**
**based proportional fund allocation among the armed forces and introduced**
**programme and target-based models of defence budgeting focused on current**
**and mid-term priorities.**

The next step will be to delegate budgeting responsibility down to the level of

individual units and force elements. This will mean that all responsible commanders
will be engaged in the complete budgeting cycle (identification of requirements –

chapter 10


budget bidding – budget distribution – funds allocation – target spending – spending
control). This will enable unit commanders to become active participants in defence
planning. This practice will be progressively introduced from 2006.

In 2005, the Ministry of Defence started, jointly with the Ministry of Finance,

to develop a modern method of budgeting to ensure transparency of budget drafting
and spending. The intention is to utilise EU and NATO nations’ experience in
restructuring the defence budget to provide clarity for every target programme.
Improved regulations and methods for budgeting will be drafted to provide guidance
on budget execution and methods for assessing future expenditure efficiency. These
principles formed the basis for drafting the military budget for 2006.

Measures have also been taken to ensure transparency and control of cash flows

at the Ministry of Defence through the introduction of clear mechanisms of financial
accounting and documents circulation.

**2006 will be a significant year for the Armed Forces as the State Programme of**

**the Armed Forces of Ukraine Development for 2006-2011 will be launched. This**
**year will see the implementation of most of the objectives that are strategically**
**crucial for the whole national defence sector.** According to the adopted State
Budget for 2006, the Ministry of Defence has received UAH 8,9542 million (1.74%
of the GDP), of which UAH 2 billion are to come from the sales of surplus assets of
the Armed Forces.

**By estimates of the Ministry of Defence, the**

**projected defence budget should support the**
**effective implementation of all the objectives set**
**forth for 2006, provided the efforts to improve**
**efficiency in budget spending are successful. The**
**sums have been calculated very thoroughly and**
**allocated to the relevant programmes solely on the**
**basis of priority.**

From 2006, defence budgeting in Ukraine will

gradually reach standards of the developed countries
(Figure 10.3).

In future the Ministry of Defence intends to

radically change the structure of the defence budget
reducing the unsustainable level of expenditure on
personnel costs and shifting the emphasis to increased
spending on force training and weapons and equipment

**Thus, the defence budget planned for 2006 will support the implementation**

##### FINAL CHAPTER

In view of the scope of the missions to be performed by the Ministry of Defence, the
General Staff and other command and control elements, the year 2006 is recognised
as pivotal in creating preconditions for significant changes in the Armed Forces.

A number of amendments will be introduced to the legislation relating to the

Armed Forces, fundamental adjustments will be made in the systems of command
and control and logistics. The downsizing of the Armed Forces will continue and
strict control over all defence economic activities will be exercised.

The Armed Forces are ready to perform the missions assigned to them and fully

implement plans and objectives of the Ministry of Defence.

The priority areas for development in the Armed Forces in 2006 are:

  - consistent build up of combat potential of the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces,

increasing levels of readiness of the Main Defence Forces and introduction of
new systems of combat and mobilisation readiness;

  - enhancing the level of training of the Armed Forces, ensuring full-scale

implementation of training curricula, driving and firing programmes and
flight training of formations within the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces;

  - renewal of weapons and equipment, primarily those of the Joint Rapid

Reaction Forces, as the key condition for maintaining a high level of combat
potential and personnel skills. Principal attention will be focused on the Air
Forces, the Naval Forces, army aviation of the Land Forces, command and
control and reconnaissance abilities of the Armed Forces;

  - continuing the process of establishing a Common Automated Command and

Control System for the Armed Forces in view of their restructuring, and
introduction of standards and staff procedures adopted in NATO countries in
relation to command and control systems;

  - the implementation of Decree of the President of Ukraine no.1043 of May 16,

2005, On Activities For Transition of the Units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine
_to Contractual Manning_ focusing on the proper selection of candidates and
improvements in their conditions of service;

  - strengthening military discipline, adherence to military laws, promotion of

the health and safety of personnel and respect for serviceman’s rights and
freedoms;

  - the introduction of harsh measures to prevent corruption and embezzlement,

overcome professional incompetence of commanding officers and achieve
exemplary discharge of military duty by officers.

The identified areas and measures for development of the Armed Forces have

been supported by the President of Ukraine, the Verkhovna Rada, the Cabinet
of Ministers, the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine and foreign
partners of our State. This support should ensure the successful implementation of
development plans for 2006.

###### ANNEX 1

##### LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK
 FOR THE ACTIVITY OF THE ARMED
 FORCES AND TASKS OF THE MINISTRY
 OF DEFENCE FOR 2006

From the very first days of its independence, Ukraine started creating its own
military legislation. Its first legal act was the Resolution “On Military Formations
in Ukraine” adopted by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on August 24, 1991. It
stated that all the military formations located in the territory of the country were
subordinated to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. The Government was assigned the
task of establishing the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine and start developing the
Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations. The said Resolution started
off the first stage of military development that lasted till 1996.

The first stage of military development was characterised by: simultaneous

development of legislative base for the activities of the Armed Forces and other
military formations of Ukraine, reorganisation of their structures, establishment of
the relevant systems of command and control, logistics, and other elements required
for its functioning.

The following legal acts were adopted to form the structure of security and defence

sector of Ukraine: Resolution of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted on October 11,
1992, that approved the Concept for Defence, and Development of the Armed Forces of
Ukraine; the laws of Ukraine “On National Guards of Ukraine” (November 1991), “On
Border Guards of Ukraine” (November 1991), “On Defence of Ukraine” (December
1991), “On the Armed Forces of Ukraine” (December 1991), “On Alternative (nonmilitary) Service” (December 1991), “On Security Service of Ukraine” (March 1992),
“On Universal Military Duty and Military Service” (March 1992), “On Internal Troops of
the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine” (March 1992), “On Civil Defence of Ukraine”
(February 1993), etc.

Thus, the legislative acts regulated the issues of military duty and military

service, alternative, i.e., non-military duty, and adopted the statutes of the Armed
Forces, which had a positive effect on the further reform of the Armed Forces.

The Constitution, adopted on June 28, 1996, defined the status of Ukraine as a

sovereign, independent, democratic, and rule of law state, justified the need to have
a well-grounded State Programme of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Development that
would identify the directions and priorities for the development of the Armed Forces,
and streamline their tasks, structure, and personnel strength to conform with real and
potential threats and challenges to the national security of Ukraine in the military
sphere, and economic potential of the nation.

In January 1997, the State Programme of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Development

up to 2005 was approved by Decree of the President of Ukraine. Approval of the
Programme marked the beginning of the second stage **of military reform of Ukraine.**

A characteristic feature of that stage was a detailed regulation of all aspects of

security and defence sector. During 1997-2000, 25 laws were passed to regulate
organisation of state defence, mobilisation and mobilisation training, legal regimes


-----

Annex 1


LEGISLATIVE F R A M E W O R K

of the state of war and state of emergency, procedures for access of foreign troops
to the territory of Ukraine, conditions for their stay, as well as procedures for
deployment of units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in other countries. Procedures
for state defence commission were defined, as well as legal regime of property and
economic activity in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

At the **third stage, the President of Ukraine as the Supreme Commander-in-**

Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine took a decision to adjust the above-mentioned
State Programme, taking into account the changes that had occurred in Ukraine
and the world at the end of the twentieth century. By Decree of the President of
Ukraine no.927 issued on July 28, 2000, the second State Programme of Reform and
Development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine up to 2005 was approved, to enter into
force on January 1, 2001.

The third stage is characterised with further improvement of the legislation

concerning the entire Military organisation of state. Functions and competence of
military formations have been clarified and designated, and the functions of nonmilitary and paramilitary formations were defined. The following Laws of Ukraine
were adopted: “On Intelligence Agencies of Ukraine” (March 2001), “On Principles
of National Security of Ukraine” (June 2003), “On Democratic Civilian Control over
Military Organisation and Law Enforcement Agencies of the State” (June 2003), “On
State Border Guard Service of Ukraine” (April 2003), “On National Special Service
of Transportation” (February 2004), “On Legal Principles of Civil Defence” (June
2004), etc.

Issues of military development in Ukraine were regulated at that stage by the

Strategic Defence Bulletin of Ukraine up to 2015 that was approved by Decree of
the President of Ukraine no.670 on June 22, 2004. The Strategic Defence Bulletin
contained results of a profound analysis of the current status of military formations in
Ukraine and its relevance to the contemporary military and strategic situation. It also
defined the ways for restructuring the Defence of the State in line with its strategic
national interests. Special place in the Strategic Defence Bulletin was assigned to
the reform of the Armed Forces of Ukraine up to 2015. The task was set to create the
army of a new type on the basis of the existing capabilities.

According to the Strategic Defence Bulletin, it is envisaged that the main form

of legal and regulatory support to the future development of the Armed Forces of
Ukraine will be the clarification of the existing legal acts and development of the new
national legislation to promote Ukraine’s accession to NATO.

The following important laws and other regulatory and legal acts were passed in

2004 in the military sphere with the purpose of improving the legislative framework
in the field of defence, and ensuring combat readiness of the Armed Forces of
Ukraine:

              - Law of Ukraine “On Amendment of Article 3 of the Law of Ukraine “On the

Armed Forces of Ukraine” (June). Its entering into force marked the beginning

              - Law of Ukraine “On State Guarantees of Welfare Support for Servicemen who

for fulfilment by all governmental agencies, authorities of the Autonomous
Republic of Crimea, as well as local administration bodies within the
