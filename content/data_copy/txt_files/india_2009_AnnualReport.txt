###### GEO STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES

1.1 India is strategically located vis-à-vis
both Continental Asia and the Indian Ocean
Region.  It has a landmass of 3.3 million
square kms and is home to over a billion
people with varying ethnic, linguistic,

religious and cultural backgrounds.

1.2 The topography of India is diverse,
ranging from the snow clad Himalayas with
peaks over 28,000 feet to deserts, thick
jungles and vast plains. The Siachen Glacier
in the North is the world’s highest battle-field,
with posts located as high as 21,000 feet.
India’s Western border runs through deserts,
fertile plains and thickly forested mountains.
The North-Eastern frontier also comprises
steep, high ranges and dense tropical forests.
To the South, there are ranges close to the
sea, inland plateaus interspersed with river
valleys, coastal plains, and far-flung island
territories such as the Lakshadweep to the
West and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands
to the East. On three sides, from Gujarat to
West Bengal, the country is bordered by
the Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean and the Bay
of Bengal. The Andaman & Nicobar Islands
located 1300 km away from the nearest
point on our East coast assume strategic


predominance with respect to the entrance
to the Malacca Straits. In the Arabian Sea, the
Lakshadweep and Minicoy islands, situated
on the sea-lanes of communication running

eastwards from the Persian Gulf and the Red
sea are 450 km away from the nearest point
on the West coast. India is, thus, a maritime
as well as a continental entity.

1.3 The geographical and topographical
diversity, especially on the over 15,000
km long border which we share with seven
neighbouring countries (viz., Afghanistan,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, China,

Bhutan and Nepal),  poses unique challenges
to our Armed Forces.  India’s peninsular

dimension places it adjacent to one of the
most vital sea-lanes of the world stretching
from the Suez Canal and the Persian Gulf to
the Straits of Malacca through which 55,000
ships and much of the oil from the Gulf
region transit each year.

1.4 India’s location at the base of continental
Asia and the top of the Indian Ocean
gives it a vantage point in relation to both
Central Asia and the Indian Ocean Region
(IOR). Additionally, India’s size, strategic

location, trade links and exclusive economic

responsibility on India.


1.5 In the post cold war international

scenario, the 9/11 terrorist attack against the
USA and terrorist strikes in many other parts
of the world have brought about greater
international convergence on security issues
and challenges. The emergence of ideology
linked terrorism, the spread of small arms
and the proliferation of WMD (Weapons of
Mass Destruction) and globalisation of its
economy are some of the factors which link
India’s security directly with the extended
neighbourhood.

1.6 South Asia hosts a diversity of

political experiences and systems. The
region also faces the menace of terrorism
and problems by way of proliferation of arms
and drugs.  Against this background, India
stands as a bulwark against fundamentalism
and extremism. It is a centre of economic
dynamism in the region and as a plural
democracy, a bastion of stability and peaceful
coexistence.

###### THE GLOBAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT

1.8 The developments in 2009, particularly
the challenges confronting the global

financial system, created strains in the global
security environment.  The difficulties in
the US financial system spread to the world
economy with economic growth slowing
down in several countries.

1.9 The foreign and security policies of the
new US Administration attracted the attention
of the international community.  In March
2009, the US announced a comprehensive,
new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan.
On December 1, 2009, the US President
announced the deployment of an additional
30,000 US troops in the region by May
2010 and indicated a July 2011 timeframe
for possible start of return of US troops from
Afghanistan.  The PM’s visit to Washington
has ushered in a phase of consolidation in
the bilateral relationship.

1.10 India has had strong diplomatic and
defence ties with Russia and bilateral

1.15 The security situation in some areas
of the African region continues to cause
concern. The incidents of piracy off the coast
of East Africa pose dangers to the safety of the
sea lanes. The linkages between terrorists
based in Somalia and transnational organised
crime is a cause of major concern globally.
The Indian Navy has been actively involved
in combating maritime piracy in the region
on its own and in coordination with the
navies of other countries. India has also been
actively involved in peacekeeping operations
in Africa under the UN mandate and seeks to
consolidate its relations with many countries

of neighbouring countries to achieve growth
and prosperity. Ensuring the safety and

security of its citizens remained an important
priority for India.

1.17 Security related developments

in Pakistan continued to impact on our
regional security environment. The Pakistani
Government made some progress in tackling
_jihadi insurgency in Swat and the adjacent_
districts and also in South Waziristan. The
increasing incidence of terrorism within
Pakistan targeting, inter alia, the security
establishment and senior military personnel,
and the rising tide of extremism underlined
the serious threat to Pakistan itself and to
the region. The continued infiltrations
across the LOC and the existence of terrorist
camps across the India-Pak border however,
demonstrate the continuing ambivalence
of Pakistan in its actions against terrorist
organisations.   India has exercised
exemplary restraint in the face of gravest
provocation. Pakistan needs to take effective

steps to address India’s concern on terrorism
directed against it from the territory under
Pakistan control. India has never shut the
door for dialogue with Pakistan, and is of the


1.16 South Asia saw unfolding of two
main trends. On the one hand, there was a
resurgence of democratic processes. On

prosperous neighbourhood is an integral part
of India’s security construct.

1.18 In Afghanistan, the International

Security Assistance Force (ISAF), led by

the USA, continues to support the nascent
Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF)
in the provision of security throughout the
country. The overall security picture has been
mixed. Violence rose sharply in parts of the
South, South-East and South-West, leading
to a significant overall increase in casualties
from 2007 onwards. With the announcement
of deployment of additional US troops and
the likely increase in the troop deployment
of other ISAF countries, there was some

stepping up of support to the Afghan
Government and people in this challenging
year through a better coordinated approach.
The security and stability of Afghanistan is
critical to India’s own security concerns.
The ultimate solution to ensuring the security
of Afghanistan lies in training an Afghan


force to engage the Taliban, undermining

support for the Taliban and dealing with the

Al Qaeda’s forces along the Pakistani border

and in the rest of Afghanistan. India remained

committed to a pluralistic, democratic and

prosperous Afghanistan and to continue its

development partnership with Afghanistan

which has earned it tremendous goodwill

from the people of that country.

1.19 China is engaged in building

its Comprehensive National Power

encompassing economic and military

development, which would enable her to play

a dominant role in global affairs. India has a

Strategic and Cooperative Partnership with

China which has generally progressed well

in 2009-10. There has been a convergence

of views and action on various issues in
international fora. A regular mechanism for

exchanges in the military sphere has been
established through the ongoing confidence

building measures between the Armed
Forces of both countries and other military
interactions. India seeks to engage China
to find commonalities which can give depth
to the bilateral relationship and enable both
countries to pursue the common goals of
growth and development.

1.20 India also remains conscious and alert
about the implications of China’s military
modernisation on the regional and national
security situation. India continues to engage
with China to develop mutual trust and
understanding, including between the Armed
Forces of the two sides.

1.21 India and Nepal share a unique
relationship of friendship and cooperation
characterised by open borders and deeprooted people-to-people contacts of kinship
and culture. As a close friend and neighbour,
India stands committed to support the people
and the government of Nepal in consolidating
the peaceful democratic transition and in
its economic developmental efforts. India
supports Nepal’s quest to establish a multi
party democracy. A peaceful, stable and
prosperous Nepal is not only beneficial for its
people, but also for India and the region.

1.22 Relations with Bangladesh have been
strengthened since the restoration of multiparty democracy in that country. India is
appreciative of the increasing cooperation
with Bangladesh in security matters,

especially vis-à-vis Indian insurgent groups


operating from its territory. India looks
forward to a further intensification of bilateral
ties, which, in turn, should contribute to
the improvement of the regional security
scenario.

1.23 Myanmar, which is located at the trijunction of South and Southeast Asia holds
importance for India in security terms. India
continues to engage Myanmar in a range of
developmental issues as well as in enhancing
connectivity, power, telecommunication,

energy, trade and economic cooperation.
Cooperation in security matters is also being
enhanced .

1.24 With the conclusion of operations
against the LTTE, Sri Lanka has a historic
opportunity to find a lasting political

settlement to the conflict where all citizens,
including the Tamils, can live in peace.
India is already working with the Sri
Lankan Government in its rehabilitation
and reconstruction efforts in Northern Sri
Lanka and stands ready to enhance bilateral
cooperation in a range of areas.

1.25 India has warm and cordial ties with
Bhutan, which are founded on mutual trust
and understanding, shared interest and
extensive cooperation in areas such as power,
transport, communications infrastructure,

education, IT, Industry, medicine and

agriculture. India is committed to assist the
Royal Government of Bhutan in its socioeconomic development.

#### The principal task of the Ministry is to frame
###### policy directions on defence and security related matters and communicate them for implementation to the Services Headquarters, ISOs, Production Establishments and Research & Development Organisations


###### ORGANISATIONAL SET-UP AND FUNCTIONS

2.1 After independence, Ministry of

Defence was created under the charge of
a Cabinet Minister and each Service was
placed under its own Commander-in-Chief.
In 1955, the Commanders-in-Chief were
renamed as the Chief of the Army Staff, the
Chief of the Naval Staff and the Chief of the
Air Staff. In November 1962, a Department of
Defence Production was set up to deal with
research, development and production of
defence equipments. In November 1965, the
Department of Defence Supplies was created
for planning and execution of schemes for
import substitution of defence requirements.
These two Departments were later merged
to form the Department of Defence

Production and Supplies. ­ In 2004, the name
of Department of Defence Production and
Supplies was changed to Department of
Defence Production. In 1980, the Department
of Defence Research and Development was
created. In 2004, the Department of ExServicemen Welfare was created.

2.2 The Defence Secretary functions as

head of the Department of Defence and is


additionally responsible for co-ordinating
the activities of the four Departments in the
Ministry.

###### DEPARTMENTS

2.3 The principal task of the Ministry is

to frame policy directions on defence and
security related matters and communicate

them for implementation to the Services
Headquarters, Inter-Service Organisations,

to ensure effective implementation of the
Government’s policy directions and the
execution of approved programmes within
the allocated resources.

2.4 The principal functions of the

Departments are as follows:

(i) The Department of Defence deals with
the Integrated Defence Staff (IDS) and
three Services and various Inter-Service
Organisations. It is also responsible
for the Defence Budget, establishment

Capability Plan are under preparation.

Various efforts are in hand to widen the

Defence Industrial Base and encourage/

promote greater participation of the Private

Industry. A Technology Perspective and

Capability Roadmap is under preparation and

will be hosted on MoD website to enable


industry to understand the requirements of

the Armed Forces.

2.8 **Tri Services Joint Exercise: Exercise**

MADAD II was the first Tri Services Joint
exercise carried out under the aegis of HQ
IDS in October 2009. The exercise was
unique in the sense that participation was
from all the services and highlight of the
exercise was the coordination, execution and
communication aspects of the three Services
in the true spirit of jointmanship. The exercise
validated the requirements of communication
needs and logistics requirements of a joint

exercise for future application of joint forces

for any task.

2.9 **Disaster** **Management:** The

streamlined mechanism set up by HQ IDS

contributes immensely towards providing

timely and desired succor to affected

population. Some of the important relief

operations coordinated were:
(a) Medical Aid to the internally displaced
Tamils in Sri Lanka.

(b) Armed Forces relief operations in West
Bengal affected by Cyclone AILA.

(c) Armed Forces response to the floods
in West Bengal, Karnataka and Andhra
Pradesh.

2.10 **Integrated Space Cell (ISC):** A single
point contact for all space related activities
of the tri-services was formally sanctioned
by Govt. in August 2009, under DCIDS
(Ops)/ HQ IDS. ISC, being a nodal point,
has successfully quantified the overall

satellite communication requirements of the
three services till 2020, in consultation with
the respective service. The same is being
coordinated with ISRO to meet Services
requirements.

2.11 **Satellite Based Imagery: Under MoD,**
satellite imaging facilities have been set up
for use by all strategic users. Efficacy of these
facilities has further been enhanced with the
commissioning of Central Archival Facility
(CAF).

2.12 **Centre for Joint Warfare Studies**
**(CENJOWS):** The Centre for Joint Warfare
Studies despite infancy, continued to grow in
stature. The Centre is guided by the Patron-inChief, Raksha Mantri. The Centre conducted


three significant  seminars on War against
Global Terror, Special Operations and

Intelligence Sharing and Command, Control,
Communication & Computer and Intelligence
& Interoperability (C[4] I[2]). CENJOWS also
carried out an incisive study on India’s
Strategic Option in Afghanistan.

2.13 **Joint Doctrine: The joint Doctrines of**
Maritime Air Operations, Sub Conventional
Operations and Electronic Warfare have been
prepared and are being published.

###### SERVICES HEADQUARTERS

2.14 The three Services Headquarters,

viz., the Army Headquarters, the Naval
Headquarters and the Air Headquarters
function under the Chief of the Army
Staff (COAS), the Chief of the Naval Staff
(CNS) and the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS)
respectively. They are assisted by their
Principal Staff Officers (PSOs). The InterService Organisations, under the Department
of Defence are responsible for carrying
out tasks related to common needs of the
three Services such as medical care, public
relations and personnel management of
civilian staff in the Defence Headquarters.

2.15 A number of Committees dealing with
defence related activities assist Raksha Mantri.
The Chiefs of Staff Committee is a forum for
the Service Chiefs to discuss matters having
a bearing on the activities of the Services and
also to advise the Ministry. The position of
Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee

devolves on the longest serving Chief of Staff,

and consequently rotates amongst the three
Services.

by Secretary (Defence Finance)/Financial
Adviser (Defence Services) and is fully
integrated with the Ministry of Defence and
performs an advisory role.

2.20 To facilitate greater combat readiness
and quicker decision making, Ministry
of Defence enjoys enhanced delegated
financial powers in consultation with

Finance Division. With a view to ensuring
transparency in exercise of these powers
and compliance with laid down policy
guidelines, Defence Procurement Procedure
and Defence Procurement Manual were
brought out in 2005. While the Defence
Procurement Procedure deals with capital
acquisitions, the Defence Procurement

Manual deals with revenue procurements.
The Defence Procurement Procedure and
Defence Procurement Manual have been
revised to incorporate experiences gained
since 2005.


2.22 The Defence Procurement Procedure
2008 aims at ensuring expeditious

procurement of the approved requirements
of the Armed Forces in terms of capabilities
sought. It puts emphasis on highest degree
of probity and public accountability,

transparency in operations, free competition
and impartiality. In addition, the goal of
achieving self-reliance in defence equipment
is also kept in mind. Further, the offset
policy, which requires foreign vendors
involved in projects to actively invest in
Indian firms and joint ventures, has been
rationalized to include offset credit banking
which will enable foreign participants to
create offset programmes in anticipation of
future obligations.

2.23 As a further step towards achieving
the objective of increased self-reliance,
greater private sector participation, enhanced
transparency and greater clarity in Defence
capital acquisition, following amendments
have been issued in the form of Defence
Procurement Procedure, 2008 (Amendment2009), effective from November 1, 2009:

provisions for change of offset partner

in exceptional cases.

2.24 Defence Procurement Manual 2006

contained the procedure to be followed for

procurements out of the revenue budget.

This Manual has been revised in consultation

with the Services and other Departments

of the Ministry of Defence, taking into

account the experience gained since the

promulgation of DPM 2006. The revised

Defence Procurement Manual 2009 (DPM

2009), issued in March 2009 is effective

from June 1, 2009.

2.25 The procedure laid down in DPM

2009 is applicable to all wings of the

Ministry of Defence and Defence Services,

as well as organizations such as the Coast

Guard and JAKLI for which budgetary

allocation is made in the Demand for

Grants of the Ministry of Defence (Civil).
The revised Manual is also applicable
to procurement of certain capital items,
medical equipment (both under revenue
and capital heads) and to purchases made
by the Defence Services from grants placed
at their disposal by other Ministries and
Departments. The Ordnance Factories and
the Defence Research & Development
Organization will continue to follow their


own Manuals which, however, would need

to be reviewed to bring them in conformity

with the provisions of DPM 2009.

2.26 The main objective of the revision

has been to simplify the procedure, provide

enough flexibility without compromising

on transparency and propriety, as also to

remove the difficulties experienced while

processing purchase proposals under DPM

2006. Two new chapters have been added

in DPM 2009. One of these chapters

deals with offloading of partial/complete

refits/ repairs of ships/ submarines/ crafts/

assets to Indian PSUs/ private shipyards/

trade. The other chapter deals with design,

development and fabrication contracts. This

should facilitate placement of developmental

orders aimed at indigenization and import

substitution.

2.27 Finance Division prepares and

monitors Defence Services Estimates, Civil

Estimates of the Ministry of Defence and the

Estimates in respect of Defence Pensions.

Break-up of the actual expenditure for the

years 2007-08 and 2008-09, as also the

Revised Estimates for 2009-10 and Budget

Estimates for 2010-11 in respect of Defence

Services Estimates are given in Table No.

### The Indian Army has a vision to consolidate
###### itself into a highly motivated, optimally equipped, modernised, operationally ready force, capable of functioning in a synergised joint service environment, across the spectrum of conflict.


3.1 The Indian Army (IA) has a vision to
consolidate itself into a highly motivated,
optimally equipped, modernised,

operationally ready force, capable of

functioning in a synergised joint service
environment, across the spectrum of conflict.
The Indian Army’s role is essentially for
deployment along the borders. It has also
been contributing in the spheres of internal
security and disaster management as an aid
to civil authority, whenever the situation has
demanded.

###### MODERNISATION

3.2 The modernization and transformation of
the Army is being actively
pursued to constantly

evolve and develop

requisite capabilities so that
there is a lethal, agile and
networked force prepared
to meet the complex

security challenges of the
21[st] century. The focus of
modernisation efforts is

on precision fire power,
air defence, aviation,

infantry soldier as a system,

infrastructure development,


network centricity and achieving battle field
transparency through improved surveillance,
night vision and target acquisition. A
number of measures have been initiated
to ensure optimal fructification of

modernization plans.

###### ARM/ SERVICE WISE MODERNISATION INITIATIVES

3.3 Armoured Corps:   The Armoured Corps
is in the process of rapid modernization as
per the requirements of changing battle field
scenario. There is a focus on upgradation of

3.9 **Army** **Aviation:** Procurement

action for replacement of existing

reconnaissance & surveillance helicopter by
a modern helicopter with better capabilities
is being pursued. Army Aviation is geared to
weaponise the indigenously manufactured
Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) to provide
teeth to the existing fleet.

3.10 **Army Air Defence:** The Corps of
Army Air Defence is taking major strides
in upgrading its gun systems. To enhance
surveillance capabilities, upgraded Super
Fledaur Maus and Flycatcher are planned to
be replaced by 3D Tactical Control and Low
Level Light Weight Radars. Self Propelled
Air Defence Gun Missile System would also
be upgraded. Procurement of successors to
the vintage missile systems are also in the
pipeline.


###### SECURITY OVERVIEW

3.11 The security challenges that face the
nation today are varied, sophisticated and
complex. From maintaining a constant
vigil on the country’s unsettled borders, to
combating a proxy war in Jammu & Kashmir
(J&K) and terrorist strikes or insurgencies in
the North East; the Indian Army is committed
to   the  defence   of  the country.
Additionally,  the Army is also geared to
provide assistance to civil authority when
required.

3.12 The Army reviews operational

preparedness/ postures in the context of
these threats.

###### JAMMU AND KASHMIR

3.13 The overall security situation in J&K
has undergone an appreciable change and
is well under control of the Security Forces
(SF). All parameters of proxy war are at an all
time low and the current situation indicates
a shift towards normalcy and peace. The
growing stability in the State is indicative of
the success of the untiring efforts of all SF
which includes the Army’s Counter Terrorist
(CT) efforts.

3.14 **Situation Along the Borders/ Line of**
**Control:** The cease fire on the borders is
holding out with a few minor aberrations.
Such violations are being taken up through
the established mechanism of local level flag
meetings and the Director General Military
Operations hotline.


3.15 Counter infiltration measures adopted
Reaching for the skies
by the Army have been further strengthened.

24


-----

Infiltration attempts, however,
continue. During the period
April 1, 2009 to February,
28, 2010, 33 infiltration bids
have been eliminated with 50
terrorists killed while attempting
to infiltrate.

3.16 **Situation in Hinterland: During 2009-**
10, the Army killed 213 and apprehended
68 terrorists. The terrorist leadership is being
successfully targeted, and 17 leaders have
been killed during the period.

###### North East

3.17 **Assam:   Relentless operations by the**
Army and Assam Rifles against the United
Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA), the largest
Under Ground (UG) group in the State, has
resulted in neutralisation of bulk of its junior
and middle level leaders. Severe attrition and
demoralization has also triggered a spate of


Front of Bodoland (NDFB), Dimasa Halam
Doagah (DHD) and United Peoples

Democratic Solidarity (UPDS) has resulted in
relative peace and stability in most parts of
Assam.

3.19 In South Assam, the unconditional
surrender by a number of cadres of DHD
(Jewel Garlossa) and DHD (Jewel Garlossa)
Splinter Group, has brought peace in the
area. Operations are continuing to force
some more armed cadres to surrender. The
work on infrastructure projects has resumed.

between the National Socialist Council of
Nagaland (Issac & Muivah) (NSCN (IM))

-----

and National Socialist Council of Nagaland
(Khaplang) (NSCN (K)) have reduced

considerably. The Army and Assam Rifles
(AR) are keeping the UG groups under
check and ensuring that the UG groups
adhere to the Ceasefire Ground Rules. The
reconciliation process has also gained

momentum.

3.21 **Manipur: Operations by the Army and**
Assam Rifles continued in the State during
the year and a number of cadres of various
outfits were eliminated and apprehended by
the SF in 2009. The insurgent groups have
also intensified their anti SF activities. The
‘Suspension of Operation Agreement’ with
Kuki and Zomi UG Groups has ushered
in peace in the Kuki and Zomi inhabited
areas. Peace talks with Meitei UG group,
Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP) are in
progress. The success of these talks is likely
to mount pressure on other Valley Based
Insurgency Groups (VBIGs) to join the
peace process. Lately, the de-notified area
in Manipur has seen a surge in violence,
protests, blockades of highways and

economic shutdown. The protests in the state
are being funded by insurgent groups, who
are using front organisations to continuously
fuel the agitation. The mindless violence and
kidnappings by VBIGs are being increasingly
resented by people, who are openly opposing
their diktats.

###### NAXAL VIOLENCE

3.22 The Army has assisted in the task
of controlling the menace of Left Wing
Extremism (LWE), commonly termed as


‘Naxalism’ and ‘Maoist insurgency’ by
providing advice and assistance in training

the Para Military Forces/ Central Police
Organisation Battalions and State Police
personnel for counter insurgency operations.

###### SITUATION ALONG THE LINE OF ACTUAL CONTROL (LAC)

3.23 China’s impetus to the modernization
of her Armed Forces and force projection
capability and rapid infrastructure

development in the Tibet Autonomous
Region (TAR) and Xinijang Province has
considerably upgraded China’s military force
projection capability and strategic operational
flexibility.

3.24 Government of India is fully seized
of the security needs of the country as well
as the requirement of development of
infrastructure in the border areas. Necessary
steps have been initiated for the upgradation
of our infrastructure and force structuring to
secure the desired national security objectives
along the Northern borders. A holistic review
of own infrastructural development and
military modernisation programme has been
undertaken along with the overall Border
Areas Development Programme. Strategically
important infrastructure requirements along
the LAC have been identified and are being
developed in a phased manner.

###### RASHTRIYA RIFLES

need to set up in-house facilities for rotable
overhaul. 515 Army Base Workshop has
been nominated for overhaul of 99 rotables
of Cheetah/Chetak helicopters in a phased
manner with Transfer of Technology from
HAL.

3.33 Indigenisation: The Army Base

Workshops and newly raised Department
of Indigenisation have been instrumental
in enhancing the overall indigenisation
process. The indigenisation contribution
rose from 13% to 37% during the year. A
target of achieving 60% indigenisation in a
year’s time has been fixed.

###### KITTING OF TROOPS

3.34 **Special Clothing: The constitution**
of Empowered Committee has enabled
accelerated procurement of state-of-the
art special clothing and mountaineering
equipment. All procurements for the year
2009 – 10 were completed.

3.35 Personnel Kitting: Concrete steps to

improve quality of clothing in the Army are
underway. One additional Olive Green (OG)
uniform and two additional OG Trousers
(for Shirt Angola) have been authorised to
Personnel Below Officers Rank (PBOR). A
pilot project for issuing OG clothing instead
of stitched uniform is in final stages of
conclusion. Popular shoe brands are being
trial evaluated.

the Army, which focused on strong IT
infrastructure, Operational Information

System (OIS), Management of Information
Technology (MIS) and trained manpower
has now incorporated in its scope the need
for the Army to become a Network Centric
Force. The Army’s **vision has been revised**
as “To facilitate transformation of Indian
Army into a dynamic Network Centric
Force, achieving info superiority through
effective management of IT”. Integration

###### INDIAN NAVY

Naval Power

33


-----

### The Indian Navy by virtue of its capability,
###### strategic positioning and robust presence in the areas of interest has been a catalyst for peace, tranquillity and stability in the Indian Ocean Region(IOR)


4.1 The Indian Navy is the prime

manifestation of the maritime power of the

country. The _raison d’etre is to safeguard_

the nation’s use of the seas for its legitimate

sovereign purposes, whilst concurrently

guarding against inimical use of the sea

by others. The Indian Navy by virtue of its

capability, strategic positioning and robust

presence in the areas of interest has been a

catalyst for peace, tranquillity and stability

in the Indian Ocean Region(IOR). During

the year, the Indian Navy has engaged

other maritime nations, to support national

initiatives of cooperation and engagement.

The operational activities have been

conducted to ensure a measure of stability

and tranquillity in the waters around our areas

of interest, so as to support the maritime trade

and energy flow, on which the economy

is critically dependent. Ensuring security

and stability becomes important since the

enhanced use of the seas, for maritime trade,

shipping, fishing, natural and energy resource

extraction, security of our seaborne, off
shore and coastal assets, etc is essential for
economic well being.

4.2 The Indian Navy has always responded

swiftly and efficiently to the various


challenges, be it in safeguarding our frontiers,

or sea trade. To achieve its mandated tasks,

the Indian Navy is enhancing its capabilities,

cooperation and inter-operability with

regional and extra-regional navies. Apart

from combating piracy and terrorism at sea,

the Indian Navy has actively participated in

survey, providing Search and Rescue facilities

to those in distress, coordinating navigational

warnings over vast oceanic and littoral areas.

In order to fulfil its mandated task of coastal

security, the Indian Navy has undertaken

numerous measures for enhancement of

capabilities alongwith the Indian Coast Guard

for ensuring surveillance and security in this

zone.

###### COASTAL SECURITY

4.3 India has a very long coastline of

7516 km. Coastal Security for this length has

assumed significance in recent times to meet

challenges of threats from the sea. The Indian

Navy has been designated as the authority

responsible for overall maritime security

which includes coastal security and offshore

security. For this purpose, the Indian Navy is

assisted by Coast Guard, State Marine police

and other Central and State agencies for the


34


-----

High Level Coastal Security Meeting


coastal defence of the nation. To achieve the

objective, an integrated approach has been

adopted by Navy in coordination with other

security agencies. The intelligence-sharing

mechanism has been streamlined through

the creation of Joint Operation Centres and

multi agency coordination mechanism. The

coastal surveillance and patrolling has been

enhanced both by Navy and Coast Guard.

Joint and operational exercises are conducted

on regular basis between Navy, Coast Guard,

Coastal Police, Customs and others in

order to check the effectiveness of the new

system. Navy along with Coast Guard has

undertaken numerous awareness campaigns

all along the coast to sensitise fishermen and

local populace to the challenges of coastal

security.


###### NEW PROJECTS/ INDUCTIONS

4.4 The process of modernization of the

Indian Navy is progressing at the desired

pace. New acquisitions programs and projects

will enhance its capability and preparedness.

The Indian Navy remains committed to the

process of indigenisation for enhancement of

capability. The national ship building industry

has substantially contributed in enhancing

maritime capability, in terms of force
accretion. In the immediate future, the Indian

Navy plans to acquire ships, submarines and

aircraft in accordance with the long term

Maritime Capability Plan.

###### OVERSEAS OPERATIONS

4.5 **Overseas Deployment:** Overseas

deployments are undertaken by ships of


35

Indian Navy in support of foreign policy.
Such missions are for Flag showing, fostering

better relations with friendly countries and
enhancing foreign cooperation. Important
Overseas activities in 2009 included

### T he IAF, one of the finest Air Forces in the world,
###### is on path to develop an entirely new generation of capabilities and the challenge is to smoothly integrate new technology while fulfilling the responsibility of the guardian of our airspace


5.1 Over the years the IAF has grown in

stature and capability and has evolved into
one of the finest Air Forces in the world. New
sets of challenges require new methods to be
adopted to neutralize them. Speed of response
and flexible application of Aerospace power
is the key to success in such situations. Today
IAF is on path to develop an entirely new
generation of capabilities. The challenge is
to smoothly integrate new technology while
fulfilling the responsibility of the guardian of
our airspace. The developments during the
year are detailed in the following paragraphs.

5.2 **Integrated Air Command Control**

**System Project (IACCS):** An IACCS was
conceived for the Air Defence of Indian
Borders after evaluating foreign systems and
taking into consideration the emergence of
Indian Software industry, it was decided to
go the indigenous way. The five systems
were to be installed at five IACCS nodes in
western and south western fronts of the
country. Successful installation of the Voice
Communication & Control (VCCS) System
has already started in the western sector.

5.3 **Network** **Centric** **Operations:** In

today’s era of information superiority there
is urgent need to exploit this domain and
thereby realize our operational requirement.


This entails visualizing future war waging
ability in the context of acquiring cutting edge
technology henceforth and how it can mesh
into doctrine of network centric operations
for the next two decades or so. Towards this,
IAF has embarked on certain major projects
viz Operational Data Link (ODL), Airborne
Warning and Control System (AWACS),
Airborne Early Warning & Control System
(AEW&C), Communication Equipment,

Radars of various ranges, Modernization of
Air Field Infrastructure (MAFI) etc.

###### AIRCRAFT ACQUISITION

### The Department of Defence Production deals with
###### the indigenization, development and production of defence equipment both in the public and private sectors


7.1 The Department of Defence

Production deals with the indigenization,
development and production of defence
equipment both in the public and private
sectors. The Department has Defence Public

Sector Undertakings and ordnance factories
with a wide-ranging production infrastructure.
The products include aircraft and helicopters,
warships, submarines, heavy vehicles and
earthmovers, guns, missiles, ammunition,
a variety of communication and electronic
devices and components for the defence
sector, and alloys and special purpose steel.

7.2 Since Independence, the defence

production sector has been developing

steadily, with the objective of achieving selfreliance. Industries in this sector have been
continually striving to update and improve
their manufacturing capacity by developing
and accessing new technology and through
joint ventures with leading companies in
different fields. They have also been focusing
on indigenization of Defence products and
platforms.

7.3 Defence equipment today is very
technology intensive and demands high
levels of precision and quality control during

manufacture. The Directorate Generals


of Quality Assurance and Aeronautical
Quality Assurance and the Directorate of
Standardization have been set up to ensure
quality levels. Quality assurance is a high
priority area and continual improvements

in the standards and testing facilities is
a requirement. The need to develop
specifications jointly agreed to by the armed
forces is addressed by the Directorate of
Standardization.

7.4 The following are the major

organizations with the Department of

Defence Production:

Ø Ordnance Factory Board

Laboratories and as Doctors and Nursing

Officers in the Armed Forces. With the

17.2 **Women Officers in the Army: Women**

officers have been serving in the Armed

Forces for about 80 years, first inducted in

the Military Nursing Service in 1927 and then

in the Medical Officers cadre in 1943. In the

Armed Forces Medical Services there are both

Commissioned Officers in the Corps of
Engineers, Corps of Electrical and Mechanical
Engineers, Army Air Defence, Corps of
Signals, Army Service Corps, Army Ordnance
Corps, Intelligence Corps, Army Education
Corps and Judge Advocate General’s

Department.

17.4 In a significant step, the tenure of
Women Officers in Short Service Commission
has been increased to 10 years extendable
upto 14 years of service. Besides, their
promotional avenues have been substantially
enhanced. Earlier, they were eligible for only
one promotion, viz., to the rank of Major
after 5 years of service. Women Short Service
Commissioned Officers in the Army are now
eligible for grant of time-scale substantive
promotions to the rank of Captain, Major
and Lt. Colonel Rank after 2, 6 and 13


years of reckonable service respectively.
This is at par with the promotions available
to the Permanent Commissioned Officers.
In addition, with a view to ensuring gender
equality, the training period of women
officers in the Army in Short Service
Commission has been increased from 24
weeks to 49 weeks, to be at par with male
Short Service Commissioned Officers.

17.5 The Government has approved

grant of Permanent Commission to Short

###### INDIAN AIR FORCE

17.8 Women were inducted into the IAF
from 1993. It has been the endeavour of the
service to give every opportunity to women
to participate and excel in all spheres of
employment. Women are employed in all
the branches of the IAF, including the flying
branch. Recently the IAF has taken a major
step forward and one woman pilot is trained
on the Heavy-Lift IL-76 aircraft. IAF maintains
identical standards in terms of eligibility
criteria, training pattern and duration, and inservice training courses etc. Women officers
are eligible for promotion at identical service
seniority and similar criteria as their male
counterparts, and also hold appointments in
the service which are supervisory in nature.

17.9 Eligible women are recruited as

Short Service Commissioned Officers in the
branches of Flying, Aeronautical Engineering
(Electronics), Aeronautical Engineering

(Mechanical), Education, Administration,

Logistics, Accounts and Meteorology. Recently,
it has been decided to grant Permanent

202


Commission to women in Education, Accounts
and Admin (Legal) branches in the IAF from
the training courses commencing in January
2009.

17.10 Women officers are encouraged and
strongly supported in undertaking adventure
activities. They regularly participate in ParaJumping, Sky-diving, river rafting, skiing,
trekking and Mountaineering. Several

women are part of the IAF’s Sky-diving Team
‘Akashganga’ and participate in the display
events all over the country. Similarly, women
participate in several sports activities through
the IAF.

17.11 **Welfare and Resettlement: Over 85%**
of all women officers married to serving IAF
officers are co-located with their husbands –
an unmatched record in the Armed Forces,
and probably for any organisation with
11,000 officers, hundreds of far-flung bases
and dozens of professional specialities.
Women officers in the family way have a
lower medical category which ensures their
employment on light duties during the antenatal period. All women officers are entitled
to full maternity leave on full pay.

17.12 Towards rehabilitation of released SSC
women officers, the Air Force coordinates
with the DG Resettlement for subscribing
to various resettlement courses sponsored
by that Directorate. Women SSC officers
undergo these courses in their last year
of service, partly paid for by the service,
and participate in the campus-selection
coordinated by the IAF for absorption into the

corporate sector.

_Appendix-III_


###### SUMMARY OF LATEST COMPTROLLER & AUDITOR GENERAL 
 (C&AG) REPORT ON THE WORKING OF MINISTRY OF DEFENCE

**Report No. CA 17 of 2008-09: Union Government**

**(Defence Services) Army and Ordnance Factories**


###### II Ministry of Defence

**Para 2.2 Import of defective ammunition**

Krasnopol ammunition is Artillery

ammunition fired from 155 mm guns for
destruction of enemy armour, high value
mechanized forces and static pinpoint

targets both during offensive and defensive
operations. The ammunition (1000 rounds
and 10 Laser Designators) was procured
by Army in August 1999 at a cost of Rs 151
Cr. from firm M/s KBP Tula, Russia which
did not meet GSQR and had limitation of
range, angle and precision in high altitudes.
The issue was raised in paragraph 4.2 of
the Report on Union Government (Defence
Services) No. 7A of 2001. In Action Taken
Note Ministry replied that despite limitation
of ammunition, it was procured because of
operational urgency. Subsequently, during
confirmatory firing in October 2006, the
ammunition was degraded within its shelf
life of 15 years. The firm was asked to repair
the ammunition and its use was banned till
its repair. The ammunition was yet to be
repaired as of September 2008.

Meanwhile knowing limitation of

ammunition, action for its repeat procurement
was initiated in 2001 and contract was

212


concluded with the same firm in February
2002 for procurement of 2000 round of
155 mm Krasnopol ammunition with 71
nos. laser designators at a cost of Rs 375 Cr.
citing inescapable minimum requirement.
The firm completed the delivery by April
2002. In June 2003 after more than a year the
consignment was inspected by Artillery and
during test firing of the ammunition in the
high altitude, none of five round fired hit the
target. Army therefore came to conclusion
that ammunition was not suitable for high
altitude firing. As a result the same limitation
of the ammunition in high altitude persisted
in second procurement also. Ministry

of Defence in September 2003 raised a
quality claim for whole amount. The vendor
accepted it and carried out demonstration
firing in India in June 2005 using modern
ammunition developed by them. But

performance of modern ammunition was
also not satisfactory. Army therefore could
not accept the offer of extended trial using
modern version of ammunition as the product
was totally different from the projectiles that
were originally procured.

Thus, 3000 rounds of the ammunition

worth 526 Cr. remained unavailable for use.
Failure of Army to conduct adequate trials


-----

and evaluations of the ammunition led to this
situation despite the fact that procurements

were carried out in view of the operational
urgency and inescapable requirement.

**Para 2.7 Non-renewal of lease of land**

**occupied by Army golf Club**

Mention was made in paragraph 18 of Report
No. 7 of 1997 of the Comptroller and Auditor
General of India that the lease of 49.03 acres
of A-I Defence Land occupied by Army Golf
Club, Delhi Cantonment was not renewed
after 1989.

The proposals for renewal of lease from
1989 to 1999 to 2009 though initiated
belatedly in 1984 and 2001 respectively,
were awaiting decision by the Ministry. As
per the prevailing Standard Table of Rent,
DGDE assessed the lease rent at Rs. 1.72
Cr. per annum for the lease period from
February 1989 to February 1999 and Rs.
4.19 Cr. per annum for the period February
1999 to February 2009. Besides the 49.03
acres of the above land, another 37.70 acres
of A-1 defence land belonging to Rajputana
Regimental Centre had also been occupied
by the Army Golf Course, Delhi.

Army HQ, however, proposed to the
Ministry that since the land being used for
public usage like Golf and training activities,
there was no need for execution of any
lease. The contention of the Army HQ is
inconsistent with the facts. Army Zone
Golf, a registered society, is the apex body
controlling the 93 Army Golf Courses all

over India which are run on fee collected

213


from the users. It is also to be noted that the
renaming of Army golf Course at various
stations as Environmental Park and Training
Area had not changed their primary role as
Golf Clubs. The Ministry may review the
position in respect of similar Golf Courses
in other stations and take appropriate action.
The Army Golf Club also did not furnish
details of its income and expenditure to the
Ministry. This indicates that on one hand the
club does not want to disclose the income
it has been generating from its members for
the use of defence land and on the other
hand it wants to continue exploiting defence
land without paying any lease charges as per
rules.

Thus the Army Golf Club, Delhi was tacitly
permitted by the Ministry for rent free use of
defence land for over 19 years, though Rs
54.95 Cr. was recoverable up to February
2008.

###### III Army

**Para 3.6 Misuse of special financial powers**

**by Army Commanders**

To facilitate procurement of stores/ equipment
to cater for operational requirement such as
readiness of strike corps for deployment,
counter insurgency, aid to civil authorities,
internal security duties etc. special financial
powers are delegated to General Officer
Commanding in Chief (GOC-in-C) of

various Commands. Audit noticed cases of
misuse of special financial powers by the
Army Commanders of Western Command
and Northern Command (NC) which are
discussed below:

-----

**Case-I:** **Procurement of Golf Carts in the**
**guise of vehicles for transportation**

**of patients in hospitals**

On the pretext of transporting aged/

handicapped patients in the Military

Hospitals, HQ Western Command procured
five “Electric Multi Utility Vehicle” (Motorised
Carts) in May 2006 for Rs 15.60 lakh under
the Army Commander’s special financial
powers. While examining the utilization
of those vehicles, it was found that three
Motorised Carts received by Command
Hospital, Chandimandir were issued to
Shivalik Golf Course, Chandimandir, which
further distributed to Army Golf Courses at
Ambala and Jalandhar.

Examination of the specifications of the
Motorised Carts further indicated that

the EMUs procured were actually Golf
Cart (Battery Golf Cart Model-27) which
were purchased under a guise of ‘Electric
Multiutility Vehicle’. Though the Ministry
denied the misuse but the evidences available
support the misuse of these vehicles.

**Case-II** **Procurement of Golf Carts in**
**the guise of ‘Track Laying Recee**
**Vehicles’**

Again, under a pretence of “Track Alignment
Reconnaissance Vehicles” (TARVs) for the
Regiments of Army Engineers, the Army
Commander of Western Command procured
22 Golf Carts of the brand name “Club Car”
at a cost of Rs 1.01 Cr. The 22 vehicles
received in March 2008 were issued to

nine Engineer Regiments responsible for the

214


maintenance of Golf Courses. While four of
the 22 vehicles were actually handed over
to Shivalik Environmental Park and Training
Area (Golf Course), no documents were
available, to show that these vehicles were
ever used for laying of track in operational
areas.

Since operation and maintenance of Golf
Courses is a non-Governmental activity,
purchase of Golf Carts from Defence fund
for issue to Golf Courses in the above two
cases indicate misutilisation of Rs 1.17 Cr.
of public money for non-public purpose by
misrepresenting facts. This is also a serious
violation of Army Commanders’ special
financial powers, which should not have
been exercised for such purchases.

**Case-III Improper Procurement of Trailers**

Against a demand of a Corps HQ in
Northern Command for three Trailers of 30
tons capacity along with Prime Movers for
transportation of dozers by the Engineer
Regiments in Ladakh sector, three Trailers
of enhanced capacity of 50 ton were
procured for Rs 26.10 lakh, under the Army
Commanders special financial powers. Prime
Movers for these Trailers were not however
procured as the cost in that case would be
higher and fall under capital procurement
and therefore not permissible under the
special powers. After the procurement was
complete, Engineers Branch of Northern
Command found that the Trailers procured
were unsuitable for the intended use in the
hilly terrain of Ladakh sector, as their turning

radius was higher. The Trailers purchased


-----

by exercising the special financial powers
therefore remained without use since their
purchase in January 2005.

**Case-IV Irregularities in procurement of**

**Stretchers**

Northern Command HQ procured Field
Stretchers (Light Weight) for use by the
medical units under the special financial
powers of the Army Commander at a
total cost of Rs 73.33 lakh. The stretchers
purchased were of 8 Kgs weight, which was
double the maximum specified weight of 4
Kgs. On receipt the item was found deficient
in specification as there was no provision to
hold intravenous fluid bottles; the Stretcher
could not be converted to a Field Hospital
bed; the Stretcher was unsuitable for casualty
evacuation as it could not float in water
and helicopter evacuation facilities were
unsuitable; and there was no provision for
fitting of wheels. In spite of these deficiencies,
the Board accepted the Stretchers under
instructions from HQ Northern Command to
avoid lapse of funds.

**Para 3.4 Unauthorized use of A-1 Defence**

**land by Army Welfare Education**
**Society**

Ministry of Defence in January 2004 decided
‘in principle’ to allot 25.559 acres of A-1
Defence land in Delhi Cantonment on
leasehold basis to Army Welfare Education
Society (AWES), a private society, for a
period of 30 years for establishment of Army
Medical College ignoring the suggestion of

HQ Delhi Area regarding acute shortage

215


of land for the Army units in Delhi.
Accordingly, Army HQ instructed AWES to
utilize the said land for opening of Medical
College only after obtaining the Government
sanction. In February 2004, Ministry asked
DGDE to indicate lease rent and premium of
Commercial rates of said land. In July 2005,
the rent for Commercial purpose for said land
was worked out to Rs. 8.72 Cr. per annum
and premium of Rs 43.59 Cr. for 2004-05.

AWES started construction of Campus and
hostel building of the medical college in
August 2005 without any Government
sanction for transfer of land and lease
agreement. The work was completed in May
2007.

Thus, a private institution had

unauthorizedly been allowed to construct
Medical College in Delhi Cantonment on
defence land, without obtaining sanction
of the Government and execution of lease
deed as of October 2008.

###### IV Works and Military Engineer
 Services

**Para 4.1 Irregular diversion of savings of**

**a project for execution of new**
**works**

A Zonal Chief Engineer irregularly diverted
saving of a project to undertake new
works valuing Rs 1.81 Cr. not originally
contemplated in the approved project. He
did not surrender such savings, as required
under rules. This resulted in unauthorized
expenditure of Rs 1.81 Cr. in violation of

Defence works Procedures.


-----

**Para 4.2 Avoidable cost overrun in civil**

**works**

Failure of a Zonal Chief Engineer to cancel
timely the outsourced consultancy contract
for preparation of architectural and structural
design despite serious default resulted in
delay of three years in conclusion of contract
for execution of sanctioned works, which led
to a cost overrun of Rs 2.96 Cr.

###### V Border Roads Organisation

**Para 5.1 Defective procurement of Hot Mix**

**Plants**

Director General Border Roads procured 18
defective Hot Mix Plants valuing Rs. 9.77 Cr.
on the basis of incorrect technical evaluation
and dilution of specifications in favour of the
firm. Six of the plants were found defective
during installation.

###### VI Defence Research and Development Organisation

**Para 6.1 Avoidable** **expenditure** **on** **a**

**research project**

Armament Research and Development

Establishment (ARDE) undertook technology
demonstration project to enhance the

capability of Pinaka Weapon System when
the user was not interested in development of
the technology. The project was foreclosed
immediately after procurement of equipments
costing Rs 1.06 Cr. citing persistent disinterest
shown by user. Thus neither ARDE instantly
acted on the user’s suggestion to foreclose
the project before procurement of equipment

nor it finally completed the technology

216


demonstration project leading to wasteful
expenditure of Rs 1.06 Cr.

**_Departmental View and Present Status:_**
The Paragraph was Partially Agreed to, any
decision to short close the contracts before
the realization of the store would have
amounted to payment of major chunk of the
contract cost as compensation to the two
firms as both the firms had placed orders for
the procurement of different components
from Indian and foreign vendors. It was in
this context that the contracts were allowed
to continue to its logical completion (i.e.
realization of store) and fulfill the contractual
obligation.

The entire procurement make in the project
are useful capital items and are being used in
the day-to-day activities. Though these items,
which were procured for the project, could
not be used for the project, as the project
itself was short closed. These items are
becoming useful in other ancillary projects
of Pinaka. Hence, the expenditure of Rs 1.05
Cr. is being used for other project of Pinaka
in progress.

Consequent upon the vetting of the Action
Taken Note by the Audit, the same has
been forwarded to Monitoring Cell on 16
December, 2009 for being tabled in Lok
Sabha Secretariat.

###### VII Ordnance Factory Organisation

**Para 7.2 Extra expenditure due to delay in**

**finalization of an offer**

Failure of Heavy Vehicles Factory Avadi and

Armoured Vehicles Head-quarters, Avadi


-----

to firm up the commercial offer within the
validity period had resulted in placement
of order on the collaborator on a later date
against revised commercial offer leading
to avoidable liability of Rs 2.78 Cr. The
avoidable liability was partially due to
acceptance of abnormal rates of two items in
the revised offer.

**Para 7.8 Suspected fraud in reimbursement**

**of Customs Duty to a supplier**

A private firm got “reimbursement” of
Customs Duty of Rs 31.20 lakh from
Ordnance Equipment Factory Kanpur for
supply of imported machines, by producing
documents suspected to be forged to claim
the reimbursement. Cross checking by
Audit with Customs record disclosed that
the supplier had produced Customs Duty
exemption Certificate and did not pay
Customs Duty for the import. On being
pointed out in audit, the factory recovered Rs
31.29 lakh from the supplier.

**Para 7.7 Non-incorporation** **of** **risk**

**purchase clause leading to extra**
**expenditure**

Failure of Metal and Steel Factory, Ishapore to
incorporate risk purchase clause in two supply
orders for purchase of Ferro Molybdenum not
only violated the Ordnance Factory Board’s
standing instructions on procurement but
also put an additional liability of Rs 76.86
lakh on the Defence exchequer as the two
firms defaulted in supply of 8875 Kg Ferro
Molybdenum leading to placing of supply

order at a much higher rate on another firm.

217


**Para 7.10 Non/Under** **recovery** **of** **fixed**

**electricity charges**

Four Ordnance Factories based in Uttar
Pradesh either failed to recover fixed charges
on the consumption of electricity or under
recovered the charges from the occupants
of Factory Estates, resulting in non/under
recovery of fixed charges, cumulatively
amounting to Rs 3.19 Cr.

###### Defence Services (Air Force & Navy)

**_Summary of Important Audit observations_**
**_by C&AG of India_**

Audit Report containing results of audit of
Ministry of Defence in so far as they relate
to Air Force, Navy and associated DRDO’s
for the year ended March 2008 (Report No.
CA 18 of 2008-09) was presented in both the
houses of Parliament on 24.7.2009. some of
the important audit findings included in the
Report are indicated below.

**I** **Inadequate** **assessment** **and**

**management of risks associated with**
**acquisition of an aircraft carrier.**

The objective of inducting an aircraft carrier
in time to fill the gap in IN has not been
achieved. The cost of acquisition has more
than doubled to USD 1.82 billion (Rs 7,207
Cr.) in four years. At best, IN would be
acquiring, belatedly, a second hand ship with
a limited life span by paying significantly
more than what it would have paid for a new
ship.

**_(Paragraph 2.1)_**


-----

**II** **Undue favour to vendor in acquisition**
**of submarines**

Despite Indian Navy’s depleting force

level, Ministry took nine years to conclude
a contract for the construction of six
submarines. The inordinate delay led to
enormous increase in the project cost to
the extent of Rs 2,838 Cr. The procurement
procedure lacked transparency and the
submarine design had not proven its efficacy
in any other navy worldwide. Technical
evaluation conducted for the ‘Y’ class
submarine including the missile to be fitted
on-board was not comprehensive and was
biased in favour of the vendor. Contractual
provisions have resulted in undue financial
advantage to the vendor to the minimum
extent of Euro 58.20 million (Rs 349 Cr.)
besides other unquantifiable benefits.

**_(Paragraph 2.2)_**

**III** **Denial of Offset benefits of Rs 2,711**
**Cr. in acquisition of an aircraft**

In placing the order for the acquisition of 40
aircraft ‘M’ costing Rs 9,036.84 Cr., Ministry/
IAF failed to go in for the offset clause as
stipulated in the DPP. This led to the denial
of corresponding benefit, amounting to Rs.
2,711 Cr., to Indian defence industry. The
objective of urgent acquisition has also not
been achieved.

**_(Paragraph 2.7)_**

**IV** **Delay in payment of UN Death/**
**Disability compensation**

Although more than five decades have

elapsed since the first deployment of troops

218


under UN Peace Keeping Missions, Ministry
is yet to frame a policy on the mechanism

to monitor the initiation and the settlement
of the claims of the deceased/ disabled
soldiers deployed for the missions. Ministry
delayed disbursement of the compensation
amount to personnel/ family members of the
deceased.

**_(Paragraph 2.10)_**

**V** **Procurement of defective missiles and**
**excess missile launchers**

42 of the 300 air-to-air ‘X’ type missiles
acquired by IAF at a cost of Rs 76 Cr. became
unserviceable during the warranty period.
Further, 165 missiles remained unserviceable
for significant periods. Though the shelf
life of all the missiles would expire by June
2010 and despite having a stock of 440
missile launchers, the Air HQ procured 145
additional launchers between August 2006
and March 2008 rendering the expenditure
of Rs 66.86 Cr. on their procurement largely
infructuous.

**_(Paragraph 3.2)_**

**VI** **Inordinate delay in installation of a**
**radar on an aircraft**

Five radars imported at a cost of Rs 24.88
Cr. could not be installed for more than
three to five years after their acquisition.
In the process the radars have not only lost
50 per cent of their life but also remained
unavailable for operational purpose.

**_(Paragraph 4.1)_**


-----

**VII Improper implementation of radar**

**fitment policy**

Navy procured six radar ‘R’ for its modern
stealth frigates and landing ship tankers under
construction at a cost of Rs 18.85 Cr., even
though performance of the radar had been
sub-optimal and its phasing out was under
active consideration.

_(Paragraph 4.5)_

**VIII Integrated Logistic Management System**

**(Air)**

The ILMS (Air) application was implemented
in August 2001 to enhance the efficiency of
air stores logistics organization with regard
to inventory provisioning, procurement,

warehousing and distribution. The Navy
needs to use ILMS optimally for effective and
cost efficient managerial decisions.

**_(Paragraph 4.6)_**

**IX** **Failure to have unsuitable equipment**
**replaced promptly**

The Navy failed to persuade a foreign firm to
replace unsuitable items supplied. As a result,
the expenditure of Rs 3.85 Cr. on their import
was yet to yield any operational benefit to the
Navy.

**_(Paragraph 4.7)_**

**X** **Tardy progress in development of a**
**radar**

Despite almost a decade in developmental
effort and spending Rs 27.88 Cr., DRDO has
been unable to provide a radar as per the

219


requirements of Navy. It closed the original
project and initiated another ‘Staff Project’
with the same goals and new funding.
Resultantly, the main aim of providing
maritime radar for helicopter ‘A’ remains
unfulfilled.

**_(Paragraph 6.1)_**

Departmental view and Present status: The
Paragraph was partially agreed to, since
the set objectives of radar under project
“Development of Maritime Patrol Radar
for Naval ALH” have been met. This was
a maiden venture for LRDE, the long
development time is owing to complexity
in airborne radar system engineering, grey
areas in processing, elaborate qualification
and certification effort involved and

very limited availability of the intended
airborne platform for radar evaluation and
optimization. Each sub-system has to be
realized with a high degree of complexity
and fineness. Qualification and certification
process is very elaborate. The period
lined with design, validation, refinement,
optimization and tuning on an airborne
platform is long drawn and calls for several
hundreds of flying hours.

The MK-II version of radar is ready for user
trials and the project Probable Date of
Completion (PDC) is July 2010, therefore,
all issues could be resolved by then. It is
envisaged that, at the end of this PDC,
NSQR Compliant radar would be ready for
productionisation. The Action Taken Note has
been forwarded to Audit on 30 September,

2009 for vetting.

###### Audit Report No. CA 23 of 2009-10 (Compliance Audit)

**Bharat Electronics Limited**

SAP was introduced in October 2006 in
Bangalore Complex and subsequently in
other units. Acquisition and implementation
of SAP, utilization of Production Planning
and Material Management modules of SAP
at Bangalore Complex were reviewed. The
review revealed that the savings projected
by implementation of SAP towards

inventory carrying cost, cost of goods sold
and reduction in sundry debtors by the
Company did not materialize. Failure to
design the required controls in the system,
inappropriate customization, lack of

input controls and validation checks and
inadequate controls during data migration
resulted in the non-utilisation of the SAP
system to its full potential and as a result the
integrity and accuracy of the data could not
be ensured. Consequently, the Company still
depended on the legacy system and resorted
to manual interventions in the current
system.

###### Audit Report No. CA 24 of 2009-10 (Compliance Audit)

**BEML Limited**

The Company has been recognizing

sales through deliberate violation of the
various internal procedures prescribed in
their quality manuals which was also in
contravention of the principles enumerated
in the Accounting Standard 9 prescribed

220


under section 211(3 C) of the Companies
Act, 1956 read with the Expert Advisory

Committee opinion of the Institute of

**_Para 6.1.1_**

The Company paid Rs.22.23 Cr. as TOT fee
to the foreign collaborator in contravention of
the terms of MoA.

**_Para 6.1.2_**

Undue delay on the part of the Company
to issue/finalise the terms of purchase order
resulted in delayed supply of BFAT wagons
and consequential loss of Rs.6.50 Cr.

**_Para 6.1.3_**

**Bharat Electronics Limited**

Failure to obtain amendments to the contracts
retained at the behest of the customer
resulted in blockade of funds of Rs.48.61 Cr.
and consequential loss of interest of Rs.4.81
Cr. besides extra contractual expenditure of
Rs.3.41 Cr. towards repairs.

**_Para 6.2.1_**

Production for a foreign customer without
necessary financial commitment resulted in
accumulation of unused finished goods worth
Rs.7.38 Cr. for over 2 years and consequential
loss of interest of Rs.1.91 Cr.

**_Para 6.2.2_**

**Hindustan Aeronautics Limited**

Fraudulent payment of Rs.52.24 Cr. made
under the guise of a new incentive scheme

without approval of the Board of Directors


-----

and in contravention to DPE guidelines.

**_Para 6.3.1_**

The Company transported five Dhruv

helicopters for the exhibition when they
were under investigation after the accident
and bringing them back without participating
in the air show resulted in an avoidable
expenditure of Rs. 4.94 Cr.

**_Para 6.3.2_**

The agreement with ONGC had not been
drafted with adequate care by including
a specific clause for admission of taxes

221


and duties prevailing on the date of sale,
resulting in loss of Rs.4.82 Cr. due to non
reimbursement of service tax on repair/
overhaul services by ONGC.

**_Para 6.3.3_**

Failure to obtain specific exemption from the
Government of India for payment of custom
duty while obtaining the sanction for the
project resulted in avoidable payment of
custom duty of Rs.3.34 Cr.
