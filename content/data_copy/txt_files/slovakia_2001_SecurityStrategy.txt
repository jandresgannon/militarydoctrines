**INTRODUCTION**

1. The Slovak Republic recognizes, asserts and protects democracy, the principle of the rule of law, and the
observance of basic human rights and freedoms in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the
Organization of the United Nations and other international documents. With its historical, cultural, political,
geographical, economical and other linkages, it is an inseparable part of the Euro-Atlantic civilization and cultural
environment. In the endeavor for a general guarantee of its security in accordance with international law and
customs, the Slovak Republic adopts the Security Strategy of the Slovak Republic. It is a public document
designed for use by state and local governmental organs and is accessible by citizens of the Slovak Republic.

2. The Slovak Republic adopts this Security Strategy with the intent to create systematic measures for an
adequate response to security challenges, risks, and threats and for emergency situations including such
changes to the Constitution of the Slovak Republic which will enable its active participation in the organs of
collective defense and in other international organizations. The Slovak Republic understands its security status as
one in which internal security and order, sovereignty and integrity, and democratic foundations of the country are
preserved, and its environment is protected.

**I. SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC**

3. The main tendencies which influence the worldwide security environment are the globalization and the uneven
development of regions. In addition to the acceleration of the economic, technological, information, cultural and
political interconnection of countries and continents and bringing people closer together, these tendencies also
bring with them the phenomena and processes which exceed the control of individual states and coalitions. The
differences between foreign and domestic policies are being removed, and global financial markets are having a
greater and greater influence on the development of the world. These tendencies are creating new, especially
non-military challenges, risks and threats, but they also offer new possibilities for their solution. There is a growing
number and diversity of difficult to specify security challenges, risks, threats and crisis situations, which can be
caused not only by relations among countries, but also by a variety of types of conflicts within states. It is obvious
that the globalization process will in a substantial way modify the challenges, risks and threats known today and
influence the strategy of how to solve them in the future.

4. A characteristic feature of European security processes is the shaping of co-operating and mutually
complementary security, political, economic and environmental organizations. The decisive factor for shaping the
European security environment is the transfer of stability through an enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. The countries involved in the Partnership for Peace program and in the activities of the EuroAtlantic Partnership Council currently act as important subjects for forming the European security system on the
basis of confidence-building and open relations between them. At the same time a security and defense policy of
the European Union is being formed, which the Slovak Republic understands as a complementary process to the
system of collective defense of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A part of these processes is also an
increase of readiness for actions of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe by co-operating with
European and Euro-Atlantic institutions. At the turn of the century, there are in Europe new challenges and threats
to peace and international stability, namely in the form of ethnic tensions, economic crises, political instability,
international organized crime and terrorism, violations of human rights, abuse of information technologies, and the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, dualuse materials and the most modern weapons systems.

5. The security environment in Central Europe, of which the Slovak Republic is also a part, has been decisively
influenced by the admission of the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary into the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and by the further openness of the process of its enlargement. The Slovak Republic still has not
sufficient external international institutional security guarantees based on a contractual foundation of common
defense. The membership of the Slovak Republic in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would contribute to a
deepening of the homogeneity of the security order in Central Europe. The countries of Central Europe, including
the Slovak Republic, aspire to join the European Union, and while in the accession process, they utilize the
deepening co-operation within the framework of the Visegrád 4 countries and the Central-European Free Trade
Association. These actions all help to create suitable conditions for the development of co-operation and the
strengthening of stability in the region.

6. In terms of its area, number of inhabitants and economic potential, the Slovak Republic belongs among the
smaller European countries who lack certain energy sources and raw materials. It has, however, rich cultural
traditions, a corresponding high level of education of its citizens, as well as a qualified labor force. These
conditions increase its possibilities to participate in the general development of the region and the continent.
Economically it is mostly interconnected with the countries associated with the Central-European Free Trade
Association, with the European Free Trade Association, and with the countries of the European Union, but it also


-----

has relations with the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (especially with the Russian
Federation) from the point of view as a source for raw materials and resources. These circumstances, together
with an openness of its economy, predetermine the Slovak Republic to be more active in the field of political and
economic co-operation. The Slovak Republic is a relatively young country, which is progressively strengthening its
democratic foundations and improving the mechanisms for the functioning of the state with respect for the rule of
law, creating the conditions for the formation of civil society and adopting systemic measures for the
implementation of fundamental reform and transformation of its social-economic and environmental spheres. It is
a strong member of the international community and an active participant in international relations.

**II. INTERESTS OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC**

VITAL INTERESTS OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC

7. The interests of the Slovak Republic express the needs of the citizens and the state. The vital interests of the
Slovak Republic emanate from basic longterm needs and are decisively important for guaranteeing the lives and
security of its citizens and for the existence and functioning of the state. They are primarily the following:

## • guaranteeing the security of the Slovak Republic, its sovereignty, its territorial integrity and its cultural
identity,

## • preservation and development of the democratic foundations of the state, its internal security and order,
and the protection of the lives and safeguarding the health of its citizens,

## • ensuring the sustainable economic, social, environmental and cultural development of the society,
together with protection of important state infrastructures and the environment,

## • preservation of peace and stability in Central Europe, linked with the expansion of the zone of
democracy, security and prosperity, including full membership of the Slovak Republic in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and in the European Union.

IMPORTANT INTERESTS OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC

8. Important interests of the Slovak Republic create wider conditions for the realization of the vital interests of the
Slovak Republic by influencing international (external) as well as domestic (internal) conditions. Important
interests of the Slovak Republic are primarily:

## • the maintenance of peace and stability in the world and the prevention of tensions and crises, or their
early and effective resolution by peaceful means,

## • good relations with immediate neighbors and development of all forms of mutually advantageous
regional co-operation,

## • internal political stability, based on corresponding society-wide consensus with the questions of vital and
important interests of the Slovak Republic,

## • the achievement of a dynamic transition of the economy of the Slovak Republic to a market economy
which is ecologically more balanced and efficient and with diversified resources capable of appropriately
satisfying the needs of its citizens,

## • guaranteeing social peace and stability in society, based on a respect for the equality of the rights of all
citizens regardless of their political orientation, religion, gender, race, or membership in various ethnic or
social groups,

## • the achievement of environmental security within the framework of domestic and international structures. 

9. The Slovak Republic is in compliance with international laws and its commitments and is determined and
prepared to use all necessary means, including its armed forces, if necessary, to defend and protect its vital
interests.

**III. SECURITY CHALLENGES, RISKS AND THREATS TO THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC**

10. An analysis of the security environment of the Slovak Republic makes it possible to specify the decisive
security challenges, risks and threats which it currently faces. If they are not addressed, they could actually or
potentially grow into crisis situations and thus directly or indirectly endanger the vital and important interests of the
Slovak Republic.

SECURITY CHALLENGES


-----

11. The Slovak Republic can ensure its general, sustainable development by its calculated engagement in global
political, economic, social and cultural trends. Slovak disregard of this challenge would exclude it from the main
currents of world development and would be a serious endangerment to its interests.

12. Active participation in peace efforts by other members of the international community will enable the Slovak
Republic to contribute to the shaping of the world security environment. The Slovak Republic recognizes this
challenge as a requirement to increase, within its capabilities, its contribution towards preventing conflicts from
emerging and assisting in their resolution should they emerge.

13. One of the most important security challenges connected with our growing responsibility for security and
stability in the world is full participation in the creation of an integrated European security system. The Slovak
Republic responds to this challenge primarily by preparing to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the
European Union, as well as by its engagement within the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

14. Active engagement in Central Europe and the development of good neighborly relations provides the Slovak
Republic with the possibility to influence its immediate surroundings and at the same time to secure a firm and
stable position in this region. The historical and unique challenge for the Slovak Republic is the utilization and
development of the co-operative potential within the framework of the Visegrád 4 countries. Political stability and
economic prosperity of this region is an important condition for the realization of the interests of the Slovak
Republic.

15. The strengthening of the democratic state based on the rule of law and respect for fundamental human and
civil rights and freedoms is a challenge that requires a continuous enhancement of democratic principles and
institutions with the aim of achieving long-term stability and development at the level of well-developed democratic
states.

16. The transformation of the economy into a functioning, socially and environmentally oriented market economy
with diversified resources, which respects the principles of sustainable development and which is comparable to
the economies of developed democratic states, is a challenge, and accepting it will create the conditions for
effective economic co-operation and make it possible to appropriately satisfy the needs of the citizens.

17. The development and utilization of the results of the technological revolution is a challenge, and coping with it
is one of the decisive conditions for the comprehensive development of the Slovak Republic and its transition from
an industrial to an information society.

SECURITY RISKS AND THREATS TO THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC

18. The positive development of the security environment in Europe and in the world after the end of the Cold War
substantially decreased the probability of an outbreak of a global war. A longer-term view, however, does not
exclude the risk of an outbreak of an extensive armed conflict. In view of the effort of several non-democratic
regimes to increase their military capacities, including the delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction,
there remains a risk to European states, and thus also to the Slovak Republic.

19. Among the remaining security risks in Europe that have the possibility of escalating into armed violence are
regional conflicts in unstable areas (at present, for example, in the area of Southeast Europe and the North
Caucasus). Because these potential conflicts are often based on extremist ethnic, religious or ideological
foundations, these risks have a long-term character.

20. Uncontrolled migration is a risk, the relevance of which is growing for the Slovak Republic in spite of the fact
that at present it is not a main target of migration flows. An unmanageable migration wave, which could emerge
as the consequence of regional conflicts, could, however, represent a destabilizing factor for the whole of Europe,
and thereby also endanger the interests of the Slovak Republic.

21. International organized crime and terrorism are security risks and in view of their wide scope and
consequences, they are at present already growing into a threat to the vital interests of the Slovak Republic.
There is an increase of activities such as illicit trafficking of weapons and drugs, dualuse materials, trafficking of
children and women, and money laundering. There exists the risk of their interconnection with state organs and
local governmental organs, as well as with economic entities. The extent and danger of the influence of
international terrorism is growing.

22. The criminalization of social relations is a risk that can grow into a threat to the vital interests of the Slovak
Republic. We are recording a growth of organized crime, which manifests itself in the field of violent crime,


-----

including racketeering (blackmail), robberies and murders. The internal stability of a state is influenced by the
growth of economic crime (frauds, misappropriation of property and financial assets, tax evasions) together with
property crime, which is manifested by thefts. There is a growing trend in violent types of crime, criminal offences
with a weapon, extortion of protection money, teenager and juvenile crime, and social crime. Corruption is also a
part of this group which includes the abuse of authority and public office, the misappropriation of public funds and
clientelism. Deepening corruption endangers the very foundations of the legal and social system. Another risk
factor is a trend towards a growing tolerance of xenophobia and racism by some social groups.

23. The activities of foreign special services, characterized by the growth in the use of traditional and nontraditional methods and new technologies and an interest in all fields and spheres of social life, represent
continuous threats to the interests of the Slovak Republic. An increase of the activities of these services in relation
to the Slovak Republic can be assumed in connection with the accession process of the Slovak Republic into the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and into the European Union.

24. A violation or total failure of information systems of the state as a result of information terrorism and piracy
represents a risk which can seriously endanger the security of the Slovak Republic.

25. The excessive dependence of the Slovak Republic on unstable sources for some basic raw materials and
energy and their transport gives rise to a risk, which can grow into a threat not only to economic prosperity and
stability, but also to the security of the state.

26. The demographic development, which is manifested in a gradual decrease of the ratio of the working
population to citizens of retirement non-productive age, negatively impacts on the maximum load on the social
system, which can lose the ability to ensure the functioning of the social net and endanger social stability in the
state. This risk is amplified by a worsening health condition of citizens and a decline in the level of their upbringing
and education.

27. The environmental threats connected with the degradation of the environment, often across state borders, can
directly impact the security of the state. Industrial technological disasters and natural catastrophes and disasters
are among these threats, which by their unpredictability and consequences represent a permanent threat to lives
and property on a large scale.

28. The decrease of food security of the state under the threshold level is a risk which can grow into a threat to
the security of the Slovak Republic.

**IV. SECURITY POLICY OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC**

29. The security policy of the Slovak Republic represents a complex set of aims, principles, procedures and
measures of the state for guaranteeing the security of the state and its citizens. In addition to the defense
dimension, it integrates in itself the foreign, internal security, economic, social, environmental and other
dimensions. Its effectiveness is determined by the degree of co-operation of state organs and local governmental
organs, non-governmental organizations, and legal and physical entities.

GOALS OF THE SECURITY POLICY OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC

30. The strategic long-term goal of the security policy of the Slovak Republic is to maintain or restore the state of
security, which enables the realization of its vital and important interests.

31. For the attainment of the strategic long-term goal of the security policy of the Slovak Republic, it is necessary
to fulfil the following basic goals of the security policy:

## • to ensure a continuous expert analysis of the security environment of the Slovak Republic and an
effective participation in it formation,

## • to maintain the ability of the state to prevent, minimize and eliminate security risks, security threats and
to resolve crisis situations,

## • to ensure the readiness of the state to adopt adequate and timely responses to security challenges, 
 • to build the security system of the state to be interoperable with similar systems of developed democratic
states.

BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE SECURITY POLICY OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC

32. The security policy of the Slovak Republic will be governed by the following principles:


-----

## • the principle of the sovereign right to guarantee one's own security, which emanates from the natural
right of the Slovak Republic to individual and collective defense according to the Charter of the
Organization of the United Nations; it expresses the right to freely decide on one's own security on the
basis of sovereign equality, the right of free choice of the forms of one's own security with the sovereign
right to belong or not to belong to international and supranational organizations,

## • the principle of complexity, which accepts the importance and mutual influence of several factors,
especially political, defense, internal-security, economic, social and environmental factors in the security
policy of the Slovak Republic,

## • the principle of engagement, which expresses the active attitude of the Slovak Republic and the decision
not to remain only a passive consumer of the advantages of international security co-operation,

## • the principle of indivisibility of security, on the basis of which the Slovak Republic will not realize such
measures for the strengthening of its own security which would endanger the security of other states,

## • the principle of prevention, which expresses the resolve of the Slovak Republic to adopt effective
measures aimed at preventing risks and threats to its security, their timely identification and elimination,

## • the principle of compatibility of the security policy of the Slovak Republic with its constitutional-legal order
and international legal standards and agreements to which the Slovak Republic has accepted,

## • the principle of a co-ordinated approach, which requires a purposeful management of all capabilities and
resources necessary for guaranteeing security at the national and supranational level,

## • the principle of continuity and credibility, which expresses the continuity, irrefutability, stability and
credibility of the security policy of the Slovak Republic,

## • the principle of responsibility and obligation of state organs and organs of local governmental bodies,
legal and physical entities and all citizens to participate in the realization of the security policy of the
state,

## • the principle of environmental security. 

AREAS AND INSTRUMENTS FOR THE REALIZATION OF THE SECURITY POLICY OF THE SLOVAK
REPUBLIC

33. In accordance with the abovementioned goals and principles, the security policy of the Slovak Republic is
being realized in two basic areas:

## • in the area of shaping the security environment, 
 • in the area of deepening the ability and readiness to respond to the challenges, risks and threats to its
interests and to addressing crisis situations.

SHAPING THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT

34. The Slovak Republic attaches great importance to shaping and influencing a stable security environment, in
which favorable conditions are created for the realization of its vital and important interests. To this end it will
utilize all available and effective options and means, especially measures aimed at prevention and those that
strengthen global, European, regional and internal security and deepen international co-operation and
enforcement of principles of international law and a state's respect for the rule of law.

- Prevention and strengthening of global, European and regional security

35. The Slovak Republic will develop its participation on those global political, economic, environmental, social
and cultural integration trends of the present world, which have a determining significance on the shaping of its
security environment. It will continue to pay special attention to the development of relations with the Organization
of the United Nations, which it considers the most important forum for multilateral co-operation. The Slovak
Republic will therefore support the enhancement of mechanisms of the activities of the United Nations that
contribute to the increase of its powers and making its work more effective. It will direct its activity in the United
Nations towards solutions of issues such as improvement in the quality of the environment, lowering the tension
between the developed and the developing world, disarmament, and co-ordination of the fight against organized
crime and international terrorism. It will continue to take part in peace and humanitarian operations.

36. The Slovak Republic considers NATO and EU to be decisive factors of guaranteeing security, stability and
prosperity in Europe and in the entire Euro-Atlantic area, for the present as well as with an outlook into the future,
and it is preparing for membership in these organizations. In the interest of the development of co-operation in
European security, the Slovak Republic is active in the realization of the conclusions of the European Security
Charter. It will continue to actively participate in the activities of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in
Europe in preventing an emergence of tensions, in crisis management and in post-conflict stabilization.


-----

- Enhancing international co-operation

37. The Slovak Republic will improve co-operation in building of a stable, secure and prosperous CentralEuropean area, especially with the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary, with whom it has a common interest to
enter into the European Union. The enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by these countries
represents a broadening and deepening of stability and security in Central Europe, and thereby also a qualitative
change to the security environment of the Slovak Republic. In harmony with its interest in full membership in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Slovak Republic will deepen its share in the common activities aimed at
improving the quality of political-security co-operation with the Visegrád 4 countries, with an emphasis on cooperation between their armed forces. It considers active co-operation within the framework of the Organization
for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Trade Organization, and the Central-European Free
Trade Association in the development of general and mutually advantageous trade and economic co-operation as
an important means of its preparation for membership in the European Union, and together with activities within
the framework of the Central-European Initiative, as a contribution to the shaping of stability in this region.

38. From the point of view of its interest in integration, the Slovak Republic considers as important the
maintenance and intensification of bilateral relations with all countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and with countries aspiring to enter it in the interest of extending stability and security in Europe.

39. In addition to direct co-operation with the Visegrád 4 countries, the Slovak Republic considers it important to
deepen general co-operation with Austria, the only neighboring country that is a member of the European Union.
The Slovak Republic is interested in gaining its support and in utilizing its experience in the accession process
into the European Union.

40. In relation to Ukraine, the Slovak Republic focuses on developing relations in the fields of common interest
and inter-regional co-operation, because an independent, secure and economically stable Ukraine is an important
factor in the security of the Slovak Republic.

41. Co-operation with the Russian Federation and with the other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent
States will be realized on the basis of mutually advantageous partnership relations in harmony with the integration
ambitions of the Slovak Republic.

42. The Slovak Republic will continue to support the effort of the international community towards development of
democracy, economic co-operation and security in Southeast Europe, and it will develop co-operation with
countries involved in the realization of tasks of the Southeast Europe Stability Pact.

- Support for the promotion of international law principles

43. The preservation of peace and security in Europe and in the world is directly connected to the development
and deepening of the process of arms control, disarmament and confidence building, which is considered by the
Slovak Republic to be the most reliable way of shaping a credible and transparent security environment and
guaranteeing its external security.

44. The Slovak Republic will continue to actively contribute to the preparation and realization of agreements on
arms and on the disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons, and it will take part in the promotion of a wider,
complex and verifiable process of international control. It attaches great importance to the realization of the
Vienna Document on Confidence and Security Building Measures and the Treaty on Conventional Forces in
Europe. A part of this effort is the export control of one's own weapons, and the Slovak Republic wants to
harmonize it strictly in accordance with its integration interests.

45. As a signatory of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, the Slovak Republic will continue to contribute to
activities for the support of its fulfillment and will promote efforts towards the adoption of an agreement on the
suspension of production of fission material and other activities, which concern prevention and curbing of
trafficking in nuclear material and the overall limitation of the threat of use of weapons of mass destruction.

46. The Slovak Republic is aware of the importance of promoting international law in connection with a growth of
threats such as international terrorism, organized crime, drug trafficking, and also with the excessive proliferation
of weapons. It supports the common effort in the fight against these threats on the basis of co-ordination of a
common approach by the international community and on harmonization of corresponding legal standards on the
national and international level. The Slovak Republic will continue to actively co-operate in this field with other
states, coalitions and international institutions, with an emphasis on prevention and uncompromising suppression
of international crime and international terrorism in accordance with the criteria of the pre-accession pact on the
fight against organized crime.


-----

- Guaranteeing stability and development of the state's respect for the rule of law

47. The Slovak Republic will enhance the functioning mechanisms of the state's respect for the rule of law, with
an emphasis on guaranteeing internal political stability, economical prosperity and the security of citizens. The
priority in the field of internal political stability is the attainment and maintenance of standard political relations in
society based on the attainment of consensus of the decisive political and social entities in the formulation and
enforcement of vital and important interests and priorities of the Slovak Republic, namely by means of continual
domestic and foreign policies that would be stable over the long term. In this way the Slovak Republic will
strengthen its credibility and character as a stable and reliable partner in the present and for the future.

48. In strengthening internal stability the Slovak Republic will guarantee the security of its citizens, the observance
of their fundamental human rights and freedoms, as well as the observance of the rights of ethnic minorities and
ethnic groups as an important field of strengthening overall security. It considers the reform of public
administration, especially its decentralization and modernization with the aim of achieving the European level, as
an important part of the strengthening of democracy and stability.

- Social-economical development

49. The Slovak Republic seeks to ensure growth in the level of upbringing and education, shaping of the
necessary knowledge for adapting to life in a changing international environment, and for coping with forthcoming
challenges. It will ensure a change of structure and content of education and a creation of conditions for a better
evaluation of the system of upbringing and education in society, so as to gradually attain the level of the
developed democratic states.

50. The functioning of a stable and socially oriented market economy with diversified resources, which respects
the principles of sustainable development, requires a formulation of a long-term strategy for fundamental
economical reform of the state, connected with the building up of institutional and legislative elements so that the
economy will be sufficiently competitive and interconnected with the economic system of modern Europe.

51. The Slovak Republic will continue to build a stable and transparent economic environment with all its
attributes (the development of conditions for enterprise, the liberalization of trade, the completion of infrastructure,
reform of the banking and financial sectors), whereby it will create suitable conditions for domestic business
entities and foreign investors and also the conditions for a reduction in foreign debt and the foreign trade deficit.
By co-ordinating monetary and fiscal policies, the Slovak Republic aspires to approach countries with stable
financial and monetary development and with the transparent redistribution of resources.

52. In the sphere of regional policy, the Slovak Republic will take into account the regional aspects of the growth
of economic efficiency, and at the same time it will endeavor to reduce the considerable differences in the level of
economic development of regions via assistance to structurally handicapped regions and micro-regions with a
high level of unemployment, and by active support of small and medium enterprises and development of
employment. The long-term task will be to support inter-regional co-operation.

53. The Slovak Republic will connect stability, efficiency and security of the economy with gradual integration into
the European Union, namely by adopting its legislation and the rules of economic regulation. As an associate
country of the European Union, the Slovak Republic will look for possibilities of its share in the Common
European Security and Defense Policy, especially in addressing crisis situations, with an emphasis on operations
of a humanitarian nature. In order to embrace the global economic trends in the transformation of the economy,
the Slovak Republic will make use of its membership in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development, as well as the possible resources and professional assistance of international financial and trade
institutions - the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, and other
organizations.

54. In the realization of the Security Strategy, the Slovak Republic will continue to build an information society,
with the aim to approach the level of the developed European countries. In connection with the accession process
to NATO and the European Union, it will endeavor to build information systems that would be interoperable with
the systems of the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and corresponding to their
requirements for the protection of secret information. In the same way it will make preparations for the realization
of industrial and information security requirements.

- Protection of the environment

55. As an important part of formulating its security environment, the Slovak Republic considers the field of the
environment in its global, continental and regional meanings. It perceives a direct relationship between a


-----

worsening environment and an ecologically negligent industrial development, and therefore it will ensure
application of environmental issues into all industrial programs with the aim to realize the national strategy of
sustainable development. We are aware that non-acceptance of rational ecological principles in the utilization of
natural wealth and resources has as its consequence a serious disturbance of the environment, with an impact on
the worsening state of health of the population and on the growth in the occurrence of dangerous diseases and
infections which cannot be coped with by individual states by their own means.

ENHANCING THE ABILITY AND READINESS TO RESPOND TO RISKS AND THREATS

- Guaranteeing state defense

56. In view of continuing regional tensions and possibilities of their escalation into armed conflicts, the Slovak
Republic will contribute within the framework of effective prevention to such an international arrangement in which
armed violence is the most extreme way of addressing disputes among states or inside states. It will contribute to
the effort to prevent the emergence of regional tensions and regional conflicts. It will adapt its legal order, as well
as the structure and abilities of its armed forces, so that it will be able to assign adequate forces and means for
activities of the international community.

57. As a consequence of qualitative changes in the security environment and the emergence of new challenges,
risks and threats, the Slovak Republic will in the forthcoming period intensify the process of systemic changes,
which will create conditions for guaranteeing its defense. The expression of a new quality in addressing this field
will be the adoption of the Defense and Military Strategies of the Slovak Republic. In accordance with this, a
fundamental reform of the state defense system will be implemented with its subsequent inclusion into the new
security system of the state, which will correspond to the standards of states of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, and guarantee effectively the security of the state in peacetime, in crisis situations, or in war.

58. Within the framework of reform of the state defense system, the Slovak Republic will implement reform of its
armed forces, which will in their character, composition, system of management and command, training and
education, be gradually made interoperable with the armed forces of the member states of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. In addition to abilities to fulfil the traditional tasks connected with the guarantee of state
defense, they must be able to adequately respond to new challenges, risks and threats of a military and also a
non-military character. The armed forces must increase their readiness for international military co-operation in
accordance with the integration interests of the Slovak Republic. The strategic intention is to build up an
adequately armed and well-trained armed force that would be able to ensure the defense of the state and to fulfil
its international commitments and agreements. The Slovak Republic will ensure its readiness for defense also by
the implementation of a defense planning system that is an integral part of the management of state defense.

- Integration into Euro-Atlantic political and security structures

59. The Slovak Republic will contribute to the creation of an integrated security structure of mutually
complementary and reinforcing organizations that would be able to prevent an emergence of a global conflict in a
long-term outlook. From a political and military view, it considers the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to be the
fundamental element of this structure, which is able to guarantee collective defense for its members and
contribute to security and stability in Europe. The Slovak Republic seeks to attain full-membership in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization as the optimum variant of attainment of effective security guarantees.

60. During the accession process, the Slovak Republic and its armed forces will make complex preparations for
entry into the political and military structures of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Slovak Republic will
realize its national program of Preparation for Entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (PRENAME) in
accordance with the Membership Action Plan (MAP), which was approved at the Washington Summit of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.

61. After achieving membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Slovak Republic will complete the
building of the defense system so that it will be interoperable with the defense system of the other member states
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and complete the formation of the defense infrastructure for the needs of
collective defense, and it will assign forces and means for the joint commands of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. It will actively take part in collective defense planning, common financing and planning of
operations, creation of multinational headquarters and units, creation of an integrated system of air-defense and
the creation of a complex interconnection of crisis management mechanisms of the state with crisis management
centers of the states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

- Strengthening of internal security


-----

62. In the endeavor to avoid uncontrollable and illegal migration and related trafficking in humans, the Slovak
Republic will gradually harmonize the foreign and asylum policy with the policy of the states of the European
Union. It will thoroughly judge the political, economic and social reasons of migrants, and on this basis it will
differentiate its measures, especially in eliminating possible negative economic and social effects connected with
a larger migration wave. The Slovak Republic considers the co-ordination of border protection, international cooperation and realization of requirements of the Schengen Agreement as a part of prevention of this risk. It will
create internal conditions for the prevention of economic emigration from the Slovak Republic, especially
speculative emigration of the Romany citizens, and participate in the solution of this problem in the European
context.

63. In the deepening of internal security and order in close co-operation with materially relevant supranational
organizations, the Slovak Republic will create the conditions for an elimination of risks connected with negative
social phenomena within society, the significance of which is growing by their interconnection to international
structures. It will improve the quality of internal functions of the state so that principal attention will be paid to the
protection of lives, rights and freedoms of people, their health and personal security and the protection of public
order. It will strengthen legal certainties of citizens in the protection of private property and will increase the vigor
in the protection of public property and public order. It will place special emphasis on prevention and elimination of
various organized forms of property crimes, but primarily violent crimes, as well as economic crimes manifesting
itself in corruption, tax evasion, fraud, and misuse of property and financial assets It will modify its legislation and
deepen the efficiency of control along these lines. The state organs will proceed particularly vigorously in
uncovering signs of corruption and clientelism in the economic field. Attention will be paid to criminality, which is
on the increase as a consequence of the social and economic polarization of society, and also to juvenile
criminality, spreading of drugs, and crimes with a racial motive. Joint action by state organs, citizens, families, the
public, educational institutions and the media must be improved in this endeavor.

64. The guarantee of internal security and order and the protection of public order in the Slovak Republic is a
matter not only for the Police Force of the Slovak Republic, the armed corps and the armed security corps, but
also a matter for the state organs and local governmental organs, and legal and physical entities. It is necessary
to improve the quality of information awareness, mutual co-ordination of activities, as well as the level of general
safeguarding of all involved entities within the framework of the security system being created, to strengthen the
participation of the means of mass communication, non-governmental organizations and citizens in this field. By
such a co-ordinated complex approach, together with a more effective and more flexible work by public
prosecutors and the courts, it is necessary to increase the legal awareness in the society, citizens' confidence in
state organs and to strengthen the feeling of their personal security.

65. The success of the progress of the Slovak Republic against the activities of foreign intelligence services
depends primarily on quality improvement of the management system, the co-ordination and co-operation of our
special services from the level of the state. The emphasis will be placed on increasing the level of analytical and
information activities, which will enable the adoption of timely preventive measures. In accordance with the
interest to enter the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Slovak Republic will deepen the level of co-operation
with the special services of states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the fields of common interest,
especially in the introduction of corresponding standards of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for the
protection of secret information.

66. The Slovak Republic will seek to ensure adequate energy security and reduce the vulnerability of the
economy, especially by diversifying energy and raw material inputs from stable states and regions, and by
adapting the supply build-up process to the requirements valid in the European Union. For the elimination of risks,
threats and emergency situations, the Slovak Republic will create adequate reserves and ensure the mechanism
of an effective transformation of the economy to an emergency economy.

- Prevention of social risks and threats and their elimination

67. Concentration on well-balanced demographic development and quality improvement of the healthcare of
citizens on the basis of modern scientific information will be a part of the efforts in the social area. The Slovak
Republic will intensify the education of citizens towards higher personal responsibility for their own state of health
and a healthy way of life. It will become actively involved in the international medical community and in the World
Health Organization. The co-ordination of activity of state organs, public institutions and the non-governmental
sector will be deepened in the realization of social policy, so as to bring it closer to the standards of European
countries.

68. A well-reasoned social policy is considered by the Slovak Republic to be the basis for elimination of social
risks and one of the most important tools for guaranteeing internal social-political stability, prosperity and security.
The determining factor will be a gradual increase of the standard of living of the population, making the social
network more effective and addressing assistance to socially weak and handicapped citizens in their adaptation to
the changed conditions of life in connection with an increase of performance of the economy.

69. The Slovak Republic will ensure preservation of social peace, maintenance of social stability and a bearable
degree of unemployment by an interconnection of social and economic policy with the aim of approaching
gradually the level of the countries of the European Union, and thus at the same time create conditions for the
maintenance of a qualified labor force on its territory.

70. In view of the cross-border impact of environmental issues, the Slovak Republic will co-operate on the
international level in maintaining the quality of the environment, on protecting natural resources, and on
preventing risks and tensions in the environmental field. It will consistently apply the principles and the legislation
of the European Union in the field of the environment and participate in common actions of member states of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and partner countries regarding questions of environmental security.

SECURITY SYSTEM OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC

71. In order to realize the security policy, the Government of the Slovak Republic will ensure the building-up of the
security system of the state, which will represent a complex, integrated system with purposefully arranged
functions and structures, with the division of authority specified in concrete terms, and with a mechanism of interrelations between the elements.

72. The mission of the security system will be planning, management and co-ordination of tasks, measures and
activities of its elements for guaranteeing the level of state security in peacetime, in crisis situations, and in war
with an effective utilization of internal resources and means of the state and international assistance.

73. The security system of the Slovak Republic must be able to:

## • analyze the security environment, its global, regional and sub-regional aspects, 
 • classify security risks and threats to the Slovak Republic and tendencies of their development, 
 • determine the procedures and measures for prevention and elimination of security risks and threats and
the solution of emergency situations in accordance with available resources and capabilities,

## • ensure an effective management and co-ordination of forces and means in the prevention, avoidance,
mitigation and elimination of consequences of individual kinds of security risks, threats and crisis
situations, including the establishment of a crisis management system of the state with a precise
allocation of authority and mutual connections between the National Council of the Slovak Republic, the
Government of the Slovak Republic, the President of the Slovak Republic and other state organs and
local governmental organs, and legal and physical entities,

## • achieve the required degree of interoperability with the security systems of the member states of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and with its neighbors, enabling effective international co-operation of
the entire system and its individual elements,

## • act as an integral part of the mechanism of state management in accordance with the legal order of the
Slovak Republic,

## • ensure the required degree of sensitivity and flexibility,

importance, the mission of which is to create systematic conditions for a complex guarantee of the security of the
Slovak Republic. From the view of formulating the interests of the Slovak Republic and determining basic aims
and strategic procedures for their realization in individual fields, the Security Strategy of the Slovak Republic
represents a document of long-term validity, which expresses the necessary degree of social-political consensus
and support of the majority citizens of the state.

orientation of the Security Strategy of the Slovak Republic not only to the current tasks connected with their
realization, but also to a clear formulation of prospective aims and expectations. It is obvious that the dynamic
development of the world will bring new challenges and new risks and threats to the Slovak Republic in the future,
to which it should be prepared to reply and respond. Therefore in addition to the current ability to take part in
shaping of the international security environment and the actual readiness to respond to challenges, risks and
threats, continuous preparation for the future is also a none the less important part of its strategy. The Slovak
Republic will ensure the realization of its interests by means of long-term strategies in the political, economic,
environmental, social, military and cultural fields, which will be based on the values recognized and respected by
the democratic world.
