**THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE SECURITY AND DEFENSE POLICY OF THE**
**REPUBLIC OF HUNGARY.**

In the course of the past few years, changes of fundamental importance have taken place
in the external security situation of the Republic of Hungary, to a decisive extent as a result
of the achievements made in the field of Euro-Atlantic integration. With the achievement of
membership in NATO and the practical advancement of the process of accession to the
European Union, the country has also institutionally become a member of the community
of democratic, developed and stable nations of the Euro-Atlantic region. All this requires
the basic principles of the security and defense policy of the Republic of Hungary to be
redefined.

1. The Republic of Hungary defines security in a comprehensive sense, which includes,
beside the traditional political and military factors, also other dimensions of security as
defined in a broader sense – that is, its economic and financial, human and minority rights,
information- and technology-related, environmental as well as international legal
dimensions. In the world of global challenges, international political and economic mutual
interdependence and technological development, the security of the Euro-Atlantic region
has become indivisible.

2. As compared to the age of the bipolar international system, the threat of a worldwide
armed conflict has decreased to a minimum while at the same time, the circle of risks and
sources of threat has significantly increased and become more complex. Hungary’s
security is influenced mainly by the development of security in the Euro-Atlantic region and
the political, social and economic processes taking place in its region. However, the
country must not consider itself immune to the global sources of threat, either. Its
membership in an alliance system will bring about additional responsibilities and at the
same time, increased opportunities in the context of handling the latter.


-----

Increasing risks stem from the transitional and durable differences between countries and
groups which have their origins in the differing levels of social development, from
economic, financial and social crises, ethnic and religious tensions, terrorism, organized
crime, illegal drug and arms trafficking, demographical tensions, mass migration and largescale environmental hazards. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their
carriers as well as the possibility of attacks against information system also constitute an
increasing challenge and threat. Besides, inter-state as well as intra-state armed conflicts
continue to persist in Europe. A particular source of threat in our region is instability and
unpredictability stemming from transformation and the fragility of the processes of
democratization.

A particular feature of security in our region is the fact that new and traditional kinds of
challenges often emerge simultaneously and reinforcing each other.

3. The main purpose of the security policy of the Republic of Hungary is,

-  to guarantee the independence, sovereign statehood and territorial integrity of the
country,

-  to create appropriate conditions for the implementation of the principles enshrined in the
Constitution, to promote the practice of the rule of law and the undisturbed functioning of
democratic institutions and the market economy and to contribute to the internal stability of
the country,

-  to promote the full implementation of citizens’, human as well as national and ethnic
minority rights in the Republic of Hungary,

-  to create the necessary conditions for the safeguarding of the safety as well as material
and social security of all persons living on the territory of the Republic of Hungary and for
the safeguarding of national wealth,

-  to contribute to the implementation of the contents of the North Atlantic Treaty and to the
security of its Allies,

-  to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and to the enhancement of
security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic region, in Europe and its immediate
neighborhood,

-  to contribute to ensuring the conditions for the international economic, political, cultural
and other kinds of relations and co-operation of the Republic of Hungary,

4. The Republic of Hungary wishes to achieve the above goals in accordance with the
Constitutions and the standards of international law, in particular with the basic principles
and commitments enshrined in the United Nations Charter, in the documents of the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Council of Europe and in the
North Atlantic Treaty as well as in other relevant international documents and through the
respect of its obligations undertaken in regional and bilateral treaties.

5. The Republic of Hungary considers no state as its enemy and treats all actors of
international politics, which abide by the basic principles of international law as partners. It
wishes to settle matters of dispute in accordance with the international law and taking into
account the European practice.

6. The Republic of Hungary bases its security on two fundamental pillars: its national selfstrength, on the one hand, an on Euro-Atlantic integration and international co-operation,
on the other.


-----

7. The Republic of Hungary wishes to promote its security and the well-being of its citizens
in a durable manner as a member of the democratic community of Euro-Atlantic nations.

The Republic of Hungary may maintain its security in the most effective manner as a
member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization / further on referred to as Alliance /
which is based on the principle of collective defense. As an integral part of the political and
military structures of the Alliance, Hungary assumes the tasks that fall upon it in the
context of collective defense. Hungary considers constructive participation in the
consultative and decision-making system of the Alliance as a means to contribute to the
enhancement of security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic region as well as to the effective
manifestation of its national interests. Hungary considers transatlantic co-operation as a
factor of fundamental importance from the point of view of security in Europe also in the
long run. Within the frameworks of co-operation within the Alliance, it supports the
development of a European Security and Defense Identity, which constitutes an important
element of Hungary's integration policy.

In the course of its history, European integration - and the European Union, which
constitutes the most important framework of the latter - has established the economic and
political fundaments of security of its member countries. On the basis of the ongoing
negotiations with the European Union and while keeping its national interests in mind, it is
a realistic goal for the Republic of Hungary to become a full-fledged member of the
European Union within a few years and to take part in the shaping and implementation of
the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the Union.

As part of its Euro-Atlantic strategy, the Republic of Hungary is striving for full-fledged
membership also in the Western European Union, which it considers as a significant future
means of coping with the regional challenges.

8. The Republic of Hungary continues to play an active role in the activities of the United
Nations, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe,
the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development as well as of the
international arms control and non-proliferation regimes. These organizations and forms of
co-operation constitute important frameworks for the implementation Hungarian security
policy goals in the context of setting norms and standards, security- and confidencebuilding, conflict-prevention and -management as well as the continuous monitoring of the
implementation of the international commitments it has assumed. In providing for its
security, the Republic of Hungary attaches particular importance also to the regional and
sub-regional as well as the traditional bilateral forms of international co-operation.

9. International co-operation can only be successful through effective national
engagement. National self-strength will therefore continue to play a determinant role in
providing for the security of the country. The active participation, support and readiness of
sacrifice of the citizens are of crucial importance from the point of view of providing for the
security of the Republic of Hungary.

Hungarian security policy and its institutional system has to function a way to be able to
recognize in time and permanently and reliably assess the factors threatening the security
of the country, and on that basis, to be able to take the necessary timely decisions to
prevent situations of threat or contain the latter and to implement the measures thus
required.


-----

10. The Republic of Hungary is implementing its security policy goals mainly by means of
foreign policy, economic policy and defense policy.

11. Besides Euro-Atlantic integration, the Hungarian foreign policy focuses on the policy of
good-neighborliness and the welfare of the Hungarian communities living beyond its
borders.

Hungary is a stable point in the region of Eastern Central Europe and plays an initiative
role in extending stability in the region; it is striving for good-neighborly relations with all
the countries of the region, for the development of regional and sub-regional co-operation.
From the point of view of balanced and good-neighborly relations with neighboring states,
it attaches fundamental importance to the enhancement of economic, cultural and human
rights - including minority rights - co-operation among the countries of the region.

The Republic of Hungary wishes to develop its relations with other countries in the region
on the basis of Euro-Atlantic values, the standards of international law and mutual
interests. It is interested in seeing its neighbors themselves becoming members of the
Euro-Atlantic organization as soon as possible upon fulfilling the criteria of membership.
Hungary actively supports their endeavors to that end as well as the maintenance and
further enhancement of the Euro-Atlantic commitment.

The Republic of Hungary is paying distinguished attention to the situation of the Hungarian
communities living beyond its borders, to the implementation of their interests in harmony
with the norms of international law. Similarly, it considers as of fundamental importance
the full-fledged implementation of the rights of national minorities living on the territory of
Hungary. It considers the implementation of national minority rights as a factor that
enhances security, and as opposed to intolerant and aggressive nationalism and
endeavors aiming at the assimilation of national minorities and at the artificial alteration of
the ethnic composition of the population.

The situation of human rights including the situation of national and ethnic minorities must
not be considered as the exclusive internal affair of any country. Hungary deems it
necessary to settle the issue of national minorities on the basis of the norms of the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Council of Europe and of the
European practice and considers it as an integral part of good-neighborly relations and
Euro-Atlantic integration.

12. The Republic of Hungary may implement its security policy goals only through reliance
on a stable and developed market economy. The national economy must be able to
provide for the economic preconditions required for the achievement the security and
defense policy goals of the Republic of Hungary.

The Republic of Hungary wishes to pursue an economic policy that takes the requirements
of balance, stability and Euro-Atlantic integration into account and sets itself the goal of
sustainable, society- and environment-friendly economic growth based on continuously
improving competitively and job creation, thus ensuring, beside the implementation of
economic and social cohesion and solidarity, the welfare of the citizens of the country and
the continuous increase of living standards and quality in a durable manner.


-----

Preparing the economy for defense is a duty of the state during the implementation of
which the least necessary interference into market operations should be an important point
of view to be taken into account.

13. There will be a continued need for an armed force providing reliable defense and
contributing also to the common security of the Alliance and a concept ensuring the
effective application of the latter. The defense policy of the Republic of Hungary is based
on the unity and complementarity of alliance, cooperation, containment and defense.

The Republic of Hungary considers national defense as a national affair based on the joint
assumption of responsibility by the citizens. The system of national defense is built on the
unity of rights and obligations stemming from the North Atlantic Alliance, the self-esteem
and responsibility of the citizens that accept in full awareness the defense requirements of
the country as well as the Alliance, on an economy capable of satisfying the material
needs of the armed forces and national defense, a status apparatus prepared for defense,
an armed force capable of carrying out the military tasks of defense, on the democratic
and civilian management and control of the armed forces, a civil defense serving the
protection of the population and its material assets and on the support of the broadest
strata of the Hungarian society.

14. Hungary identifies itself with the principles of collective security and defense of the
Alliance. It maintains and develops its capability to avert an armed attack in accordance
with the basic principles enshrined in the North Atlantic Treaty. The main task of its armed
forces is to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Hungary and – on the basis of
the North Atlantic Treaty – to contribute to the Alliance’s collective defense. Another task
of it is to contribute to other, jointly undertaken Alliance missions, to participate in
international peace support and humanitarian operations carried out under the aegis of
international organizations as well as in large-scale industrial, civilizational and natural
disaster-relief operations. In all this, the Strategic Concept of the Alliance plays the role of
a guideline, in the elaboration and further development of which Hungary is taking an
active part.

The Republic of Hungary is aware, that meeting the challenges to security emerging in the
Euro-Atlantic region requires the continued maintenance of a credible defense capability of
the Alliance which is based on the full range of defense capabilities represented by the
member states of the Alliance and on the appropriate distribution of these defense
capabilities on the territory of the Alliance. In accordance with its commitment, Hungary is
ready in the interest of common defense to put the necessary military force at disposal and
to contribute to other missions of the Alliance in accordance with its possibilities.

15. The Republic of Hungary is shaping the organizational and command structure of its
armed forces, their internal composition and proportions as well as its armaments and
equipment in accordance with the realistically expected sources of threat, the defense
requirements of the country, the obligations undertaken in the framework of the Alliance
and its material and financial resources, and through harmonization with the Alliance. It
ensures the necessary harmony between the tasks defined and the resources of the
armed forces and of their maintenance and development.

16. A particular feature of the new types of challenges, risks and threats is the fact that
they appear in a complex manner and that their effects extend beyond the national
boundaries. Effective action against them requires close international co-operation also


-----

beyond the fields of foreign, economic and defense policy. To that end, the Republic of
Hungary takes an active part in both bi- and multilateral frameworks in the efforts aiming at
preventing and managing challenges and risks, especially with respect to the activities of
authorities in the field of justice, internal affairs, customs and finance, environmental
protection and disaster-relief and others.

17. The National Assembly of the Republic of Hungary will ensure the conditions required
for the fulfillment of the tasks stemming from this document. The Government of the
Republic of Hungary is responsible for the elaboration of the national security strategy, its
review is necessary as well as for the implementation of the tasks stemming from it.
