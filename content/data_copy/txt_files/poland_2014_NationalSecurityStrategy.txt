## INTRODUCTION

**1.** _The National Security Strategy of the Republic of Poland is a document devoted_
to the security of the state, elaborated and adopted in conformity with Article 6(1) and Article 4a(1) of the Act of 21[st] November 1967 on the Universal
Duty to Defend the Republic of Poland (Dz. U. [Polish Journal of Laws] of
2012, item 461, as amended). The strategy refers in a comprehensive manner to issues of national security and indicates optimal uses of all means that
the state has at its disposal in the sphere of defence, protection, society and
economy for security purposes. The key goal is their appropriate integration
in the national security system.

**2. The present document identifies national interests and strategic objectives**
in the domain of security, in accordance with principles and values comprised
in the _Constitution of the Republic of Poland. It determines the national security_
capacities, assesses Poland’s security environment in its global, regional and
national dimension and projects its development trends. It presents actions
of the state which are necessary to fulfil the defined interests and objectives,
and also points out directions and ways of preparation of the national security system.

**3. The content of the document is consistent with strategies of the North**
Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the European Union (EU), as well
as with strategy papers creating the national development management system, in particular with the medium-term national development strategy and
the national spatial development concept. For the purpose of elaboration of
_the_ _National Security Strategy of the Republic of Poland, results of the National_
Security Strategic Review concluded in 2012 – the first such an extensive
analysis project regarding the national security system and directions of its
development – were used.

## Chapter I

 POLAND AS A SECURITY ENTITY

**4. The Republic of Poland is a sovereign security entity independently de-**
fining its own national interests and strategic objectives. They result from
historical experience, existing political and structural conditions, as well as
the state’s capacities.

#### 1.1. Poland in Europe and in the world

**5.** Poland is a democratic state of law with a market economy, observing
international law by which it is bound. Poland strengthens its national security capacities in order to ensure a stable development of the country and an
improvement of the living conditions of its citizens. It actively participates
in international cooperation, develops friendly relations and cooperates with
countries from distant and immediate neighbourhood.

**6.** The membership to Euro-Atlantic and European cooperation structures
reinforces the security of the Republic of Poland. NATO constitutes the most
important form of political and military cooperation between Poland and its
allies. European Union supports Poland’s socio-economic development and
strengthens its position in the world. The United States of America remains
the most important non-European partner of Poland.

**7.** In the field of international security policy, the significance of regional
cooperation keeps gaining in importance. For Poland, the key formats in this
respect are the Weimar Triangle and the Visegrad Group. Within their framework, also bilateral political and military relations are developed. New areas
of collaboration among Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, the Nordic Group and Romania, as well as in other regions of Europe are sought.


-----

**8.** The Republic of Poland supports reforms in Eastern Partnership countries
and pronounces itself in favour of their closer links with the EU and NATO.
The starting point for these actions are the principles of freedom, democracy,
market economy and open perspective of integration with Euro-Atlantic institutions which embody them. As a neighbour of the Russian Federation,
Poland considers that both bilateral relations and NATO-Russia and EURussia relations should be developed on the basis of full respect for international law, including sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, as well
as freedom to choose their own path of development, political and military
alliances.

**9.** Poland is a reliable member of the United Nations (UN) which is responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security, as well as of the
Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), an important
element of the European cooperative security system.

**10. Taking into account its capacities and interests, Poland – as a part of the**
international community – is engaged in solving global problems. It maintains diplomatic relations with non-European partners and develops with
them a mutually beneficial political and economic cooperation.

#### 1.2. National interests and strategic objectives

**11. The Republic of Poland ensures security of the state and of citizens by**
creating conditions to pursue national interests and fulfil strategic objectives.
National interests are specified in Article 5 of the Constitution of the Republic
of Poland. They constitute a foundation of the **national security interests,**
which include:

- possession of effective national security capacities ensuring readiness 
and ability to prevent threats, including deterrence, defence and protection against them, as well as elimination of their consequences;

- strong international position of Poland and membership in reliable inter-
national security systems;


-----

- individual and collective protection of citizens against threats to their life 
and health, as well as against the violation, loss or degradation of goods
(tangible and intangible) which are important for them.

- ensuring that citizens freely enjoy freedoms and rights, without detri-
ment to the safety of others and of the security of the state, as well as
assuring national identity and cultural heritage;

- ensuring a sustainable and balanced development of the social and eco-
nomic potential of the state, with particular attention paid to environmental protection, as well as living conditions and health of people as the
basis of existence.

**12. The foregoing set of interests constitutes a foundation of corresponding**
**strategic security objectives:**

- maintaining and demonstrating readiness of the integrated national se-
curity system for seizing opportunities, taking up challenges, reducing
risks and preventing threats;

- improving the integrated national security system, in particular its man-
agement elements, including the provision of necessary resources and
capabilities;

- developing the defence and protection capabilities that would be ade-
quate to the needs and capacities of the state, as well as increasing their
interoperability within NATO and the EU;

- reinforcing NATO’s readiness and ability to provide collective defence, 
as well as the coherence of EU’s actions in the field of security; building
a strong position of Poland in the two organisations;

- developing close cooperation with all neighbours and building partner-
ship relations with other states aimed, inter alia, to prevent and solve international conflicts and crises;

- promoting, in the international arena, principles of international law 
and universal values, such as democracy, human rights and civil liberties,
as well as increasing the Polish society’s awareness of human and civil
rights;


-----

- ensuring public security by improving the national rescue and fire-fight-
ing system and the system for monitoring, notifying and warning about
threats and eliminating consequences of natural disasters and catastrophes, as well as implementing legal and organisational solutions in the
system of civil protection and civil defence;

- improving and developing the national crisis management system in or-
der to ensure its internal cohesion and integrity, as well as to allow for
an undistorted cooperation within the framework of crisis management
systems of international organisations of which Poland is a member;

- protecting Polish borders constituting the external border of the EU; pre-
venting organised crime, including economic crime; protecting public order;

- improving system solutions aimed at preventing and combating terrorism 
and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction;

- ensuring safe functioning of the Republic of Poland in the cyberspace; 

- ensuring safe conditions for the development of human and social capi-
tal, of innovativeness, efficiency and competitiveness of the economy, as
well as of the state’s financial stability;

- ensuring energy security and climate security, as well as protection of 
the environment, biodiversity and natural resources, in particular water
resources, and shaping the spatial development of the country in a manner increasing the resistance to a variety of hazards, in particular military,
natural and technological ones;

- ensuring food security;

- conducting an effective family policy and adjusting the migration policy 
to new challenges;

- increasing public awareness in the domain of security and expanding 
citizens’ competencies allowing them to appropriately respond to crisis
situations.


-----

**13. National interests and strategic objectives in the field of security are**
translated into strategic measures and tasks, according to security conditions
and the possibility of their implementation.

#### 1.3. Strategic capacities of the national security

**14. The national security capacities serve national interests and the fulfil-**
ment of strategic objectives. Its enhancement constitutes a proof of care for
the safety of Poland and a contribution to the strengthening of the defence
capabilities of NATO and the EU.

**15. The** **national security system comprises appropriately organised,**
maintained and prepared forces, means and resources devoted by the state to
the execution of tasks in this area. It is composed of a management subsystem and executive subsystems, in particular operational (defence and protection) subsystems, as well as support (social and economic) subsystems.

**16. The** **management subsystem is a key element of the national secu-**
rity system. It is composed of public authorities and heads of organisational
units performing tasks related to the national security, as well as advisory
bodies, administrative apparatus, functioning procedures and appropriate
infrastructure. It is founded on solid constitutional principles. A special role
in the management of the national security is played by the Parliament, the
President of the Republic of Poland and the Council of Ministers. An important element of the national security management subsystem is crisis management.

**17. Executive subsystems are forces and means intended for the imple-**
mentation of tasks in the field of national security, being at the disposal
of security management bodies. They include operational (defence and protection) and support (social and economic) subsystems. Operational subsystems are aimed to seize opportunities, take up challenges, reduce risks
and prevent threats of political and military as well as non-military nature.
Social and economic subsystems supply them with appropriate capabilities and
resources.


-----

**18. The necessity to develop** **the** **defence capacities is widely accepted.**
The main element of the defence capacities are professional Armed Forces
of the Republic of Poland. Their technical modernisation – unprecedented
in terms of scale – which is legally guaranteed, stable and long-term funding of the state’s defence needs, leads to the acquisition of modern military equipment and expansion of operational capabilities. Modernisation
processes cover also various aspects of the functioning of Polish diplomacy,
secret services acting in favour of the defence and Polish defence industry
as well as related research and development capacities. A consistently implemented security policy, which constitutes an integral part of the Polish
foreign policy, favours the strengthening of defence capacities in military
and non-military terms.

**19. Internally diverse** **protection capabilities support the state in the**
execution of tasks related to the national security. They are constituted by:
judicial authorities; secret services; state services, guards and inspections
specialised in the protection of public order, rescue and civil protection
services; crisis management elements; Border Guard, Customs Service; entities from the private sector (companies protecting persons and property);
non-governmental organisations (in particular social rescue organizations). A significant role is played by entities responsible for the protection
of cyber security, as well as for prevention and combating terrorism and
extremism.

**20. Social potential, including human capital, constitutes an important**
factor determining the growth of the national economy, efficiency of the
state, activity of civil society and general improvement in the quality of life of
citizens. A modern public education and higher education system, as well as
popularisation of various forms of life-long learning serve the creation of an
active and mobile society. Education for security is an important element of
the development of human and social capital.

**21. Economic potential. Over the last two decades, Polish economy was**
continuously growing. Thanks to the constant Gross Domestic Product
growth, living conditions of the society improve and indicators of the na

-----

tional economy approach the level of the average GDP in the EU. The investment activity of Polish companies abroad and increasing exports indicate the
growth and increasing competitiveness of the Polish economy.

**22. Energy is one of key elements of the national security. Main energy se-**
curity factors include the access to energy resources, also outside the country,
diversification of fuel supply sources and directions, as well as construction
of new generation capacity based on various generation technologies that
would allow to balance the domestic demand for energy. The energy policy
of Poland is focused on ensuring appropriate development of the generation,
transmission and storage infrastructure, as well as on stimulating investment in modern, energy-efficient technologies and products, and on limiting
the dependence on supplies of energy resources.

**23. Transport system. Modern road and railway network, developed net-**
work of inland waterways, airports, seaports and infrastructure of access to
these ports, as well as effective public transport system, allow for the development of the Polish economy and strengthen its ties with the global economy.
They constitute an important component of the national security and territorially balanced development of the country. Modern transport infrastructure,
modernised rolling stock and integral freight management systems decrease
costs in the economy, contributing at the same time to a decrease in the environmental pressure. Systematic improvement in the transport infrastructure
will constitute one of the basic challenges for the development of the state.

## Chapter II

 SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OF POLAND

**24. The contemporary security environment is characterised by the blurring**
of boundaries between its internal and external, military and non-military
dimensions. The globalisation and increasing interdependence often result
in unpredictability of phenomena, the scope of which is no longer limited by
geographical borders, political and economic systems. Challenges and threats
of military nature still exist. The security of Poland will depend on its ability to effectively advance its national interests and fulfil strategic objectives
in current and predicted security conditions. It refers in particular to seizing opportunities and facing challenges of internal and external, asymmetric
and transsectoral nature, which constitute a result of interacting political,
military, socio-economic, demographical and environmental processes and
phenomena.

#### 2.1. Global dimension

**25. Globalisation processes, development of a multipolar political order, mili-**
tary threats and a range of challenges of asymmetric character impact the
security and stability of states. Together with development disparities and
interstate competition they increase the risk of occurrence of conflicts, disputes and tensions. The threat of regional and local conflicts have not disappeared.

**26. The** **United Nations – the only structure established to ensure global**
security, it occupies a special position in the system of international organisations. The existence of areas of disfunctionality, non-decisiveness and rivalry
between states and regional groups constitutes an unfavourable phenomena


-----

which results in a decrease in the legitimacy and effectiveness of its activities.
It will be of basic importance to increase the efficiency and credibility of the
UN as a source of legitimate actions of the international community in various spheres of global security.

**27. Consequences of actions undertaken by states which are not covered by**
the international cooperation system and do not observe rules of international law (or do it selectively) remain a global problem. Undermining commonly
legitimised standards of peaceful coexistence of states leads to a weakening
of the contemporary international order.

**28. It is alarming that, in recent years,** **the** **credibility of disarmament**
**agreements, including those related to non-proliferation of weapons of**
mass destruction, has been undermined. It is related to the threat of uncontrolled development of the weapons, occurrence of a new arms race or
access to this type of weaponry by terrorist groups.

**29. The persistence of authoritarian orders and confrontational attitudes,**
disregard for rules of international law, democratic standards, as well as
human rights and rights of ethnic and religious minorities remain another
problem of global security. In the case of certain authoritarian states it is related to the creation of attractive economic models, which challenge systems
of Western democracy and market economy. It increases the responsibility of
the international community for supporting and promoting democracy, the
rule of law and security. The Polish systemic transformation remains an example and source of good practice for states transforming their political, legal
and economic systems.

**30. Threats for the global security will still include international terrorism**
**and organised crime as components of instability and internal conflicts,**
as well as a source of such pathologies as: smuggling of weapons, nuclear
and dual-use materials; drug and human trafficking; kidnapping and illegal financial operations. Another challenge includes uncontrolled migrations
caused both by conflicts and problems of economic and social nature.


-----

**31. Together with the occurrence of new information and communication**
technologies (ICT) and the development of the internet, new threats have appeared, such as cybercrime, cyberterrorism, cyber espionage and cyber
**conflicts, with the participation of non-state entities, and cyber war under-**
stood as confrontation between countries in the cyberspace. Current trends
in the development of threats in the cyberspace clearly indicate an increasing
influence of the level of security of the cyber domain on the general security
of the country. Considering an increasing dependence on ICT, conflicts in the
cyberspace may seriously disrupt the functioning of societies and states.

**32. Various forms of** **extremism motivated by political, religious, ethnic,**
socio-economic or other reasons pose an important challenge for the international security. They are particularly dangerous when they are connected
with the use of terrorism as an instrument for action. The phenomenon of
extremism may be of organised character, as well as it may result from actions of individuals.

**33. As a consequence of dynamic social, economic and technological devel-**
opment of the world, an **increase in the demand for energy, food and**
**drinking water is becoming another challenge. Energy resources and rare**
earth metals often occur in politically instable territories or become a tool for
achievement of political goals of exporting countries. An increasing demand
for food is a consequence of a population explosion observed in many parts of
the world, climate changes and uneven economic development. It leads to an
increase in food prices and inability of certain states to meet the food needs of
the population. Decreasing resources of drinkable water and a considerable
contamination of its intakes may become a cause of conflicts and wars in the
future.

#### 2.2. Regional dimension

**34. The security of Europe will be determined by four main factors: NATO,**
European Union, strategic presence of the US in the European continent and
relations with Russia. It is important that the evolution of security in Europe
favours coherence and solidarity, as well as development of defence capabili

-----

ties of NATO and the EU, and not a decrease in Member States’ ambitions
related to this domain. Maintenance of an adequate level of defence capabilities and political will to fulfil obligations related to security will prevent
security processes from being organised according to multi-speed criteria.

**35. In the foreseeable future, Europe will remain a continent with diverse**
military threats – most states conduct an enhanced political and military cooperation and belong to the structures of multilateral cooperation (NATO and
the EU). Nevertheless, in contemporary Europe there still exist sources of
**potential destabilisation resulting from political and territorial disputes,**
as well as ethnic and religious tensions, which may transform into military
conflicts. Only lasting peace solutions and a permanent support of the international community may allow to solve conflicts and eliminate the risk of
open confrontation.

**36. In the neighbourhood of Poland, there is a risk of regional and local con-**
flicts which could engage the country indirectly or directly. Moreover, Poland
is not free from forms of political pressure which uses military arguments. In
its closest vicinity, there is a large concentration of military potentials, also
in offensive posture. Threats for Poland may, in unfavourable conditions, become non-military and military. As far as military threats are concerned, they
may take the form of crisis threats or war threats i.e. of military conflicts of
various scale – from military activities below the threshold of classical war to
a less probable large scale conflict.

**37. NATO will remain the most important political and military Alliance and**
a guarantor of Poland’s security. It is crucial for the North Atlantic Alliance
to maintain a full spectrum of military and political capabilities, as well as
solidarity between Allies, which guarantee the fulfilment of its core mission
– collective defence – and make it possible to undertake other tasks resulting
from the evolution of its environment.

**38. The** **European Union and the Common Security and Defence Policy**
(CSDP) developed within its framework will constitute an important factor
determining Poland’s security. Further evolution of the CSDP depends on the


-----

progress of integration processes within the European Union, intensification
of collaboration between the EU and NATO, political will to build defence capabilities, and active operational involvement of the EU in its neighbourhood.
It is important to strive to develop, within the framework of the European
Union, the cooperation aimed at the creation of the Area of Freedom, Security
and Justice, in particular in the field of the judiciary and internal affairs. It is in
Poland’s interest to face these challenges in an ambitious manner.

**39.** A continuous downward trend in the size of defence budgets of NATO
**and EU countries will have a negative impact on both organisations’ ability to**
act. The situation could be improved by the strengthening of the strategic and
operational cooperation between NATO and the EU in the field of security.

**40. The** **reorientation of the American foreign policy towards the Asia**
Pacific Region and the evolution of priorities of the U.S. in the domain of
international security will impact the condition of transatlantic relations. It
is important to preserve a significant and lasting commitment of the United
States in European security matters, within the framework of NATO and bilateral relations. It is also important for European countries to appropriately
engage in the transatlantic cooperation, to increase their responsibility in the
sphere of security and to develop adequate capabilities and resources.

**41. Russia’s relations with the West will remain an important factor influ-**
encing the security of Poland, the region and Europe. The reassertion of Russia’s position as a major power at the expense of its neighbourhood, as well
as the escalation of its confrontational policy, an example of which is the
conflict with Ukraine, including the annexation of Crimea, has a negative
impact on the security in the region.

**42. Changes taking place in the field of security increase the significance**
of regional cooperation, both in its political and defence dimension. An enhanced cooperation between sub-regions of Europe in the area of security,
including defence, will remain favourable from the political and economic
perspective. However, it cannot replace allied and pan-European solutions in
this regard.


-----

**43. The European security policy is beginning to be challenged by process-**
es taking place in EU eastern neighbourhood countries, connected with
a strong political, military and economic pressure of Russia, which is pursuing its own interests. It concerns in particular the condition of democracy
and orientations of political transformation, military potential, reintegration processes covering, inter alia, the domain of defence, as well as local and
regional conflicts favouring the consolidation of instability in the region. It
would be favourable for the said countries to participate in European integration processes, which strengthen security and mutual trust, and are based on
the respect for state sovereignty and territorial integrity.

**44. The situation in the region of North Africa and Middle East, as well as the**
persisting potential for instability in the Balkans is a serious challenge for the
European security.

**45. As for the cooperative security, the potential of** **the** **Organisation for**
**Security and Cooperation in Europe still plays an important role as a fo-**
rum for political discussion and practical actions aimed to solve conflict situations. The OSCE has a broad range of instruments for solving crisis situations
at its disposal, but its actual effectiveness depends on the commitment of
participating countries. Due to deepening divisions in Europe, an improvement in the functioning of the organisation should not be expected in the
upcoming years.

**46. A negative phenomenon is the weakening of the conventional arms**
**control regime and of the confidence-building measures system in**
**Europe, as well as the instrumental use of provisions of OSCE documents**
related to this domain for the purpose of legitimising often intense military
activities. The crisis related to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe
(CFE Treaty) remains unsolved and it has to be expected that such a state of
affairs will not change in the longer term. It will have negative consequences
for the security and mutual trust in the OSCE area.

**47. The importance of** **security in the cyberspace will increase, just like**
the responsibility of states for its protection and defence. From the point of


-----

view of increasing the level of security of the Republic of Poland in the cyberspace, considerable significance is attributed to the policy of organisations
and structures of international cooperation, in the work on which Poland is
taking part, and bilateral cooperation with selected states, in particular with
NATO and EU countries.

**48. The** **ageing of the population of European states will result in a bur-**
den on the public finances. In order to ensure generational renewal, the European Union, including Poland, must elaborate common solutions with regard to migration, improve standards in the field of family policy of Member
States, and popularise the policy of active and healthy ageing. It is in Poland’s
interest that the EU migration policy do not discriminate Eastern Partnership
countries and that it allows for the inflow of highly qualified workers.

**49. Due to the dependence of European Union states on the import of en-**
ergy resources, it will be necessary to ensure energy security by means of
continuous and diversified sources of supply of natural gas and crude oil.
The reduction of oil transportation through the territory of Poland to Central European countries, as well as of import of the raw material to Poland
with the use of the existing infrastructure will become another challenge.
The creation of a common European energy market and maintenance of
solidarity behaviours of Member States, aimed at the development of uniform rules and instruments increasing the energy security, will constitute
an opportunity. It will be a challenge for Poland to ensure effective institutional and legal conditions for prospecting and exploiting raw materials
from unconventional deposits and for the development of nuclear energy,
a considerable part of fuel cycle of which is located in the territory of the
EU, while the uranium used for its purposes can be found mainly in politically stable countries.

**50. The preservation of biodiversity is an important goal of the European**
policy. One of tools for its achievement is the _Natura 2000 network, which_
protects species and habitats of Community importance. It is vital to include
biodiversity issues in other policies and to take the costs of its loss into consideration in financial accounting.


-----

#### 2.3. National dimension

**51. A deteriorating demographic situation, caused by the falling birth rate**
and economic emigration, is becoming a more and more serious development
challenge faced by Poland. It is related to numerous threats, including labour
shortages, a considerable burden for the social security system, and the necessity to ensure conditions for the prolongation of professional and social
activity of the elderly.

**52. A barrier for further development is also the persistent phenomenon**
of long-term unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, which result in
**social stratification and unequal access to goods and services. Activation**
measures, allowing for a widespread participation in various spheres of socioeconomic life provide an opportunity for social cohesion.

**53.** **Health security of citizens contributes to the national security. It is in-**
fluenced by intensifying demographic changes, as well as changes in environmental conditions and the development of new technologies.

**54. Challenges for public security and public order will persist, including**
those related to civil protection, security of mass events and road traffic, as
well as organised, economic and drug-related crime, and human trafficking.

**55. Due to the international nature of** **terrorism and the intensity of its**
manifestations, Poland is not free from such threats. Individuals and small
groups of people using terror methods as a tool for achieving their own political, social, economic or religious goals may turn out to be particularly dangerous.

**56. An improving position of Poland in the international arena, as well as its**
membership to NATO and the EU, result in an increased interest of foreign
**secret services in our country. Possible unauthorised disclosure or theft of**
classified information and other data protected by law may cause damage to
the national security and interests of the Republic of Poland.


-----

**57. Safe functioning of the information and communication system**
**of the Republic of Poland is a condition for the uninterrupted functioning**
of the entire state. It remains a challenge to ensure the availability, integrity
and confidentiality of data processed in information and communication systems of public administration. Furthermore, there are no uniform ITC security measures. From the security point of view, the insufficient level of users’
knowledge with regard to threats in cyberspace, as well as the need to solve
the dilemma between personal freedom and protection of rights of individuals and the use of measures aimed at the maintenance of the security of the
state, is important.

**58. Corruption constitutes a barrier for the further development of Poland**
and a challenge for its economic security. Areas which are particularly threatened by it include: infrastructure, computerisation of public administration,
use of EU funds, health service, defence, energy and environmental protection.

**59. Secure financial system, based on public finances sustainable in the**
medium term, with financial institutions constructed adequately to the challenges of our times, is one of the most important instruments for the stable
development of the state.

**60. Another challenge for the national security is the dependence of the na-**
tional economy on supplies of energy raw materials from one source and
fluctuations in prices of the resources caused by developments in the international markets. The energy sector will be more and more influenced by the
EU regulatory policy creating financial challenges and introducing restrictions on freedom of action in the sphere of energy. Energy security will improve due to the diversification in routes and sources of raw material supply,
the use of unconventional deposits, generation sources, also based on nuclear
power, as well as to the achievement of stability of energy supplies by means
of the development of generation and network infrastructure.

**61. An unsatisfactory competitiveness of the** **Polish economy is also a chal-**
lenge for the security. Innovativeness, knowledge-based growth, e-business

and development of organisational, financial and legal conditions favourable
for the conduct of business activity create an opportunity of fast improvement of the situation.

**62. The** **industry remains a key factor contributing to the creation of pros-**
perity and consolidation of Poland’s position in the European and international arena. It will be a challenge to maintain a strong national industrial
base. In the conditions of modern economy, the share of the service sector in
GDP creation increases. A competitive, modern and environmentally-friendly
economy will make it possible to reduce prices and costs, as well as to create
new and better goods and services.

**63. Decapitalisation of the national wealth, in particular of industrial,**
energy, transport and housing infrastructure, may cause increased threat of
technical disasters. Particular attention should be paid to its elements classified as critical infrastructure.

## Chapter III

 CONCEPT OF STRATEGIC ACTIONS. OPERATIONAL STRATEGY

**64. National interests and strategic objectives of Poland, together with the**
diagnosis of the national security environment, determine priorities of the
security and defence policy. They indicate a need for sustainable internationalisation and autonomy, as far as the security of Poland is concerned, including an increase in the strategic resilience of the country to various threats.

**65. The main orientation for strategic actions in this field is defined by three**
priorities of the security policy, i.e.

- **ensuring readiness and demonstrating determination to act in **
**the field of security and defence, as well as strengthening national**
defence capabilities, with particular treatment of those areas of national
security in the case of which Allied (common) actions may be hindered
(consensus-challenging situations);

- **supporting processes aimed to reinforce NATO’s ability to pro-**
**vide collective defence, developing the EU Common Security and**
**Defence Policy, strengthening strategic partnerships (also with the**
US) and strategic relations with partners in the region;

- **supporting and selectively participating in actions of the interna-**
**tional community, conducted under rules of international law, aimed**
at preventing the occurrence of new sources of threats, responding to
crises and counteracting their spread.


-----

**66. Within the framework of the first priority, Poland concentrates its stra-**
tegic efforts principally on ensuring security of its own citizens and territory, on supporting the defence of allied states in accordance with applicable
international agreements and, afterwards, on participating in responses to
threats occurring outside the allied territory. The basic condition creates social acceptance and political consensus with regard to **the** **priority treat-**
**ment of national security matters in state policy. The determination,**
ability and readiness to act, based on a broad political consensus, increase
Poland’s strength in international relations, which is necessary both in order
to attract allies and partners and to deter potential opponents. The foregoing
also makes it possible to respond in an effective manner to pressure or political and military blackmail. Important instruments guaranteeing social and
political agreement concerning security issues are as follows: civic education,
social dialogue, parliamentary cooperation, as well as the National Security
Council.

**67. Within the framework of the second priority, Poland will focus on meas-**
ures supposed to consolidate NATO’s defensive function, including strategic strengthening of the eastern flank of the Alliance. They are aimed to develop practical mechanisms of collective defence and, in particular, to form
military capabilities adequate to threats. From the perspective of Poland’s security, the development and political cohesion of the European Union are also
very important. Actions undertaken by Poland will be oriented towards the
**enhancement of EU integration processes in the domain of security, in**
order for the Union to have adequate security capacities at its disposal, including defence ones. An improvement in the strategic cooperation between
**NATO and the EU – reinforcement of political cohesion and increase in the**
efficiency of actions – would be beneficial for Poland. Among strategic partnerships of Poland, the priority significance is attributed to the cooperation
with the United States of America. Poland will strive for the possibly broadest
military presence of the US in Europe, including Poland, and it will support
activities for the preservation of the US security guarantee for Europe. Furthermore, it will actively encourage consolidation of subjectivity of **Eastern**
**European countries, especially those covered by the EU Eastern Partnership**
initiative. Relations with Poland’s neighbours will be developed with the use of


-----

various forms of cooperation. As far as relationships with the Russian Federation are concerned, it will be necessary to solve difficult matters in conformity
with rules of international law. The starting point for the formation of relations
between NATO and Russia should be: analysis of security interests of the Alliance, observance of rules of international law, as well as principles of pragmatism and reciprocity. Furthermore, regional cooperation within the framework
of the Visegrad Group will be developed. It will be necessary to intensify relations with countries of improving international position.

**68. Implementation of the third priority requires measures aimed at the re-**
inforcement of the UN, continuation of efforts for rules of international law
to be revised, and strengthening of the effectiveness of regimes and regulations in the area of arms control and disarmament, including security and
confidence-building measures. In regional dimension, there is a need to reconstruct the importance of the OSCE, although the process requires constructive approach of all Member States. An important form of participation
in actions of the international community are operations abroad. Military
actions should be strengthened by civil involvement, including development
assistance.

**69. According to the adopted priorities, Poland organises and conducts the**
following types of strategic actions in the area of security: defensive actions,
protective actions and actions in the domain of social and economic security.

#### 3.1. Defensive actions

**70. The substance of defensive actions is a continuous maintenance of readi-**
ness to effectively respond to threats to the independence and territorial
integrity of the Republic of Poland. Complementary actions include active
seizing of opportunities and anticipatory reduction of risks in the field of
security by, inter alia, the participation in international efforts aimed to the
reduction of sources of threats, including international security operations. It
is achieved by means of: diplomatic efforts for security, military actions, intelligence and counterintelligence in the domain of defence, as well as functioning of the scientific and industrial defence capabilities.


-----

**71. Diplomatic actions serve to ensure favourable international conditions,**
guaranteeing to the fullest possible extent the fulfilment of broadly understood interests of the Republic of Poland. A constant direction of the activity
of Polish diplomacy in the domain of security are measures aimed at reinforcing the reliability and effectiveness of the collective defence and the deterrence posture of the North Atlantic Alliance, at providing support to improve
the EU CSDP in political and strategic, institutional and operational terms,
as well as at ameliorating strategic cooperation between NATO and the EU.
An equally important task of the diplomacy is to form an effective bilateral
and multilateral collaboration, including: further strengthening of regional
formats which include Poland – mainly the Weimar Triangle and the Visegrad
Group; development of the potential for cooperation with, inter alia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and the Nordic countries, and Romania; expanding the
spectrum of bilateral cooperation with the United States of America, while
intensifying political and military cooperation; supporting reforms in Eastern
European countries, in particular within the framework of the EU Eastern
Partnership; shaping relations with Russia on a basis of reciprocity, transparency and respect for sovereignty of neighbouring countries; expanding
partnership relations with emerging powers, including dialogue with regard
to security matters.

**72. An important area of interest is the conventional arms control system**
and the confidence-building measures in Europe. Actions aimed at breaking
the deadlock related to the CFE Treaty, its reinforcement, modernisation and
development will be continued. It is necessary to maintain and strengthen
the active position of Poland in the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction regime. It refers also to the reduction of the risk of development of
new proliferation domains (e.g. by means of the Proliferation Security Initiative, PSI).

**73. Actions in the military domain are focused on maintaining and dem-**
onstrating comprehensive readiness of the state to effectively respond to
military threats to the independence and territorial integrity of Poland. Tasks
in this field are conducted, above all, by the Armed Forces of the Republic of
Poland, which are ready to execute three types of missions: defend the state


-----

and oppose to military aggression; support protective subsystems as far as internal security and provision of help to the society are concerned; participate
in the process of stabilisation of the international situation, including international measures related to crisis management. The mission of defending
the state includes the military deterrence through demonstrating the readiness to use forces maintained in the peacetime and readiness to its mobilisation and deployment in case of war.

**74. The main tasks of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland, which**
determine the direction of planning and training activities in time of peace,
are aimed to ensure the state’s capacity to: defend and counter aggression;
maintain readiness to perform tasks related to the defence and protection
of the inviolability of borders; conduct a strategic defence operation in the
territory of the Republic of Poland; participate in antiterrorist actions in the
country and beyond its borders; participation in a defence operation abroad,
in conformity with allied obligations under Article 5 of the North Atlantic
Treaty; conduct reconnaissance and intelligence activities. In the case of a defence operation in the territory of the state, specific tasks must be determined
for units and subunits of Special Forces and the formations of the National
Reserve Forces.

**75. In order to fulfil the mission related to the provision of support to pro-**
tection subsystems in the field of internal security and of assistance to the
society, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland maintain their capability to execute tasks consisting in: monitoring and protection of airspace and
supporting the protection of national borders on land and sea; conducting
reconnaissance and intelligence activities; monitoring of radioactive, chemical and biological contamination in the territory of the country; clearing the
area from explosives and dangerous military objects; conducting search and
rescue operations; assisting government authorities, public administration
and society in responding to threats (crisis situations) and in eliminating
their consequences. In the case of the latter, particular role should be played
by formations of the National Reserve Forces, assigned, if necessary, at the
disposal of voivodes.


-----

**76. Taking part in actions aimed to stabilise the international situation, as**
well as in international crisis management missions and operations, requires
the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland to maintain adequate force levels
and resources supporting the participation in various types of crisis management (peace-keeping, crisis response, humanitarian aid) missions and operations conducted by NATO, the EU, the UN, and other operations under international agreements and military cooperation in the field of the development
and use of confidence-building and security-building measures.

**77. The cyberspace has become another area of armed struggle. The Armed**
Forces of the Republic of Poland must have defensive and offensive capabilities in this domain in order to perform the function of deterrence to potential
opponents. In particular, they must be ready to conduct – independently and
in cooperation with Allies – protection and defence operations on a larger
scale in the case of a cyber conflict or cyber war.

**78. Actions of secret** **services in the field of defence. The basic mission**
of intelligence in the field of defence is to obtain, collect, analyse, process and
transfer information regarding the existing and potential threats to the Republic of Poland, its interests and citizens to authorities of the state responsible for the national security. Intelligence activities include also: identification
and monitoring of opportunities and risks for the national security; support
for the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland participating in operations
outside the state; monitoring of the international trafficking in arms, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery; observation of activities related to the energy policy and raw materials policy;
increasing capacities by collaborating with Allies and coalition partners. The
tasks of counterintelligence in the field of defence consist in preventing: espionage, attacks on military units and defence facilities or devices, corruption
in the area of national defence, as well as violations of protection of classified
information, including the broadly understood information security. Another
significant task in this field consists in ensuring the security of research and
development ordered by the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland and
other units of the Ministry of National Defence, as well as the protection of
production and trade in military goods, technologies and services.


-----

**79.** **Defence production. The Polish industrial defence capacities – an im-**
portant element of the economic sphere of security – shall be engaged to the
maximum extent in the process of technical modernisation of the Armed
Forces of the Republic of Poland and, in particular, in priority modernisation
programmes implemented by the Ministry of National Defence. These actions
should be complemented with mechanisms supporting the development of
entities from the defence sector, including small and medium enterprises,
and by a strive to equalise differences in the development of defence production and capacities on a European scale, which would allow to increase the
competitiveness of the Polish industrial defence capabilities.

#### 3.2. Protective actions

**80. The substance of protective actions is to ensure conditions allowing to**
maintain constitutional order, integral stability of the state, public security
and public order, both common and individual tangible and intangible resources, as well as the functioning of the critical infrastructure. Complementary actions should include participation in the promotion, in the international arena and in the Polish society, of rules and consciousness in terms of
proper enjoyment of human and citizen’s rights and freedoms.

**81. The primary objective of the** **judiciary is to eliminate sources of threats**
to the liberty of exercise of rights and freedoms, as well as consistent prosecution and punishment of perpetrators of their violations. As far as this aspect is concerned, the state should ensure that courts and public prosecutor’s
offices function efficiently, proceedings are conducted and cases are resolved
in a timely manner, and decisions are enforced effectively. Within the framework of ensuring the security of citizens, it is also important to guarantee the
security of trade by means of simplifying legal procedures and making them
more flexible. Constitutional guarantees of protection of rights and freedoms
will be fully implemented when judicial institutions will become widely accessible, rapid in action, and citizen-friendly.

**82.** **Counterintelligence protection** is focused on the safeguard of the
constitutional order and democratic system against violations of the stability


-----

of the state and on operational recognition of threats to the security of Poland resulting from the activities of foreign secret services. The main tasks of
counterintelligence in this domain include: effective recognition of potential
and real threats and their prevention by means of available operational and
procedural methods; ongoing monitoring and analysis of identified threats
to the security of the state; conduct of preventive actions, in particular in the
area of protection of classified information; coordination of actions and cooperation with other components of the national security system of the Republic of Poland, as well as with foreign and international entities, in conformity
with allied obligations.

**83. Preventing and combating terrorism and extremism. The global**
reach and scale of the phenomenon of terrorism constitute a serious challenge for most international and national authorities. The most important
tasks related to preventing and combating terrorism and extremism include:
recognition and monitoring of terrorist threats to Poland and its citizens at
home and abroad, detection and neutralisation of terrorist threats, including physical combat against terrorism; elimination of sources of financing of
terrorism; criminal prosecution of authors of terrorist threats, in conformity
with the national law and rules of international law which bind Poland; recognition of sources of terrorism and symptoms of radicalisation of behaviour,
as well as preventing them; international bilateral and multilateral cooperation at the political, operational, analytical, legal and criminal level in the
area of combating terrorism; preventing acts of terrorism; development of
public-private partnerships, media policy and provision of information about
potential threats to the society, social education. Improvement of legal base
and incorporation of international documents into the national law is an important element of actions.

**84. Ensuring the security of Poland in the cyberspace, including the se-**
curity of the cyberspace of the Republic of Poland, constitutes one of the basic
tasks related to the security of the state. It should be executed both by means
of developing the ability to conduct defensive (comprising the protection of
entities operating in the cyberspace and the cyberspace itself) and offensive
activities. Particular importance is attributed to: cooperation and coordina

-----

tion of protective actions with entities from the private sector – in particular
the finance, energy, transport, telecommunications and health care sectors;
conduct of preventive and prophylactic activities with regard to threats in the
cyberspace; elaboration and use of appropriate procedures for social communication in this field; recognition of offenses committed in cyberspace, their
prevention and prosecution of their perpetrators; conduct of information
struggle in the cyberspace; Allied cooperation, also at the level of operational
activities aimed to actively combat cyber offences, including the exchange of
experience and good practice in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of domestic measures.

**85. Information security, including the** **protection of classified informa-**
**tion, is one of the most important areas of functioning of the national secu-**
rity system. Strategic tasks in this field include: ensuring information security of the state by means of preventing the unauthorised access to classified
information and their disclosure; ensuring personal, technical and physical
security of classified information; accrediting ICT systems used to process the
information; ensuring the performance of the function of the national security authority in order to allow for the international exchange of classified
information.

**86. It is extremely important to ensure conditions for** **the** **protection of**
**critical infrastructure. The infrastructure comprises key systems and ele-**
ments guaranteeing security of the state and its citizens, as well as efficient
functioning of public administration bodies, institutions and entrepreneurs.
The protection of critical infrastructure constitutes an obligation of operators
and owners supported by public administration capacities. In Poland, an innovative approach is being implemented in this regard. It is founded on the
principles of shared responsibility of interested parties, extensive cooperation
and mutual trust. Activities of the state consist in potential initiation of the
crisis management system, in case of disruption of functioning of the critical
infrastructure, as well as in increasing the awareness, knowledge and skills
and in promoting cooperation in this field.


-----

**87. In order to maintain public security and order at the right level, it**
is crucial to effectively prevent their violations and to detect offences and
misdemeanours detrimental to the life, health and property of citizens, as
well as to the interests of the state. Tasks executed in this field concern various prohibited acts, including both common crime and organised crime of
economic, drug-related and criminal nature. The discussed actions will focus
on increasing the effectiveness of prevention and detection of offences and
misdemeanours, inevitability of punishment for their perpetrators, recovery
of lost property and minimisation of losses of the state budget. A significant
role will be played also by the coordination of measures and collaboration
with other entities of the national security system, including competent public administration bodies and internal security services, as well as foreign and
international partners. The most important service executing tasks related to
this domain is the Police, which is competent to protect life, health and property against unlawful attacks that violate these goods.

**88. Ensuring public security (rescue and civil protection). The basic**
protective task consists in actions aimed at saving life, health, property and
the environment from natural or man-made disasters and other local dangers. The leading role in this domain is played by the Emergency Medical
Services and the State Fire Service which, as the main element of the National Firefighting and Rescue System, recognises threats, prepares and conducts
rescue operations (also in crisis situations, such as traffic, construction, or
chemical disasters and accidents, and radiological emergencies). Important
support in this regard is provided by means of cooperation with all rescue
services and entities, comprising also entities which are not classified within
the public finance sector (including non-governmental organisations, such
as voluntary firefighting units, and mountain and water voluntary rescue
services) but are authorised by law to undertake rescue activities in Poland.

**89. Protection of the state border. Essential activities aimed to ensure**
the inviolability and security of the borders are conducted by Border Guard,
Customs Service, Office for Foreigners and Armed Forces of the Republic of
Poland. Tasks executed by these services and bodies include: protection of the
territory of the Republic of Poland against illegal flow of goods and people, as


-----

well as against the entry of hazardous substances and materials; organisation
and conduct of border traffic control in a manner ensuring smooth flow of
border traffic, prevention of cross-border crime and crime involving foreigners; protection of the EU customs territory, including the legality of imports
and exports of goods; maintenance of border crossing points; regulation and
control of legality of foreigners’ stay in the territory of the country and of
their employment; protection of the Polish airspace; conduct of rescue operations on the maritime part of the state border.

**90. Activities related to the** **protection of the most important authori-**
**ties and public administration are conducted by the Government Protec-**
tion Bureau (GPB), both in the territory of the state and abroad. The main
tasks of the GPB include the protection of persons and objects which are important for the state’s interest, as well as of delegations of other states staying in Poland, Polish diplomatic missions, consular offices and delegations
to international organisations. It is a priority to ensure maximum protection
of Polish diplomatic posts and missions in places of high social tensions or
regions with a high threat of terrorism.

**91. Principal tasks in the domain of crisis management include: prepara-**
tion of public administration to act in crisis situations, prevention of the occurrence of the latter, as well as efficient exchange of information, decision
making and coordination of actions, effective use of forces and resources of
the state (also at the stage of response and reconstruction), cooperation with
crisis management structures of NATO and the EU, bilateral and international collaboration, in particular with countries from the region.

**92. Effective management of the development of the country and protection**
of citizens’ rights require preventing and combating corruption and cor**ruption-generating phenomena. Strategic tasks related to this domain**
consist in combating corruption in public and economic life, in particular
in state and self government institutions; effective detection of corruption
offences and persecution of their perpetrators; implementation of efficient
mechanisms for fighting against corruption in public administration; fulfilment of objectives of government anti-corruption programmes; increasing


-----

public awareness and promoting ethical practices; fulfilment of Poland’s
international obligations regarding the prevention of corruption and anticorruption education.

**93. Protection of human health covers recognising and preventing the oc-**
currence of health security risks, including those related to the development
of contemporary civilisation, as well as saving lives and health of the population. The primary responsibility of a range of bodies and inspections, as well
as health care entities, involved in the process of provision of medical services
is to ensure an appropriate level of health care services.

#### 3.3. Social actions in the domain of security

**94. The substance of social actions in the domain of security is the creation of**
safe conditions allowing citizens to live a decent life, as well as for a spiritual
and material development of the nation. Key actions include the protection
of the national heritage, comprising a guarantee of the possibility of its safe
development, in particular in the economic, social and intellectual sphere,
and provision of non-material support for the national security system.

**95. Protection and strengthening of the national identity. An impor-**
tant task of the state is to preserve the national identity by cultivating national culture as well as historical and generational continuity. It is necessary
not only to protect cultural heritage and national identity, but also to draw
out the potential for growth and development of a modern state that lies in
them. Therefore, actions in this field will focus on ensuring common and
equal access to culture, activating social capital and, within its framework,
on consolidating patriotic attitudes as well as active and aware citizenship.
The foregoing will be achieved by means of protection of the national heritage itself and its digitalisation, open access to its resources, development of
civic and cultural education within the general curriculum, and support for
the capacities of associations and non-governmental organisations engaged
in this domain.


-----

**96. Education for security** comprises activities thanks to which citizens
gain knowledge and skills related to security. It is provided within the framework of general and higher education, by central and local state institutions,
as well as associations and non-governmental institutions. It is of priority
importance to increase social awareness in terms of the understanding of
threats to the security and to shape competences allowing to respond to such
threats in a deliberate and rational manner. It is also important to increase
the efficiency of public administration, as far as its activities related to security are concerned, by means of continuous upskilling and improvement of
capacities to effectively respond to threats.

**97. Media for security. A strategic task in this sector of security is to strength-**
en cooperation of administration and services with media in order to develop
and increase social awareness with regard to appropriate manner of responding to occurring threats. Moreover, emphasis should be put on the conduct of
educational activities aimed at the promotion of knowledge concerning appropriate identification of threats and effective responses to such situations.

**98.** **Prevention of threats to the demographic security. Demography con-**
stitutes an important component of national security, as it influences all aspects
of its capacities. The strategic tasks in this area consists in inhibiting current and
predicted unfavourable demographic changes in Poland. It is important to create
conditions favouring an increase in the number of births and to support families
with dependent children. It will be possible thanks to an ably conducted family,
labour market and housing policies. Actions aimed at the protection of the elderly and appropriate migration policy will also be of key importance.

**99. Ensuring social security requires a range of activities the objective of**
which is to improve social integration and provide access to public services
of appropriate quality. The priority of Polish social policy is to reduce poverty and social exclusion through the activation, in particular in the labour
market, of people who are excluded and at risk of poverty. Actions aimed to
prevent social stratification and exclusion will use, _inter alia, good practice_
resulting from the cooperation between welfare institutions and labour market, as well as health care institutions.


-----

#### 3.4. Economic actions in the domain of security

**100. The substance of economic actions in the domain of security consists**
in protecting entities and material resources of the economic potential of the
national security system against threats in time of peace, crisis and war, as
well as supporting the functioning of operational subsystems of the national
security system.

**101.** **Strengthening financial security. In the upcoming years, the most**
important task in the domain of financial security will be to reinforce the
macroeconomic stability by means of establishing sound state finances, increasing the savings and investment rate, and by developing exports of goods
and services. It is also important to strengthen financial oversight of all institutions providing banking services.

**102.** **Increasing energy security. The strategic task in the domain of en-**
ergy security is to start extracting energy resources from domestic unconventional deposits, to develop network and generation infrastructure on
the basis of coal, nuclear and gas fuels, and to ensure diversified access to
sources and routes of raw material supply. It is crucial to liberalise energy
markets and create conditions for the implementation of investments in
the energy sector. An important element of the state policy will be to ensure stability of supplies and to integrate energy systems with EU Member
States.

**103.** **Maintenance of strategic reserves. An efficient and rational system**
of strategic reserves supports the execution of tasks in the area of security
and defence of the state, reconstruction of critical infrastructure, mitigation
of disruptions in the continuity of supplies necessary for the functioning of
the economy and meeting basic needs of the citizens, saving their lives and
health, as well as of fulfilment of Poland’s international obligations. The most
important objective in this field is the elaboration and adoption by the Council of Ministers of the Government Programme of Strategic Reserves and providing
the latter with such funding which will make it possible to conduct planned
activities. It is equally important to ensure efficient functioning of the system


-----

of intervention stocks of crude oil and fuels, securing Poland’s supply in crisis
situations, as well as its optimisation in terms of stock management and cost
effectiveness.

**104.** **Strengthening food security. It is indispensable to implement such**
an agricultural policy which will decrease the vulnerability of agricultural
production to unfavourable phenomena and the maintenance of control over
those sectors of food economy that are important from the perspective of the
security of the state, and which will guarantee an appropriate level of food
self-sufficiency.

**105.** **Environmental protection. Actions increasing environmental securi-**
ty focus on the improvement of the environment, preservation of biodiversity
and adaptation to climate changes, in particular by recognising the necessity
to ensure an appropriate level of investment in low-emission sources into
consideration. Within the framework of environmental protection, actions
aimed to improve the quality of air, water, soil and appropriate waste management will be continued. Adaptation to changing climatic and hydrological conditions requires the implementation of new systemic solutions aimed,
_inter alia, to minimise consequences of natural disasters and extreme weather_
conditions. In this context, particular importance is attributed to the introduction of flood protection measures and improvement of the crisis management system. Furthermore, it is important to conduct education campaigns
and campaigns promoting environmental protection, preservation of biodiversity and adaptation to climate changes. Water management must become
a priority for the entire national economy.

**106.** **Ensuring security of key spatial structures of the national econ-**
**omy. A priority of the Polish national spatial development policy is to limit**
the excessive, chaotic spread of cities called suburbanisation. It is desired to
construct socio-economic subsystems with open structures, high self-sufficiency and complementarity. It is important to create conditions for an effective conduct of defensive activities and to take into account the country’s
defence needs (including the location of military facilities) in spatial development plans and while making decisions concerning spatial development.


-----

**107.** **Research and development for security and defence. Orienta-**
tions of strategic significance for the state are specified in the _National Re-_
_search Programme. They refer to those areas of state activity which are crucial_
for progress of civilisation, as well as for social and economic development,
and which constitute an important element of the construction of the state’s
defence capabilities. The fundamental objective of research and development
should be the possibility to use the obtained results in practice, in particular for the purposes of development of operational capabilities of the Armed
Forces of the Republic of Poland, as well as of services and institutions responsible for the security of the state and of citizens. It is necessary to strive
for a closer cooperation and a stronger link between the final customer and
the industry, together with the research and development sector, in particular
as far as common funding and commercialisation of dual-use technology research results are concerned. It will be important to increase the involvement
of Polish centres in interdisciplinary projects and international programmes,
which will allow to gain new knowledge and experience, as well as to reinforce the potential and competitiveness of Polish entities.

## Chapter IV

 CONCEPT OF STRATEGIC PREPARATIONS. PREPAREDNESS STRATEGY

**108. Due to the variety of challenges and the unpredictability of threats,**
the national security system should be capable of providing a comprehensive
response to the occurring issues: from local problems with limited consequences to those concerning the entire state. It should be transformed in
such a way to monitor and forecast potential threats, respond to them in
a fast and adequate manner, and develop the capabilities to eliminate consequences of crisis situations.

**109. The basic objective of the concept of preparatory actions is to appro-**
priately combine within the national security system its military and nonmilitary, internal and external components. These actions will concentrate on
the fulfilment of three preparedness priorities: appropriate integration of the
national security management subsystem; professionalisation of operational
(defence and protection) subsystems; comprehensive preparation of support
(social and economic) subsystems. Key tasks are related to the establishment
of legal and organisational basis of the integrated national security system,
as well as with the implementation of political and strategic rules and procedures for national security management which would be uniform under all
conditions of security of the state.

#### 4.1. National security management subsystem

**110. Actions aimed to integrate the national security management comprise**
necessary changes at the institutional, infrastructural, procedural and legislative level.


-----

**111.** **Institutional changes. It is necessary to institutionally strengthen**
the Council of Ministers in the field on national security management by appointing an auxiliary body, the mission of which would be, in the first place,
to improve the coordination and supervision of secret services. In the future,
it will be possible to consider the extension of the body’s scope of competence
with other areas of the national security or the appointment of another subsidiary body of the Council of Ministers.

**112.** **Infrastructural changes. There is an urgent need to improve the in-**
frastructure used for the purposes of the national security management, both
as far as the modernisation of special facilities and the use of modern technical equipment with a high level of information and communication security
are concerned. Moreover, the usage of warning and alerting ICT systems requires to be better arranged. The priority task is to introduce, for the purposes
of the highest authorities of the state, of special air transport means ensuring
the continuity of the functioning, resilience and strategic mobility of the national security management system.

**113.** **Procedural changes. It is necessary to improve planning, organisa-**
tion, coordination and supervision procedures in the field of security, ensuring the conformity of national security management with the national
development management system. It results from the indivisibility and interdependence of the development and security, as well as from the need for
a comprehensive and integrated approach to the security. It will also be important to ensure that crisis management is in line with the defence response
by means of defining common areas provided for in crisis management plans
and operational plans of all levels. Efforts should be made to introduce one
planning document covering all defence, crisis management and civil protection matters at all levels of public administration.

**114.** **Changes in the legislation. The implementation of new solutions**
integrating the national security management may require changes in the
legislation which would precisely determine the role of authorities and state
institutions in the national security system, means they have at their disposal
and rules for the coordination of activities.


-----

#### 4.2. Defence subsystem

**115. The aim of preparation of the defence subsystem is to maintain and**
qualitatively transform the national security capacity in the field of defence,
considering the crucial need to have capabilities necessary to ensure direct
security of the nation and citizens, as well as of the territory and structures of
the state. The preparation of defence capabilities comprises the development
of the diplomatic service, Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland, secret services operating in the domain of defence, and capacities of the defence industry. It is part of the strengthening of NATO’s defence capabilities and the
development of such capabilities of the European Union. Defence planning
links the defence subsystem with other subsystems.

**116.** **Diplomatic service. The priority of the transformation of Polish dip-**
lomatic service is to continue its modernisation. It will include optimisation
of the network of Polish diplomatic posts and implementation of investment
projects aimed to improve their image and standards of their functioning.
A reform of training and upskilling of staff will be introduced and modern
management techniques will be popularised in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and in diplomatic missions. Furthermore, computerisation and development of the ICT infrastructure of the foreign service will be continued.

**117.** **Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland. The most urgent pre-**
paredness tasks in the field of national defence include the continuation of
the development of operational capabilities of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland, having regard to the interoperability level required within
the framework of NATO. The basis for this development is the obtainment
of modern military equipment, as well as maintenance and development
of a system for its protection. It is a priority to create a new, in terms of
quality, national air defence system, including missile defence. It is also
necessary to further develop information systems, so that the Armed Forces
of the Republic of Poland gain the ability to conduct imagery intelligence
and network-centric capabilities. Computerisation of combat and support
systems, together with an increase in the mobility of Land Forces, should
strengthen the key – from the perspective of state defence – capabilities re

-----

lated to actions aimed to prevent surprise attacks. The development of the
Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland ability to recognise and precisely
engage selected objects, as well as to prevent a wide range of asymmetric
threats, will be one of the elements of effective deterrence. The development of operational capabilities of the Armed Forces of the Republic of
Poland must be accompanied with an improvement of the level of training
and skills related to the professional use of advanced military technology,
including IT equipment. It will be necessary to increase the Armed Forces
of the Republic of Poland ability to act in the cyberspace, as well as to create
mechanisms for cyber defence and strengthen related units. Furthermore,
it is important to develop national capabilities in the field of cryptology and
in the domain of production of national cryptographic solutions in order
to ensure an appropriate level of security of ICT systems. The acquisition
of competences related to cryptology by the Armed Forces of the Republic
of Poland should result from a uniform cryptographic policy. It constitutes
a critical factor in ensuring ICT security.

**118. It is important to conclude the reform of the command and control**
system of the armed forces, consolidating the operation of joint command
structures with regard to the basic functions: planning, general command
and operational command.

**119. It is required to reform the functioning of the National Reserve Forces,**
which should become uniformed formations strengthening and reinforcing
operational capabilities both for the purpose of local response to crisis situations, as well as in their use in defending the country. The change should be
linked with a broader reform of the preparation of mobilisation reserves and
the development of a general territorial security system.

**120. Changes in the military education system should aim at its consolidation**
and may be focused on the improvement in the effectiveness of training and
conduct of research for the purposes of security and defence of the state, better
expenditure of public funds, as well as incorporation of the domain of education and vocational training of privates and non-commissioned officers into the
national education system based on the Polish Qualifications Framework. It is


-----

important to improve the military medical care system focused on the reconstruction of medical corps and modernisation of the field medical technology.

**121.** **Secret services. As far as the development of secret services is con-**
cerned, the quality of staff and implementation of the latest computerised
technical intelligence and counterintelligence systems should be treated as
the priority. The military secret services should be integrated more closely
with the Ministry of National Defence.

**122.** **Capacities of the defence industry. It is necessary to enhance the**
competitiveness and innovativeness of the national defence industry and related research and development sector. The government should create legal
conditions, investment incentives and institutional and coordination mechanisms favouring the development of industrial defence capacities, including
an increase in their innovativeness. In turn, defence industry entities must
better recognise the needs of main users of military equipment, diversify and
make their market offer referring to modern products more attractive, search
for possibilities of rationalisation of their product range and production costs,
as well as develop cooperation with foreign partners. Actions of both parties
must be oriented towards the obtainment of high quality production, in accordance with expectations of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland,
and towards the achievement of such a level of competitiveness which would
allow for a partnership cooperation with European companies and global defence industry.

**123. The development of the national defence industry must be balanced**
with Poland’s international obligations, including those related to the development of the European defence market. Poland will support the competitiveness, transparency and effectiveness of the European defence technological and industrial base, while protecting at the same time its own basic security interest and benefiting from all available legal and political instruments.
Premises indicating the need to protect the said interest include the need to
ensure the continuity of the state’s actions in conditions of a sudden or real
threat to its security, information security, as well as military equipment supply security and guarantee of the possibility of its operational use.

#### 4.3. Protection subsystems

**124. The aim of the preparation of protection subsystems is the organisa-**
tional, technical and training development of services, guards and all institutions responsible for civil protection, public order and crisis management
– adjusted to the operational strategy – as well as ensuring the freedom to
exercise civil rights and liberties.

**125.** **The judiciary. The most important preparedness tasks include a com-**
prehensive reform of the functioning of the judiciary. Its aim is to increase the
efficiency, quality and effectiveness of the functioning of common courts. The
acceleration of court proceedings, increase in their transparency and improvement of information exchange are enhanced by the continuation of computerisation and digitalisation of the judiciary. Furthermore, it is necessary
to introduce changes to the functioning of professions and legal education
models, as well as to ensure better access to legal information and services.
As for the penitentiary system, it is necessary to maximally use opportunities
offered by probation measures, including the extension of the possibility to
use the electronic monitoring system.

**126.** **Secret services. Preparedness tasks related to secret services will focus**
on the improvement of their organisation, equipment and training. It is necessary to correct the system of supervision over the services and to increase
their ability to prepare an integrated information product. It is also necessary
to aim to establish standards related to operational and intelligence activities
conducted by particular secret services and – due to an increasing transsectoral
character of threats – to develop platforms for cooperation of services and other
institutions preventing threats of particular importance for the state security.

**127.** **Institutions for preventing and combating terrorism and ex-**
**tremism. It is necessary to continue to strengthen the coordination of ac-**
tions undertaken by state institutions participating in the antiterrorist state
protection system. The preparation of government’s strategic document (antiterrorist programme), covering important aspects of antiterrorist policy, will
constitute an opportunity to increase their coherence and effectiveness.


-----

**128.** **Institutions responsible for cybersecurity. The most important**
preparedness tasks in the field of cybersecurity include the implementation
and development of the systemic approach to the sphere of cybersecurity at
the legal, organisational and technical level. It is necessary to determine the
rules for conducting active defence and to develop national cyber defence,
including the improvement of the National Cyber Incident Response System
of the Republic of Poland, compatible with systems of allied states. It is important to establish a national coordination centre which would support the
organisation of cooperation between particular entities executing tasks in the
domain of cybersecurity and exchange of information, and which would promote good practice in the domain of cybersecurity. It is important to acquire
full competences allowing to recognise, prevent and combat cyber threats
and capabilities to produce Polish technological solutions intended to ensure
appropriate level of security in the cyberspace. Furthermore, appropriate conditions for the establishment and functioning of the public-private partnership in the domain of cybersecurity will be ensured.

**129.** The process of strengthening of the resilience of the Republic of Poland’s
ICT system should begin with the creation of security areas of selected ICT
systems that are important for the security of the state, and of appropriately
secured means of communication between them. Afterwards, a uniform ICT
platform will be built. It will allow for safe processing and exchange of data
between public administration units.

**130. It is also important to increase users’ awareness of threats in the cy-**
berspace by means of intensification of educational activities at all levels of
education, also in the form of training courses and social campaigns. It is
recommended to introduce specialised studies related to the cybersecurity
and to develop research programmes dedicated to this domain.

**131.** **Institutions protecting classified information. The key prepared-**
ness task in this area consists in ensuring fixed and wireless classified government communications. Another important task is to continuously adjust
legal, procedural, physical and technical solutions to the occurring threats to
the storage, processing and exchange of classified information. In this con

-----

text, it is necessary to enhance cooperation within the framework of NATO
and of the EU. The development and implementation of national solutions in
the field of cryptography are fundamental for the protection of ICT systems.

**132.** **Institutions protecting the critical infrastructure. Protection of**
the crucial infrastructure of the state requires provisions to be put in order
to create one category of critical infrastructure objects. It will involve the
need to introduce changes both to regulations regarding objects under obligatory protection and objects under special protection. Coherent regulations
will guarantee an increase in the resilience of all elements of the critical infrastructure. The achievement of the foregoing should be the responsibility
of legally established body for the protection of the critical infrastructure.
A new law should also develop a system of incentives encouraging the owners of the critical infrastructure to invest in security.

**133.** **Public order services. Effective prevention of public order violations**
requires an enhanced coordination of various aspects of the functioning of
the protection subsystem, as well as further modernisation of services and
formations responsible for this area of the functioning of the state. As far as
the fight against organised crime is concerned, it is necessary to improve the
institutionalised exchange of information between all services and institutions engaged in combating this form of crime. It is important to constantly
increase road traffic safety. Furthermore, it is indispensable to improve the
security of mass events and to make further efforts related to the prevention
of economic and drug-related crime as well as human trafficking. In order to
ensure effective operation, it is necessary to integrate communications systems of services, as well as to develop a nation-wide digital radio communications system.

**134.** **Public security services (rescue and civil protection). A condition**
for an effective preparation of the state to implement rescue operations in
order to protect lives, health, property and environment and to provide humanitarian aid (understood as actions aimed to ensure conditions necessary
for the survival, undertaken at the stage of response of rescue services and
organisations) is the optimal use of the existing resources, in particular of


-----

the National Firefighting and Rescue System, Emergency Medical Services
(EMS), Emergency Notification System and of capacities of associations (voluntary firefighting units) and other non-governmental organisations (social
rescue organizations), as well as provision of efficient mechanisms for their
improvement and cooperation. An important task is and will be to develop
standards in a given field of rescue, taking into consideration the areas of
cooperation between particular rescue services and entities, as well as specific
requirements of organisation of the EMS system, units of which provide services to persons in health emergency situations. The domain of civil defence,
which is connected with civil protection, requires a comprehensive transformation and an adjustment to the contemporary socio-economic situation,
including international obligations. An urgent task is further development of
the Emergency Notification System and of systems of services directly performing rescue operations. An improvement in the cooperation between the
foregoing entities requires also that they be provided with an integrated radio
communications system.

**135. As for health care, perfecting of structures related to emergency medi-**
cal service, basic health care and specialist therapeutic base must be continued. It is also important to improve organisational and planning, procedural
and material preparations to the functioning in the event of threat and in
time of war.

**136.** **Border services. Due to the increasing significance of the cross-border**
dimension of security, the integrated management system for EU/Schengen
external borders will be improved. In order for the state to become more
effective in combating illegal migration, competences of participants of the
system, in particular those resulting from the expansion of functions and responsibilities of Border Guard and transformation of the latter into a border
and migration formation, must be changed.

**137.** **Services protecting the most important authorities and public**
**administration bodies. Security of the most important state authorities**
requires efficient protection services and modern transport means. Rules and
procedures regarding transport and movement of persons holding the most


-----

important public positions must be clarified, in particular in the case of regulations concerning HEAD status flights. Furthermore, it is necessary to determine an entity which will coordinate VIP air transport safety.

**138.** **Other protection subsystems. An increasing participation of the**
private sector in ensuring security as well as capacities of private protection
institutions creates an opportunity to strengthen the security of citizens and
rationalise state expenditure. An indispensible condition for further development of the private sector of persons and property protection services is the
improvement of supervision and control over its functioning. It is also necessary to determine its role and to elaborate rules for cooperation within the
national security system, in particular in states of emergency.

#### 4.4. Social subsystems

**139. The objective of the preparation of social subsystems of national secu-**
rity is to ensure their effective functioning in the event of a threat of a war
and to improve rules, procedures and capabilities to execute tasks aimed at
social support to operational subsystems.

**140.** **National heritage protection system. It is necessary to modify the**
system of protection of cultural heritage assets against common threats and
war, as well as to improve a coherent cultural and historical policy of the
state, taking into consideration requirements of the contemporary economy
and changes taking place in today’s world. It should also allow for an effective state patronage, ensure sufficient increase in the amount of funds allocated to the protection of cultural heritage assets and define their role in the
development of individuals and of the nation. Another important matter is
the appropriate cultural and historical education, comprising the promotion
of areas related, inter alia, to tradition and heritage, having at the same time
regard to contemporary reality, such as mass culture, tourism and means of
social communication.

**141.** **Education for security institutions. Actions aimed to improve com-**
petences in the field of security require intensification and better coordina

-----

tion. More emphasis should be put on the quality of education regarding
areas important from the perspective of state and citizens’ security within the
framework of the general education and higher education system, as well as
on vocational training of soldiers, officers, civilian personnel of the army and
services, public administration employees and security education teachers.
It will require the arrangement of the question of higher education offered
in particular by universities supervised by the Minister of National Defence
and by Minister responsible for internal affairs, e.g. through the creation of
coherent curricula with regard to education of the purposes of the integrated
national security and through a reform of military education system. In this
context, it is worth to consider a transformation, with the use of existing
capabilities and resources, of one or several of the universities into a new – in
terms of quality – public high education institution providing education with
regard to the integrated national security, implementing curricula on a transsectoral and supraministerial level, which would allow to obtain the quality
of teaching meeting the needs of the state.

**142.** **Media in the national security system. It is recommended to fur-**
ther develop and deepen the cooperation between representatives of national
institutions and the media engaged in the protection of the national security.
It will be necessary to improve the preparation of press services of state institutions as well as journalists covering the matters related to the national
security and to increase the focus of the mission of public media on the said
subject.

**143.** **Prevention of threats to the demographic security. An important**
priority of Poland will be to continue to prevent unfavourable demographic
trends. It will comprise an enhanced family policy and a coherent migration
policy. As far as the family policy is concerned, measures to reconcile professional and private life should be continued, including the development
of institutional care of children and alternative forms of care of the elderly.
Moreover, actions undertaken by the state must provide for support for persons returning and considering a return to Poland.


-----

**144.** **Social security. Social security of individuals and families will be en-**
sured, _inter alia, by a coherent social security system. It is planned to cre-_
ate a comprehensive and effective system of allowances and social benefits,
which will stimulate the achievement of economic independence and employment in the open labour market, and in which the risk of long-term social exclusion will be avoided.

#### 4.5. Economic subsystems

**145. The aim of preparation of economic subsystems of national security is**
to develop and implement appropriate strategies and programmes ensuring
safe functioning of state business entities in times of a threat and of war, as
well as execution of tasks related to the economic support for operational
subsystems of the national security system.

**146.** **Financial security institutions. In times of global financial crisis, the**
effectiveness of institutions responsible for the financial security of Poland
gains special significance. More efficient prevention of threats at the frontier of financial offences, as well as prevention of legal loopholes, requires
enhanced collaboration and coordination of institutions responsible for the
financial security of the state and appropriate state protection services. An increased activity of the judiciary with regard to entities the activities of which
threaten investors or the economy, is desired. It is important to implement
the strategy of entrance of Poland to the eurozone and to revise the strategy,
since the adoption of the single European currency may create an efficient
shield against currency turmoil and allow Poland to fully participate in EU
decision-making processes.

**147.** **Energy security entities. Preparedness priorities determining direc-**
tions for the development and improvement of the energy security of Poland
include the launching of industrial extraction of natural gas from unconventional deposits, including the elaboration of extraction technology adjusted
to the specific character of domestic deposits of this raw material, expansion
of transmission grids and storage facilities for the transmission of additional
quantities of natural gas to national and foreign recipients, as well as con

-----

struction of a regional natural gas distribution and storage centre in the territory of Poland. The LNG terminal must be expanded with further regasification capacities, as well as with existing and new gas connections within the
Visegrad Group, in order for a regional gas market to be developed. Actions
for the diversification of crude oil supply sources must be continued, covering the commercial implementation of the project devoted to imports of the
raw material from the region of the Caspian Sea, as well as support for the
launching of industrial extraction of crude oil from unconventional deposits
in Poland. Progressive modernisation of the system for storage, transmission
and distribution of crude oil and fuels in the country, as well as improvement
of oil terminal parameters is also significant. Furthermore, it is important
to reconstruct the electricity generation sector, taking into consideration the
priority which is the use of national deposits of primary energy sources (hard
coal, lignite, gas, also from unconventional deposits) and nuclear energy. To
this aim, it is necessary to ensure support of the state for long-term, capitalintensive investment in new capacities in the power sector. The security of
the state requires coordination among ministries, taking the division of competences within the Council of Ministers with regard to energy policy into account, as well as the state’s influence on its implementation by energy companies, which will make it possible to respond in a fast and effective manner
in the case of occurrence of threats in energy markets. It is necessary for the
state to control the key infrastructure of the fuel and energy sector and to
expand the supervision and control of the wealth of geological resources of
the state.

**148.** **System of strategic reserves. The key task regarding the mainte-**
nance of the system of strategic reserves is to ensure financing from the state
budget for the _Government Programme of Strategic Reserves at a level allowing for_
the implementation of tasks planned in the five-year perspective.

149. **Food security. In order to appropriately protect the health and inter-**
ests of consumers of agri-food articles, it is important to strengthen food control, so that activities of the state ensure a uniform and effective supervision
over its production and distribution.


-----

**150.** **Environmental protection entities. In view of a dispersion of con-**
trol over the observance of environmental protection regulations in Poland,
efforts will be made to strengthen and improve activities undertaken by
environmental protection services. International cooperation in the field of
environmental security will be developed, covering the support for organisations and international agreements favouring the reduction of emissions of
pollutants, global climate policy and preservation of biodiversity, respecting
the level of development and structure of national economies of participating
states.

**151.** **Scientific bodies. It is necessary to increase the modernity and in-**
novativeness of science and research capacities in the field of security and
defence of the state by activating the scientific and industrial (including international) cooperation of the scientific-research milieu. The needs of the
integrated national security system require an interdisciplinary approach to
research and development concerning national security embodied, inter alia,
in common funding of research on dual-use technologies that may be commercially used also in the civil sector. It is crucial for an increase in scientific
capacities to ensure long-term prospects for stable funding of research and
development in priority areas from the point of view of the national security. Proportion of expenditure allocated to research and development in the
domain of security and defence of the state to the GDP in particular budget
years must be established by law. Expenditure on research and development
in the area of security, including defence, should be increased by means of
a search for extra-budgetary sources of financing and broad use of available
(legal, financial, organisational) instruments that make it easier for domestic
entities to conduct scientific and research activities.


-----
