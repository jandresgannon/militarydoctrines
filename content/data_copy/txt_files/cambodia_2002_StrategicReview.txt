 Strategic Review

 2002


-----

On behalf of the Royal Government, I would like to express
my most sincere congratulation for the successful creation of this
Defense Strategic Review. It reflects the determination of the
Ministry of National Defense and the High Command Headquarters
to implement the Royal Government’s defense policy more
successfully.

I fully believe that this Defense Strategic Review 2002 will be
an effective instrument for the successful implementation of the
Royal Government’s reform policy, particularly the reform of the
Armed Forces. It demonstrates the efforts made by the Royal
Cambodian Armed Forces in building its reputation internationally. It
also represents Cambodia’s commitment in promoting transparency
and building confidence in security matters with all nations in the
region.

I totally support the measures and recommendations laid
down by this document and request that it becomes widely
understood within the RCAF and that it be released publicly in
national and international circles.

## Foreword

The establishment of a realistic
defense policy has inevitably
encountered difficulties, but what is
infinitely more difficult is the
implementation of this policy to
achieve ultimate success. This has
been to experience to date regarding
the implementation of the principles
of the White Paper 2000.

The Defense Strategic Review
2002 contains further guidelines for
fulfilling the roles and tasks of the
Royal Cambodian Armed Forces
(RCAF) productively and according
to the current and future security
environments. The Outlook has been
developed based on studies, research
and analyses on the evolution of the
security situation and results already
achieved in military reform. In
addition, the presence of this strategic
document is evidence of the firm
commitment of the Royal
Government of Cambodia to build
transparency and confidence in
national and international circles
regarding national security policy.


Two years have passed since the official launch of the White
Paper 2000. Although a number of principles, especially those in the
military reform process, have been and are being carried out
successfully, there have been many other major tasks that the RCAF
must place greater emphasis on to completely achieve the defense
policy objectives of the Royal Government.


-----

Recent changes in the world security and domestic political,
economic and security developments have encouraged many nations
to adopt an urgent review of their strategic objectives. Despite that it
has not been affected directly by the impacts of changes in world
security, Cambodia views that this is an appropriate time for it to
review its defense policy, especially to determine new priorities for
strategic defense objectives and providing important
recommendations for the successful implementation of the Defense
White Paper 2000. This Defense Strategic Review is a significant
tool in this regard.

## 1. International Security Outlook

The international security situation has changed dramatically
since the September 11[th] terrorist attacks in New York and
Washington. The world is focusing on a common threat, that is, the
fight against international terrorism. Almost everywhere, terrorism
has become the top item in every debate. However, methods and
ways to be used against this terrible crime remain an unresolved
issue.

The operational tempo of the war in Afghanistan to apprehend
Osama bin Laden and destroy Al-qaida terrorist networks has slightly
eased, but this is not the end of that kind of war. The policy of Bush’s
administration to root out global terrorist networks and to define “the
Axis of Evil” has possibly proliferated the war against terrorism into
other regions. The deployment of US troops in southern Philippines
to help the government of that country to destroy Abu Sayyaf rebels,
believed to be linked to Al-qaida, is evidence of the spread of the war
against terrorism into Southeast Asia. On the other hand, the concern
over possible nuclear, biological and chemical attacks on American
and some allied targets have contributed to increasing insecurity and
is affecting global economic development.

In the meantime, the most recent political and military
confrontation between India and Pakistan has complicated the
security situation in South Asia. The suicide attack on the Indian
Parliament in December 2001, the recent repeated attacks on Indian
military bases and the ongoing dispute over Kashmir have increased
military tension between India and Pakistan to a dangerous level.
Despite these tensions being eased as a result of willingness from the
two rivals leaders to solve the problem diplomatically rather than
through military force, together with diplomatic intervention by some
countries, the possibility of war between the two countries, stemming
from the unresolved Kashmir dispute and involving the use of nuclear
weapons, remains a serious threat to the whole region.

The bloody conflict between Israel and Palestine is
deteriorating and will be difficult to resolve. Violence and retaliations
against each other involving the Israeli Defense Force and suicide
attacks by the Palestinian militants are destroying human lives and
properties relentlessly. Despite support from Arab countries for the
peace initiative by the Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince (wanting Israel


-----

to respect the land occupied in 1967 in exchange for recognition of
the State of Israel by Arab nations), the process towards declaring the
Palestine State and the demand by the United States to remove Mr.
Yasser Arafat from his position as the Palestinian leader have caused
disagreements in efforts of finding lasting peace for the Middle
Eastern region.

Relations between China and the United States have been
better than any other time since the events of September 11[th]. Despite
recent bitterness (accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade and the aircraft collision over the South China Sea), the
Unites States support for China to enter the World Trade
Organization (WTO), the lifting of annual review on Generalized
System of Preferences (GSP) for China, China’s support for the war
against terrorism and the recognition of one-China policy by the
United States, have improve relations between the two countries.

At the end of May 2002, the United States and Russia opened
a new historic chapter to end the Cold War legacy through the
establishment of the NATO-Russia Council. One of the objectives is
cooperation between the former rivals in the fight against global
terrorism. Another positive development for global security was the
agreement signed between the two leaders in Moscow at the end of
May 2002. The two powers have agreed to further reduce nuclear
weapons by two-thirds within 10 years. Also in May, in Kuala
Lumpur, most of ASEAN leaders agreed to efforts to combat
terrorism, though some differences remain in the establishment of
anti-terrorist laws in each country. Three ASEAN countries,
Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, have signed an agreement
on Information Exchange and Establishment of Communication
Procedures aiming mainly at combating terrorism and preventing
transnational crimes. Cambodia acceded to the above-mentioned
agreement in early August 2002.

Despite considerable progress in cooperation to prevent and
deal with transnational crimes, these crimes remain a concern
particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. The regional security has been
plagued by new occurrences of terrorist activities in Southeast Asia,
the spread of drug trafficking, weapon smuggling, kidnapping,
money laundering and so on. Also, security of maritime
communications and trade through the Strait of Malacca and the


-----

South China Sea remains a key issue on the agenda of the ASEAN
Regional Forum (ARF).

## 2. Relations with Neighboring Countries

As described in Chapter 3 of the Defense White Paper 2000,
Cambodia’s security cooperation with its neighboring countries is
developing. Cambodian-Thai General Border Committee held its
second meeting in Phnom Penh in mid 2001 and the third meeting in
Pattaya in early March 2002. Such meetings had been suspended
since 1995.

_Senior delegates attending Cambodian-Thai General Border Committee Meeting in Pattaya,_
_Thailand in Mach 2002. (Picture: Chea Chheang AKP)_

In the Pattaya meeting, the two sides pledged to improve
security on the Cambodian-Thai border. The two sides focused on
maintaining security over trade corridors, joint cooperation to prevent
and suppress cross-border criminal activities such as human
trafficking; weapon, artifact and drug smuggling; illegal movement;
and the maintenance of self-restraint in regard to the frequent
irregularities that occur along the border.

Beside border security mechanism, humanitarian cooperation
is being carried out with both Thailand and Vietnam; for example, the
contribution by the Royal Thai Armed Forces in rebuilding Route 48
from Koh Kong to Sre Ambel and the cooperation between the
RCAF and the Vietnamese People’s Armed Forces in search


-----

operations to locate the remains of Vietnamese soldiers buried or
missing in Cambodia.

## 3. Defense Cooperation

Chapter 3 of the Defense White Paper 2000 has already
emphasized the importance of military cooperation with a number of
countries.

_One of the significant non-_
_refundable assistance from_
_China is the construction of_
_the Combined Arms Officer_
_School, Thlok Tasek. The_
_Opening ceremony of the_
_construction site and the_
_hand-over of assistance were_
_held in mid June 2002, with_
_the participation of the Co-_
_Ministers of National_
_Defense, the Commander-in-_
_Chief of the RCAF and the_
_Chinese Ambassador._
_(Picture: Chea Chheang_
_AKP)_

Currently, defense cooperation with China has been
significantly enhanced in the fields of human resource development,
the constructions of military bases and officer training facilities,
military health, engineering equipment and other material assistance.
China’s assistance in human resource development could increase
within the next 3 to 5 years.

At the same time,
India has offered an
annual program of triservice military scholarships beginning in the
2001-2002 academic year.
The Ministry of National
Defense is also considering an Indian initiative to
expand its assistance into
other areas such as
computer and English
training.


-----

France remains an
important partner in military
cooperation with human
resource development, technical assistance to the Royal
Gendarmerie and other
material support. We hope
that cooperation with France
would be enhanced in the
future, especially in the area
of improving the capability

ASEAN countries, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Indonesia and Singapore are maintaining their training support.
Recently, Thailand has expanded its construction assistance to the
Tmat Pong Cadet School, a project of Princess Maha Chakri
Sirindhorn.

Defense cooperation in six substantial areas is being
established with Vietnam. Today and in the future, Vietnam will offer
a number of skill training schemes for RCAF personnel.

working to reach an
agreement concerning an
exchange of training in the
future, through which

military personnel for
training in the Republic of

Australia has increased its defense co-operation
assistance for the period
2002-2004. The assistance
is focused on defense policy
development, English training, continued support for
the Pich Nil Army Training
Center and the Navy
workshop at Ream Maritime
Base, upgrading Military
Region hospitals, establishment of a Command and
Staff Center and a military
medical program.


The RCAF is expecting the return of the IMET program
previously provided by the US government from 1994 to mid 1997.
Reopening of this program would offer a good opportunity for RCAF
officers to enhance their capabilities and expertise which are essential
for military reform and force development.

-----

Meanwhile, Cambodia urges the United States to reconsider
the reactivation of other programs, such as the Title 10, Military-toMilitary Contact, Mobile Training in Cambodia and the possibility of
support for the functioning of the existing Cambodian Military
Institute’s Center for Strategic Studies.

With the above-mentioned defense assistance programs and in
accordance with the agreement made during the Seminar on Defense
Policy—RCAF Implementation held from 7 to 8 May 2002, the
RCAF needs outside assistance in other areas, which not only
benefits the defense force, but also contributes to national
development. Those requirements include the enhancement of
engineering capabilities, relief operations, counter-terrorism,
engagement in peacekeeping operations under the UN framework,
medical capability, improvement of communications among the three
layers of defense system, quality of domestic training… etc and etc.

## 4. National Defense Objectives

Chapter 4 of the White Paper 2000 has clearly defined
national defense objectives based on threat assessment addressing
military, economy, demography, geography and environmental
considerations. But a new threat, transnational terrorism, is currently
emerging. Nevertheless, the assessment from the Defense Seminar
held in May 2002 concluded that the possibility of a terrorist threat
did not pose a serious challenge to Cambodia’s security but may
impact adversely on the nation’s economy. This could possibly also
increase the level of poverty.

As mentioned previously, the war against terrorism could
spread to Southeast Asia and international terrorist groups may seek
all means to continue their activities. While Cambodia has a weak
economy, terrorist groups could choose Cambodia as a place for
trafficking their resources.

Border areas, both land and sea, could be the main targets for
such infiltration. Cambodia is concerned about its defense
effectiveness because the skills and technique of the Border Defense
Units are inadequate. On the other hand, the complete lack of
communication infrastructure on the borders is a major obstacle for
any operation against those international terrorist and transnational
criminal activities. The maritime area is also vulnerable, and the


-----

Royal Cambodian Navy’s current resources and technology cannot
guarantee a completely effective response.

Based on these
concerns, the Border
Defense Units desperately
need capabilities to counter
terrorism and transnational
crimes. Enhancing these
capabilities will require
international assistance.
These units must also have
appropriate communication
capability to conduct their
operations and to facilitate
the exchange of information
with other national agencies.

Another key factor is the
need to refurbish and put
back into service some basic
equipment for operations
such as the means for
ground troop mobility and
small boats for patrolling
maritime areas and so on.

To respond effectively to any threat and for national security
as a whole, Cambodia needs to change its defense priorities to adapt
to the current security environment. Those priorities include:

     - Enhance border defense capabilities against transnational
crimes and infiltration of terrorist groups. Increase efforts
in infrastructural and community development in border
areas.

     - Maintain Navy’s technological capability and resources to
achieve an effective patrol capability for the maritime
border.

     - Expedite military reforms, particularly demobilization,
improve soldiers’ living standard, unit restructuring and
the reform of the training system.


-----

     - Establish mechanism for force mobilization to ensure the
sustainability and the quality of the armed forces.

     - Expand military participation in national development,
particularly in the areas of engineering, relief operations,
suppression and crackdown on small arms trafficking,
participation in safeguarding the environment (tree
planting) and other humanitarian activities.

     - Gradually build capabilities to participate in regional and
international military activities, especially small-team
participation in future UN’s peace operations.

## 5. Consideration for the RCAF’s Roles

The RCAF’s four primary roles defined in Chapter 5 of the
White Paper 2000 have not been changed. However, there will be a
reduced emphasis on the RCAF’s role of ensuring peace, stability and
social orders. This is in accordance with current security situation and
the Royal Government’s decentralization policy.

The RCAF will increase its engagement in the restoration and
development of national infrastructure by using as much as possible
of its existing resources. On the other hand, the military must be
prepared and ready to help the people suffering from various natural
disasters.

## 6. Maintaining Military Strategy

Military Strategy of “Flexible and Controlled Response”
introduced in the White Paper 2000 remains fundamental to
implementing the Royal Government’s defense policy. The three
layers of the national defense system (the High Command, Military
Regions and Deployed Units) are core actors in implementing this
strategy effectively.

Nevertheless, the adoption of the following measures could
ensure success in the future. Those measures are:

     - Improve the effectiveness of command, control and
communication system among the three layers of the
national defense system, enabling timely exchange of
intelligence and appropriate actions for response.


-----

     - Extend the means of patrolling for Border Defense Units
where necessary and possible.

     - The Intervention Units must be in a state of readiness to
respond in time to any contingencies. This is aimed
mainly at prevention and crackdown of cross-border
illegal activities, combating terrorism and rescue
operations.

     - Be prepared to respond in a timely and effectively manner
to any contingencies occurring in the maritime areas.

     - Seek to improve the mobility of the force.

     - Expand engineering capabilities available to all Military
Regions.

     - Focus attention on developing military bases.

     - Continued efforts to improve soldiers’ living standard.

## 7. RCAF Force Development

During the past few years, the RCAF’s reform process has
progressed in many areas. In general, the reform needs to be
reinforced by a clear strategic plan, commitment from all echelon of
leadership, appropriate resources and, if necessary, external support.
These reinforcing factors must concurrently be available during the
reform process.

## a. Demobilization

Based on the Royal Government’s plan provided in Chapter 5
of the White Paper 2000, the RCAF has succeeded in the first largescale demobilization in 2001, in which 15,000 soldiers of category 1


-----

and 2 were discharged and removed from the military payroll. The
Royal Government is planning to conduct the second phase of
demobilization in 2002. According to Samdech Prime Minister Hun
Sen’s remarks while meeting with Belgian and Luxembourg Defense
Ministers, the Royal Government wants the RCAF to have an
appropriate size that meets current national defense needs while
improving soldiers’ living standards and transferring funds from
security areas to social affairs. Samdech Prime Minister emphasized
that the Royal Government will continue to demobilize more soldiers
if necessary should the means be available.

_[General Ke Kim Yan, Commander-in-Chief of the RCAF, is presenting ]_
_National Defense Medal to a demobilized soldier._
_(Picture: Chea Chheang AKP)_

Detailed studies must be undertaken to determine the
optimum RCAF force structure. In order to achieve the abovementioned objective, demobilization must be applied to all levels of
the defense hierarchy in order to avoid the situation where at the end
of the demobilization process only high-ranking officers remain. A
comprehensive implementation of the retirement law would also help
to relieve this difficulty.

The Royal Government is considering the establishment of
arrangements to ensure that manpower is available to meet defense
needs. Through the application of these arrangements, in the future,
young soldiers would be recruited (depending on manning
requirements) to fill the RCAF’s units. Meanwhile, we also hope that
if the conditions of service are upgraded appropriately, recruiting for
military service could be done on a voluntary basis.


-----

## b. Unit Restructuring

In 2001, the High Command has successfully restructured the
Army units by reducing divisions to brigades. In the future,
particularly at the end of the demobilization, further reductions in the
number of Army units are expected. This practice would also help to
improve the effectiveness of command and control in the units.
Border Defense Units have also been readjusted in terms of the
number of the units and their locations. These measures are further
detailed in the High Command’s Five Year Plan.

## c. Training and Education

The Ministry of National Defense and the High Command
have been reforming their professional training system which is the
key to ensure quality and effectiveness of military forces.

_Soldiers from 911[th] Airborne Brigade_
_are conducting training._
_(Picture: 911 Bde.)_

The three levels of professional training; Cadet, Command
and Staff and Strategic Studies; will provide basic and advanced
capabilities and experiences to officers at all levels in the RCAF. The
recent Seminar on Defense Policy – RCAF Implementation has also
demanded that more effort is required in establishing training
doctrine, extending language education programs and improving
students selection processes.

## d. Engineering

As mentioned previously, engineering capability must
gradually be extended to the military regions, where many


-----

responsibilities – border infrastructural developments, demining,
assisting communities in rural development and disaster relief, other
constructions for the interests of the military regions themselves – are
RCAF responsibilities.

_Department of International_
_Relations._
_(Picture: General Department_
_of Logistics and Finance)_

Although this capability development has always encountered
difficulties and required time, the RCAF must put more emphasis on
maintaining cooperation with international partners to absorb more
assistance to benefit the military itself as well as the society as a
whole.

## e. Maintenance of Military Assets

Chapter 6 of the White Paper 2000 acknowledges the
difficulties in obtaining fund to maintain RCAF’s assets. Moreover,
the Royal Government’s policy has restricted the procurement of
additional military equipments for the RCAF at least for the next
three to five years. Therefore, all military assets are aging or
becoming obsolete particularly due to years of poor maintenance. The
Defense White Paper 2000 also underlines the extension of repair and
maintenance capabilities to the military regions.

_In the state of budget constraint,_
_the Royal Cambodian Navy_
_increases efforts to repair its_
_aging equipments._
_(Picture: Australian Embassy)_


-----

To avoid increasing losses of military assets, the Ministry of
National Defense should consider the allocation of funds for repairs
and maintenance to major military hardware such as naval ships,
transport aircraft, military vehicle, engineering equipment, rescue
equipment…etc. Like the engineering capability, seeking support
from international partners in this area is also essential.

## f. Condition of Service

Although there has been large-scale demobilization, the
soldiers’ livelihood has not been improved. As described earlier, the
Royal Government is committed to demobilize more soldiers, but it
must be in harmony with the requirement for national defense and the
availability of means. Possession of a smaller military force suitable
for national defense while retaining appropriate defense spending
would improve soldiers’ living standard. Budgets could be spent on
training, modernization and technological capability. An appropriate
salary will not only make the soldiers loyal to serving the nation, but
it would also encourage the Khmer people to volunteer for military
service.

## g. Contribution to Ensuring Security and Social Orders

The campaign to prevent and subsequently eradicate the use
of illegal weapons must continue enthusiastically.

_Tens thousands of confiscated and surplus weapons are destroyed under the campaign_
_of “The Flame of Peace”. This picture shows the burning of weapons in Kampong_
_Thom in early April 2001. (Picture: Chea Chheang AKP)_


-----

Apart from destroying thousands of confiscated and surplus
weapons, the RCAF will continue to fully cooperate with the EUASAC and the Ministry of Interior to control the use and trafficking
of small arms. At the same time, it must also pay attention to storing
weapons properly at various military bases and safe warehouses.

## h. Humanitarian Activities 

As countries enjoy peace and stability, most of the armed
forces are putting more emphasis on capability development and
allocating resources for humanitarian purpose – disaster relief,
medical services and other humanitarian assistance.

_The RCAF evacuates people from the flood affected areas. (Picture: Chea Chheang AKP)_

Because widespread flooding affects Cambodia every year,
the RCAF must be capable of rescuing the people. Further technical
assistance in rescue capabilities should be maintained in Special
Forces, the Engineers, the Navy, the Air Force and the Royal
Gendarmerie. The RCAF has received some rescue equipment from
friendly countries, which is an important source for the development
of its humanitarian capability.

Acquiring more equipment and conducting regular training in
this skill is another priority, which requires close liaison with friendly
countries. To increase the effectiveness in operations and to ensure a
state of readiness at all times, joint exercises should be carried out
among related specialized forces and with foreign countries, if
necessary, in the future. This could be done when we have the
possibility and sufficient resources. Likewise, the establishment of
small mobile medical teams with a field medical capability will offer
great benefit for the RCAF as well as for the community. These


-----

teams would be able to carry out their humanitarian activities
throughout the country, particularly where public health services are
not available. In the future, if possible, this capability could deploy
overseas in the context of UN’s humanitarian assistance. Developing
a reliable capability and providing necessary equipments, including
mobility, could be obtained through foreign defense cooperation
programs.

## i. Counter-Terrorist Capability

The Southeast Asian region has not been spared from the
global terrorist threat. Based on a wide-ranging assessment,
Cambodia has not been a target for those terrorist threats. However,
consequences may occur in the future, which might adversely effect
Cambodia’s economy, trade, industry and domestic security.

Since the RCAF has been given roles to ensuring security and
social orders, the enhancement of a state of readiness against any
possible consequences is prudent. The establishment of a counterterrorist capability in RCAF’s Special Forces would not only provide
effective measures to the Royal Government for responses to any
hostile occurrences, but it would display quality in defense and
promote the RCAF’s reputation in national and international circles
as well.

_Soldiers from 911[th]_
_Airborne Brigade_
_are conducting_
_counter-terrorist_
_techniques._
_(Picture: 911 Bde.)_

Some ASEAN countries who vow to combat terrorism have
received support and assistance from other major countries,
particularly from the United States. RCAF’s Special Forces might be
able to obtain this support while the Royal Government would focus
on creating a coordinating mechanism for the implementation of that
special operations capability. Therefore, as an important factor, the


-----

defense institutions should maintain relations with foreign friends,
seeking ways and means to create and further enhance this capability.

## j. Construction of Military Bases

Effective and timely response depends on readiness. Military
base permits the concentration of forces, materials, training, condition
of service, medical services, morale motivation, disciplines…etc. The
Ministry of National Defense and the High Command must have a
clear plan for the step-by-step building of military bases, based on
available resources. On the other hand, seeking support from foreign
countries is essential. Outside assistance is a significant source to
achieve good results in construction of military bases.

_Mobile barracks donated by China to the 1[st] Infantry Brigade._
_(Picture: Chinese DA Office)_

Concepts for building military bases must primarily be
dependent upon studies of defense strategy, terrain and demands in
the area.

## k. Policy and Planning

Planning is one of the key factors that determines efficacy and
success in task implementation. Commanders of all levels of war –
tactical, operation and strategic levels – must understand the
importance of planning. Planning is a combination of ways and
means to achieve a certain objective. This means that if the Royal
Government’s defense policy is understood, both military and
defense objectives could be set.

_(Picture: Chea Chheang AKP)_

Therefore, a comprehensive educational campaign of the
Defense White Paper and the Defense Strategic Review is extremely
important. Moreover, the Ministry of National Defense and the
RCAF’s High Command should allow military commanders to have
the opportunity to meet each other frequently in seminars,
conferences, meetings, or in joint planning processes to develop their
personal ability, knowledge and vision. It would also provide an
opportunity for studies and exchange of experiences that could
benefit efforts of building RCAF future reputation.
