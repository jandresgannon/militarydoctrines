and moral renewal. As a Government we are committed to a clear, doable programme of action for
lowering taxes, reducing the cost of living, increasing employment and disposable income, widening
the social safety net, improving the quality and accessibility of education and health, and forging a new
national partnership based on consultation, dialogue and consensus.

Belize’s National Security Strategy responds to the more obvious threats to Belize’s security, such
as the drug trade, corruption, and the breakdown of social systems. Government is committed to
restoring faith in the justice system. A joint intelligence unit made up of the Police, Belize Defence
Force, Customs, Immigration, the Coast Guard, Income Tax and the Financial Intelligence Unit will
concentrate on illegal activities nationwide in order to strengthen criminal intelligence gathering.
A restored Conscious Youth Development Programme, appropriately resourced, is controlling and
diffusing gang violence, mainly in Belize City. Traditional threats are increasingly regional and
hemispheric, indeed global, in scope, requiring cooperation across borders. Common problems require
common, coordinated solutions.

Our national security strategy also takes account of non-traditional threats. Annually from June to
October we are reminded of our growing vulnerability to climate change, affecting agriculture, sea-level
rise, and the intensity of hurricanes. The escalating price of fuel challenges the state as well as private
citizens. Health is the foundation of a secure community. Good schools graduate confi dent citizens who
build a more secure Belize. Strong families are essential to national security. In short, Belize’s security
ultimately rests on the integral development and participation of its greatest resource, its people.

I am pleased to recommend Belize’s National Security Strategy to all.

for safeguarding the national security of our country is essential. I am proud to have encouraged the
culmination of this Belize National Security Strategy.

This National Security Strategy (NSS) integrates Belize’s major national security policies, goals,
responsibilities, and activities into a cohesive whole. It addresses the issues of national security from
all angles and provides an overarching document for accomplishing national security goals through
the combined use of the multifaceted instruments of national government. The NSS provides overall
strategic guidance and establishes the vision that will guide national security decisions at all levels.
It also aims to make individuals at each level aware of their roles as partners in our responsibility
to work simultaneously and continuously to enhance Belize’s national security and to creatively and
harmoniously coordinate activities for optimal use of our scarce resources.

We can ‘protect and preserve Belize our beloved country’ working together in a well-planned, strategic
and synchronized manner. I expect that all organizations identifi ed within will embrace this security
strategy as their own, pursue its directives, and take the necessary steps to contribute to a safer Belize.
All Belizeans can be proud of this strategic initiative and, with our national spirit of cooperation, it will
become a crucial vehicle for national progress.

Thank You.

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

##### Executive Summary

Despite the growth of global governance and regional integration efforts, the State remains the primary
actor in international affairs and is ultimately responsible for confronting a myriad of possible state
and non-state threats that challenge its very existence. Therefore, the State must make every effort to
guarantee its sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of external threats.

It is unwise to defi ne national security solely in terms of sovereignty and territorial integrity. It is a
broad concept that encompasses all possible threats to the Belizean way of life, including threats to
public safety, governance, economic wellbeing, social welfare, and the environment. National security
issues have local, regional, and international dimensions, and greatly affect the nation’s chances of
achieving all of its social and economic goals. National Security requires proactive management by the
State through its agents and institutions.

The National Security Strategy of Belize will establish:

###### “A safe, secure Belize at peace with itself and its neighbours, where the security environment allows the development of a peaceful and democratic society that utilizes its human and natural resources to ensure social justice, ethnic harmony, security, stability and prosperity.”

In essence, the vision is for all Belizeans to enjoy a better quality of life and have an opportunity to
realise their full potential.

The illegal drug trade remains of particular concern as this has a direct infl uence on criminal activity
involving drug use, gangs, small arms traffi cking, violent crime, money laundering, and the corruption
of the criminal justice system. This, coupled with the general breakdown of social mores, have led to
the widespread disregard for the rule of law and the gradual depreciation of the value of human life,
particularly among our youth. Other threats to Belize include all those relating to natural and manmade disasters, external challenges to Belize’s economic stability, and the unsustainable loss of natural
resources.

Following a careful analysis of the many threats to national security and their associated vulnerabilities,
eleven national security goals arise that can counter or reduce the extent of the country’s exposure to
these threats:

Executive Summary **3**


-----

**National Security Strategy of Belize**


1. Maintain the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Belize;
2. Reduce violent crime and dismantle local, cross border, and trans-national criminal
networks;
3. Strengthen the criminal justice system and ensure the rule of law;
4. Protect Belize from terrorism;
5. Provide the necessary environment for a stable and vibrant economy;
6. Strengthen the institutions of democratic governance;
7. Improve delivery of healthcare at all levels and reduce the impact of health related threats;
8. Reduce the risks associated with rapid and slow-onset of natural and human-caused
hazards;
9. Improve and expand nationwide access to education up to the tertiary level;
10. Protect Belize’s natural resources;
11. Achieve Energy and Food Security.

This National Security Strategy (NSS) incorporates the State’s major security policies, goals,
responsibilities and actions into an overall master plan for the fulfi lment of the national security vision
for Belize. The NSS outlines the combined use of the political, economic, social, informational, and
security instruments of national power. It clarifi es the institutional framework within which the security
forces and civil institutions of the state will coordinate their activities to create an integrated and cohesive
national security network to safeguard national interests. It also prescribes the complementary roles
and responsibilities of public and private sectors, as well as members of civil society in supporting
national security.

Transnational threats coupled with an increasingly complex internal security environment, has resulted
in the blurring of traditional agency boundaries with various entities now recognizing that they have
a role to play in promoting national security. There remains a need to enhance coordination and

Executive Summary **4**


-----

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

cooperation among the different ministries and institutions charged with providing national security.
There is a need to break down barriers to building a long-term security picture, including the sharing
of information across databases because of our limited resources in acquiring strategic intelligence.

The National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) will be responsible to coordinate the implementation
of this NSS. The NSCS shall coordinate existing operational bodies through agreed procedures. The
NSCS shall provide progress reports on strategic security initiatives, advice on current major national
security developments, regional and international security concerns.

The National Security Council, (NSC) chaired by the Prime Minister, will have overall responsibility
for the implementation of the NSS. The NSC will report to the Cabinet, and the Cabinet to the House
of Representatives for public justifi cation.

The strategic action required to achieve each of the National Security Goals is included. The plan
outlines the specifi c strategic actions required by named Ministries, Departments and Agencies which
shall contribute signifi cantly to improving the security condition of Belize. The development of detailed
security related budgets remains the responsibility of the implementing bodies, as they incorporate
security projects into their annual plans and ensure their implementation. The budget for each project
shall be incorporated into a Plan Belize; this plan shall be the blueprint for seeking national and
international funding.

##### The Strategic Environment

###### The Contemporary International System

Belize is in a unique position as the link between Central America and the Caribbean due to its strategic
location as well as its historical and contemporary links to both regions. Belize is an active member of
the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Central American Integration System (SICA). Though
its near pristine environment and stable democracy are examples to both regions, increased population
growth has led to challenges unanticipated only a few years ago. The lack of national and sectorspecifi c strategies to address current and developing concerns exacerbates these problems. However,
the international political and economic system must fi rst be clearly understood, since it provides the
context within which Belize must design and implement its NSS.

The international political system has evolved much over the course of the past one hundred years. The
violence of the “Great War” in the early 20th Century had given rise to the hope that a multilateral
international system would bring lasting peace to future generations. The subsequent failure of the
League of Nations, which cleared the way for the Second World War and the horrors of the Holocaust,
did not put an end to the hope that a multilateral system could bring peace to humankind. Unfortunately,
for most of its existence the United Nations coincided with the Cold War during which time it was
largely powerless to prevent the intra-state and inter-state violence that was in one form or another,
related to the struggle between the two superpowers.

The end of the Cold War has ushered in a new era for the international system. States are no longer the
only international actors involved in the formulation and implementation of national and international
policies. Inter-Governmental Organisations (IGOs), local and international Non-Governmental
Organisations (NGOs), local and trans-national criminal organisations, and other sub-state and nonstate actors are now heavily involved in a variety of challenges to the sovereignty of states and the
welfare of the people.

Globalization and the increasing involvement of IGOs such as the United Nations and the OAS in
maintaining international peace have made inroads into the anarchic international system. In the fi nal
analysis, though, every state remains ultimately responsible for its own existence. Organizations like
the United Nations, established primarily to promote international peace, remain restricted by the
extent to which its member states may wish to become involved.

The Strategic Environment **6**


-----

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

For Belize, the modern system presents particular challenges that escape the unilateral and traditional
application of state power. Belize’s limited size, population, and resources demand addressing problems
cooperatively with external actors. This remains true for the majority of challenges facing Belize,
including maintaining the country’s territorial integrity, confronting criminal activity, increasing
economic activity, addressing health related threats, and protecting the environment. These issues will
infl uence the future of Belize. These national security concerns if not adequately addressed could lead
to economic, political, and social instability and loss of public confi dence.

In summary, the international system remains complex and though the primacy of states has faced
challenges by a variety of external actors, the state remains the most important international actor.
Belize must therefore continue to engage its international partners while acknowledging that it remains
ultimately responsible for its continued existence as well as its successes and failures. The International
Community has demonstrated willingness to support national efforts. However, the strategic direction
must be clearly Belizean to guide scarce international assistance to our areas of priority.

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

##### National Security Vision

###### Introduction

National security issues greatly affect Belize’s chances of attaining and achieving all its social and
economic goals. This National Security Strategy cohesively integrates the country’s major security
goals, policies, responsibilities and actions into one overall master plan for the fulfi lment of a National
Security Vision. The concept of the NSS encompasses all factors identifi ed to be essential to the
security, stability and prosperity of Belize and the protection of the geo-political space of Belize as
defi ned by the Belize Constitution.

It integrates Belize’s major security policies, goals, responsibilities and actions into a cohesive whole.
It seeks to support the national effort to achieve and maintain a democratic, peaceful, prosperous and
stable Belizean society, which maintains human rights and provides the security conditions necessary
for social and economic development. The NSS is a catalyst to fulfi ll the National Security Vision of
Belize through the combined use of political, informational, social, economic
and security instruments of national power. Government Ministries,
Departments and Agencies should critically examine its directives and
conduct their own internal appraisals of implications on their roles
and confi gurations. Similarly, citizens and members of Civil Society
organizations should scrutinize it and take the necessary steps to contribute
to the accomplishment of the national security goals.

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

to support the NSS through the formulation of a variety of sector specifi c plans, including a National
Military Strategy and a National Policing Strategy.

###### National Interests

It is in Belize’s interest to continue educating its government offi cials on and to ensure all citizens
understand and support these core national values;

**Security**

- Territorial Integrity — Belize is a sovereign and independent nation and will earnestly defend its
territorial integrity in the face of external aggression. The outstanding Territorial Differendum
with Guatemala has moved away from being resolved using armed force in favour of bilateral
negotiations under the Organization of American States. This is now passing into history and, if
referendums in each country are in agreement, the matter will be placed before the International
Court of Justice or an international tribunal.

- The Belize Defence Force plays a key role in maintaining the physical integrity of the nation.
It is therefore in Belize’s interest to ensure that the Belize Defence Force is of an appropriate
size relative to its neighbours and is properly equipped to fulfi l its mission to ensure the physical
integrity of the nation. In broad terms, the Belize Defence Force should be large enough to
prevent a regional security vacuum and small enough to avoid alarming its neighbours. As part
of its regional commitments, Belize should also be able to articulate the purpose of its military
force as a moderate and positive force for cooperation in the region. Without security, there is
no stability or prosperity; therefore, there is a need for continued investment in security.

- Protecting the People – Defending Belizean citizens and visitors against
external and internal armed threats, including terrorism and local and transnational organised crime is a fundamental commitment of the Government.
Cooperation with international allies with interest in regional security and
stability will be required.

**Political**

- Rule of Law— At the institutional level, Belize must further
strengthen the Judiciary by ensuring its continued independence
and professionalism, including providing the resources necessary to
investigate and successfully prosecute all types of criminal activity.

National Security Vision **9**


-----

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

However, there must be respect for the law and individual law-abiding behaviour remains a key
component to national development. Through the consistent application of the law, respect for
the Rule of Law will be realised.

- Political Will— There is a need for the demonstrated credible intent of political actors to attack the
root causes of crime and corruption. This is a critical starting point for sustainable and effective
strategies and programs. It is essential to reform civil service, to strengthen transparency and
accountability, and to reinvent the relationship between government and private industry.

- Human Rights— It is important to reassess the responsibilities and rights of individuals as
efforts to combat crime and corruption in the society is strengthened. The protection of these
rights and freedoms are of immense importance both for the individuals affected and for the
development of Belizean society as a whole.

- Individual Freedoms— The Belizean state remains the primary guarantor of democracy, freedom,
and equal treatment of all Belizeans regardless of their ethnic background, gender, religion, and
political beliefs. Freedom to seek a life of peace and prosperity is the foundation of our national
interest.

- Good Governance – There is a need to restore faith in our institutions of government. Honesty,
transparency and accountability are the three pillars that will guide all government transactions.
We must not allow corruption to invade any level of government or society; this would only
erode citizens’ confi dence in our systems of justice and governance. There a need to recruit
competent and trained professionals who will serve with the highest level of integrity and ethical
conduct.

**Economic and Social**

- Public Health and Social Services— It is the duty of the State to provide a safety net for lower
income Belizeans; the provision of social service must be preserved and expanded. Medical
care and other services will continue to be available through the expanded NHI as part of the
government’s efforts to improve the quality of life of the people.

- Harmony— Belize is a multi-racial community of people living and working together in
harmony, and sharing common values and aspirations as a nation. Belize’s national interest lies
in ensuring that no group is marginalised and that every individual has an equal opportunity to
realize their potential.

National Security Vision **10**


-----

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

- Economic Freedom— A strong market-based economy free of corruption will enhance our
national security. Economic growth, supported by trade and free markets, creates employment,
improves income levels, and increases the standard of living of all Belizeans. It is in Belize’s
national interest for the state to promote economic growth through public sector support of
viable private sector economic activities. Self-reliant private sector participation remains crucial
to the medium and long term economic sustainability of the nation.

- Employment— we must implement measures to increase employment since poverty and
inequality breed crime, violence, and social unrest. According to a World Bank Study of
Labour Force Growth in the Caribbean region, Belize by the year 2020 will have one of the
highest average percentage increase per annum in the labour force. In the year 2000 it was
estimated at 82,000. By the year 2020 this will rise to 146,000 or a 2.9 percent rise per year.
For us to take advantage of this demographic bonus, we will have to continue to expand the
economic opportunities and improve our productivity and competitiveness in order to generate
enough jobs for our young population.

- International Debt, Investment, and Aid — because international investment requires stability,
Belize’s economic and security interests are inextricably linked. Belize therefore has a vital
interest in freeing itself of the burden of the current external debt. We must ensure that we
structure our debt repayments in such a way that they do not siphon away the money that is vital
to develop the country.

- Education—Belize must invest in its human capital through education. Eradicating illiteracy
and focusing investment in the education of children is crucial. Belize must also develop a
Future-Ready national curriculum including increased attention to science, math, engineering,
technology, innovation and entrepreneurship.

- Natural Resources — Belize’s future prosperity is inextricably linked to its natural resources
and assets. They include our oil reserves, agricultural capacity, archaeological heritage and
above all, our land and maritime areas. The proceeds of natural resources are for the benefi t of
all Belizeans.

- Immigration - Belize must formulate a long-term immigration policy. This will not only counter
the threat from the migration of Mareros from the Central American Region, but ensure that all
immigrants are integrated into Belizean society. There is also a need to raise the profi le of the
migration topic on the national agenda and the need to build the capacity of the Immigration and
Nationality Department. There is also a need for policies to limit the areas in which migrants
may be employed to protect the Belizean labour force. The importation of unregulated labour
also retards development because they overwhelm our social services which leads into a “race
for the bottom” with other developing countries.

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

###### The Strategy

 Introduction

This chapter outlines a plan of action to implement the
National Security Strategy (NSS). It focuses on prioritisation
of the national strategic goals and takes into consideration
the likely resources that will be required. In order for the
strategy to be effective, a multi-agency approach is required.
This strategy will ensure effective governance that addresses
national security, non-traditional threats, social and economic
issues and at the same time maximizing effi cient use of our
national resources. This vision is one of a secure Belize, with
its sovereignty and territorial integrity intact while maintaining
excellent relations with our regional and international partners.
This should result in a vibrant Belize with strong, sustainable economic development, prosperity, social
justice, and ethnic harmony. In this way, Belize will contribute to hemispheric security.

The National Security Goals (Ends), and the Concepts (Ways) and Capabilities (Means) that make up
the national security strategy provide the road map for achieving The National Security Vision.

###### Concepts and Required Capabilities

Resources available to Central Government are limited; therefore, pooling is required, and expenditure
prioritised to ensure the greatest positive impact on the national goals being pursued. To assist in
planning for the execution of this national security strategy, the identifi ed national goals are prioritsed
as to their perceived impact on the identifi ed security threats.

The Strategy **13**


-----

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

###### 1. Maintain the Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity of Belize

� **Strategic Concept:**

In order for Belize to guarantee its territorial integrity, it must continuously engage the international
community at the diplomatic level and seek security cooperation with its regional neighbours and other
friendly nations. In respect of the border dispute with Guatemala, the confi dence building measures
presently in place require expansion to include cultural and academic level exchanges. The mixed
commission should be the vehicle for further cooperation with Guatemala.

There should be continued efforts to accede to international treaties and agreements which aim to promote
and ensure international peace and security such as arms control, counter-terrorism, extradition and
mutual legal assistance treaties to enhance regional stability and facilitate law enforcement efforts. The
adoption and implementation of laws to counter illicit activities over Belize’s land, air and maritime
spaces need strengthening. Belize must maintain absolute administrative control of the common borders
with México and Guatemala.

To support this initiative there is a need to maintain modern, professional, balanced security forces that
are properly equipped, profi cient and technologically prepared to cooperate and contribute to national
and regional security. Belize should strive to infl uence regional and international policies on Belize and
to be a regional exemplar of good governance. Security cooperation and political agreements within the
Caribbean and Central America should be made to actively promote peace and regional stability.

� **Strategic Action:**

      - Continued diplomatic engagement regionally and internationally;

      - A public information campaign to advance Belize’s cause in selected countries and
multilateral fora;

      - Appropriately resourced professional development and training programs for Belize’s
Foreign Service personnel and members of the security forces;

      - Equipment to effectively manage and control Belize’s land, sea and air space;

      - Improved coordination of the intelligence gathering arms of the Security Forces in
disseminating their intelligence to an Intelligence Fusion Centre, to ensure better fl ow
of intelligence, nationally and regionally;

      - Develop a border management system.

      - A properly equipped, combat-ready BDF capable of deterring external attacks and
defusing internal threats to Belize;

The Strategy **14**


-----

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

###### 2. Reduce violent crime and dismantle local, cross-border, and trans-national criminal networks

� **Strategic Concept:**

Criminal activities undermine the social and
economic well-being of Belize. In order for Belize
to bring crime under control and dismantle criminal
networks, it needs to improve its intelligence
capabilities with improved manning, logistical
support, and information sharing with other
countries throughout the region. It also requires
better coordination of the intelligence gathering arms of the Security Forces in disseminating their
intelligence to an Intelligence Fusion Centre to ensure a better fl ow of intelligence. Addressing social
issues such as poverty, unemployment, education, and housing, will provide viable alternatives to
illegal activities. Actions that target criminals and their activities will have a serious effect on criminal
activity and revitalize the rule of law. Drug traffi cking represents the greatest threat from serious
and organized criminal networks because drugs offer suffi cient profi t at each stage of the trade. To
counteract the prevalence of drugs the strategy is fi ve-fold: promote demand reduction by sensitizing
our youths to the evils of drugs; eradicate local marijuana production; interdict drug smugglers who
use Belize as a transshipment point; go after the ill-gotten gains of those involved in illegal activity and
offer meaningful rehabilitation to those who abuse drugs.

� **Strategic Action:**

      - A properly resourced, properly
trained and motivated Police
Department that commands
respect and respects the human
rights of all citizens;

      - An enhanced CYDP and YFF
that provide viable alternatives
to criminal activity through
improved economic opportunities and social programs including rehabilitation focusing
on youths;

The Strategy **15**


-----

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

      - Develop a National Crime Control and Prevention Strategy to with cascaded policies,
action plans and targets;

      - People’s Coalition in every district to serve as a vehicle to solving local problems;

      - A Gang Violence Prevention Unit comprised of specially trained police and public
offi cers within the Police Department;

      - Public Information campaign to support police work and engender respect for the rule
of law;

      - Improved coordination of the intelligence gathering arms of the Security Forces in
disseminating their intelligence to an Intelligence Fusion Centre to ensure better fl ow
of intelligence, nationally and regionally.

      - A national communication network that enhances communication and information
technology systems between the security forces and law enforcement agencies;

      - A Cyber Crime Unit to develop enhanced policies, procedures, and enforcement
to detect and deter pornography, sexual exploitation, and related activities in cyber
space;

      - A multi-sector Asset Seizure Agency whose functions are to include civil recovery,
complex criminal confi scation and a national assets seizure strategy to seize the
ill-gotten assets of criminals;

      - A multi-sector Serious Crimes Unit to
dismantle criminal networks;

      - A drug demand reduction strategy and
a multi-sector approach to achieve
drug demand reduction and raise
public awareness of the negative,
unattractive aspects of the drug lifestyle
(deglamorize);

      - A National Identifi cation System
incorporating biometrics;

      - A Border Management System that covers all Ports of Entry;

      - A comprehensive database of criminal statistics to track patterns, measure effectiveness
of crime prevention techniques, and to increase operational success;

      - A crime pattern analysis GIS Database to track crime;

      - Strengthen existing and enact new legislation to address modern challenges in law
enforcement;

      - Modern Forensic Laboratory with a National Ballistics Identifi cation System and a
National DNA Identifi cation System;

The Strategy **16**


-----

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

      - A poverty elimination strategy that specifi cally targets marginalized communities on
the Southside of Belize City;

      - Develop and support initiatives to protect the rights of children to eliminate physical
and sexual exploitation of children;

      - A Witness Protection Program;

      - Develop a gun buyback program possibly administered by Crime Stoppers Belize;

      - Strengthen Canine (K-9) Unit for detection of fi rearms and explosives.

###### 3. Strengthen the criminal justice system and ensure respect for the Rule of Law

� **Strategic Concept:**

An independent judiciary is the cornerstone of the criminal justice system and serves as a guarantor of
individual freedoms and equal treatment of all Belizeans regardless of their ethnic background, gender,
religion, or political beliefs. The strengthening of the relationship between law enforcement agencies
and the Offi ce of the Director of Public Prosecution is essential. It is also necessary to improve the
investigative capabilities of law enforcement with a view to investigating and successfully prosecuting
illegal activity. This will foster public confi dence in the system and, at the level of the individual, respect
for and simple obedience to the law. These efforts require support through education programmes
directed at the youth.

� **Strategic Action:**

      - Develop a “Gun Court” to deal fairly and swiftly with crimes involving the possession
or use of guns and ammunition;

      - Establish a witness protection program;

      - Develop a National Ballistics Identifi cation System;

      - Enact a citizens charter to protect the rights of citizens;

      - Develop a victim support services unit in the Police Department;

      - Provide professional legal and investigative training to the Police Department;

      - Establish a Modern Forensic Laboratory with a National Ballistics Identifi cation System
and a National DNA Identifi cation System;

      - Encourage high levels of coordination between the BPD and the DPP;

      - Promote respect for the rule of law through a Public Awareness Campaign and
continuous education of the public;

The Strategy **17**


-----

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

      - Revise and enact legislation to address crime control;

      - Strengthen through training, understanding of the roles and responsibilities of statutory
bodies, for CEOs, and the executive to create an environment of transparent, accountable
and lawful decision making;

      - Modernize the Supreme and Magistrates Courts and court systems to take advantage of
effi ciencies of information technology.

###### 4. Protect Belize from Terrorism

� Strategic Concept:

Acts of terrorism would undoubtedly have a serious negative impact on the economy. A national
counter-terrorism strategy is necessary along with relevant legislation to improve our legal capabilities
to respond to this threat. The gathering and sharing of intelligence with regional and international
partners in the fi ght against terrorism assists in deterrence and consequently improves our preparedness
and response capabilities. The revision and strengthening of our Immigration and Customs laws to aid
in detection of possible threats at our entry points will improve security and reduce our vulnerability
to terrorism. Besides revising and strengthening laws, data management systems must be acquired to
improve security at our border points. Without a doubt, adequate equipment and human resources are
indispensable assets in the fi ght against terrorism.

� Strategic Action:

      - Develop a Counter Terrorism (CT)
Strategy;

      - Update CT legislation in accordance with existing international
instruments and standards;

      - Establish a CT Committee to
provide strategic guidance to the
NSC on appropriate tourism,
maritime, aviation, and cyber-security measures on how to combat terrorism;

      - Promote cooperation and information sharing between public and private sectors,
especially between fi nancial institutions and control authorities, with respect to
individuals, entities, and organizations that could be related to money laundering
activities and fi nancing of terrorist groups and/or activities;

The Strategy **18**


-----

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

      - Develop a properly resourced multidepartmental Counter Terrorism
Unit;

      - Enhance border and customs control
measures;

      - Develop a border management
system;

      - Promote technical standardized
training for immigration and customs
personnel;

      - Prevent the fraudulent use of
identifi cation and travel documents;

      - Enable border enforcement authorities to better enforce control laws without affecting s to better enforce control laws without affecting
the fl ow of commerce;

      - Improve vigilance and control, to prevent the passage of terrorists;

      - Improve coordination of the intelligence gathering arms of the Security Forces in
disseminating their intelligence to an Intelligence Fusion Centre to ensure better fl ow
of intelligence, nationally and regionally.

###### 5. Provide the necessary environment for a stable and vibrant economy

� Strategic Concept:

The concept is to enhance our national security through economic growth, supported by favourable
trading regimes that create new jobs, higher incomes, and improved economic opportunities that allow
people to raise themselves out of poverty. Promote growth and fi nancial independence through public
sector support of viable private sector economic activities. Vibrant private sector participation remains
critical for ensuring the economic sustainability of the nation. There is a need to seek international
assistance and debt relief to assure macroeconomic stability; re-establishing confi dence should translate
into lower mortgage and interest rates. The economy should be gradually steered away from the
export of primary products to value added products. There is a need to invest in the technological
infrastructure necessary to leapfrog the nation to a Digital Belize.

The Strategy **19**

      - An educated and technically competent workforce;

      - An Amnesty program coupled with a new Immigration policy.

###### 6. Strengthen the institutions of democratic governance

� Strategic Concept:

Transparency and accountability are key to good governance. Political, fi nancial and legal reforms that
involve the participation of the wider Belizean population, civil society and the business community
will create an atmosphere of confi dence in government affairs. The use of information technology, that
is accessible to the public and business community in routine government procedures, will facilitate
effi ciency and promote good governance.

� Strategic Action:

      - Revised Freedom of Information Act;

      - Public Senate hearings on corruption and mismanagement by public offi cials;

      - Constructive input from Civil Society and the Private Sector;

bodies, for CEOs, and the executive to create an environment of transparent, accountable
and lawful decision making;

      - Modernize the Supreme and Magistrates Courts and court systems to take advantage of
effi ciencies of information technology.

###### 7. Improve delivery of healthcare at all levels and reduce the impact of health related threats

� Strategic Concept:

Providing access to modern, effi cient, and affordable healthcare is the duty of the state. The physical
health of the Belizean people is an indispensable element for the immediate, medium and long-term
development of the country. Nationwide access to primary medical care and specialist care provide the
foundation for a modern, national healthcare system.

Preventable health threats such as malnutrition, obesity and endemic diseases such as malaria, diabetes
and dengue lead to premature deaths and affect the productivity of the Belizean people. This may
require a comprehensive review of national surveillance and vector control capacity in order to mitigate
existing and emerging health threats. The country must develop a cadre of rapid responders beyond just
mass casualty approaches as well as enhance its mass casualty response capacity to be in a position to
manage potentially devastating pandemic health threats such as HIV/AIDS and the Avian Flu.

The focus will be on wellness, preventive health services, early childhood nutrition and immunization,
more and better equipped rural clinics, public health education, and the removal of GST from medical
service and medications currently subject to tax. Government will need to expand support for Belize’s
health care system in general including the Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital and upgrade facilities at
all regional hospitals to provide all basic testing and primary care services. The preventive health care
needs of every child will be addressed, and a national school feeding program will be introduced at the
primary level in partnership with the private and social sectors.

The Strategy **21**


-----

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

� Strategic Action:

      - Develop a national wellness revolution addressing major preventable lifestyle diseases
plaguing Belize (diabetes, hypertension, obesity);

      - Improve and enforce public health legislation;

      - Enhance strategic alliances with the private sector and NGOs;

      - Legislation governing medical practice outlining the rights and responsibilities of

healthcare countrywide, emphasizing wellness and primary care;

      - Legislate occupational health and safety standards at the work place;

      - Develop a Department of Mental Health Care within the Ministry of Health. Acute
mental health centers and support systems for families of affected persons will be
established at all regional hospitals;

      - Provide Oncology and dialysis treatment facilities at the KHMH;

      - National training scheme to train the general health care providers as priority not just
the specialist;

      - A proper retention policy must be developed and a review of conditions of service must
be done to ensure quality personnel remain in the health care system;

      - Establish appropriate incentives to attract and retain professionals;

      - Develop sustainable partnerships with NGOs, regional and international agencies for
specialist treatment and training;

      - Develop sustainable mechanisms and international partnerships for response and
mitigation of pandemics;

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

###### 8. Reduce the risks associated with rapid and slow-onset of natural and human-caused hazards

� Strategic Concept:

Natural or man-made disasters are complex, potentially deadly events that often occur with little
warning. Comprehensive Disaster Management (CDM), addressing all hazards at all times involving
all sectors of the society is the key to mitigating known and probable non-traditional threats such
as human-caused disasters. Existing emergency action plans developed by the twelve (12) National
Operational Committees must be refi ned and cross-fertilized with the District and Special Committees
plan of action. These could include the implementation of a national alert or warning system, the
promotion of Disaster Mitigation awareness through schools, key private and public sector stakeholders,
and the promotion of legislation to allow the participation of lending institutions in the development of
infrastructure to contribute to the mitigation of natural hazards. There is a need for the strengthening
of NEMO’s capacity and enabling its strategic authority to infl uence sustainable development and
natural resource management through analysis and prediction of disasters thereby reducing the risk of
disasters for vulnerable communities.

� Strategic Action:

      - Develop centralized information database centre to enable precise damage assessment
and needs analysis processing;

      - National authority to infl uence infrastructure development that enforces disaster
resistant construction regulation;

      - Refi ned Mass casualty treatment plans;

      - Enhance national building codes legislation to increase hazard resistant development;

      - Enforce pollution and oil spills legislations. Hold stakeholders responsible to quick
action, mitigation, and resource the agencies to clean up pollution;

      - Amend and enforce the EIA related legislation;

      - Secure highly trained medical, security, and operational planning personnel;

      - Public education and awareness campaign on the importance of mitigation and the
effects of rapid and slow onset hazards namely Hurricanes, Floods and Fires.

The Strategy **23**

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

###### 9. Improve and expand nationwide access to education up to the tertiary level

� Strategic Concept:

The Government of Belize’s vision for education is grounded in three basic principles:

- **_Education for Self: Education must prepare each child to be the best he/she can be to create_**
meaningful and happy lives;

- **_Education for the Strength of the Nation (The Common Good): Education must prepare all_**
Belizeans to enter, participate and contribute ethically to an economically strong, socially rich,
culturally proud, politically just societ; and

- **_Education for Life and Change: In a changing world, we must provide opportunities for life-long_**
learning no matter why or when a person left formal schooling. We are never too old to learn or
too old to start. Belizeans of all ages must enjoy educational opportunities as we create a country
founded on the intelligence and education of its greatest assets, the people who are ready, willing
and able to lead and confront changes in our world.

The barriers to realizing this vision are many. The direct and indirect costs of education hinder access
to education at all levels. It also impacts the provision of suffi cient human and material resources.
This combined with inadequate quality and lack of relevance of education undermines the effectiveness
of the system to produce productive citizens able to contribute to the development of our society.

To overcome these barriers the following strategic action have been defi ned:

� Strategic Action:

**Start Strong: Ensure Every Child Starts School Ready to Learn**

      - Create and provide access to high-quality preschool programs designed to prepare

children for primary school. The fi rst target in achieving this goal will be to expand

access by attaching preschools to primary schools, especially in disadvantaged areas.

      - Ensure that the preventative health care needs of every child are addressed through

school immunization programmes.

      - Introduce a National School Feeding Program at the primary school level in partnership

with the private and social sectors.

The Strategy **24**


-----

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

**Build Stamina: Get and Keep Young People in Schools for More Years of Learning**

  - Expand mandatory education to include secondary as well as primary levels with the
introduction of 10 years of compulsory education for all.

  - Provide a direct annual subsidy of $300.00 per student to qualifying fi rst and second
form students at enrollment to offset the high cost of school fees, in addition to the free
tuition policy instituted by the UDP in 1993.

  - Establish First and Second Forms as extensions of rural primary schools to give the
rural population more education with less travel

  - Standardize a core high school curriculum with vocational and technical options.

  - Standardize high school textbooks and cycle usage for a minimum of 3 years.

  - Allocate public funding to schools equitably by funding schools on a per-student
basis.

  - Provide basic literacy, numeracy and continuing education opportunities for both adults
and youths who have left the formal system.

**Raise the Bar: Put a New Focus on Standards**

  - Foster full competence in English, Mathematics, Spanish, and the Physical and Social
Sciences for all students.

  - Subsidize the cost of CXC Examinations (CCSLC and CSEC) to ensure that all students
are able to take the exams at least in core areas.

  - Create National Education Performance Standards and direct resources to underresourced, underperforming schools to enable them to meet standards.

  - Position remedial teachers throughout the school system to assist students in danger of
failing.

  - Support the development of after-school programmes to assist with homework, learning
diffi culties and provide healthy forms of recreation in arts, culture and sports.

  - Activate the National Accreditation Council.

  - Encourage the private and public sectors to support on-the-job training programmes and
foster private sector grants, scholarships or other funding of tertiary level education.

  - Expand courses at vocational and technical institutions, in partnership with the
private sector, to develop a skilled labour force to meet the changing needs of new
industries.

The Strategy **25**


-----

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

**Teach the Teacher: Invest in Teacher Education and Professional Development**

      - Provide fi nancial incentives for teachers to acquire professional qualifi cations.

      - Encourage the provision of targeted Professional Development/In-Service Training for
teachers by tertiary level institutions and other private providers.

      - Establish a Continued Professional Development Fund for teachers to access loans for
continued professional development.

###### 10. Protect Belize’s natural resources

� Strategic Concept:

Belize must preserve its rich natural resources by enacting, strengthening, and enforcing legislation and
implementing programs that promote the sustainable use and conservation of Belize’s natural resources
while supporting the country’s development goals. By promoting awareness on environmental issues
early in the Education Curriculum, Belizeans will gain a greater appreciation for the near pristine
environment that characterizes Belize. Strengthening our engagement with international partners and
our involvement in international efforts to manage the natural resources is equally critical and should
be encouraged and supported at all levels to complement national development efforts.

� Strategic Action:

      - Support the development of the National Protected Areas Commission and support the
implementation of the National Land Use Plan and the National Protected Areas Policy

      - Strengthen and enforce the EPA and EIA related legislation;

      - Provide research and development technology for management of Belize’s natural
resources.

###### 11. Achieve Food and Energy Security

� Strategic Concept:

The high cost of food, fuel, electricity, water, and telephone
services is a major obstacle to economic development. Promote
incentives for enterprise within these sectors by subsidizing
and granting concessions and establishing partnerships with
international agencies for technological training and expertise
to maximize success. Utility providers must not stand in the
way of competitors willing and able to provide lower cost
service by means of the new technology that is readily available throughout the world. In the long term, ble throughout the world In the long term
a self-reliant, sustainable society is critical for economic stability and prosperity. The economy should
be geared to production and manufacturing for subsistence and export.

**National Security Strategy of Belize**

###### Execution and Monitoring Programmes

 Introduction

Pressured by the immediacy of today’s concerns, government ministries and agencies often focus on
current issues at the expense of strategic long-term thinking. Without a long-term view, policy makers
lack the strategic perspective needed to achieve the goals of this vision. The absence of an institutionalised
process for long-range national security planning results in a structural strategic disadvantage.

###### Overarching Issues

Achieving the Belize vision requires adopting strategic concepts and action plans that have a high
probability of success while at the same time minimising risk of failure. Recognising that constrained
resources require the development of innovative strategies and action plans that maximise the use of
resources and look for synergies, ministries must develop strategic concepts and actions plans that are
suitable, feasible and acceptable. A suitable concept or action plan addresses the root causes of the
problem, identifi es the threats and challenges, and establishes the conditions necessary to achieve the
desired goal. To be feasible the strategic concept or action plan must have the necessary means or
resources available for execution. The plan is acceptable when its execution costs are justifi ed by the
importance or benefi ts of the goal. By striking a balance between benefi ts, the probability of success
and the associated costs, risk can be minimised.

With such plans in hand, the government will have the necessary information to carefully prioritise and
allocate resources in a rational manner.

###### Periodic Strategy Reviews

Recognizing that the security environment is dynamic and requires periodic adjustments in the allocation
of resources, regular periodic reviews of the strategy and resource prioritisations need to occur to
ensure we attain the national security goals of Belize.

###### National Security Architecture

To reduce risk and achieve this vision, Belize requires an integrated national security architecture
that develops policy, coordinates action plans, monitors execution, reviews progress and maintains a
long-term perspective. Achieving these capabilities requires a redesign of the current national security
architecture so that it provides long-range planning, coordination between cabinet ministers and their
agencies and monitoring of security programs. Achieving this capability can be the difference between
success and failure of the national security strategy.

A strengthened National Security Council Secretariat with adequate staff dedicated to enabling the
development of strategic policy objectives is required to fulfi ll its original purpose. They need the
capability to translate such objectives into executable initiatives resourced according to their strategic
priority is essential to achieving this vision.

###### Conclusion

Belize is the product of a particular set of historical, geographical and geopolitical circumstances that
have combined to create a dynamic and progressive nation. However, because of the complex nature of
the international system in which Belize participates, Belize faces a number of challenges that defy its
sovereignty and the way of the life that the Belizean people aspire to achieve. Based on an identifi cation
of a number of fundamental national interests, the NSS exercise has identifi ed eleven national security
goals which, if achieved, should mitigate some of the most serious challenges facing Belize today.

Some of the challenges present themselves in traditional forms easily recognizable by leaders of centuries
past. However, the contemporary, interdependent international system also offers a myriad of complex
non-traditional challenges that require not only seamless interagency cooperation but also a high degree
of coordination and cooperation with other states as well as IGOs, and local and international NGOs.

This NSS points to specifi c issues of concern and the lead agencies charged with developing more
focused, sector-specifi c plans for confronting these challenges. There is an urgent need to improve
coordination of the intelligence gathering arms of the Security Forces in disseminating their intelligence
to ensure better fl ow, nationally and regionally. The National Security Council Secretariat should then
receive timely and comprehensive analysis of a variety of possible traditional and non-traditional
threats. In this way, the NSCS shall be able to formulate comprehensive long-term policies that ensure
that Belize achieves the level of development that its people desire.

The underlying message of the NSS is that National Security is everyone’s business and all Belizeans
must play a part in maintaining the country’s national security. All Government ministries, departments
and agencies should critically examine their policies and directives and conduct their own internal
assessment of the implications of their roles and structures. Individual citizens, the private sector and
members of civil society groups are compelled to join in this process of transformation and take the
necessary steps to contribute to the achievement of the national security goals and a safer Belize.
