FOREWORD

![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)

The last decade of the 20th century was characterised by unprecedented change in ideologies, cultural, moral and ethic values, economic and social systems and attitudes of generations which grew up in a different social environment.

This radical transformation led to significant changes in the national security concepts, the nature, purpose, development and use of Armed Forces in Europe and the rest of the world. The logical advance of globalisation after the end of the Cold War has been accompanied by problems but also by a very positive trend - it has made it futile to conquer territories and has thus ruled out the reasons for a global military conflict, and therefore the need to keep large armies, trained for large-scale strategic operations with heavy weapons and considerable material and human resources.

The democratisation of society expanded to embrace the information area and provided the public with previously inaccessible information on national security and defence. The Republic of Bulgaria and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have reclaimed their place in the European family of shared moral and cultural values, spiritual, economic and social interests. These circumstances have made it possible to publish the first ever White Paper on Defence in Bulgaria. It is a strong confirmation of the irreversibility of the social and political processes and resolute changes in a conservative area such as the area of defence and the Armed Forces.

The preparation of the publication of the White Paper started in 2000 when the general parametres of defence and Armed Forces were outlined. It was accompanied by an active public debate on the Armed Forces' role and place in modern society.

The contents of the White Paper emerged as a result of in-depth public discussions on defence issues aimed at presenting society and the international community with a vision, widely shared by the public, on the nature of national defence and the role of the Armed Forces therein. The purpose of the White Paper is to present policy directions and main parametres of the defence and Armed Forces system. We have tried to reveal the nature of the strategic environment and the context in which the Armed Forces reform is taking place, to outline the prospects for their development in the foreseeable future and to show how the different components of the Armed Forces perform tasks related to the defence of national sovereignty, and contribute towards enhancing regional and European security.

The White Paper also provides the public and our international partners with reliable information on the state of defence and the Armed Forces, and is an official source of detailed data serving institutions, academic and non-governmental organisations and associations. It is necessary to emphasize that some specific areas in the military sphere have been presented in rather general terms because they are still being studied, developed and defined. 

The White Paper focuses on the main functions, missions and tasks of the Armed Forces and the military reform which aims at building the Armed Forces of the 21st century, capable of meeting the high demands of the common European security system, the new, non-traditional challenges to national security and the new type of civil-military relations as a manifestation of the Armed Forces' integration in society.

The present White Paper is also an expression of the government's policy favouring increasing openness and transparency of defence and Armed Forces related activities, but it is only the beginning of a public debate in this area. For this reason the Ministry of Defence would welcome any intellectual contributions to these important social functions.

We hope that civil society with its sensitivity towards the problems facing our dynamic century will feel satisfied for having learned more about this previously closed area of social relations and will provide a sufficient contribution to guaranteeing the military aspect of national security of the Republic of Bulgaria.

OF THE Stan GENORA
THE REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 21ST CENTURY The state leadership formulates and carries out the policy of the country in accordance with

![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png) the strategic priorities, goals and interests. The security and defence policy is an instrument for materialising Bulgarias active position on a regional, European and global scale. It takes into account the changes in the strategic environment, the dynamics of the processes in the political, economic, military, social, and information spheres, the increasing interdependence, and at the same time, differentiation on a global scale. The Republic of Bulgaria's security policy is founded on the principles of equality and mutual recognition of interests, co-operation and integration. 

CHAPTER ONE

## 1.1. National Interests And Integration Processes

![9_Image_1.Png](9_Image_1.Png)

The Bulgarian national values and interests are the basic criteria in the formulation and implementation of the overall state policy. The state guarantees its security as it achieves its national interests, goals and priorities. National interests can be integrated into certain categories as follows: independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; democracy, human rights, and rule of law; sustainable ecenomic development and prosperity; international peace and security.

Bulgaria pursues and protects its national interests in conformity with the universal human values, principles of international law and justice. Asserting Bulgarias role as a key political factor and stability generator in South Eastern Europe, as an economic and infrastructural centre, with an advanced scientific and technological potential is of a primary importance for the national security.

The processes of political, economic and cultural integration have been expanding. Parallel to that, a new generation of challenges emerges extending the scope of capabilities and measures for their overcoming. That's why, having in mind the existing risk environment and the variety of geostrategic,

![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png) geopolitical and geoeconomic factors affecting it, the Republic of Bulgaria has to be ready not only to respond adequately to challenges, but also to be pro-active in shaping the environment in accordance with its national interests and the interests it shares with the international community.

12 This implies the combination of measures aimed at actively shaping a favourable environment, management of crises of various nature, sharing the responsibility for strengthening peace and security as well as preparation to meet future risks and challenges. The Republic of Bulgaria perceives its national security in a direct relation with regional and European security. Therefore the accession to the European Union and NATO and the stabilisation of South Eastern Europe is of a national, regional and European interest. The aspiration of the states to identify and develop their relations in areas of common interests has brought about remarkable dynamics in building communities of states, organisations, values and interests. 

## 1.2. The Security Environment 1.2.1. The Dynamics Of Security Factors

The profound changes in the strategic environment affect all its aspects. The new realities and tendencies introduce considerable dynamics in the international situation but also open up new opportunities for countries. The military aspect of security acquires new dimensions and the intensity of challenges and risks formerly defined as "non-traditional" presupposes a

![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)

quest for non-traditional solutions to prevent, neutralise and overcome them.

![11_image_1.png](11_image_1.png) The diminishing risk of a global conflict and the increasing number of ethnic and religious conflicts, as well as the integration tendencies, on the one hand, and the nation state with its sovereignty, system of bodies, powers and interests, on the other, outline the potential framework for interaction among the actors on the international stage at the beginning of the 21-st century. The traditional North-South opposition, the introduction of new technologies as well as the establishment of a global information area raise issues, the solution of which lies beyond the powers and abilities of single governments and states. A number of transnational economic, financial, cultural community interests become security factors as well.

They have various, including international, dimensions and transcend the limits of nation state and society. An ever-growing role is attributed to non-state factors in international relations as well as to challenges of non-state origin.

The universal approach to security based not only on defence capabilities but mainly on political, economic, financial, information, and technological capacities opens new perspectives for guaranteeing national security and interests. Whereas organisations such as the UN and OSCE remain important, the role and contribution of NATO and the EU to crisis management and resolution of global and regional problems increases. The intensive development of the international system demands a transformation of the existing organisations so as they successfully adapt to changes and remain effective in influencing the ongoing processes.

NATO's functions as a basic source of security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area have been increasing. The main tasks of the Alliance are related to the consolidation of the community of states and values and the establishment of a flexible security architecture, where the Alliance and other international organisations complement one another in order to guarantee the security in the Euro-Atlantic area and worldwide.

The European Union's determination to add military dimensions to its political and economic might is an indisputable security factor. The evolution of the EUs Common Foreign Policy and the development of the Common Security and Defence Policy and the mechanisms and potential necessary for the enhancement of integration in the economic sphere and the internal aspects of security present the candidate countries with new opportunities for practical involvement in the establishment of common European security.

.2.2. Factors Guaranteeing the Sustainable Development of Society

![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png) The changes that have taken place in the strategic environment have transformed the nature of challenges, risks and threats to the security of the Republic of Bulgaria. Their analysis leads

14 The combination of political will and real capabilities transforms the United States into a particularly important global factor. The growing role of Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain and other European states, whose joint initiatives and efforts support the European integration and stability and security on the continent, is an important prerequisite for the security in Europe and worldwide. Russia's political, economic, demographic and natural resources and potential determine its significant role in the global security system that is under construction. China will also play an increasingly global role as it has the potential necessary to conduct an independent and active policy in pursuit of its national interests. Potential nuclear powers as well as states and organisations that possess weapons for mass destruction and technologies for their production are also factors in the international system.
to the conclusion that at present, as well as in the foreseeable future, there is no direct military threat to Bulgaria. The military aspects of the strategic environment have acquired new dimensions mainly due to the political changes in the world and throughout Europe. The decrease in national military potentials, the arms reduction and the strengthening of the confidence building worldwide are additional prerequisites for the establishment of the new security system. Co-operation among the Armed Forces and national security system components is being enhanced.

From a political point of view, the processes of confidence building and enhancement of cooperation in all areas, aimed at finding new approaches to solving emerging problems, are of primary importance in shaping the strategic environment.

In a broader context, the globalisation processes, the reduction of large-scale military confrontation risk world- and Europe-wide, and the development of the integration processes are factors that present

![13_image_1.png](13_image_1.png) favourable opportunities for the Republic of Bulgaria. In the 21st century the leading security guarantee factor will be the broad international co-operation in the political, economic, military, legal, information, ecological and other spheres. National interests are affected strongly by the construction of a trans-continental energy, transport and communication infrastructure crossing the territory of our country and connecting Europe with Asia and Africa. An important role in neutralising risk factors is played by the reinforcement of the principles of democracy and market economy in the states of the region, the transparency in their policy, including their military policy, the security, stability and co-operation initiatives in South Eastern Europe, the accession to the European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Regional stabilisation and other processes are increasingly affected by the opening of the region to global markets and incorporation into present European and transcontinental links. The sustainable development and economic growth of countries in transition is an important premise for the prevention of internal crises and the maintenance of the necessary national security and defence potential.

Regional and global tendencies and processes are also positively influenced by the multinational character of the actions against security risks and threats, the advance of technologies, the formation of a global information society, the enlargement of the international network of non-governmental contacts.

## 1.2.3. Prerequisites For Insecurity

Regardless of the positive trends in the development of global, European and regional processes, there are factors that generate potential or real security risks as well as factors that have both positive and negative impact. In the new strategic environment the importance of traditional security risks and threats has declined. A considerable role is played by non-traditional challenges such as the illegal proliferation of arms and technologies for their production, international terrorism, organised crime as a serious risk factor with social and political implications for the consolidating market economies in South Eastern Europe, ethno-religious and cultural confrontation and extremism, illegal trafficking of people and drugs, biological and chemical threats, ecological risks, natural disasters, major industrial accidents, etc. The transnational nature of most of these challenges requires the application of common approaches and joint actions for their neutralisation. The social-political environment in some countries, e.g. weak civil society's structures, disrespect for fundamental human rights and freedoms, state functioning failure, etc., is also a factor that poses potential risks to international and regional security.

The radicalisation of the objectives of criminal groups as well as the availability of huge quantities of uncontrolled arms are serious challenges to the effectiveness of national security systems. Though not to similar extents as in other parts of the world, the extension of the ties between international terrorism and regional organised crime could lead to a rise in national security risks.

Information provision and infrastructure have been increasingly important. However, the advance of modern technology creates prerequisites for breaking into, manipulation and destruction of information systems and data bases in an attempt to disrupt the functioning of certain social and economic spheres. The broadening and deepening of globalisation processes create both opportunities and challenges to national economies and societies. Economic differences in Europe and the world, the uneven availability of resources and accessibility of technology are a source of tension that has practical consequences for the security of the countries, including the Republic of Bulgaria. The demographic aspect of security as well as its ethno-cultural dimensions will also be of a growing importance in the years to come.

The regional strategic environment is also influenced by the situation in the Middle East and the Mediterranean, the Caucasus and Central Asia and certain parts of Africa. The generation of instability in these regions has a wide international impact due to their unique place in the global security system and the presence of strategically important routes and assets. As a whole, Bulgaria will continue to pursue its national interests in a complex regional and global environment. The integration of the Republic of Bulgaria into NATO and the EU and its further development as a politically stable and economically prosperous country with an active contribution to the European and regional co-operation will be crucial for the better protection of national interests and the guaranteeing of national security.

## 1.3. Security And Defence Policy And The Challenges Of The Risk Environment

The changed strategic environment, the new wave in world politics and the new challenges demand a new assessment and approach to problems as well as the adoption of an active stance in conformity with the political priorities, the strategic environment and national

![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png)

resources in accordance with the Constitution and the legislation of the country as well as

![15_image_1.png](15_image_1.png) the commitments deriving from international law and agreements and treaties that Bulgaria is a party to.

National security is a dynamic system and structurally it consists of different interlinked elements - political, economic, military, ecological, intellectual, information, social, etc. Being an element of security policy, the defence policy aims at ensuring the defence potential necessary for neutralising military threats and for the credible defence of the state's territorial integrity and sovereignty, of the population and the infrastructure as well as at facilitating the establishment of a favourable environment for the execution of this main task, rapid and adequate reaction to existing challenges and continuous training for future tasks on guaranteeing security.

Bulgaria's defence is a responsibility both of the state and of the society and the citizens. The goals of the defence policy of the Republic of Bulgaria are achieved by optimal utilisation of national resources, bilateral and multilateral co-operation. The principle of peaceful settlement of national security issues is fundamental for Bulgarian policy, as well as for the new, enlarged European and Euro-Atlantic security architecture that is under construction. Bulgaria takes into account the significance of the fact that at the present stage of human development collective security and defence measures come to the forefront and this calls for a large-scale and at the same time a very detailed alignment of criteria and approaches with the international standards. Bulgaria has proven its readiness to share the responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security. The involvement in bilateral, regional and international initiatives provides a broad spectrum of alternatives to achieve national interests and an effective way to influence the processes and tendencies in modern politics and provides the opportunity to participate in the process of decision-taking on issues of common interest. New forms of military co-operation and integration, new approaches in the Armed Forces 18

![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png)

build-up, the establishment of the principles of political governance and democratic control over them have an ever-growing importance. Transparency, openness and public debate on national security and defence issues have an increasing role in the process of formulating, implementing and assessing the policy in this sphere.

The objectives and priorities of the security and defence policy are achieved through building optimal defence capabilities, co-operation and integration.

## Defence Capabilities

The Armed Forces guarantee the sovereignty, security and independence of the country and defend its territorial integrity. The new challenges of the strategic environment, the dynamics of relations among the structural elements of the security system, as well as the overall transformation in the Bulgarian society, are the basic premises for changes in the Armed Forces which have to be capable of carrying out a wide spectrum of tasks in accordance with the increasing requirements to them. The Republic of Bulgaria builds up its defence concept and develops its defence capabilities in line with the nature of the potential sources of tension, the international legal commitments and integration trends. The reform in the defence system is one of the key elements of the new security policy of the Republic of Bulgaria. Its aim is to build and maintain defence capabilities for an effective execution of missions and tasks as defined in the main security and defence related documents and in accordance with the changes in the militarystrategic environment, the financial, economic and demographic potential of the country, as well as the need to accelerate the achievement of a high level of interoperability. As a result of the reform Bulgaria will have a defence potential that is adequate to the needs and to reality, with a clear military-political perspective, an effective management and integrated planning, a reliable early warning and rapid reaction system, a high level of mobility and motivation, a modern management system. The Armed Forces will have personnel and organisation allowing them to effectively discharge their national defence functions and be an equal partner in international peace support efforts. The defence and the Armed Forces as its main guarantee are sustained by integrating the basic principles and provisions of security and defence related documents with a credible, resource-provided defence planning system and a transparent decision making process. Our future efforts will be channeled in the following areas: finalising the reorganisation of the main components of the defence system and building military-strategic and resource-assured Armed Forces; developing an integrated civil-military defence management model; meeting the requirements of the basic NATO membership criteria, providing the conditions necessary for the functional integration of the country in the Alliance's political and command structures and achieving interoperability with the Armed Forces of the member states; development of the logistics and medical and financial procurement systems; priority utilisation of the resources released in the restructuring to improve the quality of life, combat training and interoperability. Realisation of these priorities, as well as of the overall military reform concept, will lead to a gradual and continuous increase of defence capabilities of the troops and forces in accordance with the whole spectrum of missions and tasks likely to be imposed by the modern challenges.

The build-up of optimal defence capabilities is a multifaceted process that needs broad public support and dialogue and should involve military as well as civilian resources. It also includes maintaining the security system ready to respond adequately to current challenges and safeguard national interests including in times of internal or international crisis. This entails the availability of an effective system for early warning, consultations and decisionmaking, uniformity of action among institutions, and the military and civilian components of the system, and an effective interaction with the international community. The adaptability and flexibility in institutionalising co-operation is a necessary element of the overall crisis management strategy.

## Co-Operation

![17_Image_1.Png](17_Image_1.Png)

The prevention and settlement of some of the present-day challenges can be achieved by reinforcing national political and social-economic systems. And yet, there are challenges that can only be overcome by the joint efforts of countries united by shared values, interests and criteria. Co-operation as one of the basic instruments for guaranteeing the national security is a crucial factor in the process of consolidation of a new political philosophy in the relations among countries. The relations between the Republic

![17_image_0.png](17_image_0.png)

20

![18_image_0.png](18_image_0.png)

of Bulgaria and the other countries and international organisations are based on the national interests and main foreign policy priorities of the country. The dynamics is in line with the trends and processes in the geostrategic environment, and the mechanism is bilateral, regional and international co-operation.

The Republic of Bulgaria values highly the co-operation opportunities existing within different international organisations, mostly the United Nations as the only global organisation with universal functions. Bulgaria embraces the understanding about the common responsibility of all states to prevent, restrict and resolve crises and conflicts and contributes to a number of UN missions and operations. Bulgaria is an active participant in the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe as a broad political forum for preventive diplomacy, dialogue, consultations and confidence building; in the Council of Europe as an organisation of a unique geographic and subject spectrum, as well as in the other organizations that it is a member of.

Bulgaria defines its accession to NATO and the European Union as a strategic goal that corresponds to the long-term interests of the country. Therefore, Bulgaria considers its partnership with NATO and EU member-states as a strategic one.

Bulgaria's balanced and pragmatic regional policy aims at establishing lasting peace and stability in South Eastern Europe and reaffirming Bulgaria as a key factor on the Balkans, as a source of security and stability. It is the most important element of the strategy for preventive defence of Bulgarian interests. This is why Bulgaria will continue to generate security and contribute to the common efforts to strengthening stability on the Balkans by initiating and supporting regional efforts for confidence building in the political and military areas, enhancing co-operation, containing non-traditional security risks, accelerating the economic development of the region, and establishing the country's role as an infrastructure and energy centre in South Eastern Europe. The political will of the countries in the region to co-operate in identifying and settling of potential and existing common national security challenges serves as a foundation for the

![19_image_0.png](19_image_0.png)

establishment of a number of regional networks and communities aimed at enhancing stability and security in South Eastern Europe and promoting the principles of openness and transparency in relations between states. The active regional co-operation is demonstrated in implementing and enhancing a number of initiatives that help overcome the region's negative image and provide real opportunities for a better coordination and constructiveness in addressing common problems. Hence we give priority to: Bulgaria's membership in the UN Security Council in 2002-2003; Our preparation to assume the presidency of the OSCE in 2003; NATO's South East Europe Initiative as a mechanism for strengthening stability in the region; The South Eastern European Defence Ministerial Process as a forum for consultations and joint planning that is firmly bound to the region's Euro-Atlantic integration, as well as its particular initiatives:
The Multinational Peace Force South Eastern Europe and the Engineer Task Force; The Crisis Response Information Network; The Civil Military Emergency Planning Council; The Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe as a forum where Bulgaria can share its experience with willing countries, etc.

The comprehensive regional co-operation however cannot and should not replace the European and Euro-Atlantic integration of the countries.

## Integration

![19_Image_1.Png](19_Image_1.Png)

Bulgaria considers its security an integral part of the common European security. Therefore, membership in NATO and the European Union are the strategic objectives of the overall policy of the country. Integration into the European and Euro-Atlantic structures is a major guarantee of Bulgaria's national security, and of the regional and European security. Accession to NATO and the European Union is an immediate interest and priority that is widely recognised by the Bulgarian society and confirmed by the political forces. (Figure 1)

![20_image_1.png](20_image_1.png)

In the pre-accession period the country will continue to contribute actively, and make best use of the mechanisms available through the existing programmes and initiatives - Partnership for Peace, Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, including the working group on South Eastern Europe, the Membership Action Plan, the Planning and Review Process, the Individual Partnership Programme, as well as such that may ensue from our status as a country

![21_image_0.png](21_image_0.png)

negotiating for membership in the European Union. Our accession to NATO and the European Union supports the common security efforts. The indivisibility of European security is a major imperative which outlines the overall policy trends. Bulgaria considers the enlargement of the European and Euro-Atlantic structures as a matter of mutual interest. The collective approach to security is the most reliable tool for its guarantee. In this context Bulgaria has repeatedly proven its Euro-Atlantic solidarity, its willingness and ability to share the responsibility for collective security and defence.

The Republic of Bulgaria appreciates the open approach to security adopted by NATO and the European Union. Taking into account the processes of internal transformation in the European and Euro-Atlantic structures and the changes on a national level Bulgaria will continue to contribute to the joint efforts both in the pre- and post-accession period.

Full membership in NATO and the European Union demands complex efforts in various fields. At the political-military level the activities related to Bulgaria's preparation for NATO membership include: Intensive individual dialogue with NATO; Adaptation of national structures and procedures in conformity with NATO standards and requirements taking into account national specifics; Improving the interoperability of the Armed Forces with those of the NATO member states so as to be able to cooperate effectively in joint multi-national operations under Allied command; Participation, in conformity with the provisions of the Constitution, in peace support operations under a United Nations or OSCE mandate, or in co-operation with the European Union; Bilateral agreements for scientific and military-economic co-operation with NATO member and aspirant states; Active information policy and strategy promoting Bulgarian candidacy for NATO membership in political circles and the public in Bulgaria and the Alliance member states.

The preparation for NATO accession is based on an established and functioning mechanism for planning, coordinating and overseeing the implementation of the activities related to the country's efforts for more intensive co-operation with, and integration into, the Alliance, and on the existing operational and flexible mechanisms for interdepartmental interaction. A special emphasis is placed on civil-military relations and democratic control over the Armed Forces, improvement of the legal framework, reinforcement of the planning and programming principle, expansion and improvement of training, aligning national crisis management mechanisms, procedures and structures with those of the NATO member states. Bulgaria's relations with the European Union are conducted on the basis of an active and targeted political and expert dialogue that is a serious step on the way to membership and is an important factor for the development of regional co-operation in South Eastern Europe and the Black Sea area. The decision to

![21_image_1.png](21_image_1.png)

24

![22_image_0.png](22_image_0.png)

constitute a EU military capacity and the establishment of the respective military and political bodies is the first decisive step in building capabilities for carrying out the full spectrum of the Petersberg tasks. The arrangement of the aspirants' participation and the mechanisms for interaction with NATO is of a great importance for the operability of the European forces.

Being a country, negotiating for a full membership in the European Union, Bulgaria fully supports and is ready to participate actively in the process of the Common European Security and Defence Policy implementation by contributing to the best of its abilities to the European forces. Defence capabilities, co-operation and integration are instruments of Bulgaria's active security and defence policy. This policy is consistent and predictable but also active and flexible.

The security policy integrates political, economic, social and other interests and means. The increased requirements of the present and the expectations for the future demand an evolution of the security guaranteeing capabilities and structures in order to successfully overcome possible challenges. This evolution is associated with a change of concepts and perceptions and build-up and development of certain skills and relations that support political strategies and allow for an effective interaction in a national and international environment.

DEFENCE CAPABILITIES

![24_image_0.png](24_image_0.png)

![24_image_1.png](24_image_1.png)

2.1. The Role of the Military Factor in a Risk Environment The Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria defines the Armed Forces as the guarantor of the sovereignty, security and independence of the country.

Despite the positive political changes and the abolishment of the bi-polar model of confrontation, the present stage of social development does not allow for the complete elimination of the military factor from the system of social relations.

The events shaping the military strategic environment at the beginning of the 21st c. as well as the global security crisis have clearly demonstrated a trend towards changing the role of the Armed Forces within the national security systems. Furthermore, they have confirmed the public's conviction that a military power that for decades was based on mass armies, established to conduct large-scale classic-type military operations, has turned out to be insufficient to guarantee reliable national defence under certain circumstances.

Economic prosperity, development of democratic processes and NATO and EU integration are key factors in building a stable and secure national environment. The reform in the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria, the optimisation of their composition, role, functions, tasks and structures is a prerequisite for guaranteeing national security.

## 2.2. Missions And Tasks Of The Armed Forces

The Armed Forces' missions correspond to their constitutional obligations, the long-term national interests in the field of security and defence, the trends of the strategic environment and Bulgaria's integration priorities and they can be expressed as follows: Contribution to peacetime national security Contribution to global peace and security Participation in national defence The Armed Forces fulfill the tasks they have been assigned by preparing to meet the following tasks:

At the same time the military infrastructure is maintained in permanent readiness to host and interact with NATO and EU contingents.

## 2.4. Structure And Composition Of The Armed Forces

The organisational and functional build-up of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria is based on the principles of efficiency, mobility, modular units, interoperability, adaptability to coalition environment, and the capacity to increase operational capabilities in a way

![28_image_1.png](28_image_1.png) that is adequate to potential threats. 2.4.1. Organisational Structure The organisational build-up of the Armed Forces aims at providing the optimal ratio among the different services, troops, type of armaments and infrastructure and maintaining a high level of operational and combat training in order to successfully fulfill the whole spectrum of tasks. The reform process optimises the composition and structure of the Armed Forces in line with the changes in the military strategic environment, the financial, economic and demographic potential of the country and with the requirement for an accelerated achievement of NATO interoperability (Chart 2).

The personnel of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria comprises the servicemen in the Armed Forces, the Ministry of Defence and the units subordinate to the Minister of Defence (Military Information service, Security - Military Policy and Military Counter-intelligence service, "G.S. Rakovski" Defence and Staff College, the Military Medical Academy and the executive agencies to the Minister of Defence).

Chart 2 The Bulgarian Armed Forces consist of General Staff, Land Forces, Air Force, Navy and formations and units under central command.

The General Staff is the main body that provides the strategic management of the Bulgarian Armed Forces in peace and wartime. The General Staff assists the Chief of the **General Staff** in the management of the Bulgarian Armed Forces and the coordination of the services' activities.

The activities and functions of the General Staff provide the Armed Forces strategic management and the implementation of the tasks laid down in all national security and defence documents.

In the event of a military-political crisis or a military threat, the General Staff heads the transfer of the Armed Forces from a peacetime to a wartime state, the establishment of defence

![30_image_0.png](30_image_0.png)

methods of conducting military operations and personnel manning and training systems.

The Land Forces are a basic service in the Bulgarian Armed Forces. Their prime function is, in co-operation with the other services, to guarantee the country's sovereignty and independence and protect its territorial integrity. The Land Forces include troop units of the various military branches and special forces, trained to carry out tasks, both individually and within multinational forces in peace support operations.

In terms of structure, in peace time the Land Forces encompass the Land Forces Headquarters, the Operational Forces Command, two Command Posts (East and West), the Special Operations Forces Command and a Complex of the Land Forces Headquarters. (Chart 3) In order to discharge their functions and tasks the Land Forces include in their structure branches and Special Forces, Special Operations Forces, mechanised, tank, artillery, airdefence, combat and logistics support units.

The Operational Forces Command consists of mechanised/light infantry/tank brigades, an artillery brigade, a logistic support brigade and combat provision and support units. The East Command and the West Command comprise mobilisation bases and centres and training ranges. In wartime the mobilisation bases and centres deploy mechanised and artillery brigades and regiments. The Special Operations Forces include: Special Operations Forces Command, a special

![30_image_1.png](30_image_1.png) operations brigade, a parachute reconnaissance regiment and a psychological operations battalion.

Chart 3

At present the Air Force fulfills its functions, tasks and missions by applying an integrated approach to reforming the troops so as to adequately respond to crises and conflicts of a various nature. In peacetime the Air Force comprises the following: Air Force Headquarters with a complex, Air Defence Command and Tactical Aviation Command. Structurally the Air Force comprises branches of forces (avia-

and special forces (combat, special and logistics and medical support units). (Chart 4)
Chart 4

36

![33_image_0.png](33_image_0.png)

The Navy's function is to guarantee Bulgaria's sovereignty in its aquatory and, whenever necessary, take part in operations other than war.

The Navy carries out tasks on guaranteeing the safety of navigation within the economic zone of our country's aquatory. 
In peacetime it includes the Navy Headquarters, two naval bases and a Navy Headquarters complex. (Chart 5)
Chart 6

![34_image_0.png](34_image_0.png)

![34_image_1.png](34_image_1.png)

## 2.4.2. Functional Structure

The functional build-up is closely related to the organisation and structural building of the Bulgarian Armed Forces and is aimed at finding the best option for the military on the  basis of a feasible forecast of the geopolitical trends and the military and political situation in the world, in Europe and on the Balkans.

In compliance with the Military Doctrine the troops and units of the Bulgarian Armed Forces in functional terms consist of Active Forces and Reserve Forces. (Chart 6)
Chart 6

![34_image_2.png](34_image_2.png)

The Active Forces comprise the Deployable Forces and In-place Forces with a peacetime personnel of 34 000.

The Reserve Forces comprise the Augmentation Forces and Territorial Defence Forces and training bases with a peacetime personnel up to 11 000.

The Active Forces are units of the Bulgarian Armed Forces whose major function is to guarantee the fulfillment of the basic tasks on national defence and coalition commitments. The Active Forces include 75% of the peacetime personnel and are provided to 100% with armament and equipment, the major part of which is maintained in operational readiness. The Active Forces are the main elements of the national defence and are divided into: Deployable forces set to meet the demands of NATO's collective defence; In-place forces set for national defence and other national tasks. The Deployable Forces (Chart 7) include a land, air and naval components. They are at least 90% manned and 100% equipped with flawless weapons and armament. These forces will provide a considerable contribution to the NATO collective defence following our accession to the Alliance. In peacetime the Deployable Forces participate in rescue and humanitarian operations, in peace support operations abroad and fight armed terrorist groups.

![35_image_0.png](35_image_0.png)

The Immediate Reaction Forces are the part of the Deployable Forces with the highest readiness level, 100% manned and equipped with weapons and armament. They are determined annually by a Defence Minister's order.

The In-place Forces comprise all the Active Forces with the exception of the Deployable Forces. They include units of the Armed Forces services which are up to 70% manned (but not less than 40%) and 100% provided with weapons and armament. (Chart 8) The Reserve Forces (Chart 9) are part of the Territorial Defence Forces with a low level of manning and equipment, and are not kept in operational readiness and do not constitute a combat potential in peacetime. Their tasks include planning and training reservists, storing armament and equipment, training formations for rotation of the Active Forces or increasing the latter's size. In peacetime the Reserve Forces comprise 25% of the Bulgarian Armed Chart 8

![36_image_0.png](36_image_0.png)

Chart 9

![36_image_2.png](36_image_2.png)

Forces personnel

![37_image_0.png](37_image_0.png)

and, whenever necessary, they form the Augmentation Forces and the Territorial Defence Forces. The Reserve Forces' formations are equipped up to 80100% with weapons and armament that are kept in long-term storage. In peacetime they are manned with reserve personnel and supplied with equipment from the national economy.

A mobilisation and a permanent Reserve are trained and maintained to man the Bulgarian Armed Forces in times of crises or war. The Mobilisation Reserve's function is to fully man the wartime staff of the formations and units. It is divided into high-readiness and low-readiness reserve. The Permanent Reserve's function is to man the peacetime structures of the Bulgarian Armed Forces. The number of the permanent reserve is determined annually in an order of the Defence minister in accordance with the resources planned for its maintenance. The Augmentation Forces include mechanised brigades of the Land Forces and formations of the services, branches and special forces that are deployed in wartime and reinforce the In-place Forces. In peacetime they are represented by mobilisation bases and centres (of the Land Forces) which carry out the training of staffs, formations and reservists, store and maintain armament, equipment and materiel.

The Territorial Defence Forces are formations of the Land Forces set up after a decision of the Supreme General Command. They are manned from the mobilisation reserve following a territorial principle. In the event of a mass-scale armed conflict threat strategic reserves of the Armed Forces can be formed with a decision of the Supreme General Command. In peacetime they are not provided with personnel and they do not form part of the wartime composition of the Armed Forces. As for the units of the Navy

![37_image_1.png](37_image_1.png)

comprising the strategic reserve there are annual technical tests of the vessels of the national economy.

![38_image_1.png](38_image_1.png)

A strategic mobilisation reserve are all citizens of the Republic of Bulgaria who have been trained to meet their constitutional duties as to defence and should report in the event of mobilisation. The following military units are trained to participate in the European defence forces
(Chart 10): a mechanised battalion, an engineer battalion, a radiation and chemical reconnaissance company, two helicopters MI-17, four helicopters MI-24, a corvette, CIMIC officers.

Chart 10 In order to participate in the NATO forces following an invitation for membership, the following Deployable Forces are being trained: Of the Land Forces:
A mechanised brigade, a light infantry battalion, a special forces battalion, an engineer battalion, an NBC protection and ecology battalion, an NBC reconnaissance company, and a logistics support unit. Of the Air Force: By 2002 a mixed helicopter squadron and a transportation aviation unit will be prepared. By 2004 an air defence missile division will be additionally included. In the period 2004 - 2008 an extra air defence fighter squadron and two air defence missile divisions will be trained. Of the Navy: A frigate, two corvettes, two minesweepers and an auxiliary ship are being prepared. Troops and forces from the Bulgarian Armed Forces are trained and kept ready to support the population in the event of natural disasters, industrial accidents and ecological catastrophes by providing timely and effective assistance, containing a crisis and overcoming the harmful effects on the infrastructure and the environment. 2.5. Command Structure and Management Bodies The President of the Republic is the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.

![38_image_0.png](38_image_0.png)

Upon the Council of Ministers' proposal the

![39_image_0.png](39_image_0.png)

President approves the Armed Forces' strategic action plans, calls up a higher combat readiness level, declares mobilisation, appoints and dismisses the command staff, and confers high military ranks to officers. In the event of martial law, war or military action, it is the President who sets up the Supreme General Command which assists the Supreme Commander-in-Chief in the defence and Armed Forces management. In peacetime the Bulgarian Armed Forces management is provided by the General Staff, the Headquarters of the services, the Commands and Staffs of formations, units and subdivisions.

The command structure and management bodies are so organised as to provide a reliable management of troops and forces participating in an operation regardless of the situation. (Chart 11)
Chart 11 The development of the management system of forces is directed towards the keeping of the

![39_image_1.png](39_image_1.png) formations, units and subdivisions in readiness to carry out their tasks.

The management aims at guaranteeing the maximum efficiency of the forces' actions in carrying out their peacetime tasks or tasks in the event of a crisis or military conflict.

The main task of the command, control, computers, communications, information and reconnaissance systems (C4IR) is to implement the Armed Forces management concept in real time, on the basis of modern technologies that provide: information superiority over the enemy - up-to-date comprehensive information at any time and any place (a comprehensive and protected picture of the theatre of war);
 a complete and multi-level protection of the information that is critical for the accomplishment of the tasks; interoperability of the C4I systems.

## 2.6. Armed Forces Support Reconnaissance And Information Provision.

The establishment and maintenance of a reliable early warning system and announcement of existing crises of different nature and intensity is a priority of the Republic of Bulgaria's national defence and security policies. A main element of this system is the military reconnaissance. The military reconnaissance provides to the military and political management timely, comprehensive and precise data, assessments, analyses and forecasts about the military-political and operational-strategic situation that are used as a basis on which the national defence and security policies are developed, planning is carried out and decisions are made.

Engineering Support. The continuous development of the transport, energy, meliorative and urban infrastructure enhances the importance of the engineer support both in peace and in war times. Engineer forces are permanent participants in peace support operations, crisis management, eliminating the effects of industrial accidents or natural disasters. This confirms the need to maintain capabilities sufficient to react timely and efficiently to crises within the country's territory and throughout the region.

NBC Protection. The NBC reconnaissance units are provided with technological reconnaissance and surveillance equipment and can perform tasks on registering and indicating the level of radioactive contamination, determining the quantitative and qualitative composition of the radioactive isotopes, quick analysis of the chemical composition of the environment, automated information exchange on the NBC situation.

Logistics and Medical Support. It includes organising and carrying out a set of activities concerning the planning, analysis, forecasting, ordering, delivery, storage, transportation, distribution, maintenance, evacuation, moving and accounting for all facilities, armament and technical equipment. It also includes the accommodation, servicing and security of personnel, the maintenance, exploitation and reconstruction of infrastructure and delivery of medical supplies.

The development of the uniform logistics and medical support system of the forces aims at aligning it with the country's economic potential, the changing structure of the Armed Forces, and Bulgaria's future integration in the European and the Euro-Atlantic security systems.

## 2.7. Basic Operational And Combat Capabilities Of The Armed Forces

![40_Image_3.Png](40_Image_3.Png)

The Republic of Bulgaria's Armed Forces are built and trained following a set of parametres and structures laid down by the Military Doctrine. The forms of their deployment are determined by the Military Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria and the doctrines of the services.

The functional structures established and the groups formed on their basis allow the execution of tasks related to defending the country's territorial integrity, taking into account the military and strategic environment, the level and intensity of potential military threats in a short- and mid-term perspective. The combat capabilities of the Bulgarian Armed Forces can be measured by the volume of tasks they are able to perform under particular circumstances. They are based on the human and logistic parametres that determine the capabilities of

![41_image_0.png](41_image_0.png) the units to fulfill the tasks set. The main criteria along which these parametres are determined are the level of manning of combat-ready formations, the level of armament and equipment, the materiel availability, the quality of the training of the command staff, the efficiency of logistics and management, and the degree of mobility of the forces.

The structural and operational build-up of the Bulgarian Armed Forces is aimed at guaranteeing their adequate combat capabilities. The Armed Forces perform the greatest number of tasks in the event of an escalating military-political crisis and a direct threat to national security and the country's territorial integrity. It is under such circumstances that the Armed Forces activate their early warning, rapid reaction and management system, cover the state borders, the air space and the aquatory of the theatre of war under threat, increase adequately the deterrent and defence forces, and carry out operational, and if necessary strategic, deployment. The Bulgarian Armed Forces' combat capabilities will be gradually increasing in the course of time by improving and reaching the optimal values of the following parametres: step-by-step recovery of the combat capability of troops and forces; modernisation of the major types of armament and equipment, increase of their available exploitation resource, and supply of modern equipment; maintenance of a clear-cut organisation in transferring the forces from a peacetime to a wartime state and gradual professionalisation of the Bulgarian Armed Forces; enhancement of the operational and combat training of commanders, headquarters and troops by raising the personnel's intellectual level and professional training; optimisation of the functionality and increase in the efficiency of the information, reconnaissance and warning system; increase of the operational capabilities, reliability and stability of the management system and implementation of modern technological systems and communication and automation facilities; improvement of the logistics and medical support system; improvement of the preparation and training of the national economy, the country's territory and the population for defence.

The higher capital investments both as a percentage of the defence budget and in absolute terms and the sustaining trend of their increase in a long-term perspective will allow for maintaining a higher percentage of operating armament and equipment; the latter, together with improvement of the staff's training level, will finally result in reaching about 80% of the effective combat potential in terms of armaments and equipment's technical level - a standard quite close to that in NATO member states.

The year-by-year analysis of the possibilities for modernising the Bulgarian Armed Forces combat potential on the basis of the expected economic and financial provision for defence, shows that there is a considerable increase after 2002 when additional budget spending is planned on recovering the damaged and faulty armament and equipment, and on combat training (Figure 2).

## 2.8. Troops And Forces' Education And Training System

![42_Image_1.Png](42_Image_1.Png)

2.8.1. Military Strategy and Doctrines on the Troops and Forces (Chart 12) The implementation of the Armed Forces' functions and tasks with regard to achieving the goals of the country's military security is subject to the Military Strategy which incorporates the measures necessary to actively form a favourable international environment, to manage crises of a various nature, and to defend the country.

In its nature the Republic of Bulgaria's Military Strategy is defensive, responsive and balanced; the core of the strategic concept is the structural reform in the Armed Forces, the optimisation of their composition with a view to fulfilling their functions and tasks, bringing the Armed Forces' structure and deployment rules in conformity with the changes in the military-strategic environment, the country's financial, economic and demographic resources, and the requirement for a high degree of interoperability with NATO forces.

The Military Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria has an important place among the fundamental national security documents and its adoption is crucial for the improvement of the interoperability with NATO. The Military Strategy has been elaborated in accordance with the changes in the strategic environment, the PG G 0028 Force Structure Review and the updating of Plan 2004.

The views and principles for the build-up, development, training, utilisation and management of the Armed Forces are laid down in the respective doctrines and concepts that reflect the role and tasks assigned to them in the Military Doctrine and the Military Strategy.

## 2.8.2. Troops And Forces' Training System

The troops and forces training system includes training of officers, staff, troops and forces. It is conducted following the action plans of the headquarters at all levels. These plans lay down the forms of all conducted activities, their sequence, period and topic in compliance with the financial funds and logistics provided. The basic forms of training commanders and staffs are: operational meetings, commanders' training exercise, staff training exercise, command-and-staff exercises, computer-aided exercise, troops exercise and combat games. The tactical units' staffs are trained in tactical, special tactical and special exercises.

In order to achieve the goals of interoperability and adaptation to NATO's standardisation documents and staff training procedures to our conditions we have increased the relative share of the computer-aided exercises which raise the effectiveness at lower costs.

In the units of the Bulgarian Armed Forces the training is carried out under the direct guidance of the commanders in comprehensive training programmes, tactical and drill training, tactical and special tactical drills and exercises, as well as training focused on the unit that is considered as the basic individual combat unit for a particular branch of the Armed Forces or special troops.

The mobilisation training of

![44_image_1.png](44_image_1.png) commanders, staffs, troops, reserves, military regions, the state and economic senior management involves conducting training, mobilisation games, mobilisation assemblies and exercises.

Apart from all traditional training forms, there are new forms of actions in the training of troops and forces, such as securing the safety of humanitarian operations, and solving refugee issues, restoring public order, prevention of border violations, control over compliance with arms embargoes, tasks related to the eliminating the effects of natural disasters and industrial accidents both on the national and the international level.
Training is conducted in conditions close to the real combat conditions on various topics and with the participation of subdivisions, units and formations of the other services, branches or special troops.

## 2.9. Interoperability

Bulgaria has been implementing a large-scale programme on achieving interoperability with the Armed Forces of NATO member states. The effort to increase interoperability is directed at the following main areas: language training, communications, staff procedures, topographical and geodesical basis and logistics.

Prerequisites have been established for determining the approaches to the Armed Forces modernisation. A programme is being implemented for recovering the technical parameters and upgrading the armament and equipment of the formations, units and subdivisions. This programme will increase their interoperability with the the Armed Forces of the NATO member states.

The participation of Bulgarian units in NATO-led peace support operations has shown that the units within KFOR and SFOR can successfully accomplish various tasks and operate in a multinational environment. In order to raise the interoperability Bulgaria negotiated with NATO the implementation of a package of the so-called Partnership Goals which will result in a considerable increase of the level of interoperability with the Armed Forces of NATO member states.

Yet another significant element of the training for participation in joint multinational operations is the restructuring of part of the national infrastructure with a view to providing host nation support. Despite the important achievements so far there are still a number of problems concerning the interoperability, one of the first among them being the personnel's language training.

## 2.10. The Defence Reform

The characteristics of the Armed Forces in terms of quantity and quality are specified in the Amended Plan for the Organisational development of the Bulgarian Armed Forces by the year 2004. These have to be as follows: Adequate to the strategic environment and the nature of the contemporary challenges; Securing the best possible defence within the country's available resources; Effectively supporting the country's policy of NATO and EU accession and the international community's efforts for maintaining peace and stability. The Plan envisages radical measures to relieve the Ministry of Defence of certain irrelevant functions and to concentrate on the Armed Forces' building, maintenance and effective operation. It emphasises on developing the international military co-operation so as to accelerate the reforms and contribute to preserving peace and stability.

Optimising the Bulgarian Armed Forces' size and structure has provided the basis for the improvement of all other qualitative and quantitative characteristics. This optimisation was carried out after a detailed analysis of the Armed Forces' combat potential and the country's resources. Applying the mathematical modeling method and making use of the Defence Resource Management Model we have set parametres such as the size of personnel in peace time, the degree of armament and equipment support, the logistics support. The possibilities for modernisation and rearmament were forecast as well as the level and rate of the anticipated increase of combat readiness and capability as a function of the availability of resources and the structural changes in the Bulgarian Armed Forces. Studying the different options for the size of the Bulgarian Armed Forces showed that the implementation of the model based on a 45,000 peacetime personnel would make possible the fulfilment of peace-time tasks as well as the tasks in times of crises. It would also make possible the mobilisation of the contingent necessary in war time and would allow Bulgarian contingents to take due part in multinational operations supporting the international community's efforts to preserve peace and security on the continent.

The aforementioned size of the Bulgarian Armed Forces has yet another aim: to focus

![46_image_2.png](46_image_2.png) resources and efforts on establishing "effectively operating Armed Forces", and setting up structural units which are efficient, modular, compact, maneuver and combat capable, relatively independent and fully sustained, capable of guaranteeing the country's defence, and being an equal partner in the international military co-operation and integration. Such Armed Forces will ensure the necessary conditions for military service and life and a sustained and effective motivation of personnel, so that the latter reveals its intellectual potential and professional skills in building the national defence and Armed Forces. According to Plan 2004 the reform within the Bulgarian Armed Forces is to be implemented in three stages the first of which was completed in 2000. The present second stage (2001-2002) is characterised by reorganising the headquarters and formations of the Land Forces, the bases and units of the Air Force and the Navy, part of the General Staff, and the logistics and medical support system. During the third stage (2003-2004) the structural reform is to be completed and the new organisational and staff structures of the Bulgarian Armed Forces will be established. The second and third stages of the implementation of Plan 2004 are under way as well as the training of the Armed Forces and development of future plans for the Bulgarian Armed Forces in the period 2010-2015.

THE HUMAN FACTOR
IN DEHENGE

![48_image_0.png](48_image_0.png)

![48_image_1.png](48_image_1.png)

3.1. Legal Status of Servicemen and Civilians in the Defence System According to the Military Doctrine of the Republic of Bulgaria the human resources are the most important element of the Armed Forces. The government provides conditions and guarantees for meeting the needs of the Bulgarian citizens employed in the Armed Forces in accordance with the significance and specificities of the defence tasks they perform, and ensures optimal opportunities for social adaptation of those released from military service as a result of the reform.

The Ministry of Defence's personnel consists of servicemen and civilians with a specific status regulated by the existing legal framework. 

A specific, positive institutional characteristic of Armed Forces is the high level of integration of various ethnic and minority groups and religions.

## 3.1.1. Servicemen

By legal status servicemen are career personnel and recruited conscripts. Career personnel comprises officers, non-commissioned officers, cadets and soldiers. To carrer servicemen military service is a profession in the Armed Forces. Bulgarian citizens who have completed their conscript military service (not applicable to women) and who are not older than 40 for officers, 35 for non-commissioned officers and 30 for soldiers, may apply for a carrer military service. Certain positions specified by the Minister of Defence can be taken by career servicewomen as well.

Conscript national service is obligatory for all male citizens of the Republic of Bulgaria who have turned 18 years of age. The age limit for conscripts is 30 years of age. The length of service is 9 months and for those who have a university degree - 6 months. Conscript military duties can be replaced by alternative service. Bulgarian citizens permanently residing abroad cannot be exempted from conscript service on residence grounds only. The gradual move from a conscript to a professional service in the Bulgarian Armed Forces is determined by the global tendencies and by the undoubted professional advantages of a career serviceman to a conscript. The limited term of military service and the related impossibility to train the conscripts to use and maintain the combat equipment, as well as the country's commitments to maintaining peace and security in the region do not make the conscript service option a successful one any more. The Bulgarian Armed Forces are trying to reach a fully professional model by 2010. The 2004 ratio between carrer servicemen and conscripts is expected to be 39%:61% and in 2007 this ratio will be respectively 56%:44%. The full professionalisation is a priority for the Deployable Forces.

The legal status of servicemen includes their rights, responsibilities and restrictions as laid down in The Law on Defence and Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria. The status of servicemen doing military service on the territory of another state is determined in accordance with the Law and the respective international agreement that Bulgaria is a party to.

Carrer servicemen are not allowed to take another government office. Business activities, membership in management boards and participation in supervising bodies of companies (unless this is ex-officio), other full-time jobs and part-time job contracts except for teaching, Career servicemen are entitled to associations on a professional basis. However, they are not

![49_image_1.png](49_image_1.png) entitled to membership in trade union and political organisations, parties, movements and coalitions with political purposes, neither can they undertake ex-officio actions that may impair their political neutrality. They are not obliged to declare their political, religious and ideological convictions.

Persons recruited as conscripts and servicemen from the reserve summoned for training mobilisation assemblies cancel their membership in political parties, movements and coalitions during the term of their service. Servicemen are free to profess religious beliefs and participate in religious rituals and associations outside the area of their military units and facilities, but they are not allowed to spread religious or atheistic propaganda when fulfilling their duties, neither are they allowed to refuse to perform their duties for religious reasons. Set-

52

![49_image_0.png](49_image_0.png)

medical, research and other kinds of creative work are incompatible with the professional military service. Share holding in joint-stock companies and participation in agricultural co-operatives are not considered business activities.

The Law acknowledges and guarantees the right of career servicemen to run for and be elected president and vice-president, members of Parliament, municipal counselors and mayors. Servicemen registered as candidates for elective bodies of political parties and coalitions are released from military service and those elected MPs and mayors on independent election tickets are considered to be on unpaid leave during their term of office as such. The status of conscripts doing military service is incompatible with sitting in a representative or elective office.

![50_image_0.png](50_image_0.png)

![50_image_1.png](50_image_1.png)

ting up religious communities in the areas of military units and facilities is not allowed either.

## 3.1.2. Reserve

The reserve is meant to provide full peacetime and wartime manning of the Armed Forces' units. In accordance with the level of readiness the reserve is divided into permanent reserve and mobilisation reserve. The Permanent Reserve consists of reservists selected on a contract basis meant to take up certain positions in the peacetime personnel of the Active Forces. The Mobilisation Reserve is meant to fully staff formations in times of war, to make up for losses during operations and to deploy units in wartime. It comprises Bulgarian citizens who have served their term as conscripts or done an alternative service; retired career servicemen; men eligible for military service who have not yet taken a conscript or another alternative service; women filed as reportable to the military having qualifications needed in the Armed Forces. The training of the mobilisation reserve is carried out in various forms, the main ones being mobilisation assemblies, mobilisation drills and mobilisation exercises. The reservists can be called up for mobilisation training activities once a year for no longer than 20 days. They can be summoned for specialisation and qualification courses for 30 up to 90 days once in every five years. Having in mind the global trends and the national economic potential and adopting a model of smaller-size peacetime personnel, the Ministry of Defence takes into account the increasing significance of the reserve and pays due attention to the process of recruitment, maintenance and training of this category of servicemen that is so important to the combat capability of formations, units and subdivisions.

3.1.3. Civilians Civilians in the Ministry of Defence are employed in accordance with The Law on Defence and Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria, the Civil Servants' Act and the Labour Code. The presence of civilians in the defence system is an element of the integrated civil-military model implemented by the Ministry of Defence. The Law on Defence and Armed Forces provides for restrictions on the rights and personal liberties of civilians in the Ministry of Defence and in the Armed Forces. Although not deprived from the right to membership in political parties, civil servants are limited in exercising it. Civilians are not allowed to practice any political activity at their work place and express any political views within the working hours and in the military units and sites. The Law on Defence and Armed Forces deprives civilians from their right to strike. At the same time, civilians enjoy some of the rights of career servicemen. Civilians can set up and become members of trade unions which represent and defend their interests to government bodies on matters related to ex-officio and social-security relations, quality of life, etc.

## 3.2. Career Development Opportunities

The state guarantees the career servicemen's professional development which is manifested in the possibility to successively take positions depending on the terms of the contracts signed by them, their professional qualification, physical state and their performance, taking into account the military service interests and those of servicemen themselves. Career servicemen obtain ranks ordered in succession. A condition for promotion is their 54

![51_image_0.png](51_image_0.png)

![51_image_1.png](51_image_1.png)

appointment at a higher position requiring a respective rank. A minimum term of holding a rank (3 years) and a maximum term of holding a post (5 years) have been introduced with a view to gaining professional experience and career development. Holding a higher post is possible after an obligatory holding of the preceding positions depending on their respective specificity. A qualification course has to be passed before appointment to a higher post. In order to enrich their professional experience and career, professionals are moved to different positions following the principle of rotation (acquiring experience on different positions corresponding to the rank held before being promoted to the next position).

The Ministry of Defence prepares an annual Register of Vacancies which ensures transparency and guarantees a competitive principle in the appointment of career servicemen. Performance appraisal of career servicemen carried out by career panels has been introduced to reduce the subjective element in promotion. The appraisal is accompanied by a career development forecast observing the principle of rotation and term of service done in different garrisons. This system allows for satisfying the Armed Forces' need for highly qualified professionals meeting the high requirements of the European integration.

A system of civilians selection, appointment and career management operates in the Ministry of Defence as well. Civil servants following a certain term of office are successively promoted to a higher civil

![52_image_0.png](52_image_0.png)

rank or position. The rank reflects the public servant's level of professional qualification. Improvement of professional qualification is a condition for pre-term promotion. The above scheme of professional development through horizontal and vertical rotation of

![52_image_1.png](52_image_1.png) personnel contributes to maintaining a highly professional administration and command staff and to their better integration into and alignment to a similar model of Armed Forces management.

## 3.3. Quality Of Life Of Military Personnel 3.3.1. Social Status

In conformity with the importance, complexity and difficulty of their tasks, the servicemen and civilians engaged in the defence of the country enjoy a specific status comprising special conditions of remuneration, provision of a certain quality of life in the units, recreation, social security and health insurance and retirement, a system of education and qualification.

Servicemen receive a basic monthly pay in accordance with their military rank which corresponds to the amount determined by the Council of Ministers after a proposal of the Minister of Defence. According to the data of the National Statistics Institute the monthly pay is calculated on the basis of the average monthly salary in the budget sphere. For an officer it is no less than two average monthly salaries, for a non-commissioned officer - no less than 1,3 average monthly salaries and for a soldier - no less than 1 average monthly salary. Career servicemen are paid a sum additional to the basic monthly salary depending on the length of service, amounting to 2% for every year served, but not more than 40%. Additional remuneration is paid also for specific or health-hazardous working conditions. Rewards and bonuses can be paid for performance throughout the year as well. Servicemen have the right to a one-off compensation in the case of transfer, release from cadre service, severe or medium bodily injury caused during or because of the carrying out of their official duties. Servicemen renting accommodation on the free market are paid compensation amounts. Servicemen in social difficulty may be financially supported.

## 3.3.2. Health Care

![53_Image_0.Png](53_Image_0.Png)

The functional environment and the nature of activities in the Armed Forces require the creation of a safe and healthy work environment for servicemen and civilians during their daily service.

According to the Law on Defence and Armed Forces and the Civil Servants' Act in the system of defence there is obligatory health insurance for career servicemen and civilians covered by the state budget. There is also an obligatory insurance against accidents that have occurred on or in relation to carrying out of official duties covered by the state budget. The Ministry of Defence as an employer can participate in the choice of a supplementary health insurance fund and take up the payments to it for persons working under risk and

56 The changes in the system of remuneration under the military reform are subject to the adopted model of career servicemen development: education and qualification are the basis of obtaining a higher rank that secures the right of holding a higher position in the Armed Forces hierarchy. The implementation of this model by 2004 - 2005 creates prerequisites for determining a basic monthly pay depending on rank and development of a new system of bonuses, corresponding to the specificities of the work. The building of modern professional Armed Forces and the recruitment of highly qualified professionals are possible by implementing a system adequate to the economic conditions which raises the motivation and improves the quality of life of people in defence. In order to maintain the necessary social status of servicemen and civilians, the Ministry of Defence carries out a housing policy along a territorial principle. It involves the building of flats on land owned by the Ministry of Defence and the setting up of housing funds to provide accommodation for servicemen after they have been released from military service.

Career servicemen and civilians can buy a flat from the military housing fund during their service provided they have worked in the Armed Forces for not less than 10 years.

The Ministry of Defence's housing policy is also relevant to the specific conditions and needs of the re-dislocation of units and the prospects of having professional Armed Forces.

![54_image_0.png](54_image_0.png)

health hazardous conditions. Additional

![54_image_1.png](54_image_1.png) health insurance for the whole Armed Forces personnel is provided through additional insurance for a limited number of risk-exposed personnel (pilots, paratroopers, divers), the scope being gradually expanded and planned to cover all servicemen and civilians in the Ministry of Defence by 2010. During their service career servicemen and conscripts are entitled to free medical treatment at the health centres of the Ministry of Defence (the Military Medical Academy, hospitals in Plovdiv, Varna, Sliven and Pleven). The rehabilitation and prophylactic centres in Bankia, Hisar and Pomorie are also at the servicemen's disposal. The Ministry of Defence takes into account the influence of health on the servicemen's morale, combat readiness and the combat capability of the units and will continue to put efforts into the improvement of health care.

## 3.3.3. Social Assistance

![54_Image_2.Png](54_Image_2.Png)

The Ministry of Defence carries out social assistance activities for servicemen, retired servicemen, military invalids and others who have been injured during or in relation to the defence of the country as well as to the members of military-patriotic organisations.

The regulatory framework and organisation, necessary for granting monthly, one-time and regular benefits meant to guarantee differentiated basic minimum income, has been created. Benefits are also provided to cover expenses in case of illness, accident, longterm unemployment, natural disasters and emergencies that have led to loss of property, etc. Currently 3% of the conscripts resort to assistance. The trend of increasing the relative share of minority groups' representation in the Armed Forces has initiated the collection of sociological data on recruited conscripts who due to specific circumstances are in a disadvantaged position. This information allows for a more precise forecasting and planning of the Ministry of Defence's budget appropriations so as to grant benefits. The Ministry of Defence renders assistance to militarypatriotic unions involving people eligible for reserve service and people who have passed the age limit for service. Rents for premises for carrying out socially useful patriotic activity and social events are covered.

3.3.4. Social Adaptation In co-operation with non-governmental organisations such as the Social Adaptation Association and the Resource Centre Foundation, the Ministry of Defence implements a programme for re-training and social adaptation of career servicemen due to be released from military service. The implementation began in 2000 with the opening of the Retraining and Social Adaptation Centre in Sofia, and later in Plovdiv, Sliven and Veliko Tarnovo. Career servicemen who have sought the services of the Centres are provided with vocational guidance and retraining courses.

The outcomes of the Centres' activities are provided in Table 1

RETRAINING AND SOCIAL ADAPTATION CENTRES' ACTIVITIES
Table 1

## 3.3.5. Retirement Pension

Career servicemen are insured against all social risks under the provisions of the Obligatory Social Insurance Code at the expense of the state budget. On release from regular service,

![56_image_0.png](56_image_0.png)

![56_image_1.png](56_image_1.png)

they receive a one-off compensation to the amount of as many gross monthly salaries as the number of years served, but not more than 20. They are entitled to pension on retirement regardless of their age, having completed 20 years of service, two thirds of which being in active service. Those who have served 15 years as airborne personnel, crews of submarines and diver personnel are entitled to pension on retirement, irrespective of their age.

The carrer personnel's additional voluntary pension insurance, supported by the Ministry of Defence being the employer, is a part of the general government policy for supplementary voluntary insurance.

## 3.3.6. Recreation

Career servicemen are entitled to a full-pay annual leave of up to 30 working days and an additional paid annual leave of one day per year of service, but not more than 20 working days. Career servicewomen are entitled to leave on the occasion of pregnancy, child delivery and adoption, as well as taking care of a small or a sick child.

For the whole period of service, conscript soldiers are entitled to a 15-day home leave in case of a 9-month military service and to a 10-day home leave in case of a 6-month service. The leave is considered as military service. Career servicemen and civilians can benefit from various medical, sanitarium, prophylactic, recreation and sports facilities of the Ministry of Defence. Bases such as Flotilia, Nesebar, Sarafovo, Sozopol, Ribaritza, Pamporovo, Borovetz, Olymp, Govedarzi and Chaika offer opportunities for family, group and individual rest, specialised recreation for children, recovery programmes, spa treatment, training camps for sportsmen, high mountain and hunting tourism. The existing sports facilities provide the basis needed for the personnel's sports activities. In addition, competitions with national, regional and international participation, as well as events of the International Military Sport Council are organised and carried out there.

## 3.3.7. Education And Qualification

Education and qualification of servicemen and civilians are among the Ministry of Defences priority activities.

The system of military education ensures the consecutive acquiring of educational and qualification degrees of higher education. It is a universal system giving a chance of job-related, targeted, additional and foreign language training at all professional development levels. Servicemen are educated and improve their qualification in military and civil schools in the country and abroad.

The requirements for an educational threshold and qualification level are the ones channeling the professional development of career servicemen and civilians, and obtaining a higher qualification is a precondition for promotion.

According to these requirements officers start their career following the comletion of a Bachelor's degree at a military or civil higher education college (for professions not taught at the National Higher Military School). Certain positions require a Master's degree from the Defence and Staff College in the country or abroad. There are higher education and qualification requirements for those who apply for career NCOs. A priority is given to career soldier candidates with secondary education and a certain qualification.

The integration process has set yet another key priority in the personnel qualification - foreign language training. It is crucial for the interoperability,  a main element of which is communication in a multinational environment. Certification of career servicemen and civilians is carried out annually in accordance with the NATO standardisation agreement on foreign language knowledge - STANAG 6001.

![58_image_3.png](58_image_3.png) school will retain its independence.

The G. S. Rakovski Defence and Staff College

![59_image_0.png](59_image_0.png)

The Georgi Stoikov Rakovski Defence and Staff College provides education for officers willing to obtain a Master and a PhD degree. The College teaches officers and civilians working in the Ministry of Defence, the General Staff and the services. It also provides military training for state and local administration officials.

The College's structure incorporates an Operational-Tactical Faculty, a National Security and Defence Department, an Interoperability Department, a Post-Graduate Qualification Centre and an Institute for Advanced Defence Research. The advance of the new information technologies has made it possible to implement the

![59_image_1.png](59_image_1.png)

![60_image_0.png](60_image_0.png)

global CISCO Networking Academy Programme (CNAP). A CISCO Academy has been

![60_image_1.png](60_image_1.png) established at the Institute for Advanced Defence Research at the College.

The G. S. Rakovski Defence and Staff College represents the Republic of Bulgaria in the Consortium of Defence Academies and Security Studies Institutes.

The reform in the system of military education aims at attracting highly qualified staff in the national security system who will be offered opportunities for professional development and intellectual achievements. The Military Medical Academy organises courses for raising the qualification of the medical

![60_image_2.png](60_image_2.png)

personnel of the Armed Forces, conducts research and programmes for prevention and treatment of psychoactive substances abuse.

The high professionalism of the Academy's medical personnel as well as the training of some

![61_image_0.png](61_image_0.png) of the specialists at NATO military medical centres allows for the harmonising of the health care with that of NATO Armed Forces.

CHAPTER FOUR
DEFENCE MANAGEMENT
4.1. National Principles and Mechanisms of Interaction in the Development and Implementation of the Defence Policy Under the present conditions the pillars of the Republic of Bulgarias security policy are cooperation, integration, economic stability and maintaining a modern military potential. The co-operation and integration processes are aimed at shaping a favourable security environment which has a direct effect on the nature of the Bulgarian military policy.

Military policy is that part of defence policy which is implemented by using in different ways the Armed Forces' potential. Its aim is to guarantee the country's sovereignty and independence, as well as defence of its territorial integrity, prevention of conflicts and preparation for participation in crisis management. Its implementation is only possible by developing modern, combat capable, interoperable Armed, capable of accelerating Bulgaria's integration in NATO and the European Union.

## 4.2. Defence Management Institutions And Bodies

![63_Image_1.Png](63_Image_1.Png)

The country's constitution and laws stipulate the powers of the National Assembly, the President of the Republic, the Council of Ministers, the Ministerof Defence and the Chief of the General Staff in managing defence. The powers of the National Assembly include: declaring war and concluding peace treaties, declaring martial law or another state of emergency, sending and deploying Bulgarian Armed Forces outside the country. Other National Assemblys powers are related to foreign Armed Force stay in the country or their crossing of Bulgarian territory, ratification and denunciation of international treaties of military nature. It is solely within the competence of the coun-

![63_image_0.png](63_image_0.png)

try's legislative body

![64_image_0.png](64_image_0.png) to adopt long-term programmes for the Armed Forces development, authorise their total size and the state budget funding. The defence and Armed Forces related activities of the President being the Supreme Commander-in-Chief are assisted by a National Security Secretary and a Military Secretary.

The Consultative National Security Council headed by the President with the participation of representatives of the government and all political forces sitting in the National Assembly considers issues of paramount importance to the country's security.

The Council of Ministers provides the general management of Armed Forces bearing responsibility for their development, training, all-round logistics and maintenance of their combat and mobilisation readiness. The Law on Defence and Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria and the National Security Concept further specify the powers of the Council of Ministers. In carrying out its main task on management and implementation of the military policy, the government adopts regulatory acts and planning documents important for the armed force activities.

Under the Council of Ministers there is an Interdepartamental Council on the military-industrial base and the mobilisation readiness of the country.

The Minister of Defence is directly responsible for conducting the government policy in the Armed Forces, for leading the Ministry of Defence and for exercising civilian control over the Armed Forces. The Minister manages the defence planning; the personnel, social, training, health and information policy, and the budget allocation for the Ministry of Defence, as well as the maintenance of state-owned military property. The Minister of Defence represents the Ministry before third parties, carries out international co-operation in the area of defence and leads the Bulgarian military-diplomatic offices. The offices providing defence information as well as the units responsible for the order, security and preservation of the state and official secret in the Armed Forces are also directly accountable to the Minister of Defence.

In the formulation and drafting of concrete decisions on the implementation of the governments defence and Armed Forces policy the Minister of Defence is supported by a Political Cabinet.

![65_image_0.png](65_image_0.png)

The Minister of Defence confers the first commissioned rank, promotes and demotes in rank,

![65_image_1.png](65_image_1.png) takes on and releases from service career officers from the Armed Forces. Other Ministries and Agencies The Ministry of Foreign Affairs conducts political dialogue and co-operates with other countries in providing a sustainable security environment in solving disputable issues by diplomatic means.

In accordance with the Programme for the Preparation and Accession of the Republic of Bulgaria to NATO a mechanism has been established for planning, coordination and control over the activities' implementation involving the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Interdepartamental Committee on NATO Integration is at the heart of this mechanism. The Committee conducts an overall review of the harmonisation of the legislation, structures and mechanisms of the operation of the political, military-political, militarytechnical and military industry areas in the Republic of Bulgaria and in NATO. The Committee is co-chaired by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Defence. The Prime Minister of the Republic of Bulgaria participates at the discussions of issues of special importance.

The Ministry of Interior performs tasks related to the training and involvement in territorial defence, security and control over the state borders, security of strategic and other important sites and the prevention of terrorist activities. The bodies of the Ministry of Interior assist the population in coping with the aftermath of natural disasters and industrial accidents. The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defence exchange information concerning national security and the internal situation in line with the functional competence of the respective structural units. Organised crime and terrorism have become strategic threats which necessitate joint coun-

70

teraction using highly specialised knowledge in the area of industrial management, law, economics, finance.

The Ministry of Economy is responsible for the maintenance, stabilisation and development of an optimal structure of the defence industry. A priority for the Ministry and the defence industry enterprises is the maintenance, promotion and development of their research, development and industrial potential. The defence industry development concept is underpinned by a combination of market economy with the demands for armament and combat equipment of the Armed Forces and the standartisation of the defence production in line with the future NATO membership. The Ministry of Finance is responsible for the development of the consolidated state budget and the implementation of the financial, budgetary and economic policy of the government on providing the advance of the military reform and the country's accession to NATO and the EU. The Ministry receives, processes and analyses information on the financial status of the trading companies in the defence industry so as to support the necessary wartime production capacity and armament and equipment repair. The Ministry of Regional Development and Public Works carries out the state policy for regional development and coordinates the construction and utilisation of the dual-use infrastructure. Bulgaria's strategic geographic location gives additional significance to the existing and the planned transport, communication and energy infrastructure which grants access to alternative markets and energy sources. Bulgaria's relative energy dependence and the process of opening the energy sector and turning it into a part of the dynamically integrating energy market determine the significant defence-related role of the Ministry of Energy and Energy Resources, that is connected with guaranteeing the security of the energy supply network and enhancing the reliability of the energy resources supplies.

The Ministry of Transport and Communication organises and manages the preparation of the transport and communication network for working under crisis conditions. The Ministry develops the technical requirements to the mobile transport materiel, studies and installs technologies for loading and unloading of troops, military equipment and cargoes along NATO standards. Its bodies develop programmes for automated planning, organisation and management of military cargoes compatible with the relevant NATO systems and conduct consultations on the preparation of the transport system for use under crisis conditions.

![67_image_0.png](67_image_0.png)

The Ministry conducts the state policy in the area of telecommunications and postal services

![67_image_1.png](67_image_1.png) as regards the national security and defence requirements. It supports the development of the special infrastructure of the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company Plc. with speed and quality corresponding to the part of the network fixed for public needs.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has important functions related to defence and security and provides for the storing of reserves and stock piles of food stuffs and natural resources for the needs of the Armed Forces under the conditions of conflict or crisis.

The Ministry of Health together with the Ministry of Defence is responsible for the maintenance and updating of the medication reserves and wartime stockpiles. In carrying out its tasks for wartime health care as well as in crisis response, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Defence determine the type and quantity of medicines, the medical tools, apparatuses and equipment to be stored in the bases of State Reserve and Wartime Stockpiles Directorate. The Ministry of Environment and Water participates in the work of the Standing Committee on protecting the population against natural disasters and industrial accidents under the Council of Ministers and in the regional committees. The work of the Ministry of Culture is related to the consolidation of the Bulgarian cultural identity and the education of the nation in the spirit of the national traditions combining those with the challenges of the EU integration process. The Ministry of Labour and Social Policy is responsible for the organisation of the alternative national service. After a proposal of this Ministry, the Council of Ministers adopts a list of the jobs and positions which can be taken as a peacetime alternative service and sets the number of citizens who can enlist for it in the respective year.

The Ministry of Justice analyses the Bulgarian legislation and its compliance with the legal instruments and agreements regulating the co-operation with NATO. The Ministry is responsible for maintaining a level of readiness of the justice system for implementing the wartime plan.

The Civil Protection State Agency prepares and trains the population for action during natural disasters, catastrophes and industrial accidents and mitigating their consequences.

72 The Ministry of Education and Science is involved in applied and theoretical research, in the area of defence and security and in the development and updating of the military education system.

## 4.3 Defence Planning Mechanism

Defence planning is carried out in accordance with the adopted political goals and priorities, the resources of the country, the current political and military strategic environment in the region and the general security and defence tendencies in the world. The obvious binding of planned results with resources, executors and terms, with continued review, assessment, control and transparency of military expenditures, is an indispensable prerequisite for success in this area.

Defence planning is integrated by objectives, approaches and time, and is underpinned by the National Security Concept, the Military Doctrine, the Military Strategy and other strategic concepts, the White Paper on Defence, the Concept for the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System, as well as directives, plans and programmes for development, training and deloyment of the Armed Forces, the economy, the population and the defence infrastructure.

The basic planning document is the Updated Plan for Organisational Development of Armed Forces by the End of 2004, which sets the short-term development trends of the Armed Forces and creates a basis for forecasting their development in the near future.

The General Staff of the Bulgarian Armed Forces develops plans for the training and deployment of the Bulgarian Armed Forces so as to carry out the tasks ensuing from the Military Doctrine and the country's integration priorities.

## 4.3.1 Budget Planning

![68_Image_0.Png](68_Image_0.Png)

The introduction of the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System made it possible to include elements of mid-term planning in the budget process and to outline the trends for a longer period. The Ministry of Defence is also developing a budget management information system. The introduction of the new organisation of financial management optimises the size of the personnel, minimises the costs of the financial transactions, improves the management at all levels and contributes to effective decision-making.

CHAPTER FOUR

![69_image_1.png](69_image_1.png)

## 4.3.2. Preparation And Decision-Making

In accordance with the legislation and the decisions taken on particular issues, the Minister of Defence issues rules, regulations, instructions and orders. A Political Cabinet assists the Minister in the formulation and development of specific decisions for the implementation of the government policy in the sphere of defence and the Armed Forces.

The current issues in the country's military policy, structure, functions and budget of the Ministry, the organisational development plan, the structure and size of the Armed Forces and many other important issues within the competency of the Minister are considered by a Defence Council. A Military Policy Council has been set up as a standing advisory body which prepares and submits to the Defence Council consolidated proposals on key and priority military policy issues.

A Programming Council of the Ministry has been established to achieve effective and coordinated provision for the military policy and defence planning. This is a standing advisory body to the Minister whose aim is to formulate the military policy, coordinate and control the implementation of the programmes related to the organisational development, personnel training, modernisation and rearmament of the Bulgarian Armed Forces.

A standing advisory body on issues related to the National Programme for joining NATO is the Integration Council. Its principal tasks are related to the planning of the integration processes in the area of defence, the intradepartmental coordination and implementation of planned integration activities, the control over the implementation of the national strategy on NATO accession. The process of defence reforms has necessitated the development of a long-term plan for the restructuring and modernisation of the Bulgarian Armed Forces. To this end a Modernisation Council operates in the Ministry of Defence.

Over the recent years the practice of conducting research on various problems involving leading foreign institutions and organisations has acquired considerable importance in the drafting of important decisions. This has made it possible to use a science-based approach in managerial decision-making. Studies on the reform progress in the Bulgarian Armed Forces were carried out in 1998 - 2000, such as the Parliamentary Supervision and Democratic Control over the Bulgarian Armed Forces and Ministry of Defence and the Integrated Model of the Functioning of the Ministry of Defence. Studies were made also on the command, control, communication, computers, information and surveillance systems and the air defence system. National expertise on the reform and integration was developed on the basis of these studies. An important element of this process is the foreign consultancy and the powerful mathematical instruments such as the Defence Resources Management Model.

## 4.3.3. Defence Diplomacy And Co-Operation

Defence diplomacy exists to provide stability and security for the Republic of Bulgaria. It facilitates the continuous process of strengthening the confidence. It also helps present the country's defence policy to foreign partners and conduct defence-diplomatic contacts. Negotiations are held and activities carried out on reviewing the agreements in the area of armament control, on programmes for personnel exchange, exercises, training courses, as well as exchange along military training programmes. Adoption of the international standards for the non-proliferation of weapons for mass destruction and conventional weapons as well as their implementation is among the priorities of defence diplomacy. The strengthening of the stability and security is a process of

## 4.4. The Administration And Management System Of The Armed Forces

The reform in the executive power administration is manifested in the clear definition of functions, tasks and responsibilities, on the basis of which structural units are formed or reorganised. The result is building a modern and efficient administration which supports management decision-making and ensures effective implementation of these decisions.

74 changing the attitudes and thinking which evolve from operational deployment of forces and equipment so as to "control armament and military activities". The Ministry of Defence is one of the main institutions carrying out the Republic of Bulgaria's consistent policy in the area of arms control in conformity with the international treaties and conventions that Bulgaria is a party to. Defence diplomacy is reflected in the functions assigned to defence attaches. They are authorised to represent the Minister of Defence in the country of accreditation and to provide advice on military-political issues to the Bulgarian ambassadors. Thus the defence attache apparatus helps achieve a coordination of the joint activities set down in the programmes with the respective countries.

Integrated civil-military administration for defence and Armed Forces management Among the key priorities in reorganising the defence and the Armed Forces is the reform of the Ministry of Defence's central administration. The selected model is based on complex studies of the Ministry and General Staff's organisational and management structure, the state of the Armed Forces, the civil-military relations and democratic control as well as on consultations with experts from NATO member countries. The results of these studies, that are unprecedented in the Bulgarian defence system, have served for the drafting of plans for building and development of the central administration units and the General Staff structures, the development of visions for the services in the Armed Forces and a new resources management model of the Ministry of Defence. The concept of building an integrated civil-military administration for defence and Armed Forces management is based on the functional approach to the development of the management structures providing interlinking of all activities and an analysis of the results in conformity with the Bulgarian defence policy objectives. In this way the reform's organisational characteristics transform the Ministry of Defence into a modern, compact and flexible planning and management structure.

As an important element of the integrated civil-military defence management administration the General Staff of the Bulgarian Armed Forces has also undergone serious reforms. Its reorganisation along the model adopted by the North-Atlantic Treaty member states has proved effective and provides for further optimisation of its functions and personnel. In the near future the integration tendencies in the Armed Forces command bodies will bring about organisational unification of structures and a move to a single civil-military defence management scheme.

## Ministry Of Defence - Structure

A Structural Code regulates the Ministry of Defence' organisational structure (Chart 14). In accordance with their purpose, the administrative units are integrated into general or specialised administration. 

![71_image_0.png](71_image_0.png)

## 4.5. Defence And Armed Forces Conceptual Basis

The development of defence and Armed Forces stems from an orderly hierarchy of statutory documents defining the conceptual and doctrinal grounds of their build-up and maintenance.

The National Security Concept defines the strategic environment, national security factors, principles and priorities. It sets down the responsibilities of institutions, ministries and departments in guaranteeing national security, and emphasises the role of the political and economic resources in achieving this task.

The Military Doctrine of the Republic of Bulgaria presents the military-political and military aspects of national security, the priorities of defence and the trends in the bulding, development and employment of the Armed Forces for the purposes of national defence. The Doctrine reflects Bulgaria's firm intention to take active part in the European community's efforts for safeguarding and strengthening peace and security on the continent and developing the new architecture of European and trans-Atlantic security. The Military Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria reflects the views on the role and tasks of

![72_image_0.png](72_image_0.png) Armed Forces in the new strategic environment and determines the strategic framework of their development in the short and long term. It is the basis for development of the whole hierarchy of conceptual and doctrinal documents forming the theoretical foundations of defence and Armed Forces.

76 Accompanying activities, including providing services to citizens, are concentrated in executive agencies under the Minister of Defence. 

A Chief Secretary carries out the administrative management at the MInistry of Defence providing the Ministry's administrative functioning and the organisational link between the Political Cabinet and the administrative units.

The administrative reform has placed strict requirements to the structure of the administration and has brought about a downsizing. As a result by January 1, 2002 the organisational structures, the administrative units and the secondary budget holders amount to 7 400 people (this figure will be further reduced). 
4.6. Security at the Ministry of Defence

![73_image_1.png](73_image_1.png) 4.6.1. Organisation and Tasks The 'Security - Military Police and Military Counter-Intelligence' Service maintains order and security at the Ministry of Defence and the Bulgarian Armed Forces. In terms of structure the Service is established on a territorial principle in conformity with theadministrative and territorial division of the country, and with the structure, personnel and dislocation of the units of the Ministry of Defence and the Bulgarian Armed Forces. Law and order at the Ministry of Defence are maintained by exercising control over how sevicemen preserve public order, by providing security for Armed Forces activities, military sites and persons, participation in guaranteeing the safety of foreign officials, military representatives, servicemen and troops staying on the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria, etc. 

The Ministry of Defence carries out interaction and coordination with other government authorities and with other states' special services in compliance with international agreements of the Republic of Bulgaria.

## 4.6.2. Control And Inspection In The Ministry Of Defence

Inspection is aimed mainly at analysing the work and interaction between the individual units at the Ministry of Defence, with a view to their efficient functioning. The Ministry of Defence's Inspectorate exercises control related to the problems of military service, logistics, human rights and labour safety. It also conducts some other inspections assigned by the Minister of Defence. The adequate inspection activity at the Ministry of Defence necessitated a change in the philosophy of its operation.

![73_image_0.png](73_image_0.png)

78 An emphasis is laid on the preventive nature of the activities assisting the Minister of Defence, commanders and chiefs of all ranks in performing their functions and tasks.

## 4.6.3. Financial Control In The Ministry Of Defence

The financial and contractual discipline at the Ministry of Defence comprises all forms of control: ex-ante, current and ex-post. The ex-ante control covers the overall budgetary procedure, the expedient and legal spending of budgetary funds, the deduction of tax liabilities, the supply, repair and service orders, their approval and inclusion in the annual plan, the public procurement procedures, the organising of tenders and contests, and the signing of contracts. Current control is exercised on budgetary revenues and expenditures on programmes and activities, and on observation of priorities; on double-entry accounting and accounting operations, terms of delivery and payments, tax payment, and sales carried out by the Ministry of Defence. The ex-post control is exercised over approved annual accounts and budget accounts (observing the limits discipline), annual balancing of the books, meeting the obligations to the budget, execution of contracts and payments on them, sales, inventory lists compiled and on writing off property.

The development of financial control activity at the Ministry follows the line of legal regulation of the right to exercise intradepartmental audit control over the entities accountable for assets.

## 4.6.4. Military Information

The objective of the reform in military intelligence is to align it with the requirements of the new strategic environment, to improve the quality of the information, and achieve interoperability and efficient partnership with the EU and NATO member countries. In conformity with the structural part of the reform a Military Information Service has been established to collect, process, analyse, store and provide information to the benefit of defence and national security.

![75_image_0.png](75_image_0.png)

The Service permanently analyses the development of the militarypolitical situation in

![75_image_1.png](75_image_1.png)

South-Eastern Europe, the state and development of regional conflicts, international security and stability, the progress of the disarmament processes and arms control, the fight against organised crime, illegal trafficking of people, weapons, explosives and nuclear materials, the development of the international military and military-economic co-operation, etc.
Analyses are submitted to the government, the Chief of the General Staff, the HQs commanders of the different services, to directors of national services under the Ministry of Interior, and others. The President of the Republic, the Chairperson of the National Assembly and the Prime Minister receive information equal in volume and content. Information of mutual interest is exchanged with other countries on the basis of signed interstate and interdepartmental treaties and agreements.

## 4.7. Democratic Control Over The Armed Forces

![75_Image_2.Png](75_Image_2.Png)

Exercising civilian control over the activities of the bodies of executive power, the Armed Forces and the special services is necessary because of the extremely important public interest served by the Armed Forces, i.e. defence against foreign intervention.

## 4.7.1. Parliamentary Oversight

The parliamentary form of government and division of powers requires the National Assembly, along with its traditional legislative function, to exercise oversight on the activities of the executive power. This function ensues directly from it being a representative body, a mouthpiece of people's sovereignty.

The National Assembly, exercising its exclusive legislative powers, oversees the processes in defence and Armed Forces. The statutory acts of the National Assembly provide the basic regulating mechanisms in this field of social relations. A specific instrument of parliamentary oversight is the Report on the State of Defence and the Armed Forces which the government submits to the National Assembly on an annual basis. This is a public report that draws public attention and becomes a subject of public debate. Among the most important forms of parliamentary oversight is the National Assembly's approval of the state budget funds necessary for the country's defence as well as the deliberations on the government report on the expenditures incurred in this sphere. In direct relation to this is also the National Assembys right to determine the Armed Forces size. Current control on legal and expedient state budget execution is exercised through the National Audit Office which is elected by the National Assembly and is independent of the executive power. The Foreign Policy, Defence and Security Committee also exercises parliamentary oversight and at its sessions hears the Minister of Defence, the Chief of the General Staff, the heads of special services and other officials, sets up enquiry committees and working groups which investigate issues, drafts opinions on bills and decisions and considers complaints of citizens and institutions.

Classical instruments of parliamentary oversight are the Minister of Defence's answers to current questions at the National Assembly sessions.

## 4.7.2. Public Organisations

Civilian control over national defence activities is exercised through state institutions as laid down by the Constitution as well as by independent public formations and civil movements.

The scope of their activity covers studies into foreign policy and integration issues, militarypatriotic education and social adaptation.

The Ministry of Defence seeks regular interaction with non-governmental organisations. At joint open fora, seminars and workshops problems of national security, defence and the Armed Forces are discussed. The most active participants are the Open Society, the Atlantic Club of Bulgaria, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, the University on National and World Economy. A number of non-government organisations are partners of the Ministry of Defence in the implementation of the Programme for Social Adaptation and Economic Reintegration of personnel released as a consequence of the defence reform.

![77_image_0.png](77_image_0.png)

## 4.7.3. Publicity Of Defence Activities

Publicity and transparency of activities related to defence and the Armed Forces are inseparable attributes of democracy. They provide an opportunity for society to exercise a disciplining influence on management decision-making on the part of responsible institutions of state power and control spending of planned budgetary funds. Mass media duly inform society on issues related to the Armed Forces' combat capability and readiness, the servicemen's social status and on the military reform progress.

The impact of publicity is seen in the opportunity for the state to use the intellectual potential of independent external experts in the spheres of defence and security. By means of their professional knowledge and social authority they channel the interest and add depth to the public debate.

## 4.8. Research And Development

![77_Image_1.Png](77_Image_1.Png)

The research, development and technological provision of defence is ensured mainly by assigning research and development to external organisations on a competitive principle. Building on this principle the Ministry of Defence has signed framework agreements with the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and leading universities in the country for coordination of research and development activities on issues of national security, defence and the Armed Forces. Special importance is attached to the co-operation with companies producing defence articles and research organisations working in high technology areas. The Ministry of Defences research programme aims at implementing projects in different aspects of security and defence. The new philosophy of defence R & D is being realised through implementation of 27 projects.

Along with that Bulgarian defence studies are integrated in the rapidly developing NorthAtlantic community of scientific and applied-scientific research organised in the framework of the Scientific Committee and the Research and Technology Organisation. The Republic of Bulgaria participates in NATO's research and development programme. Bulgarian scientists actively develop applied projects and projects related to development of the infrastructure for scientific research.

Bulgaria has been taking an active part in NATO's Research and Technology Organisation since 1999. Scientists from the Ministry of Defence and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, and higher education institutions represent Bulgaria on the Organisation's Board and its seven sub-committees.

The reorganisation of the research and development system has provided a potential possibility to integrate and focus the efforts of the national research community - the Ministry of Defences institutes and colleges, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, civil schools and universities, company institutes and R&D divisions - to the purpose of making the country more competitive and finding the country's due place in the international system of defence research and development.

Priorities in defence research are determined by the security environment, the scientific discoveries and the development of modern technologies. The Ministry of Defence has set the following R&D priorities in support to defence capabilities : research in the field of cultural aspects of security and personnel's psychological and physiological resistance; research in support to the maintenance of information, command, communication and control systems; research in the area of the equipment and armament modernisation; research in the field of multifunctional weapon and ammunition systems; research in the area of the logistics of troops and forces. Financial support for defence research and development is regulated in the State Budget Act which is a premise and a guarantee for the implementation of projects and programmes. After the Armed Forces organisational restructuring becomes a fact the Ministry of Defence's budget funds earmarked for research will be increased up to four times.

## 4.9. Human Resource Management

The new personnel policy and strategy of personnel career development involves the coherent implementation of the principles of rotation, openness and democracy. Apart from the position and rank succession requirement the order of performance appraisal has also been streamlined. The career development model has been set up and an effective mechanism of motivating servicemen for professional development built.

A key understanding in formulating the Ministry's social policy is that the main defence activities have to be carried out by a highly qualified and socially stable personnel who, with its training level and personal commitment, can guarantee the accomplishment of the tasks on the country's defence. Implementation of this concept is achievable if career personnel are provided with supplemetary social benefits such as accommodation, health and social security (including supplementary insurance), development of an appropriate remuneration system taking into account of the specificities of defence jobs, and social adaptation of servicemen released from military service. An important element of the social policy are the activities related to the social integration of the national minority groups in the Bulgarian Armed Forces.

## 4.10. Procurement

Procurement of armament, ammunitions, military equipment, support materiel and other supplies for the Armed Forces is based on a tender procedure in strict observance of the Public Procurement Act and the associated regulatory acts. Depending on the needs and limits

![79_image_0.png](79_image_0.png)

on materials, orders are placed as to the type and quantity of supplies and the military-technical requirements to them in accordance with the standardising documents, the priorities and the storage sites they are to be delivered from.

The procurement system is being permanently optimised with a view to guaranteeing quality and timely delivery of ordered items by improving the regulatory framework and establishing bodies of forwarding and control on quality of deliveries.

The defence procurement aims at providing the necessary material resources for maintaining and developing defence capability adequate to the security environment. The leading procurement principle is the "package capability", i.e. comprehensive and complete equipping of the operational defence structures with optimised combat and support components. The system of maintaining the storage stock is set up in order to meet the needs of the Armed Forces in terms of the time necessary for the production capacities to make and deliver the military and non-military articles needed in times of crises.

In the market economy environment the defence procurement follows the competitive tender principle of public deliveries.

The quality guarantee and management of the military and special production comprise the activities in the whole life cycle of the product  from the idea, through the processes of design, development, production, contracting, repair, exploitation, storage and upgrading, to its writing-off. The quality management of the military and special production is carried

![79_image_1.png](79_image_1.png)

out by applying the main principles of the international, European and Euro-Atlantic directives and standards adopted by the Republic of Bulgaria and in compliance with the principles of continuousness, comprehensiveness, effectiveness and efficiency in the spending of the financial and material resources. The Ministry of Defence builds and maintains a system of control over the material flows in kind and value with a view to cleavage and utilisation of property upon its full depreciation. The surplus armament, equipment, infrastructural facilities and other long-term assets are regularly offered for sale on the national and international market. The management of the real estate is based on the continuous maintenance of a data base along inventory nomenclatures with an analysis of the current status. 4.11. Assisting Civil Authorities and Participation in Non-Military Crisis Management The organisation, coordination and control on prevention, reduction and remedial actions in non-military crises are carried out by the Council of Ministers, ministries, departments, local authority and administration bodies and companies in accordance with their competence. The government through the Standing Committee for protection of the population against disasters, emergencies and accidents, headed by a minister and members who are representatives of the central state administration, is responsible for the management of this activity. 

The ministers, departments, regional administrations and municipalities set up similar committees as well. A specialised standing structure under the Council of Ministers is the Civil Protection Agency responsible for removal and remedial action in cases of disasters, emergencies and accidents.

Having in mind the globalisation of the problems concerning the protection of the population from natural disasters and industrial accidents, the Civil Protection Agency of the Republic of Bulgaria launched the initiative of setting up Civil-Military Emergency Planning Council of the South East European states. An agreement for such a Council was reached in June 2000.

Actions are coordinated and harmonised with the efforts of NATO, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre at NATO's General Headquarters, the Stability Pact and the South East Europe Initiative.

## 4.12. Public Relations And Public Support For Defence And The Armed Forces

In its relations with the media and society the Ministry of Defence is guided by the principles of timely and accurate dissemination of information where all users enjoy equal rights; access to information about the Armed Forces with strict observance of the requirements of preserving the state and official secret; inadmissability of party propaganda, continuity and honesty of the Armed Forces-society dialogue and commitment to the subdivisions' specific tasks. The Ministry of Defence carries out a programme aimed at keeping the society informed about the progress, objectives and importance of the reform in Armed Forces, the country's participation in the Partnership for Peace Initiative, about clarifying the prospects of and practical steps on joining NATO, about the preservation, development and further enrichment of Bulgarian Armed Forces's traditions and values.

The programme is carried out by consecutively applying 4 professionally developed PR
strategies. Special importance is attached to using the opportunities which the Internet provides.

The military clubs as centres of cultural and military-patriotic activity and as a real link between the military and society develop their activity all over the country and cover all the units of the Armed Forces and the main target goups. An important goal of the military clubs is to raise the level of public support for the military reform and NATO integration. The military clubs help maintain contacts with 43 regional newspapers and over 70 regional

![81_image_0.png](81_image_0.png)

television and radio stations. 

![81_image_1.png](81_image_1.png) The clubs are the basis for the work of military-patriotic unions and youth organisations set up to them in the regional centres. They implement the programmes providing cultural and information support for the Partnership for Peace exercises carried out in the country and do most of the work on organising cultural recreation for the servicemen and their families as well as qualification courses for servicemen transferred to the reserve.

## National Defence Resources 5.1. State Policy In The Field Of Defence Resources Planning

The course of the political changes in the 90-s of the 20th century brought about a reduction in government expenditures on defence throughout the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The military budgets, in conformity with the new environment, required that new approaches be sought to solve the problems of the Armed Forces' operational and combat training, armament and equipment modernisation, infrastructure maintenance, as well as the investment policies in the national defence sector. 

The state policy for defence economic resources planning is aimed at maintaining, allocating and utilising the resources with a view to securing the effective implementation of all tasks concerning the country's security. The policy is implemented by means of:
 regulating the relations among the economic entities to the benefit of the further development of the free-market economy; maintaining the infrastructure for the production of goods and services in the country and securing its well-balanced development; efficiency and transparency in planning, spending and accounting for the resources. 

These requirements demand significant changes in the defence resources utilisation mechanisms. 

The changes have to be directed towards disposing of redundant property and infrastructure,

![83_image_1.png](83_image_1.png) reducing the Armed Forces number, developing the system for management of civilian resources for defence and the crisis management system, restructuring the companies whose principal is the Minister of Defence and relieving the Armed Forces from economic activities that are not typical for them. International co-operation and integration ensure better opportunities for implementation of the programmes and plans in the military-technological field. Thus the resource deficit can be made up to a certain extent and provision will be made for modernising the remaining armament and facilities, developing the C4ISR systems' infrastructure, improving the infrastructure, the maintenance of a dual-use infrastructure, and rearmament with new arms systems in the longer term. 

Despite the reform drive in society the realistic assessment of resources reveals that radical changes in the defence system will be carried out within a transitional period up to 2010 when the restructuring of the Armed Forces will be finally completed: they will be relieved of redundant property and activities, and will largely have achieved a professionalisation and interoperability with the NATO member states' Armed Forces. 

## 5.2. Resource Capacity For Maintaining Defence Capabilities

The Republic of Bulgaria's economic capacity in the defence sector is apparent in the steadily growing GDP and the proportionate absolute growth of the defence expenditure while its share remains about 2,88 - 3,1 % of the GDP. Thus a stable resources base is sustained which will guarantee the maintenance and development of the country's defence capabilities. The defence expenditure amounts to 21 % of the overall government expenditure (Chart 15).

![84_image_0.png](84_image_0.png)

Chart 15

![85_image_0.png](85_image_0.png)

The estimated macroeconomic framework of defence spending (Table 2) shows a rising trend as a percentage of the GDP.

AN ESTIMATED MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK OF THE DEFENCE SPENDING FOR THE PERIOD 2001 -2007
(in min N)
A comparison of expenditures on major appropriations is shown in Figure 3.

These terms illustrate the minimum, necessary to provide the implementation of the reform in the Armed Forces and the fulfillment of the country's international commitments on training of forces for participation in peace support operations.

BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS
Figure 3

![85_image_1.png](85_image_1.png)

The analysis of the budget indicators reveals a regular tendency towards a moderate increase in operational and maintenance costs and a steady growth of the investment expenditures; the latter will have reached the lower limit of NATO's member states by the end of the planned period. The growing capital expenditures result from the reduction of the Armed Forces in terms of size, armament and facilities, the optimisation its organisational and functional structure, and discharge of redundant infrastructure. 

Investment expenditures will be focused in six major areas: Improving the quality of life of the personnel; Up-grading the adopted armament systems, in the cases where the latter's construction allows for such up-grading; Re-armement by introducing modern, licensed systems; Purchase and utilisation of high technologies for the production of military items within the country; Joint development of systems with leading companies; Research to raise the efficiency of the arms systems. Allocating a relatively high share of the budget for personnel costs will be maintained because of the military reform's mass scale and the stated national priority - the people working in the defence sector who must acquire high professional skills, an adequate social status, and a strong motivation to work in the Armed Forces.

An important economic feature of the Armed Forces' state are the costs per serviceman, calculated in USD in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP).

Figures 4 and 5 show the tendency towards growth of this indicator which is essential for the Armed Forces build-up as a function of the planned reduction of the personnel. The available defence resources and their forecasted growth in the medium-term perspec-

![86_image_0.png](86_image_0.png)

Figure 4 Figure 5

![87_image_0.png](87_image_0.png)

tive provide sufficient grounds to consider as realistic the establishment of formations that are highly mobile, sustainable, combat ready, NATO interoperable, capable to take part on an equal footing in multi-national peace support operations, and to support and assist the population in the event of natural disasters and accidents, and to participate in humanitarian and national defence operations.

## 5.3. Defence Resource Management

![87_Image_1.Png](87_Image_1.Png)

In 2000 the Ministry of Defence introduced the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System (PPBS) which is compatible with NATO planning systems, as well as a 6-year planning cycle in line with NATO cycle (Chart 16). This modern and unique system makes it possible to define the tasks of the Armed Forces depending on the national and regional security conditions, to analyse the available resources and to develop 6-year defence programmes. In the annual adoption of the programmes a risk assessment is undertaken and the next budgetary mid-term period is updated. This system allows for the most expedient and prioritised defence spending and for maximum transparency of the spending.

The defence resources planning and management is the immediate responsibility of the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff, as well as their subordinate commands and staffs. The defence resources management process is actually quite complicated and requires a highlevel of coordination among the different hierarchical units. Hence the necessity to set up a Programming Council and a Modernisation Council whose proposals are submitted to the Defence Council, where decisions on the final allocation along the major military items of the budget are made, and spending priorities set. 

Apart from establishing a rational mechanism for defence resources planning and management, the system provides favourable conditions of an effective civilian control on the expediency of the Defence Ministry's budget spending, and transparency of all activities undertaken in the Armed Forces sector.

CHAPTER FIVE 
Programming - the system's most important feature, is a process of detecting and specifying

![88_image_0.png](88_image_0.png)

the mix of all factors, guaranteeing that the strategic goals and tasks within the restricted budget are met. The programmes will be developed for a six-year period thus taking into account NATO's planning cycle, and these programmes are annually updated. Such a budget allocation secures the maintenance of the Armed Forces' forecasted structure, their training according to NATO's norms, and up-grading armament and facilities to a certain extent. The structure of the main defence programmes for 2002 is shown in Table 3. The programme-based budget allocation 
(Figure 6) is the result of a detailed assessment of the capabilities and priorities in establishing the Armed Forces, the latter's prospects of development, reflected in the military reform plans. The programme-based resource management will contribute to reaching the optimal option and cycle of the staff reduction, and the armament and facilities reduction, so that the levels, stipulated by the reform plans, are gradually reached.

The programme structure is not fixed : annually it undergoes changes to the effect that the programming procedures are optimised, and the Armed Forces defence programmes are most efficiently implemented. 5.4. Modernisation of Armament and Facilities, and Optimisation of the Military Infrastructure The heavy infrastructure, armament and facilities, inherited from the former defence system, caused great problems to implementing the reform because of its resource-intensiveness. It also proved to be redundant and no longer had to be maintained. The need to focus the scarce resources priority sectors led to radical measures to make the

![89_image_0.png](89_image_0.png)

defence material basis appropriate to the contemporary conditions in the country and its economic capacity.

5.4.1. Disposal of Redundant Properties, Armament and Facilities and Infrastructure The timely disposal of redundant properties, armament and facilities, ammunitions, infrastructure and sites up to a limit which will guarantee that the Armed Forces meet their functions and goals, will be a premise for the implementation of the up-grading programmes, and the programmes on improving the military bases' condition. The disposal of redundant infrastructure is carried out by transferring it to state-owned agencies and municipalities which will function as intermediaries in privatising the state-owned property.

As a result of the reform, some 539 Armed Forces' regions and sites were closed down, among which over 3 000 buildings were declared redundant. During the present 2002 year over 82 such sites are to be disposed of.

Despite the Ministry of Defence's efforts to build and fully utilise the infrastructure objects, their specific characteristics, dislocation and the market conditions create difficulties and delay the disposition process.

A great deal of armament and facilities were made redundant due to the reform - over 700 tanks, over 300 combat armoured vehicles and over 800 artillery systems proved to be redundant within the Land Forces. 

By the end of the reform, the Air Force will have disposed of over 200 aircraft and helicopters, and the Navy will have dismantled about 10 ships and 4 helicopters.

The missile complexes P-300 (Scud) and P-400 (SS-23) will be dismantled and destroyed. After being dismantled, certain items of military equipment and facilities will be offered for sale. Unless the latter are sold within the fixed period, they will either be donated or destroyed. With regard to the sales of the arms systems the UN Security Council's resolutions will be observed as well as the provisions regarding the imports of dual-use armament and products, agreed upon under the Vassenaar Agreement. The result of the dismantlement of the redundant quantities will be the greater availability of resources which may thus be utilised to up-grade the armament and facilities or to develop or purchase new and up-dated weapons. 

## 5.4.2. Modernisation Of Armament And Facilities And Military Infrastructure 

![91_Image_1.Png](91_Image_1.Png)

The modernisation of armament and facilities is carried out in three stages: First stage - encompassing the period up to 2002 during which the development of the national modernisation strategy will be the priority issue; this strategy will be backed up by the plans and programmes for its implementation. Second stage - modernisation of armament and facilities, following the priorities set for the period 2003 - 2007; Third stage - modernisation of the remaining armament and facilities - up to the year 2015. In order to modernise armament and facilities in 2002, 175 mln leva will be provided which will be channelled into the following modernisation programmes: 1.6. Modernisation and re-armament of the Land Forces 2.6. Modernisation and re-armament of the Air Force 3.6. Modernisation and re-armament of the Navy 4.8. Modernisation of the Logistics System 10 . Research and development 12. Development of the command, control, computers, communications, information, surveillance and reconnaissance systems (Ñ4ISR).

The modernisation of the C4ISR systems will be focused on raising the functional capacity of communications and information systems (CIS)
to the effect that information is readily provided in real time at all levels and structures of the command and control systems, and interoperability with NATO systems is achieved. The central activity in this respect relates to developing strategically-oriented products for commercial use (COTS) and high technologies, establishing a National Military Command Centre as a centralised unit to administer crises on a strategic level, supplying the complete equipment of FICIS for a mechanised brigade and the subdivisions that are to take part in NATO-led peace support operations.

The priority issues concerning the modernisation of the Land Forces include equipment, ammunitions and medical support for the troops and staff, participating in PfP drills and exercises, and operations of multinational forces. Other issues of primary importance relate to improving and modernising the artillery's surveillance and target-setting systems, and creating the conditions that will facilitate the conduction of both strategic and technological computer-aided exercises. A medium-term objective is to develop autonomous ground sensors
(robots) to detect, identify and monitor combat equipment and staff, and implement the "Soldier of the Future" concept. The modernisation of the Air Forces and the Air Defence (AD) will be aimed at raising the capabilities to achieve NATO interoperability. The latter will be carried out by modernising some of the available aircraft and air defence systems; and in the long term a supply of new armament will be necessary. A gradual re-armament of aircraft and equipment which take part in NATO-led operations within the Partnership for Peace Initiative, will be carried out in a short-term perspective; the latter concerns the modernisation of the MIG-29 fleet. Favourable opprotunities will thus be provided for the integration of the Air Sovereignty Operational Centre (ASOC) to NATO's Integrated Air Defence System. The modernisation of the Navy will include up-grading the frigates command and control system, the coast radio-location control system guaranteeing the safety of navigation and shipping, and our sea border security; the modernisation also presupposes some extra equipment for the communications and information systems. Auxiliary ships and tankers will be up-graded so as to meet NATO standards. The harbour facilities, securing petrol and fresh water supplies will be re-furbished. Long-term programmes to acquire new ships, including two or three patrol ships and fast patrol boats are now being negotiated. The modernisation of logistics support will be focused on setting up communications and information logistics systems which are NATO interoperable -
thus the logistics support provided to staff and troops will be up to NATO standards.

The airports', harbours' and railway stations' capacity to support allied forces will be considerably expanded. The modernisation of armament and facilities will be carried out in compliance with the Modernisation

and Re-armament Plan, that is

![93_image_1.png](93_image_1.png)

![93_image_2.png](93_image_2.png) now being developed. This plan will set a number of new requirements and priorities, adequate and relevant to the Armed Forces' needs and the country resource availability. 5.5. Maintaining the Defence Industrial Base The defence industrial base's major function will be to provide for the demands of armament and combat equipment and offer services to efficiently implement all defence objectives and tasks. The national defence industry includes the industrial sector which have the capacity to perform the following:
 Production of light rifle, mortar and artillery armament and ammunition for these; antitank and AA equipment; combat vehicles and SP artillery; Overhaul and repair of the dual-use materiel - communication and command systems and means, radio-location systems and optic apparatuses; Production of equipment ad inventory for the logistics, foodstuffs, fuel and lubricants, chemicals, clothing and accoutrements, protection materiel. The National Defence industrial base is finalising the property transfer and its organisational restructuring. It is adapting to the market conditions by means of:
 New products and optimisation of the

![94_image_0.png](94_image_0.png) production and technological links and co-operation in the production of articles; Internal regulation of the production balance of goods and services and lowering the costs for maintaining material asset reserves with limited technological and exploitation resources; Harmonisation of the quality management systems of the mass and special production with the EU and NATO requirements.

The leading producers of defence production such as Arkus, Arsenal, Beta, VMZ, Dunarit, Elektron Progres, Samel90, Cherno more, Armitech, Radomirmetali, Alukom, KPZ are privatised or in the process of privatisation. There are also newly established private producers of armament. At present there are more than 20 companies which have the capacity to produce special production and more than 100 companies which can participate in co-operation production for the needs of the Armed Forces. The restructuring of the economic activity of the Ministry of Defence, which has adopted the appropriate policy for a free-market economy, has resulted in the establishment of the "Terem" Plc (100% state ownership) with an imposing infrastructure and a highly-qualified personnel. The company has specialised in the repair and maintenance of ammunitions, radars and communications systems, armament and facilities. Four plants for military repair and maintenance - Single Proprietorship, have been included in the privatisation programme (Khan Asparouch, Lyulin, Tzar Kaloyan and Vola). Of them all the Lyulin military repair and maintenance plant was 80% privatised. These processes are a result of the changes in legislation, the expansion of the privatisation process and the liberalisation of the production regime of armaments, facilities and ammunition for them.

Despite the traditional links of the Armed Forces with the main national military articles producers, the Ministry of Defence realises that in the modern world the management of trading companies is not a function it should discharge and it will continue to seek ways of disposing of this function.

The Ministry of Defence continues to play a significant role in the maintenance and development of the defence industrial base in line with the principles and aims of the integration policy expressed in: Creating opportunities for increasing the supplies for defence needs; Introduction of a system of certification and quality management in the production of armament, combat equipment and materiel; Introduction of the systems of codifying the production and material resources necessary for defence; Creating opportunities for a maximum involvement of the Bulgarian industry in the programmes and projects for upgrading the Armed Forces on a contractual and subcontractual basis or in the off-set programmes of foreign suppliers.

![95_image_0.png](95_image_0.png)

In order to rationalise the relations with the defence industry companies the Ministry of Defence applies a single management cycle for the defence research, public procurement and coordination of modernisation programmes and projects, control over the production of facilities and equipment for defence needs. The public procurement system which is being developed further provides for maintaining the necessary capacities at a level of readiness which allows for the future integration of the producers in the Euro-Atlantic industrial complex. The significance of the defence industrial base is expressed not only in the ability to provide for the current needs and the modernisation of the Bulgarian Armed Forces but in establishing the country as a regional centre for the repair of main types of armament and equipment for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and a supplier of military production for the logistics system of NATO member states.

## 5.6. National Infrastructure To Maintain The Defence Capability

![95_Image_1.Png](95_Image_1.Png)

The trends for reductions in the defence infrastructure as a result of the positive development of the strategic environment as well as the free-market economic mechanisms required that new dual-use technologies be introduced, and civil infrastructure be utilised to meet the demands of the national defence sector. Apart from economic expediency, the orientation towards an infrastructure of a universal nature is an integration priority, bringing us closely to the industrial practice adopted by the EU. 

The first steps in utilising the dual-use infrastructure were made at the Sarafovo airport during operation Enduring Freedom. It was then that an Americal airborne unit base was set up successfully accomplishing its mission. Naturally the provision of such favourable conditions requires the development and implementation of the respective infrastructural projects, such as: 
 An airport has to meet NATO standards.

![96_image_0.png](96_image_0.png) The training centres of the Land Forces are to be improved. A central facility for military topography is to be set up. A joint information centre is to be established. The operational forces' training ranges need to be improved. The Air Force's training facility in Shabla needs to be improved. 

 A central laboratory for nuclear, chemical and bacteriological protection is to be established. 

 Four depots are to be reconstructed so as to meet NATO's fuel and lubricants standards. Airport, port and railway station facilities are to be improved to facilitate the deployment and advance of troops. Having in mind the available resources which are still limited, Bulgaria has the ambition to participate in NATO's infrastructural programme. The latter will contribute to implementing the priority infrastructural projects, and will accelerate the military reforms. Participation in NATO's infrastructural programme will make our country an integral part of the European and North Atlantic security and stability system and the community of economic and cultural prosperity.
