## Introduction

The National Security Strategy of Montenegro (hereinafter: the Strategy) represents a strategic document that defines the development and functioning of the system of national security of Montenegro and it is an expression of its commitment to be a part of regional and international (UN, NATO, EU and OSCE) security systems. Based on established national interests, security challenges, risks and threats, the Strategy defines security goals, possible reactions of the state of Montenegro, national security system and required resources. The Strategy confirms the commitment of Montenegro to undertake all necessary activities so as to meet the conditions for its integration into the European, Euro-Atlantic and other international security structures. In that context, the strategic goal of Montenegro is to become a fully fledged NATO and EU member as soon as possible. Having that goal in mind, Montenegro has joined NATO Partnership for Peace Program and signed the Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU. The Strategy represents the basis for an essential reform of the national security sector, as well as for normative adaptation and further development of the national security system. The Strategy is a document that serves as the basis for reforming security and defence sectors in Montenegro and it can be amended and adjusted to the extent of innovation and improvement of the security system. 

## 1. Strategic Goal

The strategic goal of Montenegro is to build an integrated and functional security system that enables prevention, management and resolution of possible crises, conflicts and disputes, regardless of their level and character, and in compliance with international standards and principles. The achievement of the above mentioned goal will create a positive environment for efficient protection and defence of vital national and social values and interests as defined by the Constitution of Montenegro. 

## 2. **Security Interests And Objectives Of Montenegro**

Montenegro is focused on the realization of its national interests and security objectives based on the principles of a developed democracy, rule of law, market economy and its orientation towards Euro-Atlantic and European integrations with full respect of international law and internationally accepted principles of peaceful resolution of disputes. If necessary, Montenegro will use all available capabilities and resources to protect its national interests. National interests constitute the most important needs of Montenegro and its citizens. They derive from the highest values of Montenegro established by the Constitution, and they are: freedom, equality, ethnic and gender equality, stability of society, social justice, human rights, safety of property, preservation of nature and environment, rule of law and democracy. A peaceful and stable environment, protection of life and property of citizens and development of democracy represent important national interests. Foreign and security policy of Montenegro is especially directed to developing good neighbourly relations and strengthening regional cooperation with the objective to establish confidence and to promote peace in South East Europe, as well as membership in international and regional organizations. Montenegro believes that small countries can best provide and solve their own security by accessing the system of collective security. Montenegro actively participates and contributes to stability and security in the region and Euro-Atlantic community by being actively engaged in regional initiatives and processes and through bilateral and multilateral cooperation with partners and Allies. Starting from economic progress and progress in overall already undertaken reforms and integrative processes, Montenegro wishes to establish new, quality relations with NATO, which should strengthen our role and responsibility in the stability and security of Euro-Atlantic space. The enlargement of the North Atlantic Alliance to the region of West Balkans will strengthen and further build the area where joint values shared by NATO (democracy, rule of law and human and minority rights) are reigning. This will also additionally stabilize and unite the region which shares common goals and integrative processes. Since the process of joining EU is a strategic priority of Montenegro, harmonization with European Union's *Common Foreign and Security Policy* as well as with European Security and Defence Policy as its integral part will constitute the framework for the development of our attitudes towards regional, European and global issues. Regional cooperation and relations with neighbours are of key importance for realizing stability and security, both of the whole region and of Montenegro itself, but they are also a precondition for progress in Euro-Atlantic and European integrations. Becoming full member of regional security initiatives, Montenegro will further strengthen mechanisms of security and political co-operation. Montenegro is developing good relations and communication with its neighbours, along with mutual respect and permanent building of political, economic and cultural contacts and cooperation, and especially linking and cooperation in the area of security. 

Recognizing that the development of all of these relations is of exceptional significance for the security and stabilization of the region, Montenegro can rely upon a safe place in a stable region and making the accession to Euro-Atlantic and European integration more dynamic. Montenegro realizes the priorities and objectives of its security and foreign policy by accessing and actively participating in the work of international organizations - United Nations, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Council of Europe and others. The special engagement in the UN and OSCE on the building and active participation in collective security will enable Montenegro to additionally affirm its position with regard to areas such as: participation in international peace and humanitarian operations and missions, non-proliferation of weapons, arms control, as well as weapons of mass destruction and in a series of other activities that are significant for the promotion of international role of Montenegro within these organizations. The security interests and objectives of Montenegro are: 
1. defending the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Montenegro; 2. protecting the lives and property of citizens and economic goods, 3. defence capacities development, 4. integration into NATO and European Union, 5. promoting the policy of good-neighbourly relations and cooperation on the regional and global level, 6. strengthening democracy, rule of law, full protection of human and minority rights, 7. full legal organization in the field of national security in line with Constitutional provisions, international law norms and international obligations undertaken by Montenegro, 8. strengthening independence, autonomy and efficiency of the judiciary, accessibility of judicial authorities and public trust in the judiciary, 9. strengthening the capacities of Montenegro for combating terrorism, organized crime and corruption, strengthening the security of borders, 10. strengthening the process of transparency of the defence sector and civilian control of the armed forces, 11. strengthening the capacities and institutions responsible for management in emergency situations caused by natural, technical-technological (manmade), biological, chemical, nuclear, radiological and other accidents, 12. contributing to stability and world peace by demonstrating its international solidarity, participating actively in combating terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in de-mining, in humanitarian and peace-keeping operations, and by allowing the possibility of use its land, air and sea space to support the missions undertaken by the UN, NATO, EU and OSCE, 
13. stimulating sustainable economic development through growing economic freedoms and strengthening the role of entrepreneurship, 14. improving the standard of living of citizens by offering better quality public services through efficient education, health and social protection systems, 15. encouraging research, development and use of new technologies, 16. ensuring conditions needed for the protection of tradition, culture, language, national identity and customs, 17. ensuring the protection of information resources of Montenegro from unauthorized access or modification of information while storing, processing or transferring them, including the measures of detection, documentation and elimination of threats, 18. preservation and protection of nature, healthy environment and promotion of sustainable development. 

## 3. **Challenges, Risks And Threats Against The Security Of** Montenegro

Montenegro belongs both to the Balkan and Mediterranean area and is a part of the region which was overcome by dynamic changes in the previous period. The current security situation in Montenegro should be viewed in the regional context as well. Taking into consideration its historical heritage and positive trends after the renewal of its independence, Montenegro has a specific place and significant role in the region stability. Montenegro shares the strategic approach to challenges, risks and threats against the national security, which are defined in NATO strategic documents. The range of challenges, risks, and threats is wide. It is characterized by rapid change, unpredictability, complexity and reduced significance of geographic distance. The region is still burdened by past events and unsolved problems, which may cause instability in smaller areas. The danger from military threat to Montenegro is significantly reduced today as a consequence of the reduction of military assets in the region, integration of countries into NATO and EU and development of a policy of confidence, cooperation and partnership, but it can not be excluded in the future. Taking into consideration the position of Montenegro, security can be negatively influenced by the crises in the immediate surrounding, but in the wider area as well, especially in the area covered by the Middle East, Caucasus and North Africa. In these areas that have been destabilized by crises, conflicts, demographic growth and reduction of strategic resources (water, energy), the demonstration of transnational threats and the transferring of crises towards Europe is increasingly expressed. Intensifying transnational risks and threats in the region and wider, primarily international terrorism and organized crime may have a negative impact on the national security of Montenegro. International terrorism and organized crime pose serious threat to international peace and security. These phenomena, regardless of whether their source is in the immediate surrounding or beyond it, are realistic security risks and threats for Montenegro. Organized crime and its consequences (destabilization of state institutions, undermining legal order and economic system, and corruption) represent a security risk to Montenegro. Security risks and threats to Montenegro also include: **smuggling of narcotic drugs,** weapons, illegal migrations, human trafficking and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Consequences of the globalization process as well as problems of transition: the growing global difference between rich and the poor countries along with the political consequences of that inequality, as well as economic and social problems, may have a negative impact on the economic interests and development of Montenegro as well. 

Risks and threats to the security of Montenegro may be created by natural, technicaltechnological (manmade), chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological catastrophes, epidemics, as well as terrorism consequences. Surplus obsolete armaments and ammunition poses major security risk to Montenegro. Ecological threats to world security derive from a series of problems such as: global warming, quantity of harmful gas emission, destruction of ozone, reduction of fertile agricultural areas and potable water reserves. These problems can undermine the stability and security of certain parts of the world and such disorders could reflect on the global security as well, therefore including the security of Montenegro. The increase in the use of information technologies is making Montenegro more endangered in the field of information security. Traffic infrastructure, telecommunication network, health and social system, financial system and procurement are only a few of areas the functioning of which could be limited or completely paralysed by cyber crime. 

## 4. Reaction Of The State To Security Challenges, Risks And Threats

Montenegro achieves the objectives of its security policy by implementing a strategy of cooperation on the *national* and *international level*. On the national level, comprehensive and flexible security cooperation consists of assigning specific tasks and corresponding resources to various entities contributing to security at different levels, along with mutually coordinated cooperation in their deployment within an integrated system. Comprehensive cooperation requires the employment and cooperation of various authorities at different levels (state, municipal and other). Flexible cooperation enables combination of the most appropriate measures and resources to be employed, based on realistic needs. International security cooperation should consist of preventive and, where appropriate, reactive involvement, too. Through coordinated multinational cooperation, Montenegro will contribute to crisis management, stabilization of the region by eliminating tensions and general mutual reinforcement of security measures. Montenegro will also have as its objective the strengthening of its relations with other countries and international organizations, primarily for the purpose of creating a system of appropriate agreements on joint security and defence. Cooperation at both national and international level implies continuous and intensive activities on streamlining the Montenegrin resources and making them more functional. Montenegro will undertake all necessary measures to reduce the risks and to protect the state, its institutions and the population against security threats by establishing an efficient system of security and by building confidence and partnership with other countries and international organizations. 

## 4.1. National Security States

Depending on the level of danger for national security, the security state in Montenegro can be: *regular, state of emergency and state of war.* 
Regular state constitutes circumstances void of significant real threats against the national security, enabling the public authority structures and citizens to freely work and perform their regular tasks. State of emergency constitutes the situation in which the level of danger against national security has been realistically appraised as exceptionally high and requiring the undertaking of special measures for the security of state. During state of emergency, normal functioning of public structures is seriously and completely endangered. State of war constitutes situations when Montenegro is in immediate danger of war, when a war is declared against or when it has been attacked. Establishing the level of danger for each of these states, relevant indicators and measures that need to be undertaken in all of these cases and other relevant details are 

## 4.2. Missions

Montenegro is ready to respond to risks and threats against national and international security, by executing the following four **missions**: 4.2.1. Defence: Montenegro developing and maintaining its capability to protect and defend its sovereignty, borders, territory, air and sea space and its population against threats and use of force of strategic magnitude. Protection and defence capability implies: maintenance of a credible defence capability; an efficient and flexible system of homeland security; high standards of equipment and training; a degree of readiness that can be adapted to various developments and interoperable forces capable to act jointly with the forces of other states. 

4.2.2. Maintaining and enhancing internal security by protecting the Constitutional order, democratic political system, human rights and basic freedoms and other values defined by the Constitution and law and maintaining internal stability. In order to successfully maintain internal security of Montenegro, special significance have security and protection of borders which are realized through a system of integrated border management and cooperation with other countries, contributing to efficient fight against terrorism and organized crime. 4.2.3. Managing emergency situations caused by natural disasters, ecological, technical-technological (manmade), chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological disasters, epidemics, as well as consequences of terrorism and other hazards that might create risks and threats against the security of Montenegro and the region. It will participate in provision of aid to endangered persons on the international level in cases of natural, technical-technological (manmade) and other disasters. 

## 4.2.4. Participation In International Peace And Humanitarian Operations Led By Un, Nato And Eu:

Montenegro is determined to contribute to the building and preservation of peace on the regional and global level. During decision making process on the participation in international peace and humanitarian operations, the following will be taken into account: international-legal basis of the mandate, integration objectives of Montenegro, available resources, location of hotspot and influence on the national security. 

## 5. National Security System

The system of national security represents the functional unity of all elements of the state for the purpose of ensuring the protection of national interests and values of Montenegro. 

Montenegro gives particular importance to the role of civil society, civil-military and civilpolice cooperation in the area of security, as well as to the development of the civil sector and institutions of the national security system. Montenegro is developing a functionally integrated national security system that provides for: 
1. effective functioning of system elements in all conditions for the purpose of ensuring the protection of Montenegrin interests and values; 2. interoperability of national security elements and rational use of resources; 3. coordination and efficient management of the national security system; 4. even development of all system elements; 5. transparent operations of all system elements; 6. the necessary personnel professionalism and state ability to act preventively with regard to challenges, risks and threats to security and to adequately respond to them; 7. contribution to regional and global security. 

The system of national security is subject to democratic and civilian control. 

## 5.1. Structure Of The National Security System

The structure of the national security system consists of state institutions and authorities, which manage, plan, organize, harmonize and implement measures and activities in the security system. The basic elements of the national security system are: the Parliament of Montenegro, the President of Montenegro, the Government of Montenegro, the Defence and Security Council, security forces, forces for action in emergency situations, the National Security Agency, the Public Prosecutor's Office and courts. Security forces are army and police. Their use is regulated by the law. Security forces are under parliamentary and democratic oversight and civilian control. Army is leading institution in defence and constitutes an armed force defending independence, sovereignty and state territory of Montenegro, contributing to the building and preservation of international peace in line with principles of international law that regulate the use of force. The Army supports civilian authorities in natural or manmade disasters and can be engaged as support to the police in combating terrorism. Police provides general, personal and security of property and protection of citizens. The police is leading institution in internal security, performing activities related to prevention and suppression of all forms of crime, especially of organized crime and corruption, protection of human rights, supervision and control of state border, securing public peace and order, security of citizens and traffic. It is leading institution in combating terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, corruption and drugs. Forces for action in emergency situations are organized as a part of integrated response to emergency situations caused by natural, ecological, technical-technological (manmade), chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological and other disasters, as well as terrorism consequences and other hazards that might create risks and threats to the security of Montenegro and of the region. Leading institution in emergency situations (hazard management, protection and rescue and elimination of consequences in emergency situations) is a ministry responsible for internal affairs. The National Security Agency, as a part of an integrated security system, in cooperation with national authorities, ministries and administration authorities, in line with security standards, pursuant to the Constitution and laws, performs national security affairs, which are related to the protection of order as established by the Constitution, security and territorial integrity of Montenegro, human rights and freedoms defined by the Constitution, as well as other affairs of interest for the national security of Montenegro. The Public Prosecutor's Office is a single and independent national authority performing affairs of prosecuting criminal offenders and perpetrators of other punishable acts which are prosecuted ex officio. Affairs of the Public Prosecutor's Office are performed by the Public Prosecutor. Criminal offences classified as organized crime, corruption, terrorism and war crimes fall under the competence of the Special Prosecutor. Courts are independent and autonomous. A court adjudicates based on the Constitution, laws and ratified and published international agreements. Establishment of kangaroo and extraordinary courts is prohibited. 

The Supreme Court is the highest court in Montenegro. The Supreme Court ensures a unified implementation of laws by courts. All persons are entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time before an independent, impartial court established by law. Without an efficient judicial system, it is not possible to realize the interest and objectives of Montenegro in the field of national security. The other elements of the national security system are: citizens, sufficient associations of citizens, companies, agencies for private protection of facilities, local self-government, institutions and organizations of importance for security and defence. They perform their security and defence related tasks in accordance with the Constitution and laws. Apart from the execution of their basic mission, elements of the national security system, when needed, support other elements when executing missions. 

## 5.2. National Security System Management

The national security system management is regulated by the Constitution of Montenegro, respective laws and bylaws for their implementation. 

Integrated management of the security system enables coordination and cooperation of various organizations and institutions performing joint and combined civilian, police and military duties at the state level or local self-government level in situations of regular, emergency and state of war. The national security system management is exercised by: **the Parliament of** Montenegro, the President of Montenegro, the Government of Montenegro and the Defence and Security Council. The Parliament of Montenegro adopts legislation; issues the Strategy of National Security and the Strategy of Defence; declares state of war and state of emergency; renders decisions on the deployment of forces in international missions; exercises oversight over the Army and security services. It is responsible for ensuring the legal preconditions for functioning of the national security and defence sector. The President of Montenegro chairs the meetings of the National Security Council, acts as the Commander in Chief of the army on basis of the decisions of the National Security Council and decides about its employment in accordance with the law. The Government of Montenegro runs the national security policy by: 
1. proposing the National Security Strategy, Strategy of Defence and laws in this area; 2. implementing the National Security Strategy; 3. monitoring the national security state; 4. adopting a decree having legal force during state of emergency or state of war, if the Parliament of Montenegro is not able to meet; 5. establishing the organization of work of public administration authorities in case of state of emergency or state of war; 6. signing and taking care on implementation of international treaties and agreements in the area of national security and compatibility of national legislation with international documents, 7. ensuring material and financial resources for the needs of the national security system and the required level of operational and combat capability of the security forces. 

The Defence and Security Council renders decisions on commanding the Army of Montenegro; analyzes and evaluates the security situation in Montenegro and renders decisions needed for undertaking appropriate measures; proposes to the Parliament to declare state of war or state of emergency and proposes deployment of the armed forces in international missions. The Defence and Security Council of Montenegro consist of: the President of Montenegro, the Speaker of the Parliament and the Prime Minister. 

## 5.3. Resources

Adequate employment of resources of the national security system has a considerable effect on the efficient functioning of the system of national security and it can help in dealing successfully with all security challenges, risks and threats. The basic resources of the national security system are **human** and **material** resources. Human resources represent the basis for the establishment of the national security system. The number and availability of human resources are determined by demographic and other factors. New security challenges, risks and threats require new capabilities and modern training, and that should be especially kept in mind. Development and training of new staff is a key area for the building of a successful security system of Montenegro. To that effect, it is necessary to significantly improve the quality of civil, military and police personnel, primarily by using international cooperation mechanisms and especially to educate specialists for the use and exchange of information, use of modern technology and protection of information systems from cyber terrorism. Material resources include natural, economic, financial, energy, information and other potentials of Montenegro engaged for security and defence needs. The funds for operations and reform of the security and defence system are provided by the Law on the Budget of Montenegro. Budgetary resources for the needs of security and defence are planned and utilized in a transparent manner, compatible with the standards and criteria of the UN, EU and with the NATO recommendations and matching the financial capacities of the state of Montenegro. Montenegro is committed to use available resources in a rational manner, and to integrate them whenever it is justified and possible, with the objective to have a more efficient development and functioning of the national security system. Law regulates human and material resources engagement and monitoring of their use within the national security system. 

## Final Provisions

The Strategy of National Security's starting point is the realistic security condition and it constitutes a framework for the development and functioning of the integrated national security system. The Strategy is the basis for building up the Montenegrin security system, for defining security policy and for the development of strategic, normative and other documents in the area of functioning and development of the security and defence systems. 

All documents regulating the national security of Montenegro must be harmonized with the Strategy. The Strategy is a document subject to amendments depending on the security environment, interests, economic capacities and changes of other relevant factors.
