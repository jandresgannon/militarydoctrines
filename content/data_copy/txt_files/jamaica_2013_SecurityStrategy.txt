## Executive Summary
_Jamaica currently has one of the highest per capita levels of homicide and violent crime in the_
_world. This is the result of a combination of factors including imports of illegal firearms and_
_ammunition, the supply and trans-shipment of illegal narcotics, financial frauds, including_
_Ponzi schemes and the Lottery scam, and opportunities for corruption and extortion, all of_
_which have encouraged the use of violence by criminals._

These problems have been compounded suffering in Jamaica. It is essential to seize the

## Environmental Analysis
_In order to determine the national security priorities it is necessary to identify the main threats_
_to Jamaica. These include threats that constitute a clear and present danger (e.g. the high rate_
_of homicide), and major risks within a given time horizon (e.g. a storm surge that could flood_
_heavily populated areas), although the strategies for dealing with these are markedly different._

## Probability-Impact Matrix

The threats and risks identified in the horizon scans were weighted and ranked in a
probability-impact matrix, using the following parameters:

       - The probability that an event will occur within a given time horizon.

       - An estimate of the impact of each event in terms of fatalities, economic loss, and the risk
of civil unrest.

Each category in the Probability-Impact Matrix corresponds to a Threat Tier, and each Tier is
assigned an appropriate response, as follows:

6 There is a controversy about the homicide data for Venezuela. The official statistics for 2011 indicated that the homicide rate was
48/100,000, although independent estimates suggested that it reached 67/100,000. In 2012, the Interior Minister confirmed that the
homicide rate had reached 65/100,000. If this is correct, Venezuela has overtaken Jamaica to become the third most violent country in the
world; because the homicide rate in Venezuela has risen sharply, while the rate in Jamaica has fallen.

The GDP per capita data is shown relative to income in Jamaica, which is set at 100, so that all other
incomes are percentages of income in Jamaica in 1974. In 1974, for example, income in Antigua and
Barbuda was 71% of income in Jamaica. By 2003, income in Antigua and Barbuda was 275% of income in
Jamaica. Every other country in the region, apart from Guyana, became relatively prosperous compared to
Jamaica. Jamaica and Guyana were the only two countries where per capita income actually declined, but
Jamaica’s case is exceptional, for two reasons. One is that it fell from being the regional leader to being
one of the two weakest economies in the region. The other is that Jamaica was not gradually overtaken
by the other countries; there was a remarkably sharp turning point in Jamaica’s fortunes which clearly
marked the beginning of the country’s decline. The inflection point in Jamaica’s development can be seen
in the graph below (from Kn’lfe, 2005)[xiv].

however, Burundi suffered a civil war, while Burkina Faso continued to remain peaceful. As a result, Burkina Faso is now two-and-a-half
times richer than Burundi. The Report concluded that people in developing countries that are badly affected by violence are over twice
as likely to be malnourished, three times as likely to miss primary school and almost twice as likely to die in infancy as people in other
developing countries, and that the countries that are most affected by violence are also the most vulnerable to economic shocks, mainly
because their institutions of government are greatly weakened. The Report also points out that gang-related violence now kills more
people than most wars (in Guatemala, for example, more people are now murdered each year by gangs than were killed in Guatemala’s
civil war in the 1980s) so that countries with high rates of crime and violence are likely to suffer similar consequences of lost economic
growth and perpetuated poverty.

13 It is important to note with a counterfactual analysis of this kind that other factors might have intervened to prevent Jamaica from
achieving this better future, but this comparison does provide some measure of what has been lost.

attributed to Jamaican gangs. One Jamaica-based gang is estimated to have killed over 1,400 people in the USA during the 1980s, while
the arrest of over 100 members of the same gang in Toronto in 2011 resulted in homicide rates in the city immediately falling to a 25-year

16 Two of the most important factors in determining the level of crime are the profit margin and the perceived risk of detection and
punishment. The rate of crime will tend to increase when criminal activity is lucrative and when the risk of detection and punishment is
perceived to be low, so it is important to simultaneously increase the risk of detection and punishment (i.e. with more effective systems of
policing and justice) and remove the profits of crime (by seizing the assets of criminals and their facilitators).

-----

###### Action Points

The fight against the crime that has crippled Jamaica requires decisive leadership. It also
depends on a ‘whole-of-government’ approach. National security is not the sole province
of the portfolio Ministry; key Ministries and Government agencies, such as the Ministries
of Finance and Justice, also have an essential role to play. It is important, therefore:

1. _Establish a permanent framework for inter-Ministerial cooperation on national_
security issues, under the auspices of the National Security Council, which is
chaired by the Prime Minister. Other specific recommendations include:

2. _Establish a task force . The successful prosecution of fraud and money laundering_
cases depends on the ability to manage and integrate complex legal, financial
and personal data from diverse sources and jurisdictions, so it is a high priority
to establish a high-level task force that will integrate the necessary strands of
information. This task force should not be disbanded after a few successes, as
it will take a long time to trace and seize the proceeds of organized crime, break
the power of the major criminals, eliminate the influence of the key facilitators,
destroy their reign of fear and eradicate the pervasive corruption that allowed
criminality to flourish.

3. _Upgrade the intelligence architecture, strengthen technical capacity . It is vital to_
strengthen the technical capacity needed to detect and unravel complex fraud
and money laundering operations.

4. _Establish a special court . The next section of this document outlines proposed_
reforms for the justice system. However, this is likely to be a lengthy process. In
the interim, therefore, it may be necessary to establish a special court with the
necessary technical support and expertise to hear serious cases of organized
crime, fraud and money-laundering[17].

5. _Denial of Assets. There should be automatic denial of tainted assets during_
trial. Criminals should not be allowed to pay their legal fees with the proceeds
of crime. Those accused of crimes such as fraud, extortion or money-laundering
should be required to demonstrate that the funds used to pay their legal fees
were obtained legitimately, and they should only be allowed to draw moderate
living expenses from frozen assets while their case is being determined.

6. _Asset Forfeiture . There should be automatic asset forfeiture on being found_
guilty of crimes such as major fraud, extortion, trafficking, embezzlement and
money-laundering, including not just the funds associated with the actual trial,
but all personal assets that cannot be proven to be clean, plus an estimate of the
lifetime personal profits derived from criminal activity, and confiscation of those
estimated profits[18].

17 This was one of the recommendations of the Jamaica Justice Reform Task Force Report of 2007

18 This is the model now used in other jurisdictions, such as the UK.


-----

###### Financial investigation

1. Increase the capacity of the Financial Investigations Division (FID) by granting it
stronger investigative powers, and more aggressive use of asset recovery. This
should be modeled on the cross-referencing initiative introduced in Italy in 2011
which allows tax officials to examine bank accounts to check declared income
against bank deposits, as well as real estate, investments and car ownership.

2. The FID should focus on profiling the most serious criminals instead of going
after ‘small dollar’ cases.

3. The Revenue Protection Division should be given a mandate to cooperate
with national security agencies in all cases involving suspected fraud, money-
laundering and tax evasion.

4. Regularly review the legislation relating to cybercrime, including scams, fraud,
extortion and the ‘grooming’ of victims by sex abusers to ensure that it remains
adequate to address one of the most rapidly-evolving forms of crime.

5. Accelerate the introduction of a National Identification System, as this would
help to prevent many forms of money-laundering and tax evasion (provided that
all public and many private transactions then required entering the national ID
number, including government offices, tax, banking, large money transfers and
investments).

###### Public contracts and licenses

1. Establish higher levels of transparency and oversight of the award of public
contracts. As far as possible, a ‘fit and proper’ criterion should be applied to bidders
for all government contracts and licenses. Major contracts should be subject to
vetting, so that any person or organization known to be involved in organized
crime, a front for organized crime or a significant beneficiary of organized crime
can be identified before the bid is awarded.

2. All government contracts should specify that if the contract is won by a person or
organization that is subsequently established to be involved in organized crime or
a front for organized crime, then part or all of the cost of the completed component
of the contract has to be refunded by the contractor, plus interest, with an additional
penalty to cover the increased cost of completing any unfinished components of
the contract.

3. All government contracts should specify that if the contract is won on the basis of
forged certification or certification obtained corruptly or by any other fraudulent
and/or material misrepresentation, then part or all of the full cost of the completed
component of the contract has to be refunded by the contractor, plus interest, with
an additional penalty to cover the increased cost of completing any unfinished
components of the contract.


-----

4. Amend the definition of Government Contract to include all major sub contractors
and other tributary contracts above a given threshold value (which should be
pegged to the value range of contracts which require the endorsement of the
National Contracts Commission)[19].

5. All contractors and major sub-contractors should be routinely required to
disclose the principal and beneficial shareholders of their respective companies.

6. Contracts for infrastructure projects should carry fixed-term maintenance
obligations and recoverable cost liabilities, so that any road (for example) that
deteriorates badly while in normal use within the given period has to be properly
repaired at the contractor’s expense.

###### Legislation

1. Increase significantly the penalties for contravening the Public Sector
Procurement Guidelines.

2. Merge the Corruption Prevention Commission, the Integrity Commission and
the Office of the Contractor General into a single Anti-Corruption Agency[20].

3. Review the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) to ensure that the legislation can be
extended to anyone who facilitates organized crime, and anyone involved in
corrupting the government’s contracting process.

4. Encourage the use of the Evidence (Special Measures) Act, 2012, which allows
evidence to be given by live link from remote locations, in cases where there is
a risk that witnesses might be intimidated, or where the victim (of e.g. a Lottery
scam) is an elderly citizen of another country, or where the victim or witness
is a child, and needs to be protected from the trauma of appearing in court[21].
The Evidence (Special Measures) Act can also be used to reduce the number
of prisoners on remand that have to be transferred between the correctional
centres and the courts, which will increase security and reduce cost.

5. Introduce Public Interest Immunity legislation, so that information from covert
sources can be taken into consideration in Court without the need to disclose
their identities.

6. Amend the Real Estate Dealers and Developers Act to close the loopholes
that currently allow illegal funds to be blended with legitimate investment
capital. Serious breaches should be made a first or second schedule offence,
as appropriate, under the POCA. The Real Estate Board should also be given
formal responsibilities under the POCA to monitor all transactions and report
any suspicious activity.

19 It will be necessary to incorporate precise definitions of major subcontractors, tributary contracts and threshold values into the relevant
contracts and legislation.

20 This proposal would supersede the Special Prosecutor Bill.

21 This is not the only measure needed to protect children who have to appear in court; others were proposed by the Child Development
Agency and were included in the Justice Sector Reform program. It is particularly important, for example, that cases involving children are
dealt with rapidly, in a child-friendly environment.


-----

7. Introduce reporting requirements for non-financial institutions under the POCA.
This includes professionals such as lawyers and accountants, agencies such as
the Real Estate Board, and possibly large-scale car dealers and entertainment-
providers [22], [23].

8. Introduce cash payment limits to prevent money laundering, tax evasion and
extortion. Any transaction above the set limit should be by credit card, cheque,
manager’s cheque, inter-account transfer or any other method that leaves a
record and an audit trail. Payments by the Government for goods and services
should be made by wire transfer, phasing out the use of cheques, as this will help
to reduce both cost and the risk of fraud and corruption.

###### Seized assets

1. Part of the funds seized should be re-invested in the asset seizure program and
the fight against organized crime. Part of the funds should also be returned to
the community to fund developments that will benefit everyone (such as new
schools, clinics, community centres, roads, water and drainage systems and street
lighting), as this is an essential part of the ‘hearts and minds’ strategy needed to
win the support of the community, and turn them against the criminals.

2. Some criminal assets can go to auction. In some cases, however, powerful
criminals may attempt to intimidate potential buyers. In such cases, it may be
necessary for Government agencies to retain control of the assets, converting
houses into schools, for example, and giving vehicles to the JCF and JDF to use

22 These two business activities are regularly used for money-laundering in Jamaica.

23 These entities can be given reporting requirements for threshold and suspicious transactions under POCA by Ministerial Order; legislation
is not necessary.

24 In Italy, cars seized from the Mafia are sometimes given to the police and used to patrol Mafia-dominated areas, which helps to
demoralize the criminals

##### II. Reform The Justice System

_“When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out, the hearts of the people are_
_filled with schemes to do wrong.”_

27 Over the period 2004-2010, 61% of homicides were unsolved, while 39% were ‘cleared’, i.e. the murderer was identified. However, of
the 39% that were cleared, 88% were cleared when the person thought to be the murderer was themselves killed, either in reprisal, or
else in a fight with police officers, or else did get to court but was acquitted (approximately 1/3’’ were killed; 2/3’’’ were acquitted). Just
12% of the 39% survived long enough to get to court, and were duly sentenced. This means that the conviction rate for murder is less
than 5% per year This also means that someone believed to be a murderer is about three times more likely to be killed and about five
times more likely to be acquitted than they are to be sentenced. This, in turn, means that increasing the severity of punishment (by, for
example, reintroducing capital punishment) is unlikely to have the desired deterrent effect, as criminals will realize that the punishment
is still unlikely to be applied.

28 This can also result in similar problems in recruiting juries.


-----

###### Action Points

Decisive action is required to resolve the current weaknesses in the justice system.
Some of the recommendations in this section were also made by the Jamaica Justice
System Reform Taskforce in 2007, but not all of the recommendations made by the
Taskforce have yet been implemented. The following steps are therefore recommended:

_Improve court management_

1. Modernize court procedures, systems, protocols and working practices, especially
in the Registries.

2. Strengthen the management of courts, especially with regard to scheduling (to
ensure that the accused, the relevant police officers, witnesses, the evidence,
prosecutors and defence lawyers all come before the court at the appropriate
time), and introduce penalties for delinquents (where there is no reasonable excuse
for lateness or non-appearance).

3. Extend court working hours from the current average of five hours a day[29].

4. Mandate the use of electronic records for case files, including witness statements
and precedents, and electronic tagging for physical evidence, as this will help to
improve efficiency and transparency, and the security and integrity of the records.
This process should start in the Court Registries.

5. Encourage judges not to tolerate the use of delaying tactics in order to defer the
execution of sentence (in some instances, this may have allowed time for evidence
to be contaminated or destroyed, witnesses to be intimidated or killed, or for the
case to lose political salience).

_Reduce delays_

1. Establish clear guidelines for granting adjournments. Only one adjournment should
be permitted per case unless there are exceptional circumstances. This is partly
to reinstate the right to a speedy trial, and partly to reduce the risk that evidence
could be lost or witnesses intimidated or suborned.

2. Require that Notice of Alibi should be given in advance (not necessarily the names
of those giving the alibi), as this will prevent one particular delaying tactic[30].

3. Abolish Preliminary Enquiries[31] (Preliminary Inquiries before magistrates, who may
then refer cases to the Supreme Court, are, on occasion, so extensive that the case is
effectively tried twice, and they can also offer an opportunity for some defence lawyers
to prolong the proceedings). The magistrate involved should make a preliminary
assessment of the evidence and documented pleadings and then, in instances
involving serious or organized crime, refer the case directly to the higher court.

29 The principle of judicial independence is a vital safeguard against political interference; its purpose is to ensure that everyone receives a
fair and unbiased trial. It does not mean that members of the judiciary are exempted from reasonable expectations as to their management
ability, workload, performance, productivity and the length of the working day.

30 This issue is also under review by the Ministry of Justice.

31 This is being addressed, with the introduction of the Committal Proceedings Bill.


-----

4. The burden on the Courts should be reduced with the use of plea bargaining and
alternative dispute resolution methods, including restorative justice, for minor
crimes[32].

5. Reform the management of traffic violations. The more effective use of traffic
cameras, with automatic fines, would remove the need for many cases to come
to court.

6. Accelerate the implementation of the other provisions in the Ministry of Justice’s
Backlog Reduction Strategy and the report of the 2007 Justice Reform Taskforce.

_Increase consistency_

1. Ensure greater consistency in the enforcement of laws and sentencing (a lack
of consistency makes outcomes more idiosyncratic and therefore encourages
‘judge-shopping’, which is where some defence lawyers try to contrive that their
client will come before a judge that they think will be more lenient). The Judiciary
should use sentencing guidelines, with tariffs. If a judge chooses to hand down
a sentence outside the guidelines, he or she should be required to give a formal
explanation.

2. The prosecution should be permitted to make recommendations as to the
appropriate sentence (as is currently the case in the UK and USA), although
the decision should remain with the judge.

_Increase effectiveness against organized crime_

The most effective way to break the grip of major organized crime bosses is to seize
their criminal assets, so it is important to strengthen and streamline the process of
assert seizure.

1. Give members of the judiciary additional training in the role and use of Proceeds
of Crime and Asset Forfeiture and anti-corruption legislation, and to encourage
them to routinely require persons convicted of serious crimes to prove that they
came by their assets legally[33].

2. There should be automatic asset forfeiture on being found guilty, including not just
the funds associated with the actual trial, but all assets that the convicted person
cannot prove to be clean, plus, where appropriate, an estimate of the lifetime personal
profits derived from similar cases, and confiscation of those estimated profits[34].

3. Provide additional training for police officers in the management of evidence and
the preparation of cases, especially with regard to POCA and anti-gang legislation.

4. Provide additional training for lawyers in the Office of the Director of Public
Prosecutions in the preparation of cases involving POCA and anti-gang legislation.

32 These issues are being addressed by the Justice Undertakings for Social Transformation (JUST) Program in the Justice Ministry.

33 For maximum impact, seized assets should be used to increase the size and capability of police POCA units, to upgrade police equipment,
and converted into community assets in troubled areas (as part of a ‘hearts and minds’ strategy to strengthen the community and erode
the power of the gangs).

34 This is the model used in the UK and USA.


-----

5. Review the Proceeds of Crimes Act 2007 to ensure that it contains similar provisions to
the 1982 Rognoni-La Torre law (Article 416 bis of the Italian Penal Code), which makes
conspiracy with organized crime a criminal offence, including laundering criminal assets,
collusion, fronting for or helping to conceal criminal operations, and gives courts the
power to seize the personal assets of persons involved in the conspiracy, as well as any
assets transferred to their relatives or partners in the prior five years, which allows the
seizure of the personal assets of anyone who assists a criminal to launder the proceeds
of their crimes.

6. Require judges to act more rapidly in approving forfeiture orders. These currently take
over 14 months on average, which gives criminals time to conceal or transfer assets.

7. Impose denial of tainted assets during trial (criminals should not be allowed to pay
their legal fees with the proceeds of crime); those accused of crimes such as fraud,
extortion or money-laundering should be required to demonstrate that the funds
used to pay their legal fees were obtained legitimately[35], and they should only be
allowed to draw moderate living expenses from frozen assets while their case is
being determined.

8. Ensure that the lawyers in the DPP’s office and judges are aware that the Proceeds
of Crime Act 2007, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering Prevention) Regulations,
2007 and the Proceeds of Crime Regulations, 2007 are all applicable to lawyers,
bankers, accountants and other professionals. In particular, a lawyer that assists
their clients to conceal their assets or otherwise launder their funds is effectively
conspiring to weaken the system of justice in Jamaica and undermine the people’s
faith in law and justice, so any such case should be prosecuted to the full extent that
the law allows.

9. Ensure that lawyers cannot conceal possible cases of money laundering, fraud and
tax evasion behind the principle of client confidentiality by requiring that all sums
(over a set minimum) transferred or invested on behalf of clients are reported,
disclosing sources and amounts[36].

10. Review the Parole and Bail Acts to ensure that particular categories of criminals (homicide,
violent crime and sex crimes) are normally ineligible for parole or bail where there is a
clear risk that witnesses will be intimidated or murdered, or evidence destroyed[37].

35 In cases where the accused cannot demonstrate any non-tainted assets, it may be necessary to grant them legal assistance, with the
proviso that all costs should be recovered from the assets of the accused in the event of a guilty verdict

36 At present, the Bank of Jamaica is responsible for ensuring that financial institutions operating in Jamaica comply with anti-money
laundering provisions, but the Bank does not regulate lawyers, even though they may manage and invest significant sums of money
on behalf of their clients. Lawyers are subject to the Legal Profession Act, which requires a certain standard of the practice of law to be
maintained through the prescription of professional standards and etiquette. In addition, the General Legal Council has issued the Canons
of Professional Conduct and Etiquette; non-compliance may lead to the suspension or the revocation of the Certificate to Practice Law in
Jamaica. However, these standards may be insufficient to prevent corruption.

37 Bail has sometimes been granted even in cases where the person had been accused of multiple homicides, and was believed to have
already murdered a number of witnesses. This would be less likely to happen in the UK, where the Bail Act 1976 gives six separate grounds
on which the prosecution can argue for denial of bail (including a significant risk of the defendant committing a crime while on bail), and
where a person with a previous conviction accused of actual or attempted murder or rape would be granted bail only in ‘exceptional
circumstances’ (Crime and Disorder Act 1998). However, in some of these cases the reason for granting bail is that the police officers or
witnesses do not appear in court at the right time, which is another reason why it is essential to strengthen the management of courts
with regard to scheduling and time-keeping.


-----

11. Strengthen anti-gang legislation, where necessary, to ensure that gang membership
or association is defined as a serious criminal offence.

_Ensure the integrity of the judiciary_

1. Amend judicial letters of appointment to indicate the expected standards of
performance and incorporate the Judicial Code of Conduct and any further required
ethical standards, with provisions for removal from the bench for anyone who falls
significantly below the performance and standards required.

2. Members of the judiciary should be required to file annual declarations under the
Corruption (Prevention) Act.

3. Review the Legal Profession Act to strengthen the ethical standards required of
lawyers, and strengthen, if necessary, the power of the General Legal Council to
enforce such standards.

4. Members of the judiciary, defence and prosecution lawyers should be required to
submit to polygraph examinations if requested to do so by the Anti-Corruption
Commission.

5. Strengthen the ability of the Court Management Service to monitor the performance,
professional conduct and ethics of Registry staff and bailiffs.

_Ancillary reforms_

1. Strengthen the management of the chain of evidence. It is essential to have
protocols for the preparation of witness statements, police reports, and the
management of evidence from the crime scene to the police storage facility, the
forensic laboratory and the court, so that all parties involved can be confident that
the witness statements are authentic, that the facts in the police reports have
been recorded accurately, and that the evidence presented in court is the same
evidence that was taken from the scene of the crime (this is not currently the case;
many charges are dismissed because of inconsistencies and technical errors in the
evidence presented).

2. Ensure witness protection in cases where the witnesses might be at risk (witnesses
sometimes have to sit in the same waiting room as the accused, and their identities
are usually known, which makes it easier for violent criminals to intimidate
witnesses or have them murdered).

3. Ensure that all prisoners undergo rehabilitation training before discharge, in order
to reduce the rate of re-offending[38].

38 It is important to remember that prison serves as a deterrent and as a form of punishment, but also that almost every prisoner will
eventually be discharged back into society – most of them in a relatively short time. So it is important to ensure that prison also serves
as a means of rehabilitation.

An important part of this strategy is that

-----

###### Action Points
_Reassuring the public_

1. There should be increased transparency with regard to failures of proper procedure,
with independent investigation of every use of deadly force by the police.

2. Ensure that any police officer who is found to have seriously abused his powers is
removed from the police force and made to face criminal charges.

3. Give JCF officers increased training in the use of non-lethal options, equip more
officers with non-lethal technologies and develop appropriate protocols to ensure
that every officer can respond appropriately to each threat increase.

_Supporting the police_

1. Give increased counseling and other psycho-social support for police and security forces,
especially first-responders and others who are exposed to serious risk and trauma.

_Information management_

Good information management is required throughout the entire process of detection,
arrest, trial and conviction. Criminals cannot be convicted of crimes unless there is
sufficient evidence or testimony to establish their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

1. There should be a transition to intelligent policing – intelligence-led policing, better
information management and access, and a total policing strategy that encourages
the sharing of relevant information between different police divisions. This will
require the further strengthening of performance tracking, with a national crime
map updated continuously to allow the management of crime hotspots and civil
unrest, modeled on the New York crime map information management system.

2. The JCF should institutionalize the use of predictive analytics software such as
CRUSH (Criminal Reduction Utilizing Statistical History), which looks for patterns
in crime records, intelligence briefings, offender profiles and other data to identify
where particular types of crimes are most likely to occur. The JCF should also
strengthen their capacity to undertake criminal profiling.

3. The JCF should accelerate the full integration of JCF information management
systems, phase out all paper-based recording, and mandate a transition to electronic
records, with templates developed for PCs and hand-held devices (such as smart
phones) to guide officers to input the data correctly. The first priority would be
to introduce these systems for crime recording, crime scene management and
management of the chain of evidence.

4. Automatic number-plate recognition software should be installed as part of CCTV
traffic management systems.

5. Take Integrated Ballistics Identification System (IBIS) records of all guns in Jamaica –
all police, military and legally-owned guns should be recorded, as should all criminal
firearms when seized.


-----

6. It is important to strengthen crime scene management, including the rapid debriefing
of first responders, with good systems for the management of physical, electronic
and all other forms of evidence. Many police forces manage the chain of custody
with the paperwork that accompanies the evidence. However, as it is possible for
paperwork to be lost, along with the physical evidence to which it is attached, the
recommended solution is to manage the entire chain of custody through a single
database, with secure information management systems that allow controlled
access for legitimate inputs and inquiries.

7. This system for the management of the chain of evidence has to be integrated with
the system for managing the documentation needed in Court. All paper records
used in the justice system should therefore be replaced with electronic records;
this will prevent case files from being lost.

8. The police should train more Scene of Crime Officers, and must have access to at least
one full-spectrum forensic laboratory which can process all types of physical, ballistic,
blood-spatter and biological evidence; including DNA analysis and body reconstruction.

_Supportive legislative reforms_

1. Introduce legislation for the mandatory registration of all cell phone numbers (this is
now routinely done in countries such as Mexico, which introduced this requirement
in order to assist in tracking kidnappers and extortionists).

2. Introduce legislation to require Cellular Service Providers to store call data for a
given period, and make these records available to police, with a valid warrant, when
this is needed to assist investigations.

3. Review the legislation that covers wiretaps and electronic intercepts in order to
allow the police electronic access, with a valid warrant, to a wider set of databases
in the pursuit of crime, including bank accounts, tax records and shipping manifests.

_Management of staff and resources_

It is important to deliver police services efficiently and cost-effectively. The following
measures are recommended:

1. Merge the ISCF into the JCF in order to improve efficiency and reduce cost.

2. The District Constable Act needs to be reviewed and upgraded in order to improve
the service provided and to address welfare issues.

3. The program of ‘civilianization’ (for positions in the JCF that do not require powers
of arrest) should continue.

4. The JCF should aim to have ownership of its buildings. Currently, it is a major drain
on public funds and the money currently spent on rent could be used to replace or
repair JCF buildings.

5. The JCF should have a proper fleet management plan for purchasing, servicing,
decommissioning and selling vehicles. Currently, most vehicles are purchased off
the lot and are not built to police specifications and as a result many of the vehicles
are not operational.

as possible.

to be highest at the public spaces that mark the boundaries between gang territories.

###### Action Points

_1 .  Focused enforcement_
_Increase probability of detection and punishment_
One of the most powerful deterrents of crime is the probability of detection and
punishment. If the probability of detection is low, or the punishment is mild, there
is little effective deterrent. To be effective, punishment must have three qualities
– it must be certain, swift and severe. Many people assume that severity is the
most important factor, but it is actually the first two factors that have the biggest
influence on rates of crime. This is because the severity of the possible punishment
has little deterrent effect if the criminals perceive that there is a very low probability
of being detected and caught, as they don’t think that the punishment will be
applied. The effect of the severity of the possible punishment can also be weakened
if there are lengthy delays in judicial processing, as repeated appeals may reduce
the probability that the sentence will ever be carried out, and they also give time
for the intimidation or killing of witnesses. So the goal of focused enforcement is to
increase the probability of both detection and punishment. This typically requires
that resources are focused on just one gang (or on one area) at a time, usually the
most violent and dangerous, rather than spread them too thinly across all gangs. The
goal is to significantly increase the probability of detection of crimes by that gang,
which acts as a serious deterrent, as well as disrupting their operations, degrading
their capabilities, reducing their assets, eroding their power and eventually resulting
in the complete dismantling of that gang.

_Increase the speed of punishment_
The most effective way to disrupt a criminal structure is to build evidence against
an entire gang, especially the leadership, then to arrest them all at the same time.
This has a greater impact than arresting low-ranking members, who can be easily
replaced. It is also important to increase the speed of punishment. This requires
reform and streamlining of police and judicial procedures.


-----

_2 . Community-based policing_
This is sometimes seen as ‘soft’ policing, but is partly based on population-centric
counter-insurgency tactics.

a. This should be organized on a ‘Same Cop, Same Neighbourhood’ basis, with officers
being assigned to particular communities so that they become familiar with the
local residents, and get involved in helping to solve problems and resolve conflicts.
The role of community-based policing is to complement focused enforcement
strategies. The focused enforcement strategy will require tactical operations
against the gangs, while the role of community-based policing is to eliminate their
social support and influence.

b. Community policing should be supported by improved planning, regulation and
building control; this is in order to prevent illegal settlements, and to remove
abandoned buildings and any zinc fences used to create defensible spaces in which
gangs can operate.

_3 . Support for victims and witnesses_
a.  Strengthen Witness Protection  Programme

Some victims and witnesses have reported that they got little support or sympathetic
treatment in court. Some of them are exposed to threats of retribution or further
violence. This undermines faith in law, order and justice. It is very important,
therefore, that victims and witnesses should be protected and supported. This
means that victims and witnesses should be kept separate from the accused in
court, and that the witness protection program should be strengthened.

_4 . Clear, hold and build_
a. Adopt a Clear, hold and build strategy

Strong anti-gang measures are needed to normalize and integrate the worst-
affected communities. In areas where gangs are deeply entrenched, this will
require a Clear, Hold and Build strategy. These are operations that can clear gangs
out of entire communities; hold those areas by maintaining a strong, continuous
police presence to provide lasting security, and then build a robust civil society
by engaging other government agencies and NGOs to provide education, training,
economic opportunities, health care and prompt justice. The goal of this clear, hold,
and build strategy is to reassure the community, remove their fear of gangs, build
sustained popular support, increase the flow of intelligence about gang operations,
and ensure that gangs have no safe haven anywhere.

_5 . Prevent recruitment_

a. Disrupt the process of gang member recruitment

There are effective tactics, developed in the cities of Boston and Glasgow, for
interrupting the process of recruitment to local street gangs. These involve call-ins
for the gang members and confrontations with victims, followed by the presentation
of a clear choice – reform, and qualify for assistance and job-training, or remain in


-----

the gang; anyone that chooses to remain an active gang member should then be
subjected to every possible form of legal harassment by every arm of government
(tax compliance, vehicle licensing, business permits and so on should all be made as
difficult as possible for known gang members who refuse to give up their criminal
connections).

_6 . Denial of Liberty_

a. Violent criminals should not normally be granted bail, especially when there is a
clear risk that witnesses will be intimidated or murdered, or evidence destroyed.

###### Action Points

_Breaking the cycle of violence_
1. Every school has a programme to deal with maladaptive behavior, trauma, post-
traumatic stress, depression, and other long-term consequences of the physical,
sexual, emotional and psychological abuse of children.

_Social Intervention_

1. _The first goal of all intervention programs should be a sustained reduction in the_
_level of crime and violence . All other social goals (such as increased investment,_
job-creation and long-term, skilled employment) depend on the primary goal
of ensuring safety and security; they cannot be achieved without a marked
reduction in crime, violence, corruption and extortion. All social intervention and
employment-creation programs should therefore be part of the anti-gang and
community regeneration initiative.

2. Much stronger coordination and co-operation is needed among the social intervention
agencies and programs. These agencies have different parent Ministries, so
cooperation will have to be mandated by the Prime Minister.

3. _Self-sustaining process of economic regeneration . It is important that communities_
do not become dependent on scarce public resources, so all interventions should
come with an exit strategy. Once economic confidence has returned, money is being
invested and viable businesses are being established, the public funding should
start to taper off and be reallocated to the next community in need.

46 In Brazil, the police and army will typically give up to a week’s advance notice of their intention to move into a crime-dominated favela.

47 This should be incorporated as a provision in the Anti-Gang legislation.

48 This will require that these officers are properly trained in community policing, with a particular emphasis on human rights.

48 This will require that these officers are properly trained in community policing, with a particular emphasis on human rights.

49 There have been complaints in the past that operational policing – especially where paramilitary units are involved – can undermine the
work of the community police and the social intervention agencies. This is why the timing and sequencing of these phases is very important.

50 In areas that have been used to not paying for their water and electricity, it would be sensible to offer a transitional period of 1-3 years

Some of the measures needed to strengthen governance are addressed in more

1. Move the focus away from reactive and containment strategies to concentrate
on dismantling criminal organizations, including their facilitators

2. Seize the proceeds of crime

3. Strengthen anti-corruption measures

4. Increase transparency in the public accounts, especially with regard to
procurement

5. Reform the justice system

6. Improve intelligence-sharing with key strategic partners

7. Encourage the DPP and the Judiciary to vigorously pursue the most serious

## Addressing Tier 2 Threats Major Potential Threats

_I . Traditional threats_

The Tier 2 traditional security threats to Jamaica are:

        - The Mexican, Central or South American drug cartels and maras gangs, which could
seek to extend their influence and diversify their operations across the Caribbean.

        - Terrorism, possibly aimed at tourists. The tourism industry would be a soft target,
and offer the opportunity to create mass casualties and cause extensive economic
damage to countries seen as sympathetic to the USA.

51 Organized crime is a highly complex and adaptive form of human behaviour, which evolves in response to both opportunities and
pressure from law enforcement. One reason why its future development cannot be predicted with any certainty is that criminals are often
quick to take advantage of new technologies. Another is that any intervention (such as a change in police tactics) disrupts the current
pattern of risks, benefits and motives, and the pattern of crime then changes, sometimes in some quite unexpected ways. For example,
cybercrime is now emerging as a greater threat than narcotics trafficking, because it offers greater profits and lower risks to the criminals,
which illustrates both of the above points.

The larger cartels have cores, which typically consist of people who are related or who have known each other for a long time. The rest

54 Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean nations sit at the intersection between these two trades; the flow of narcotics going north,
and the flow of weapons going south. These two factors, in conjunction with a number of weak governments with high levels of corruption,
are the main reasons why seven of the world’s ten most violent countries are in this region.

###### Action Points
1. It is important to track signs of cartel interest in the Caribbean. Relevant indicators
include:
a) Evidence that the cartels are acquiring shipping companies and port operations,
as they might then seek to expand their trans-shipment operations across the
Caribbean.
b) The rate of interceptions of narco-submarine and surface vessel shipments in
the Caribbean, which will indicate the extent to which shipments are being re-
routed from the cross-border and Pacific routes (the number of intercepts has
increased significantly in the last couple of years).
c) Reports of increasing cartel involvement in other Caribbean jurisdictions (they
already have a presence in several other Caribbean countries).

2. It is important to establish intelligence-sharing links with the relevant US agencies,
including the FBI, DEA, ATF, and Southern Command, and with security, police and
intelligence agencies in Mexico, Colombia, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador,
as well as other Caribbean jurisdictions. This will then allow for ‘due diligence’
background checks on investors, especially from Mexico and Central America, to
see whether any of them have known connections to organized crime.

###### Action Points

It is important to improve the efficiency with which energy and resources are used in
Jamaica, and to develop new energy supplies. The priorities are to:

1. Promote greater energy efficiency, especially in buildings and the transport sector.

2. Promote the development, dissemination and uptake of renewable and low-
carbon energy technologies, especially those that would also reduce Jamaica’s
dependence on imports.

3. Promote the uptake of advanced resource management concepts, such as cleaner
technology, waste exchanges and industrial symbiosis.

-----

###### Action Points

1. Ensure that Jamaica is prepared for a major earthquake or tsunami. This will involve
reviewing national planning guidelines and building codes, identifying the most
vulnerable areas, and upgrading emergency planning and disaster management.

2. Protect the core functions of government by ensuring that key Government offices,
JDF and JCF buildings, hospitals, supplies of emergency stores and communications
links are in secure buildings, designed to withstand the most severe conditions.

3. Ensure that all vital records are regularly backed up to hardened sites.

4. Ensure that all government departments are aware of the need for disaster
preparedness and emergency management.

5. Ensure that new buildings are built to withstand earthquakes, especially public
buildings such as schools, and encourage people to strengthen their own homes.

6. Establish basic earthquake education in all schools.

7. The great majority of people that are saved after an earthquake are not saved
by the specialist disaster teams, but by their neighbours. In Haiti, for example,
less than 200 people were rescued by the specialists, compared to over 7,000
that were dug out by their neighbours. People rarely survive more than 72 hours
when trapped under rubble, so the only help likely to reach most people is the
help that is already at hand. This means that Jamaica should not rely on the aid
that will come from outside after a disaster; all parishes should have disaster
specialists who can prepare, organize regular training exercises, and ensure that
essential supplies are stockpiled. Another lesson from Haiti is that these supplies
must include shovels, tents, plastic sheeting and shelter material, mosquito nets,
kitchen sets, portable toilets, hygiene and sanitation equipment, stores of food
and water, and medical supplies for dealing with crush and other trauma injuries,
respiratory disease, obstetrics, and vaccinations against infectious disease.

8. It is important to make an inventory of essential equipment and locations in
advance. This should include firms that own bulldozers and other earth-moving
equipment, so that these can be requisitioned to clear arterial routes, and firms
that own buses, which might be needed to evacuate devastated areas. It is also
important to identify areas of clear ground, such as sports fields, as these may be
needed for emergency evacuation centres, temporary hospitals and heliports.

9. Strengthen public health infrastructure, with adequate stockpiles of medical
supplies to deal with a major natural disaster or terrorist incident (including
treatments for chronic diseases, in case other supplies are temporarily disrupted).

If government agencies and local planning authorities make these preparations, and
ensure that everyone knows what to do, the death toll when the earthquake strikes
will be far smaller.

###### Action Points

_1 . Reform Jamaica’s Planning and Regulatory Systems_
Establish regulations that will promote sustainable development with a combination
of economic development and growth, rising incomes, high environmental
standards, strong protection for important ecosystems, good management of
natural resources and an improved quality of life.

_2 . Develop a goal-oriented planning model_
Set policy goals for energy-efficient cities including water and resource
management, waste minimization and materials recovery, buildings; and transport
systems. Have a reducing rate for environmental damage with remediation and
enhancement. Set standards for greater resilience and reduced vulnerability to

_Jamaica’s credibility_

There are a number of areas where the a reputation as a trusted, reliable partner.
support of international partners is likely This does not mean pretending that Jamaica
to be increasingly important in the future, does not have problems; it means discussing
including government borrowing, trade these problems with honesty and clarity,
facilitation and cooperation on policing accepting responsibility where appropriate,
and intelligence. In order to ensure this and then addressing these problems in a
support, it is important that Jamaica builds resolute manner.

###### Action Points

1. The emphasis should now be on cooperation on policing and intelligence, trade
facilitation, especially with regard to e-commerce, on-line services, tourism and
high-value niche products, the development of e-government, and increasing
human capital and skills in the workforce.

2. There should also be planning and regulatory reform to prevent environmental
degradation, control depletion of natural resources and reduce exposure to
natural hazards, in conjunction with regional risk-pooling to manage the cost of
earthquakes and hurricanes.

These steps would strengthen Jamaica’s credibility with key international
partners. They will also help Jamaica to achieve investment-grade status, attract
foreign investment and retain human capital, which will strengthen and diversify
Jamaica’s economy, and thereby help to buffer the country against any future
global economic recession.

###### Action Points

1. The resources for education (above primary level), adult education and training
in Jamaica should be focused on areas where there is potential demand-pull, i.e.
areas where there are more likely to be growth opportunities in future.

2. It is also essential to improve teaching standards in schools. A truancy service
should be introduced, so that school officials are mandated to find out what
has happened to absentees, and a universal system of home-school contracts
should be established[59].

3. Over the longer term, it is difficult to predict the exact jobs that will be most
in demand, but it is possible to identify the kind of skills that are likely to be
required . These include social networking skills (team-builders, managers and
leaders), creative skills (designers, visionaries and conceptualizers), technical
skills (scientists, engineers and technicians), logistical skills (organizers, project
aggregators and coordinators, open-source project managers, logistics and
supply-chain strategists and managers), thinking skills (critical thinkers, problem-
solvers, policy analysts and business strategists), entrepreneurial skills (people
who can network between different networks, e.g. scientists, financiers, and the
businesses that control the manufacturing, supply and distribution networks)
and generic skills (e.g. people who are ICT-fluent, can multi-task, network, and
have high emotional intelligence). Educational and training programs in Jamaica
should emphasize these skills, as that would allow them to make a stronger
contribution to national development.

4. It is important to draw on the talents, resources and contacts of the Jamaican
Diaspora. They can provide the links to markets, ideas and business opportunities
that will demand-pull business development in Jamaica.

5. The proposed development of a Logistics Hub in Jamaica will create many direct
and indirect employment opportunities for those with the relevant skills, so it
is important to utilize the opportunity by establishing the necessary training
programs before the Logistics Hub becomes fully operational. This could be
supplemented with targeted support for entrepreneurs, especially in low-income
areas, to encourage community regeneration.

6. Agriculture remains a key source of employment in rural areas, but subsistence
farmers must be given targeted training and support to enable them to increase
their productivity and move into higher-value forms of production.

59 This is a contract explaining the school discipline and rules. Parents must sign this document and agree that they accept the school’s
rules, that they are responsible for their child’s attendance and behavior, and must respect the discipline methods used in the school. This
system is now widely used in the US and UK. It gives parents a formal, binding obligation to ensure that their child reaches the school and
remains there until the end of the school day.

_Deported persons_

There have been several high profile visa limit, non-reporting green card holders

gang members. This created a public convicted of minor crimes, most commonly

###### Action Points

1. It is important to distinguish between serious criminals and persons deported
for visa violations or petty crimes. With regard to serious criminals, it is
critical to maintain and improve communications between law enforcement
agencies in the deporting countries and the authorities in Jamaica, so that
serious criminals can be put under surveillance, if necessary, in case they try
to re-establish their criminal connections or regain control over their former
community in Jamaica. It may be necessary to require them to report on
a daily basis to a designated police station. It may also be necessary to
consider the introduction of electronic tagging.

2. With regard to those deported for visa violations or petty crimes, it is
important to encourage their assimilation back into society, as that will
reduce the risk that they will get involved in criminal activity in Jamaica.
This should include establishing a short-stay hostel for those who arrive
without friends or financial resources, and giving them access to HEART/
NTA training courses.

_Informal settlements_

The problems with gangs are exacerbated However, people have built lives in these
by the existence of informal (‘squatter’) areas; children have been born in these
communities, as some of them have become communities, and it is important not to

to the problem of informal settlements.

###### Action Points

1. If a settlement is unsafe (e.g. on an unstable slope or land prone to flooding),
the occupants must be moved as soon as possible.

2. If a settlement is safe, but on land that is needed for legitimate purposes,
the occupants must still be moved to other locations, but this can be done
over a longer period of time (depending on when the land is needed).

3. If a settlement is in a safe location, in relatively good condition, and on land
that is not needed for other purposes, it should be considered for upgrading
and regularizing.

60 These reforms were proposed in the Government Green Paper on the Establishment of an Environmental Regulatory Authority (2010).

## Addressing Tier 4 Threats Possible risks that require monitoring

Tier 4 threats are low probability, low impact threats. They are still potential threats, but they
are less likely to have a serious impact within the immediate future, and these impacts can
probably be contained. With regard to food security, Jamaica is heavily dependent on imported
food supplies, but has substantial reserves of under-utilized land with agricultural potential,
so it would be possible to increase local food production in the event of global shortages or
disruptions in the supply chain. With regard to water security, the problem is not shortage of
supply, but the contamination of the existing resources, so better management could resolve
this problem. It is important to note, however, that Tier 4 threats require monitoring, in case
circumstances change, and there is a need to reclassify them as higher priority threats.

The Tier 4 threats to Jamaica are:

       - Food security

       - Water security

###### Action Points

_1 . Develop technology_

It is important to accelerate the development and adoption of particular
technologies so that greater volumes of output of food, fibre and fuel can be
generated in smaller areas. This includes:

a) Genetically modified plants and animals. For example, taking the gene that
gives legumes the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen and transplanting it to
other crops would greatly reduce the need for fertilizer, and would also reduce
water pollution from fertilizer run-off.

b) Production in environments where evaporation and pests can be more easily
controlled (such as polytunnels and hydroponics).

c) Aquaculture; using fish modified to thrive in intensive conditions.

_2 . Develop new market opportunities_

a) The global trends listed above will also create new market opportunities. For
example, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are already the primary causes
of premature death, and the incidence will rise in future as the many countries
now have aging populations .

b) This has already created a new market for plant-derived micro-nutrients to
reduce the impact of age-related degenerative disease; some of these could be
supplied from Jamaica. There is also a growing market for biological feedstock
for manufacturing eco-composites and other new industrial crops.


-----

###### Action Points continued

_3 . Biofuels_

a) First and second-generation biofuels have limited potential in Jamaica, due
to lack of scale. Third and fourth-generation biofuels (e.g. algae and synthetic
genomics) are still in development, but may eventually provide the basis for
energy independence.

_4 . Improve food security_

Agriculture in Jamaica is not currently focused on ensuring food security. Until
relatively recently, sugar cane accounted for about 30% of all agricultural land
in Jamaica, and about 40% of all permanent crop land. Forestry Department
estimates suggest that there are 90,000 hectares of idle private lands and over
200,000 hectares of land not currently intensively utilized for agriculture. This
gives a total of 359,244 hectares of land that could be better utilized, for food,
forestry, biomass, or for some other higher-value form of production . This would
help to improve Jamaica’s food security, reduce imports and increase exports,
retain more capital in Jamaica and strengthen the economy.

_Water security_

Current projections indicate that over half       - Agriculture accounts for 80% of water
of the world’s population will suffer from use in Jamaica, but less than 5% of its

-----

###### Action Points

The main problem with regard to Jamaica’s water security is not insufficient supply,
but contamination of existing resources, and a distribution policy that is exceptionally
energy-intensive. The most important steps to improve Jamaica’s water security are
as follows:

1. Improving sewage disposal systems, so that surface and ground water are
not contaminated.

2. Agricultural extension programs to encourage the safe use and disposal of
agrochemicals. Burial (preferably in designated sites) is usually a much better
option than surface disposal.

3. An agricultural extension program to encourage more efficient irrigation.

4. The development of more local water supplies to reduce the need to pump
water uphill.

|Legislation - Page 33|||||||||||||||||||||
|1. Increase significantly the penalties for contravening the Public Sector Procurement Guidelines.|||||||||||||||||||||
|2. Merge the Corruption Prevention Commission (CPC), the Integrity Commission (IC) and the Office of the Contractor General (OCG) into a single Anti-Corruption Agency.|||||||||||||||||||||
|3. Review the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) to ensure that the legislation can be extended to anyone who facilitates organized crime and anyone that is involved in corrupting the government’s contracting process.|||||||||||||||||||||
|4. Encourage the use of the Evidence (Special Measures) Act, 2012, which allows evidence to be given by live link from remote locations, in cases where there is a risk that witnesses might be intimidated, or where the victim (of e.g. a Lottery scam) is an elderly citizen of another country, or where the victim or witness is a child, and needs to be protected from the trauma of appearing in court. The Evidence (Special Measures) Act can also be used to reduce the number of prisoners on remand that have to be transferred between the correctional centers and the courts, which will increase security and reduce cost|||||||||||||||||||||

|5. Introduce Public Interest Immunity legislation, so that information from covert sources can be taken into consideration in Court without the need to disclose their identities|||||||||||||||||||||
|6. Amend the Real Estate Dealers and Developers Act to close the loopholes that currently allow illegal funds to be blended with legitimate investment capital. Serious breaches should be made a first or second schedule offence, as appropriate, under the POCA. The Real Estate Board should also be given formal responsibilities under the POCA to monitor all transactions and report any suspicious activity.|||||||||||||||||||||
|7. Introduce reporting requirements for non-financial institutions under the POCA. This includes professionals such as lawyers and accountants, agencies such as the Real Estate Board, and possibly large-scale car dealers and entertainment-providers (note that these can be given reporting requirements for threshold and suspicious transactions under POCA by Ministerial Order; legislation is not necessary).|||||||||||||||||||||
|8. Introduce cash payment limits to prevent money laundering, tax evasion and extortion. Any transaction above the limit should be by credit card, cheque, manager's cheque, inter-account transfer or any other method that leaves a record and an audit trail. Payments by the Government for goods and services should normally be made by wire transfer, phasing out the use of cheques, as this will help to reduce both cost and the risk of fraud and corruption.|||||||||||||||||||||

|Seized Assets - Page 34|||||||||||||||||||||
|1. Part of the funds seized (from illegal activities) should be re-invested in the asset seizure program and the fight against organized crime; some should also be returned to the community to fund developments that will benefit everyone (such as new schools, clinics, community centers, roads, water and drainage systems and street lighting. This is an essential part of the ‘hearts and minds' strategy needed to win the support of the community, and turn them against the criminals).|||||||||||||||||||||
|2. Some criminal assets can go to auction. In some cases, however, powerful criminals may attempt to intimidate potential buyers. In such cases, it may be necessary for Government agencies to retain control of the assets, converting houses into schools, for example, and giving vehicles to the JCF and JDF to use on patrol|||||||||||||||||||||
|Objective 2: Reform the Justice System|||||||||||||||||||||
|Improve Court Management - Page 37|||||||||||||||||||||
|1. Modernize Court procedures, systems, protocols and working practices, especially in the Registries.|||||||||||||||||||||

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|5. Encourage judges not to tolerate the use of delaying tactics in order to defer the execution of sentence (in some instances, involving particularly dangerous or well-connected criminals, this may have allowed time for evidence to be contaminated or destroyed, witnesses to be intimidated or killed, or for the case to lose political salience).|||||||||||||||||||||
|Reduce Delays - Page 37|||||||||||||||||||||
|1. Establish clear guidelines for granting adjournments. Only one adjournment should normally be permitted per case unless there are truly exceptional circumstances. This is partly to reinstate the right to a speedy trial, and to minimize the opportunity for evidence to be contaminated, files ‘lost’, and witnesses killed or intimidated.|||||||||||||||||||||
|2. Require that Notice of Alibi should be given in advance (not necessarily the names of those giving the alibi), as this will prevent one particular delaying tactic|||||||||||||||||||||
|3. Abolish Preliminary Enquiries, especially in cases involving serious and/or organized crime|||||||||||||||||||||
|4. Introduce plea bargaining and alternative dispute resolution methods, including restorative justice, for minor crimes|||||||||||||||||||||

|Increase consistency - Page 38|||||||||||||||||||||
|1. Ensure greater consistency in the enforcement of laws and sentencing (a lack of consistency makes outcomes more idiosyncratic and therefore encourages ‘judge-shopping’, which is where some defence lawyers try to contrive that their client will come before a judge that they think will be more lenient). The Judiciary should use sentencing guidelines, with tariffs. If a judge chooses to hand down a sentence outside the guidelines, he or she should be required to give a formal explanation|||||||||||||||||||||
|2. The prosecution should be permitted to make recommendations as to the appropriate sentence (as is currently the case in the UK and USA), although the decision should remain with the judge.|||||||||||||||||||||
|Increase effectiveness against organized crime - P|ag|e 3|8||||||||||||||||||
|1. Give members of the judiciary additional training in the role and use of Proceeds of Crime (POCA), Asset Forfeiture and anti-corruption legislation, and to encourage them to routinely require persons convicted of serious crimes to prove that they came by their assets legally|||||||||||||||||||||
|2. There should be automatic asset forfeiture on being found guilty, including not just the funds associated with the actual trial, but all assets that the convicted person cannot prove to be clean, plus, where appropriate, an estimate of the lifetime personal profits derived from similar cases, and confiscation of those estimated profits (this is the approach in the UK and USA).|||||||||||||||||||||

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|4. Provide additional training for lawyers in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the preparation of cases involving POCA and anti-gang legislation.|||||||||||||||||||||
|5. Review the Proceeds of Crimes Act 2007 to ensure that it contains similar provisions to the 1982 Rognoni-La Torre law (Article 416 bis of the Italian Penal Code), which makes conspiracy with organized crime a criminal offence, including laundering criminal assets, collusion, fronting for or helping to conceal criminal operations, and gives courts the power to seize the personal assets of persons involved in the conspiracy, as well as any assets transferred to their relatives, partners or cohabitants in the prior five years, which allows the seizure of the personal assets of anyone who assists a criminal to launder the proceeds of their crimes.|||||||||||||||||||||
|6. Require judges to act more rapidly in approving forfeiture orders. These currently take over 14 months on average, which gives ample time to conceal or transfer assets|||||||||||||||||||||
|7. Impose denial of tainted assets during trial (criminals should not be allowed to pay their legal fees with the proceeds of crime); those accused of crimes such as fraud, extortion or money-laundering should be required to demonstrate that the funds used to pay their legal fees were obtained legitimately, and they should only be allowed to draw moderate living expenses from frozen assets while their case is being determined|||||||||||||||||||||

Ensure that the lawyers in the DPP’s office and judges are aware that the Proceeds of Crime Act 2007 and the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering Prevention) Regulations, 2007 are all applicable to lawyers, bankers, accountants and other professionals. In particular, a lawyer that assists their clients to conceal their assets or otherwise launder their funds is effectively conspiring to weaken the system of justice in Jamaica and undermine the people's faith in law and justice, so any such case should be prosecuted to the full extent that the law allows|||||||||||||||||||||
|9. Lawyers should not be allowed to conceal money laundering, fraud and tax evasion behind the principle of client confidentiality. All sums (over an agreed minimum) transferred or invested on behalf of Clients must be reported, disclosing sources and amounts.|||||||||||||||||||||
|10. Review the Parole and Bail Acts to ensure that particular categories of criminals (homicide, violent crime and sex crimes) are normally ineligible for bail where there is a clear risk that witnesses will be intimidated or murdered, or evidence destroyed.|||||||||||||||||||||
|11. Strengthen anti-gang legislation, where necessary, to ensure that gang membership or association is defined as a serious criminal offence.|||||||||||||||||||||
|Ensure The Integrity Of The Judiciary - Page 40|||||||||||||||||||||

|5. Strengthen the ability of the Court Management Service to monitor the performance, professional conduct and ethics of Registry staff and bailiffs.|||||||||||||||||||||
|Ancillary Reforms - Page 40|||||||||||||||||||||
|1. Strengthen the management of the chain of evidence. It is very important to have strong protocols in place for the preparation of witness statements, police reports, and the management of evidence from the crime scene to the police storage facility, the forensic laboratory and the court, so that there can be no doubt as to the integrity of the system. It is essential that all parties involved can be confident that the witness statements are authentic, that the facts in the police reports have been recorded accurately, and that the evidence presented in court is the same evidence that was taken from at the scene of the crime (this is not currently the case; many charges are dismissed because of inconsistencies and technical errors in the evidence presented).|||||||||||||||||||||
|2. Ensure witness protection in cases where the witnesses might be at risk (witnesses sometimes have to sit in the same waiting room as the accused, and their identities are usually known, which makes it easier for violent criminals to intimidate witnesses or have them murdered)|||||||||||||||||||||


3.  Ensure that all prisoners undergo rehabilitation training before

|Reassuring the Public - Page 44|||||||||||||||||||||
|1. There should be increased transparency with regard to failures of proper procedure, with independent investigation of every use of deadly force by the police.|||||||||||||||||||||
|2. Ensure that any police officer who is found to have seriously abused his powers is removed from the police force and made to face criminal charges|||||||||||||||||||||
|3. Give JCF officers increased training in the use of non-lethal options, equip more officers with non-lethal technologies and develop appropriate protocols to ensure that every officer can respond appropriately to each threat increase|||||||||||||||||||||
|Supporting the Police - Page 44|||||||||||||||||||||
|1. Give increased counseling and other psycho-social support for police and security forces, especially first-responders and others who are exposed to serious risk and trauma|||||||||||||||||||||
|Information Management - Page 44|||||||||||||||||||||
|1. There should be a transition to intelligent policing – intelligence-led policing, better information management and access, and a total policing strategy that encourages the sharing of relevant information between different police divisions. This will require the further strengthening of performance tracking, with a national crime map updated continuously to allow the management of crime hotspots and civil unrest, modeled on the New York crime map information management system|||||||||||||||||||||

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|2. The JCF should institutionalize the use of predictive analytics software such as CRUSH (Criminal Reduction Utilizing Statistical History), which looks for patterns in crime records, intelligence briefings, offender profiles and other data to identify where particular types of crimes are most likely to occur. The JCF should also strengthen their capacity to undertake criminal profiling|||||||||||||||||||||
|3. The JCF should accelerate the full integration of JCF information management systems, phase out all paper-based recording, and mandate a transition to electronic records, with templates developed for PCs and hand-held devices (such as smart phones) to guide officers to input the data correctly. The first priority would be to introduce these systems for crime recording, crime scene management and management of the chain of evidence|||||||||||||||||||||
|4. Install automatic number-plate recognition software as part of CCTV traffic management systems|||||||||||||||||||||
|5. Take Integrated Ballistics Identification System (IBIS) records of all guns in Jamaica – all police, military and legally-owned guns should be recorded, as should all criminal firearms when seized|||||||||||||||||||||
|6. Strengthen crime scene management, including the rapid debriefing of first responders, with good systems for the management of physical, electronic and all other forms of evidence. Many police forces manage the chain of custody with the paperwork that accompanies the evidence. However, as it is possible for paperwork to be lost, along with the physical evidence to which it is attached, the recommended solution is to manage the entire chain of custody through a single database, with secure information management systems that allow controlled access for legitimate inputs and inquiries|||||||||||||||||||||


7. Integrate the system for the management of the chain of evidence
with the system for managing the documentation needed in Court.
All paper records used in the justice system should therefore be
replaced with electronic records; this will prevent case files from

|8. The police should train more Scene of Crime Officers, and must have access to at least one full-spectrum forensic laboratory which can process all types of physical, ballistic, blood-spatter and biological evidence; including DNA analysis and body reconstruction.|||||||||||||||||||||
|Supportive Legislative Reform - Page 45|||||||||||||||||||||
|1. Introduce legislation for the mandatory registration of all cell phone numbers (this is now routinely done in countries such as Mexico, which introduced this requirement in order to assist in tracking kidnappers and extortionists)|||||||||||||||||||||
|2. Introduce legislation to require Cellular Service Providers to store call data for a given period, and make these records available to police, with a valid warrant, when this is needed to assist investigations|||||||||||||||||||||
|3. Review the legislation that covers wiretaps and electronic intercepts in order to allow the police electronic access, with a valid warrant (in order to protect the right to privacy), to a wider set of databases in the pursuit of crime, including bank accounts, tax records and shipping manifests|||||||||||||||||||||
|Management of staff and resources - Page 45|||||||||||||||||||||
|1. Merge the ISCF into the JCF in order to improve efficiency and reduce cost. There is no longer a good reason to maintain two separate forces.|||||||||||||||||||||
|2. The District Constable Act needs to be reviewed and upgraded in order to improve the service provided and to address welfare issues.|||||||||||||||||||||
|3. The program of ‘civilianization’ (for positions in the JCF that do not require powers of arrest) should continue|||||||||||||||||||||
|4. The JCF should aim to have ownership of its buildings. Currently, it is a major drain on public funds and the money currently spent on rent could be used to replace or repair JCF buildings.|||||||||||||||||||||

|1. Organize community policing on a 'Same Cop, Same Neighbourhood' basis, with officers being assigned to particular neighbourhoods so that they become familiar with the local residents and issues, and can get involved in helping to solve problems and resolve conflicts|||||||||||||||||||||
|2. Community policing should be supported by improved planning, regulation and building control; this is in order to prevent illegal settlements, and to remove abandoned buildings and any zinc fences used to create defensible spaces in which gangs can operate.|||||||||||||||||||||

|Prevent Recruitment - Page 51|||||||||||||||||||||
|1. Disrupt the process of gang member recruitment. These involve call-ins for the gang members and confrontations with victims, followed by the presentation of a clear choice – reform, and qualify for assistance and job-training, or remain in the gang; anyone that chooses to remain an active gang member should then be subjected to every possible form of legal harassment by every arm of government (tax compliance, vehicle licensing, business permits and so on should all be made as difficult as possible for known gang members who refuse to give up their criminal connections).|||||||||||||||||||||

Relevant indicators include: a) Evidence that the cartels are acquiring shipping companies and port operations, as they might then seek to expand their trans-shipment operations across the Caribbean. b) The rate of interceptions of narco-submarine and surface vessel shipments in the Caribbean, which will indicate the extent to which shipments are being re- routed from the cross-borderand Pacific routes (the number of intercepts has increased significantly in the last couple of years). c) Reports of increasing cartel involvement in other Caribbean jurisdictions (they already have a presence in several other Caribbean countries).||||||||||||
|2. Establish intelligence-sharing links with the relevant US agencies, including the FBI, DEA, ATF and Southcom and with security, police and intelligence agencies in Mexico, Colombia, Honduras, Guatemala and Salvador as well as other Caribbean jurisdictions. (This will then allow for ‘due diligence’ background checks on investors, especially from Mexico and Central America, to see whether any of them have known connections to organized crime).||||||||||||

|The Role Of Education And Training - Page 83||||||||||||||
|1. The resources for education (above primary level) including adult education and training in Jamaica should be focused on areas where there is potential demand-pull, i.e. areas where there are more likely to be growth opportunities in future||||||||||||||
|2. Improve teaching standards in the primary and secondary schools. A truancy service should be introduced in schools, so that school officials are mandated to find out what has happened to absentees, and a universal system of home-school contracts should be established.||||||||||||||
|3. Education and training programmes should incorporate and emphasize the importance of the following skills that will be required in the long term: social networking skills ( team -builders, managers and leaders) ; creative skills (designers, visionaries and conceptualizers), technical skills (scientists, engineers and technicians), logistical skills (organizers, project aggregators and coordinators, open- source project managers, logistics and supply-chain strategists and managers), thinking skills (critical thinkers, problem-solvers, policy analysts and business strategists), entrepreneurial skills (people who can network between different networks, e.g. scientists, financiers, and the businesses that control the manufacturing, supply and distribution networks) and generic skills (e.g. people who are ICT-fluent, can multi-task, network, and have high emotional intelligence).||||||||||||||
|4. It is important to draw on the talents, resources and contacts of the Jamaican Diaspora. They can provide the links to markets, ideas and business opportunities that will demand-pull business development in Jamaica.||||||||||||||
|5. Utilize the opportunity of the proposed development of a Logistics Hub by establishing the necessary training programs before the Hub becomes fully operational. This could be supplemented with targeted support for entrepreneurs, especially in low-income areas, to encourage community regeneration.||||||||||||||
|6. Accelerate the transition to e-government in order to reduce the cost of government services, the size of the public payroll, and the delays imposed on individuals and businesses.||||||||||||||

|Deported Persons - Page 84||||||||||||||
|1. With regard to serious criminal deportations, it is critical to maintain and improve communications between law enforcement agencies in the deporting countries and the authorities in Jamaica, so that serious criminals can be put under surveillance, if necessary, in case they try to re-establish their criminal connections or regain control over their former community in Jamaica.||||||||||||||
|2. With regard to deportations for visa violations or petty crimes, it is important to encourage their assimilation back into society, as that will reduce the risk that they will get involved in criminal activity in Jamaica. This should include establishing a short-stay hostel for those who arrive without friends or financial resources, and giving them access to HEART/NTA training courses.||||||||||||||
|Informal Communities- Page 85||||||||||||||
|Implement the 3-tier model:||||||||||||||
|1. If a settlement is unsafe (e.g. on an unstable slope or land prone to flooding), the occupants must be moved as soon as possible.||||||||||||||
|2. If a settlement is safe, but on land that is needed for legitimate purposes, the occupants must still be moved to other locations, but this can be done over a longer period of time (depending on when the land is needed).||||||||||||||
|3. If a settlement is in a safe location, in relatively good condition, and on land that is not needed for other purposes, it should be considered for upgrading and regularizing.||||||||||||||

|1) Develop technology - Page 87|||||||
|Accelerate the development and adoption of particular technologies so that far greater volumes of output of food, fibre and fuel can be generated in smaller areas. This includes: a) Genetically modified plants and animals. If, for example, a gene that conferred the ability to survive in a more arid or a more saline environment can be transplanted into a food or industrial crop, this would increase the area of cultivable land b) Production in environments where evaporation and pests can be more easily controlled (such as polytunnels and hydroponics) c) Aquaculture; using fish modified to thrive in intensive conditions.|||||||
|2) Develop new market opportunities - Page 87|||||||
|Micro-nutrients|||||||
|Explore a possible new high-value export market (for example a number of actives and micro-nutrients could be grown, processed and supplied from Jamaica).Changing world demographic trends have already created a new market for actives and micro- nutrients, mostly plant extracts, which are used to reduce the impact of age-related degenerative disease.|||||||
|3) Biofuels - Page 88 (still an emerging industry, but there are already four distinct ge|neratio|ns of b|iofuel|techno|logy:||
|Jamaica should focus on third and fourth-generation biofuels, as these have the potential to give the country the basis for energy independence. While First and second-generation biofuels have limited potential in Jamaica, if Jamaica’s entire annual biomass harvest were converted into fuel using a cellulosic process, it would only displace at most one-third of its oil imports. a) First generation: This includes cane or corn-derived ethanol. b) Second generation: This includes cellulosic ethanol, which allows more of the plant to be converted. c) Third generation: It is projected that an efficient algae-based process could eventually produce 10-20,000 gallons of fuel per acre per year. d) Fourth generation: This involves synthetic genomics; where organisms are engineered to serve as bioreactors, and make fuel.|||||||

|4) Improve Food Security - Page 88|||||||
|A study on the Sugar Industry of Jamaica in 2009 proposed a managed, partial diversification of the cane lands into a combination of more intensive, higher-value uses in order to improve both food and economic security. This included food (such as yam, potatoes, cassava, dasheen, breadfruit and other complex carbohydrates), and high-value plant extracts (such as oleoresins and flavonoids) for export. Measures like these would help to improve Jamaica’s food security, reduce imports and increase exports, retain more capital in Jamaica and thereby strengthen the economy|||||||

|2. Encourage the safe use and disposal of agrochemicals through Agricultural extension programs. Burial (preferably in designated sites) is usually a much better option than surface disposal|||||||
