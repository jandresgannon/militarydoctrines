The Strategy of National Security of Montenegro (Hereinafter referred to as: the Strategy) is the document that defines the development and functioning of the system of national security of Montenegro and it is an expression of its commitment to be a part of the regional and global security systems. 

The Strategy addresses the national interests, security objectives, security risks and challenges, possible reactions of the state of Montenegro to these risks and challenges as well as the structure of the national security system; it also focuses on the capacities of the state of Montenegro and its continuous efforts to adjust to global changes and to contribute to security and stability in South East Europe. The Strategy confirms Montenegro's commitment to undertake all necessary actions so as to meet the conditions for its integration into the Euro-Atlantic and other international security structures. In that context, the strategic goal of Montenegro is to become a full NATO and EU member as soon as it is possible. Having that goal in mind, Montenegro seeks to join the NATO's Partnership for Peace Program. The Strategy addresses the security system that Montenegro aims to establish by using the elements of the current security system and by developing some new ones. Having this approach in mind, the Strategy creates political-legal basis for thorough reform of the national security sector, as well as for legislative adaptation and further development of the national security system. 

The Strategy represents the basic document that defines the concept of security of the state of Montenegro. All other documents that address security issues (such as the Security Policy, the Defense Strategy, Military doctrine, the Strategy for Homeland Security) and other security-related documents derive from it and have to comply with this Strategy. 

The Strategy is a document that will serve as the basis for reforming the sectors of security and defense in Montenegro and that can be changed and adjusted to the extent of innovation and improvement of the security system. This Strategy gives grounds for a close cooperation in security-defense matters with all countries that so wish, provided there is a common interest in that. 

The Strategy is a public document.

3. CHALLENGES, RISKS AND THREATS AGAINST SECURITY AND REACTION OF THE STATE 

## 3.1 Montenegrin Security Context

The range of challenges, risks, and threats is rather wide. It is characterized by rapid change, complexity and reduced significance of geographic distance. Whereas in the past, the threat against territorial integrity and sovereignty was prevailing, today it is primarily the threat against the functioning of society and the concept of the state as a protective institution. Since the majority of risks are transnational by nature, they can no longer be addressed independently. Manifold and flexible multilateral security structures enable Montenegro to safeguard its interests more efficiently than it could do by relying solely on its own capacities and resources. The relative loss of freedom of action, arising from membership in multilateral security structures, is compensated by the security benefits. 

3.2 Classification of challenges, risks and threats against national security Conventional military threats: the number of these threats has substantially decreased, the warning time for large-scale operations with conventional weapons has increased and the direct military impact of potential conventional operations is limited to relatively small regions. However, a geographical escalation involving Montenegro directly can never be ruled out entirely. Potential risks of crises in the region are not altogether eliminated neither. 

Global terrorism and violent extremism: this category of security challenges currently constitutes one of the most important global, regional, and national threats due to its transnational character and links to organized crime. 

All forms of organized crime - illegal trafficking in narcotics, arms, chemical, biological and nuclear-radiological agents, human beings, contraband and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction can develop into the most serious threats against the society, the state and the economy. Corruption in all its forms, abuse of power, *weak institutions* and *lack of* accountability can corrode the state from within and contribute to destabilization and regional insecurity. 

South-East European countries are also confronted with economic, social, and political difficulties accompanying the process of transition to societies based on the principles of democracy and market economy. These difficulties could also generate risks and threats against the security of these countries. 

Natural, ecological, technical and technological disasters, *man-made* accidents, and *epidemics* of human or contagious animal diseases may generate challenges, risks and threats against national security. The security of democratic institutions may be jeopardized by the activities of individuals or groups that violate the laws of Montenegro. 

## 3.3 Normal, Special And Extraordinary Situation

Depending on the level of threat against national security, the security situation in Montenegro can be either normal, special or *extraordinary.* Normal situation is the situation under which there are no significant realistic threats against the national security of the state and the state structures can operate uninhibited and perform their regular activities. 

Special situation refers to a situation under which the level of threat against national security is higher than the acceptable levels relevant for the normal situation. The security situation is characterized as *special* if the activities in individual sectors of the state structures are affected, and normal administrative procedures are no longer sufficient for ensuring normal operation of these sectors. Extraordinary situation refers to a situation under which the level of threat against the national security is realistically assessed as particularly high and when the special measures are needed for protecting the security of the state. In an *extraordinary* situation the normal operation of the state structures is seriously and completely affected. The determination of the level of threat for each of these situations, relevant indicators, measures to be implemented in each case and other relevant details are regulated by the law. 

## 3.4 Reaction Of The State

Montenegro pursues the objectives of its security policy by implementing a strategy of *national* and *international cooperation*. In the interior aspect, comprehensive and flexible security cooperation consists of the assignment of specific missions and corresponding resources to the various bodies contributing to security at different levels, and of mutually coordinated cooperation in their deployment. Comprehensive cooperation requires the employment and cooperation of various authorities at different levels (state, municipal and other). 

Flexible cooperation enables the most appropriate combination of measures and resources to be employed, based on the real needs. 

International security cooperation, should consist of preferably preventive and, if necessary, reactive involvement, too. Through coordinated multinational cooperation, Montenegro will contribute to crisis management, the stabilization of region by elimination of tensions and general mutual reinforcement of security measures. Montenegro will also be focused on strengthening its relations with other countries and international organizations for the purpose of safeguarding its own security and establishing the network of the appropriate agreements for collective security and defense. Cooperation at both interior and international level presumes continuous and intensive activities on modernization and operability of Montenegrin resources. 

Montenegro will undertake all necessary measures to reduce the risks and to protect the state, its institutions and the population against these threats by establishing an efficient system of security and by building trust and partnerships with other countries and international organizations. Montenegro is ready to respond to the threats against national and international security, by undertaking the following three missions: 
- *Prevention and management of vital threats*. All instruments of security policy contribute to the prevention and management of vital threats. That means in particular: helping to relieve natural and manmade disasters in Montenegro and abroad; protecting people, critical national infrastructure and vital facilities; and combating organized crime and terrorism. 

- *Crisis management for the purpose of promoting peace*. Montenegro benefits directly from a stable strategic development and therefore it has every reason to contribute to crisis management and promotion of peace. The criteria for its commitment to those goals include the national interests, basis in the international law and the orientation of such activities towards democracy, human rights, and humanitarian values. 

- *Defense*. Montenegro maintains its capability to protect and defend its sovereignty, borders, territory, air and sea space, and its population against the threat and use of force of strategic magnitude. Protection and defense capability means: maintenance of a credible defense capability; an efficient and flexible system of homeland security; high standards of equipment and training; a degree of readiness that can be adapted to various developments; and interoperable Security forces capable of cooperation with other states for the purpose of defending its own territory. 

In realization of the stipulated missions, Montenegro : 
- *gives absolute priority to political and diplomatic measures*, in conformity with the best international practice, standards and documents; 
- *is committed to the principles of peaceful dispute resolution,* with the least possible use of force within and outside its borders, and to non-intervention; 
- *will participate in the anti-terrorist coalitions*, thereby preserving the rule of law, international law and international humanitarian law; 
- *has capacity to undertake effective preventive actions and to* efficiently respond to all challenges, risks and threats against security and it will depend on building and optimal functioning of its national security system, and 
- *will deploy its security forces as a final option*, selectively and proportionately to the scope and intensity of the threats with full respect to international conventions and multilateral agreements. 

Truthful, rapid, and easily understood information for the public *is of the* utmost importance in all security situations. The importance of information and communications as a means of peace promotion is increasing. The information technology and communications infrastructure are exposed to many threats and risks at all times, not just during the crises. The state's supreme objective regarding the security of the communication infrastructure is to maintain the ability of Montenegro to decide, act and create conditions for ensuring the functioning of its "information society". 

Security and protection of borders is of utmost importance for the security of Montenegro and the region. Montenegro provides external and interior security by establishing the system of integrated border management in compliance with the international standards and in cooperation with the neighboring countries. The integrated border management system shall in particular contribute to combating terrorism and organized crime. 

## 4. System Of National Security

The system of national security is subject to democratic and civil supervision. Defense and security are the responsibility of the society as a whole. The system of national security represents functional unity of all elements of the state for the purpose of ensuring protection of national interests and values of Montenegro. Montenegro assigns particular importance to the role of civil society, strengthening civilians' training, civil-military and police cooperation in security matters and development of the civil sector and institutions of the national security system. Integrated functioning of the system provides: 
- **Self-sustainable stability**, based on the principles of democracy and the rule of law; 
- **Ability** of the state to prevent challenges, risks and threats to security and to respond adequately to them; 
- **Positive** political influence to security environment, and - **Quality analysis** and **assessment** of the security in Montenegro and its strategic environment. 

The integrated system of national security provides for the distribution of resources and infrastructure to all subjects of the security policy on economically and strategically justified basis.
