# Contents Introduction

The National Security Strategy of the Republic of Serbia (hereinafter: the National Security Strategy) is the most important strategic document that defines the basis of security policy in the protection of national interests of the Republic of Serbia. 

Starting point of national security strategy consists of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia, economic prosperity, social stability, development of democracy and the rule of law, respect for human and minority rights, European foreign policy orientation and the improvement of cooperation with the most influential entities of the international community and countries in the region. 

The National Security Strategy confirms the commitment of Serbia to general democratic values, international law and respect for its own state-building tradition. Determinations expressed in the National Security Strategy show willingness of the Republic of Serbia to contribute, within the UN, European and other international organizations and regional structures, to the development and improvement of its own, regional and global security. 

The National Security Strategy provides an analysis of the environment of Serbia, identifies security challenges, risks and threats, establishes national interests, sets goals, basic principles and elements of national security policy and defines the structure, principles of the functioning and accountability within the security system. 

The National Security Strategy is the basis for drafting strategic documents in all areas of social life and functioning of state bodies and institutions, in order to preserve and protect the security of citizens, society and the state. 

The National Security Strategy is a public document showing domestic and international public the main strategic goals of the Republic of Serbia in the field of security. 

# I. Security Environment

## 1. Global Environment

The last decade of the last and the beginning of this century was marked by new security trends in the world. Mostly from the military sphere, security is expanded to other areas, primarily economic, energy, societal and environmental security, including security of the individual and society as a whole. Termination of bloc confrontation, the spread of democracy, creating a multipolar world, the integration processes in the field of security and more intensive economic and cultural cooperation and interdependence reduce the risks of conflict between states, as well as the possibility of crises and conflicts. 

After the end of the Cold War, the risk of a global military conflict is significantly reduced. The world is, however, still faced with many traditional and new security challenges, risks and threats. 

The circumstances that contribute to a growing number of security risks at the global level are primarily large differences in the degree of economic and cultural development, whose consequences are poverty and social vulnerability of the population, which causes the occurrence of demographic and psycho-social phenomena. Regional and local conflicts, ethnic and religious extremism, terrorism, organized crime, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and illegal migration, climate change and growing deficit of energy resources threaten the stability of individual countries and whole regions, and also global security. The essential feature of these challenges, risks and threats is that they become more unpredictable, asymmetric and have a transnational character. 

In terms of the globalized economy, the macroeconomic consequences of major disruptions in the functioning of financial markets in the world also reflect on the state of global security. The consequences of the global economic crisis may lead to the prevalence of narrow national interests in the system of international economic relations and delay in resolving the priorities of global security, actualize the danger of social unrest and contribute to undermining the internal stability in some countries and intensify investment in the military industrial complex and the continuation of the arms race. 

The world is facing the challenges imposed by a gross violation of the UN 
Charter and universally accepted norms of international law, especially the interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states, as well as concept and practice of preventive attacks and military interventionism. Attempts to give legitimacy to the creation of new states in the territories of sovereign states, members of the UN, violate the existing international legal order and significantly jeopardize the overall security situation in the world. Political, economic, cultural and military-security relations in the world are increasingly taking place in the global multipolar and multilateral environment in which a complex interdependence of states is increasingly being manifested. 

Transnational and asymmetric character of contemporary security challenges, risks and threats have influenced the fact that security is indivisible, and it is obvious that no country is able to independently solve complex problems of preserving and strengthening national security. Therefore, security in modern conditions is considered on a more global level, and national security is increasingly associated with the security situation in the closer and more remote environment. 

The answer to transnational asymmetric threats is in the integration of the national security systems, strengthening of multilateral security forums and the collective system of international security as key factors in securing peace, stability and democratic development of countries of the modern world. In such circumstances, there is a stronger need for a cooperative approach to maintaining and improving security based on cooperation and pooling of national security capacities of the states. 

Progress achieved in implementing the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy and the inclusion of European defense forces in resolving the security problems indicate an important role of the EU in the harmonization of relations and interests of European countries and taking a part of the joint responsibility in creating the European and global security. 

# 2. Regional Environment

The states in the region of Southeast Europe accept and promote the values of democracy, economic and social stability and security. In line with these commitments, they opt for dialogue, which reduces the possibility of conflict and positively influence the security environment. Enhancing regional security is increasingly based on cooperation and joint and co-ordinated activities in the area of security, politics and economy and other areas that are aimed at preserving stability and focused on crisis prevention in the region. 

Inherited problems from the past, historical contradictions and consequences of the conflict between the nations and states in the region of Southeast Europe, particularly in the Balkans, in recent history and today affect the security situation in the region. 

Geostrategic position of Southeast Europe, through which the energy and communication lines pass, linking developed countries of Europe with the regions of the Caucasus, the Caspian basin, the Middle East and Mediterranean, also significantly and directly affects the security situation of the states on the European continent. Conflicting interests of states in the use of transit routes and available resources may lead to the creation of regional crises and threats to security and stability in Southeast Europe. 

Risks of the outbreak of wars and other armed conflicts in the region of Southeast Europe, although reduced, have not been eliminated. Trying to review the provisions of the Dayton agreement, which would be contrary to the interests of any constituent nation, would destabilize the security situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and thus in the region. 

Separatist aspirations in the region are real threat to its security. By its level of difficulty and complexity, as well as negative implications for the internal stability of countries in the region and their security situation, the attempted secession of a part of the territory of the Republic of Serbia based on the unilateral declaration of independence by the provisional institutions of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija is a particularly distinguished problem. 

Recognition of the so-called Republic of Kosovo by some states in the immediate environment of the Republic of Serbia, as well as a number of countries in the world, adversely reflects on strengthening measures of trust and cooperation, and slows down the process of stabilization in this region. 

Terrorism and the expansion of organized crime, corruption, trafficking in narcotics and weapons, as well as people trafficking, which are most pronounced in Kosovo and Metohija, significantly burden the security situation in Southeast Europe. Inadequate resolution of the return of refugees, displaced and internally displaced persons in former Yugoslavia and their unsatisfactory social status make security situation in the region even more complex. 

Security situation in the region is characterized by distinct national, religious and political extremism and the destruction of cultural heritage, which, in addition to existing economic and social problems and lack of state institutions, drags out the process of faster and more successful democratic transition of the countries in the region. Relations among the states in the region are also burdened by the return of refugees and return of their property and the problems of borders, as well as the problems arising from inadequate integration of certain minority communities and groups in the wider social environment. Therefore, the integration of this region into European and other international security structures is difficult, which increases the risk of renewal of the crisis and armed conflicts. 

In such conditions, the continuity of international support and military and security presence with the UN mandate in the region can contribute to stabilization and prevent the occurrence of conflicts and their turn into large-scale conflict. 

Due to the complex nature of security in the region, the countries of Southeast Europe are increasingly in the situation to use their joint efforts in suppressing the negative processes that threaten their safety. Through building joint mechanisms for the prevention of risks and threats and crisis management, the preconditions for faster democratic transition of all the countries in the region are achieved, thus creating conditions for their approaching and joining the European Union. 

# 3. Security Of The Republic Of Serbia

Democratic processes and European foreign policy orientation of the Republic of Serbia strengthen its international position and positively influence the creation and improvement of policy of cooperation and strengthening measures of trust in the region. The security policy of the Republic of Serbia established on this basis makes the country a significant factor of regional security cooperation and reliable partner in international relations. 

Republic of Serbia is still faced with significant challenges, risks and threats that endanger its security. The main threat to security is attempted secession of the territory of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija. Security situation in Kosovo and Metohija is burdened by ethnically motivated acts of violence that contribute to the creation of insecurity and fear among members of the Serbian people and minority ethnic communities. Slow development of democratic institutions and democratic political culture and relations in Kosovo and Metohija, disregard of basic human rights, denial of freedom of movement, the expansion of organized crime, usurpation and destruction of private property and cultural-historical heritage and difficult process of return of refugees and internally displaced persons, as well as other security problems that have regional dimensions turn this region into the main source of instability in the Republic of Serbia. 

Unlawfully proclaimed independence of Kosovo and the failure of the international civil and military presence in the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija in the establishment of a multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multicultural civil society contributes to the further strengthening of the factors which manifest a negative impact on the security of the Republic of Serbia and will represent the source of its long-term instability. 

The overall security situation in the Republic of Serbia is significantly affected by the consequences of many years of civil war waged on the territory of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the international isolation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and NATO bombing, as well as the problems of transition. 

The Republic of Serbia, as well as other countries of the region, is faced with terrorism, various forms of organized crime, corruption, trafficking in narcotics, the destructive activities of certain religious sects, people trafficking, and financial and high-tech crime. 

## Ii. Security Challenges, Risks And Threats

The Republic of Serbia is determined, based on the development of democratic processes, European foreign policy orientation and policy of cooperation and strengthening measures of trust in the region, to build its own security, which makes it a significant factor of regional security cooperation and reliable partner in international relations. 

Despite the positive results in strengthening the security position of the Republic of Serbia, there are still significant security challenges, risks and threats. The consequences of many years of civil war waged on the territory of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the international isolation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and NATO bombing, the problems of transition, as well as key issues of global and regional security, reflect on the security of the Republic of Serbia to a large extent and can threaten its stability and peace. 

Challenges, risks and threats to the security of the Republic of Serbia have a complex character, and they may manifest with similar content, scope and intensity at the global, regional and national level. Basic criteria in considering and stating challenges, risks and threats are the consequences on the security of the Republic of Serbia that could arise in case of their appearance. 

The threat of armed aggression against the Republic of Serbia is significantly reduced but not completely excluded, and may occur as a result of armed conflicts, either global or regional in nature, caused by conflicting interests of major powers or countries in the region. 

Separatist aspirations of some nationalist and religious extremist groups represent a source of constant security risk and a direct threat to the territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia. Separatist efforts of a part of the Albanian national minority in Kosovo and Metohija, which culminated in the illegal unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo, are a direct threat to the territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia and one of the most serious security challenges in the region. Such efforts may encourage the spread of separatist ideas and thus become a factor of destabilization in other parts of the Republic of Serbia and the wider region. 

Unlawfully and unilaterally proclaimed independence of Kosovo is the greatest threat to the security of the Republic of Serbia. The imposition of unilateral solution contrary to the UN Charter and international law contributes to the area to become long-term factor of instability in the region. Respect for human and minority rights and the implementation of democratic standards, particularly in terms of security and protection of Serbian and other non-Albanian population, sustainable return of refugees and internally displaced persons and the decentralization of Kosovo and Metohija, is not carried out in accordance with the proclaimed goals of the international community. Unfavorable development of the security situation and implementation of "Comprehensive Proposal for Kosovo Status Settlement" (Ahtisaari Plan), which is not accepted in the United Nations Security Council, can cause an escalation of violence in Kosovo and Metohija and become a source of risks and threats to the security of the Republic of Serbia and the destabilization of the region. This is contributed by the formation of paramilitary, so-called Kosovo Security Force, which represents a serious threat to the existing mode of regional arms control and threatens the balance in the region. 

Security of the Republic of Serbia could also be threatened by the *armed* rebellion, as a specific form of armed conflict motivated by unconstitutional and violent aspiration to change the borders. Also, *disputes with the use of weapons* may arise as a result of escalating terrorism and border, territorial and other disputes. 

Terrorism is one of the greatest risks and threats to global, regional, and national security. Modern terrorism is global in its scope, and is also associated with violent religious extremism. In terms of global terrorism, the Republic of Serbia may be the target of terrorist activity, both directly and using its territory for the preparation and execution of terrorist actions in other countries. From the standpoint of security risks and threats the Republic of Serbia is facing with, what is particularly important is the link between terrorism and all forms of organized, transnational and cross-border crime. 

Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is potentially the greatest threat to global and European security, and therefore the real threat to the security of the Republic of Serbia. The danger that weapons of mass destruction could come into possession of the structures the state has no control of, especially terrorist groups and individuals, is a particular threat to security. 

National and religious extremism, which has roots in the conflicts on ethnic and religious grounds in the recent and distant past, is a risk factor and a significant threat to security. The slow pace of democratization of economic and political processes can significantly contribute to the increase of inter-ethnic tensions that can potentially turn into conflicts. 

Intelligence that the foreign intelligence organizations conduct through illegal and concealed action is the real threat to the security of the Republic of Serbia. It is accomplished through the weakening of its political, economic and security capacities and through the influence on the direction and dynamics of social processes, contrary to national interests. The combination of traditional intelligence methods with sophisticated means makes it difficult for their actions to be detected. 

Organized crime in the territory of the Republic of Serbia, especially in Kosovo and Metohija, is particularly manifested in the areas of drug trafficking, human trafficking and illegal migrations, as well as in economic and financial sphere, the proliferation of conventional weapons and the possibility of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In its nature, organized crime is a serious threat to security and overall development of the state and society. 

Corruption threatens the fundamental values of society and leads to the decline of trust in state institutions, makes the implementation of essential reforms difficult, slow the transition process, economic development, foreign direct investment and integration processes and to the destabilization of the situation in the country and region. 

Problems of economic development of the Republic of Serbia due to many years of economic sanctions and the destruction of vital economic facilities and transport infrastructure during the NATO bombing has resulted in many negative social phenomena, which are in their overall performance a significant risk factor in the transition process. High rates of unemployment and poverty of a substantial portion of the population, along with the presence of a large number of refugees and internally displaced persons, are potential sources of serious social and political tensions that can produce a situation of high risk. Highly-educated personnel leaving the country, which is caused by the impossibility of adequate employment and evaluation of work, reduces the prospects for faster economic and any other recovery of the country by relying on its own resources. 

Energy interdependence and vulnerability of infrastructure for production and transportation of fuel, as well as the inevitable trend of attrition of nonrenewable energy resources, are the real threats to *energy security* and a real challenge to stability and security of the Republic of Serbia. 

Uneven economic and demographic development of the Republic of Serbia, which was a strong source of crisis in the past, is still a security risk in this region. Different levels of economic development of certain regions, in conjunction with their demographic characteristics, cause the appearance of larger migrations of population from underdeveloped to developed regions, from the regions of extreme overpopulation caused by demographic expansion towards the areas with an extreme depopulation. Demographic trends and migrations, in addition to social problems and the growth of crime, can lead to increased instability and the emergence of risks and threats to the security of the Republic of Serbia. 

Unresolved status and difficult situation of refugees, displaced and internally displaced persons from the territory of Croatia, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija, slow implementation of their safe return and no guarantee of their survival, as well as not resolving the fate of missing persons from those areas complicate the normalization of relations in the territory of former Yugoslavia and represent a potential source of instability in the region. 

Unfinished process of demarcation between the states of the former Yugoslavia is a potential source of conflict and impedes the establishment of full cooperation between countries. Any inadequate attempt to resolve the issues of law and protection of national minorities in the countries of the region can be a significant source of instability. 

Uncontrolled spending of natural resources and endangering the environment has already reached serious proportions. This primarily refers to the excessive exploitation of forests, uncontrolled disposal of energy potential, arable land and sources of drinking water, air, water and soil pollution, as well as uncontrolled waste disposal. In addition to irreparable material damage, such treatment causes adverse changes in macro and micro climate and seriously undermines the right of people to life in a healthy environment. 

The consequences of natural disasters and technical and technological accidents, as well as *endangering the environment and health of citizens* due to radiological, chemical and biological contamination, are the constant security risks for the Republic of Serbia, its population and material goods. Technological accidents are a significant risk in which the consequences of the effects of hazardous substances can affect not only the territory of the Republic of Serbia, but also neighboring countries. The environment is further endangered by high-risk facilities in the region, as well as industrial facilities with technology that does not meet international environmental standards. 

Hazards associated with the appearance and spread of infectious diseases in humans and diseases in animals represent a security risk that could be growing in the future. 

Drug addiction, as a growing social problem, is also given the character of the security problem and affects the increase in the number of serious crimes. 

Destructive action of certain religious sects and cults in the family and society becomes a growing problem and creates a significant security risk. 

The tendency of increased use of ICT is accompanied by a constant increase in the risk of *cyber crime and threats to information and* telecommunications systems. In this respect, there is a risk of threatening from the outside, but also the possibility of misuse of data on citizens and legal entities. 

Climate change at the global level, particularly *global warming* negatively affects the change of biodiversity in ecosystems and leads to disturbances in agricultural production in the territory of the Republic of Serbia, which could have implications on its overall security and economic stability. 

There are also some other risks and threats to security, with lower or higher probability of manifestation and recognition, such as: abuse of new technologies and scientific achievements in the field of information technology, genetic engineering, medicine, meteorology and other scientific fields. The specificity of these security challenges, risks and threats is a reduced possibility of their early detection and preventive action. Security challenges, risks and threats at the global, regional and national level are constantly growing and changing the character, intensity and forms of manifestation. 

Content, scope and likelihood of the manifestation of the challenges, risks and threats to the security of the Republic of Serbia directly affect the definition of national security policy and adequate capacity building of national security system. 

## Iii. National Interests In The Field Of Security

Interests of the Republic of Serbia are the expression of vital values and needs of the citizens, nations and the country and arise from the highest values that are established by the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia. 

Republic of Serbia considers, as the basic national values, above all, independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, freedom, equality, building and keeping the peace, rule of law, democracy, social justice, human rights and freedoms, national, racial and religious equality and gender equality, the inviolability of property and environmental protection.

The Republic of Serbia is determined to use all available capacities and resources to protect its national interests. 

## Iv. National Security Policy

National security policy is a part of the overall state policy and is implemented through the consistence program of measures and activities that the state undertakes to achieve the goals of national security policy. Its implementation creates the preconditions for political, economic, social, cultural and overall social development of the Republic of Serbia. 

## 1. Basic Orientation Of National Security Policy

The Republic of Serbia is committed to respect the obligations arising from the UN Charter, the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Helsinki Final Act. It particularly emphasizes refraining from the threat of force or the use of force as a threat to the territorial integrity or independence of any state, respecting the existing internationally recognized borders and resolving disputes and outstanding issues through peaceful means. 

The Republic of Serbia is committed to respect the international law, strengthening the role of the UN, OSCE and EU and to create mechanisms for maintaining security in the world, with equal respect for the interests of all countries, nations and ethnic groups. Accordingly, it does not consider, in advance, any state or alliance hostile. 

In the protection of sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Republic of Serbia is determined to use diplomatic, legal and all other legitimate means in accordance with the firm position outlined by the Constitution never to recognize the decision of provisional institutions of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija on the unilateral declaration of independence. 

Starting from the belief that the national security of the Republic of Serbia is closely linked to the security of the region of Southeast Europe and the continent as a whole, the Republic of Serbia will improve its relations with the EU and NATO members and partners on the basis of direct, close and long-term cooperation and common action. 

Taking into account the interest of preserving its own territorial integrity and sovereignty, the Republic of Serbia will largely harmonize its foreign and security policy with the positions and activities of the EU in all the major issues of global, European and regional character. 

Through the process of European integrations, the Republic of Serbia expresses its willingness to build capacities and capabilities of national security system, in accordance with the standards and obligations deriving from the European security and defense policy. Entry into force of the Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU will enable the Republic of Serbia to intensify dialogue with the EU on the issues of common interest, including security and defense issues. 

The Republic of Serbia's accession to the NATO Partnership for Peace program confirms its long-term commitment to contribute to the common democratic values and strengthening regional and global security. The Republic of Serbia emphasizes its belief that the active and meaningful cooperation of all countries of the Western Balkans with the NATO and Partnership for Peace member countries is the road to permanent stabilization and prosperity of this region.

The Republic of Serbia is committed to improving the role and position of women in decision-making processes and strengthening state mechanisms for ensuring gender equality. 

The Republic of Serbia is determined, due to the increasing impact of energy and fuel on all aspects of social life and key aspects of security, to pay special attention to providing energy security in terms of the ownership structure and construction of production and infrastructure capacities. Successful resolution of issues of energy security is a prerequisite for the overall social development and satisfaction of the citizens' needs. 

The Republic of Serbia is determined, in accordance with its needs and capabilities, to develop a system of national security, which is able to adequately respond to security risks and threats, as well as to participate in the construction and improvement of regional and global security. 

In accordance with the changes in security factors in strategic environment and national interests, the Republic of Serbia will determine on the content, scope and manner of the security organization of the society and integration in the security structures.

## 4. Elements Of National Security Policy

Elements of national security policy include foreign policy, economic policy, defense policy, internal security policy, policy of protection of human and minority rights, social policy and policies in other areas of social life. 

## 4.1. **Foreign Policy**

The Republic of Serbia is permanently committed to democracy, individual freedoms, rule of law and free market. It is convinced that the stability and security of the entire international order can be achieved through cooperation, the preservation of democratic values and respect for international law. It is ready to provide its direct contribution to the development of peaceful and friendly relations, strengthening of institutions, respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter, the Helsinki Final Act, the development of economic cooperation and close cooperation in the field of security in Europe. 

The Republic of Serbia accepts common values of democratic societies, based on tolerance, respect for diversity and social justice, and thoroughly supports international and regional cooperation, as a model for harmonizing various interests and resolving disputes between nations, countries and cultures. 

Priority objectives of foreign policy in the protection of the interests of the Republic of Serbia are: persistence in diplomatic efforts to defend its constitutional order, the acceleration of the process of European integrations and the development of good neighborly relations and regional cooperation in the Western Balkans. 

Acting in accordance with the United Nations Charter and basic norms of international law, the Republic of Serbia will continue to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity using all available diplomatic and legal means. Together with the international community, the state authorities of the Republic of Serbia will continue to contribute to the creation of preconditions for the peaceful crisis settlement, in accordance with the Security Council Resolution 1244, international law and the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia. 

Strategic priority of the Republic of Serbia is accelerating the accession process. The Republic of Serbia will continue with the intensive implementation of political and economic reforms of the society and their harmonization with the European standards, as well as meeting other necessary conditions on the road to European integrations. The National Program for Integration of the Republic of Serbia into the EU is the basis for the integration activities. 

The Republic of Serbia will continue to improve cooperation and establish better and more meaningful relations with countries in the Western Balkans, as well as contribute to the harmonization of regional sector policies with the EU legislation. In accordance with the Dayton Agreement and fully respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina, it will continue to develop special links with the Republic of Srpska. 

Historically close and extensive links of the Republic of Serbia with the Russian Federation on the issues of wider national interests are strengthened by the strategic partnership in the domain of energy.

The Republic of Serbia plans to adopt a national strategy and action plan on small arms and light weapons as soon as possible and improve its legislation in line with the assumed international obligations. 

## 4.2. **Economic Policy**

Economic stability is a main prerequisite for the achievement of the goals of national security policy of the Republic of Serbia. The priority of economic policy is sustainable development with a tendency of long-term expansive development and high rate of economic growth, as a significant measure of support to strengthen the economic stability of the state. Economic development of the Republic of Serbia is also significantly conditioned by external factors, which necessitates the need for continuous fulfillment of conditions related to the EU accession and integration processes and active participation in the international economy and regional arrangements. 

The objectives of economic policy are the development and achievement of economic stability of the state and creating conditions for foreign and domestic investments, as well as all other forms of development of international cooperation, including cooperation with the international financial institutions. Achieving the goals of economic policy creates the conditions for improving the living standard of citizens and reduction and elimination of all negative economic and social consequences of transition. 

Dynamic and continuous economic development and intensifying international economic cooperation reduce the likelihood of the emergence of risks and threats at national and international level. Economic development is provided by the continuous investment in infrastructure, industrial and agricultural production, development of high technology, and the intensive development of research resources, education and the creation of adequate working conditions for highly educated staff. In this way, important preconditions for economic development and competitiveness of the economy are provided, and dependence on imports and reduction of external debt reduced. By creating its own capacities and redirecting existing resources, all the processes are accelerated that must be institutionally supported through liberalization of the economy of the state, encouraging the market principles of business with executive legal guarantees for free and fair system of competition and consumer protection. A number of these processes is strengthening the state banking system and the system of insurance and reinsurance, with low inflation and appropriate measures of monetary and fiscal policy. 

Priorities of the Republic of Serbia in order to accelerate economic development are the development of knowledge-based economy, reducing external and internal debt, the privatization of socially owned enterprises and restructuring of public enterprises, in line with national interests. An important precondition for security is to reduce the difference in the development of the regions, which is possible to be achieved by involving local governments in the general trends of the economic policy of the Republic of Serbia. Stimulating the return of the population to the economically underdeveloped areas, the implementation of measures for the improvement of industrial production, agriculture and trade, as well as development of transport infrastructure, significantly contribute to reducing the differences in regional development. 

Important prerequisites for reducing poverty and unemployment and participation of the shadow economy in the overall economy of the country are also stimulation of the development of small and medium enterprises, continuous investment in agriculture, tourism development and strengthening of institutional and legal framework related to environmental quality. Improving institutional capacity and powers of the state in the economy, rationalization of public administration and the fight against corruption and organized crime are some of the basic preconditions for the improvement of the overall national security system. 

The global economic crisis and disruptions in the financial market also significantly reflect on the economy of the Republic of Serbia. Determining the appropriate economic goals and adopting economic measures for crisis situations represent a significant segment of economic policy, relevant to the security of the Republic of Serbia. Timely economic measures ensure energy security of the state, which means the divergent trends of supply, stability of supply and production of fuel, creating the necessary autonomy and strengthening of regional position in the supply of fuel. 

The aim of appropriate measures of economic policy is that, in accordance with the possibilities of the state, support defense and security preparations, and in the case of endangering state security, to ensure the needs of the population and provide logistic support to all structures in the national security system. In order to ensure that these measures are promptly taken, it is important to harmonize the existing and adopt new regulations that would affect the operation of the state in responding to various situations. 

## 4.3. **Defense Policy**

The Republic of Serbia is committed to active participation in the processes of cooperation and joint action with other countries and entities of international relations in the construction of national, regional and global security.

The orientation of defense policy is the basis for making normative, strategic-doctrinal and planning documents, and when they become operative, conditions for achieving the defined goals of defense policy are created. 

## 4.4. **Internal Security Policy**

Internal security policy provides protection of the democratic political system, human rights and freedoms, public order and peace and the citizens' property security and other social values. In achieving internal security policy, legislative, executive and judicial bodies work together, with effective policies in the economic, social and health care fields, as well as other areas that have an impact on internal security. 

For the implementation of internal security policy, normative extension of the activities of the competent state bodies and other entities dealing with matters of security has a special significance. Adoption of appropriate strategies, timely collection and exchange of data and information, coordination of security services and strengthening their organizational, human and material capacities are a necessary precondition in achieving the objectives of internal security policy. 

Along with government and other bodies and institutions, the entities in the field of private security services have increasing responsibility for the implementation of internal security policy, whose activities include security protection of individuals, objects and other material goods not covered by the protection of the competent state authorities. Of particular importance is that the social activities of the entities in the field of private security are entirely normatively and doctrinally regulated. 

The action of state and other bodies and institutions of the Republic of Serbia in the field of internal security is focused on the protection of constitutional order, life and property of citizens, preventing and combating all forms of terrorism, organized, financial, economic and cyber crime, corruption, money laundering, human trafficking, drug addiction, proliferation of conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction, intelligence and subversive activities, as well as other security challenges, risks and threats. To achieve the objectives of internal security policy, it is particularly important to constantly improve information and prevention activities. 

In determining the internal security policy and maintenance of public order, state and other bodies and institutions of the Republic of Serbia start from the goals that are directed to the respect and protection of human rights and dignity, as well as professional, impartial and transparent execution of tasks with respect of customary, religious, cultural and other characteristics of ethnic and other social groups and specificities of local communities. 

An important prerequisite of achieving and improving protection of life and property of citizens, human and minority rights is the cooperation of state bodies with the entities from the field of private security and other institutions, local governments, professional associations, churches and religious communities, the media, minority communities, civil society organizations and citizens, thus developing relationships of trust, building and strengthening security and solving security problems. 

Efficient operation of judicial authorities in prosecuting all crimes, especially those that threaten the constitutional order and economic system of the country, is the basis of improving the situation of national security. This is also contributed by the continuous improvement of legislative solutions, harmonizing the organizational structure of judicial authorities and continuous education and training of holders of judicial office. 

 Implementation of the Strategy for Integrated Border Management of the Republic of Serbia and the Convention on Police Cooperation in South East Europe, through the exchange of information with countries in the region, coordinating work and strengthening capacities of all border services, enables faster flow of goods and people across the border, while preventing cross-border crime, preventing and combating illegal migrations. Such action improves the efficiency of monitoring and securing the state border, in accordance with the European standards. 

Building and strengthening a modern and unique system of protection and rescue have an important role in achieving internal security. Developing the appropriate social capacities for crisis management and organizing citizens and effective system of information, the conditions are created for effective protection of life, health and property of citizens and environmental protection. Particularly important is the preparation for the action in emergency situations, in case of fire, natural disasters, technical and technological accidents, effects of hazardous substances and other dangerous situations. 

Acceptance and implementation of international, mainly European, and national standards in the security field, particularly in the areas of human security and risk management, significantly contribute to achieving the goals of national security. 

## 4.5. Policy Of Protection Of Human And Minority Rights

Protection of human and minority rights is a civilizational value, the basis of national security and a measure of democratic character of the society and state. 

The policy in the field of human and minority rights of the Republic of Serbia is based on the provisions of the Constitution, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities of the Council of Europe and other ratified international treaties. 

Compliance with the accepted commitments in the field of human and minority rights and improving the legal framework, which allows monitoring in the function of preventing human rights violations and marginalization of citizens based on political, ethnic and religious affiliation, is a significant aspect of improving national security. 

The Republic of Serbia guarantees all individual and collective rights of national minorities on its own territory. It also promotes and advocates for the obligation to respect human and minority rights of Serbs in other countries through the improvement of relations with those countries, and in accordance with the relevant documents of international law. 

Starting from the importance of interethnic tolerance and intercultural dialogue, the Republic of Serbia takes effective measures to improve mutual respect, understanding and cooperation among all the people living on its territory, regardless of their ethnic, cultural, linguistic or religious identity. The Republic of Serbia is determined to develop cooperation with representatives of minorities, as well as their countries of origin, in order to improve their position and their rights. 

## 4.6. **Social Policy**

Social policy of the Republic of Serbia is an important part of national security policy. Reforms that are implemented in the Republic of Serbia for the democratization of the society and the stabilization of the economy involve finding new solutions for systemic improvement of social policy. 

The main goal of social policy is satisfying the needs of citizens, protection of their rights and improvement of their security. In addition, the goals of social policy of the Republic of Serbia are focused on providing social protection, reducing unemployment, improving working conditions, education and continuous training of human resources. In social policy, special attention is paid to increasing the birth rate, improving the demographic structure and the protection of the family. By the achievement of the projected goals of social policy, the care of an individual, his personal security, and thus the overall security of the state is improved. 

## 4.7. **Policies In Other Areas Of Social Life**

Improving education, science, scientific work, environmental protection, culture and other spheres of social life, as well as their harmonization with the EU standards, have a strategic importance for the protection of national interests. 

Recognizing the growing importance of knowledge, education policy is focused on organizational changes in the education system, which will allow its much greater social integration. In this way, the essential preconditions are created for overall social development and raising awareness about the importance of education for national security. In achieving this goal, it is necessary to build favorable working conditions for teaching and educational staff at all levels of organization. Developing security culture of citizens, especially young people, represents an important basis of improving national security. Through the process of education, it is necessary to provide mastering modern knowledge and technologies, as well as acquiring the basis for independent and continuous studying during the working life. In addition, education should contribute to the formation of identity and sense of belonging to the Republic of Serbia. 

Improving the scientific work and its harmonization with the social needs contributes to the development of society. A significant segment of the policy of scientific and research work is aimed at improving material conditions for research and development, as well as creating conditions for the specialization of scientific and research staff in order to stop them from leaving the country. A scientificresearch work in the field of security has a special importance for achieving and improving national security. 

The policy of technological development is aimed at overcoming the technological backwardness and reaching the level of technological development that will be in function of social development and strengthening national security. In this sense, complete integration into the international communications and information system is required, with the development of strategic partnership with the countries that are the bearers of modern technology. With the development and adoption of new technologies, the preconditions are created for the rapid development of defense industry and its integration into the flows of national and international economy. 

Due to the serious violation of the environment, environmental protection becomes increasingly important area of security of the Republic of Serbia. Activities in this area are directed at the elimination of consequences caused by the NATO bombing and the protection and conservation of natural resources that may be affected by uncontrolled exploitation. In achieving this goal, it is necessary to ensure integrated management and control of the planned use of natural resources, the respect for international conventions on environmental protection and the adoption of international standards in this area. 

The Republic of Serbia pays special attention to the health care of its citizens. Building and strengthening modern health care system and its linking with other institutions of society help create the preconditions for preventing the emergence and spread of infectious diseases in humans and diseases in plants and animals, as well as for the effective elimination of the consequences that they cause. 

Rich cultural and historical heritage of the Serbian people and Serbian citizens, as a part of the world cultural heritage, also is the basis for the protection of national and cultural values and contributes to strengthening of the national security; therefore, it is necessary to be adequately presented to the public and protected by international institutions. 

By the promotion of religious freedoms and affirmation of indigenous, historically-developed multi-religious structure of the Serbian society, the Republic of Serbia is established as a modern, secular European state. Cooperation between the state and churches and religious communities, support given to interreligious dialogues and mutual cooperation between churches and religious communities weaken the motivation for the manifestation of religious fanaticism and extremism and encourage the process of harmonization of religious relations on the principles of tolerance, understanding, respect and mutual solidarity of churches and religious communities, which strengthens the social cohesion of the society, and thus the national security of the state. 

The policies of education, science, culture, technological development and environmental protection are an essential part of national security policy and significantly contribute to the achievement of its objectives.

# Conclusion

The national security strategy is an expression of the compliance of the relevant political factors, government institutions, civil society organizations and citizens in determining the general approach and ways of achieving protection of national interests, in accordance with the actual and estimated challenges, risks and threats to security of the Republic of Serbia. 

The strategy is based on modern theoretical knowledge in the field of security, national experience and security needs of the society, as well as the experiences of other countries in creating their systems of national security and resolving the risks and threats to security. 

The National Security Strategy is a document in which the key strategic goals in strengthening national security are transparently put to the international and domestic public and the commitment of the Republic of Serbia to actively contribute to building and improving regional and global security is expressed. 

Contemporary social movements are marked by dynamic changes in international relations, which suggest that, in addition to the existing ones, new security challenges, risks and threats will also appear, which are to be timely and adequately responded. Therefore, the national security strategy should be promptly adjusted to the conditions in which it is implemented, for the protection of national interests. 

Implementation of the items contained in the Strategy requires coordinated involvement of all the state bodies and other entities dealing with the security matters. In this way, full and integrated operation of the national security system of the Republic of Serbia is achieved. 

The National Security Strategy of the Republic of Serbia is a basic document in which the basis for the organization and achievement of the security functions of the state, through activities at all levels of social organization, are provided. It represents a starting point for the development of the Strategy of Foreign Policy, the Economic Development Strategy, the Defense Strategy, the Strategy of Internal Security, the Social Development Strategy and the strategies in other areas of social life, as well as for the normative regulation of activities within the national security system.
