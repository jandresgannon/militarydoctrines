PART I: STRATEGIC CONTEXT
1. INTRODUCTION
The development of the internet and

technology innovation changes over the recent
decades have resulted in fundamental changes
and challenges in every society worldwide. Our
daily lives, human rights, economies, and
social interaction are deeply impacted by
information and communication technologies.
A common and

Page|1485


-----

open cyberspace promotes social and political
engagement, breaks down communication
barriers between countries, communities, and
citizens, and ensures transparency, allowing
interaction with and exchange of information
and ideas in real-time worldwide. All the
developments and growing use of information
and communication technologies have brought
great benefits, but also threats, which makes
cyber defense and security-critical.

Various groups and individuals with

malicious interests perpetuate continuous

efforts in the cyberspace, which impact the
progress and functioning of states. Privacy
breaches and identity theft are also increasing
and highly concerning problem for society at
large.

On the one hand, the government is

increasingly investing in digital infrastructure
to provide digital services to citizens.  On the
other hand, the public is increasingly using the
internet because of the advantages it offers.

As a developing country, Albania relies on

information technology as well, intending to
improve the quality of life and public services.
Alongside the advantages of using new digital
technologies, internet use also has its issues
related to cybersecurity. Cyberthreats are on
the rise, taking advantage of technological
weaknesses or lack of knowledge inadequately
using these tools, thus threatening information
systems security.

One of the current and ongoing challenges

in many countries is the building of a
developed digital society, which is

cybernetically protected, equipped with the
required knowledge and skills to maximize
benefits and manage risks.

Under the “National Security Strategy 2014
2020” and the “Cybersecurity Policy Paper
2014-2017”, Albania has taken important steps
to improve its cybersecurity situation.

Alongside the developments in the technology
and information field, and the public services
digitalization revolution, the legal framework
on cybersecurity was completed and improved
upon. Due to this progress, Albania has
improved its rank in the Global Cybersecurity
Index

Page|1486


compared to 2017 from 89[th] to 62[nd] globally

and top 36[th] in Europe.

However, this process has not yet reached

the change scale and pace required to stay
ahead of the fast-moving evolution of the
various cyber threats. Cybercrime is

undoubtedly one of the major threats to modern
global security and for this reason,

cybersecurity has become an important part of
national security. For this reason, the National
Cybersecurity Strategy 2020-2025

development is a necessity for the

establishment of the relevant institutional
mechanisms that will improve the

cybersecurity level in the country.

This strategy will be based on the following

core principles to meet government

commitments and to be incomplete coherence
with the strategic developments in developed
countries:

  - application of the same core values in both

the physical and digital worlds;

  - fundamental rights, freedom of

expression, personal information, and privacy
protection;

  - access for all;
  - democratic and effective governance;
  - joint responsibility in guaranteeing

cybersecurity.

2. ASSESSMENT OF THE CURRENT

SITUATION IN ALBANIA

The current cybersecurity situation in

Albania was evaluated in cooperation with the
relevant institutions and is based on the
following 4 pillars:

1. Cybersecurity situation;
2. Cybersecurity legal framework;
3. Safe internet for children;
4. Education, research, and training on

cybersecurity

**2.1. Cybersecurity situation**
_2.1.1 Critical information infrastructure_
The “National Security Strategy” adopted in

2014 has provided the national framework and
pillars to increase security in the country. Being
a developing country without the necessary
cybersecurity legal infrastructure, this field has
only been developing in the last two years in
Albania, over which critical and


-----

important information infrastructure has been
identified in the public and private sectors.,
besides, minimum security measures to be
implemented for better cybersecurity in this
infrastructure have been developed along with
the development of a methodological

mechanism for sector CSIRT establishment and
operation at the national level.

The legal framework on electronic

communication security is completed with
legal provisions on the security and integrity of
electronic communication networks and

telecommunication networks covered by Law
No. 9918, dated 19.5.2008 “On electronic
communication in the Republic of Albania” as
amended, which has transposed EU directives
on electronic communication.

The cybersecurity legal framework has also

designated the National Electronic Certification
and Cybersecurity Authority (NECCA), as the
authority responsible for overseeing the

implementation of the law.

As a result, after the implementation of the

law on security, the current critical information
infrastructure situation in the **banking sector**
has improved compared to two years ago.
Considerable security measures, approved by
NECCA have been applied in this

infrastructure, and sector CSIRT shas been
established, creating a safe cyberspace.

In the **financial sector, cybersecurity is**

divided into two pillars, the public and the
private, and the current situation is as follows:

Security measures according to the

applicable legislation and in compliance with
the ISO 27001 standard are applied in critical
government information infrastructure used by
public institutions, allocated in the government
data center, and managed by the National
Agency on Information Society. NAIS is a
government sector CSRIT and was certified in
2018 for this standard, and ISO 27001 standard
policies are applied to any government
infrastructure managed by NAIS.

Critical infrastructure managed by private

operators is currently being identified and in
some cases, the investment to develop them is
also being identified.


**In the health sector, which is also divided**

into the public and private pillars, the
cybersecurity situation is as follows:

Measures approved according to the law on

security have been applied in critical

infrastructure managed by public

operators/institutions, which has led to

improved cybersecurity levels. Besides, groups
responsible for managing and addressing
incidents, which did not exist when the legal
framework was absent, have also been
established.

The private operator managed information

infrastructure, considered to be critical

infrastructure as defined by the European
Commission legal framework on information
networks and infrastructure, have not been
identified and the situation study conducted by
the relevant authority found that they do not
meet security elements that critical

infrastructure should guarantee.

**Energy Sector** Currently, all generation,

transmission, and distribution energy system
operators are implementing innovative

technologies based on computer systems and
data transmission networks, to manage and
optimize their technological processes.

SCADA systems are implemented or are
planned for implementation in all three sectors
of the energy system, and they have their
operation, computer system, and data

transmission centers. Along with reading and
analyzing energy system data remotely,

operation modules automating processes that
are currently completed manually by operators
are planned for implementation in the near
future. Transitioning to independent systems
that operate automatically will certainly require
the implementation of security measures and
policies, since the impact of cyber-incidents
would be great. This will certainly require
energy operators to pay special attention to
system security and to develop internal
procedures and human capacities for

cybersecurity when planning ICT projects and
automation.

Page|1487


-----

**In the transport sector, which is composed**

of three pillars, the situation is as follows:

Critical information infrastructure related to

_air transport meets minimum security rules_
obligations and sector CSIRT has been

established in the relevant sector.

Critical information infrastructure in _road_

_transport does not meet any minimum-security_
rules obligations, including the establishment of
the relevant CSIRT.

Information infrastructure in maritime

transport, which is considered critical

infrastructure in the meaning of the legal
framework adopted by the European Commission
on networks and infrastructure is yet to be
identified.

Besides, critical information infrastructure in

the water supply sector, which is managed by
local governance, has yet to be identified as such
in the meaning of the applicable legislation on
cybersecurity and no security measures are
applied in this regard.

Considering that the majority of cyber threats

and cyberattacks are perpetrated through

electronic communication networks,

cybersecurity issues in the digital infrastructure
and electronic communication networks and/or
services are covered and are under the
responsibility of the Electronic and Post
Communication Authority (AKEP). According to
article 122 of Law No. 9918, dated 19.5.2008
“On Electronic Communication in the Republic
of Albania” and Regulation No. 37 dated
29.10.2015 “On Technical and Organization
Measures to guarantee Electronic

Communication Network and/or Services

Integrity”, AKEP requires adequate technical and
organizational measures to be put in place by all
electronic communication entities operating

under the General Authorization Regime to
guarantee electronic communication networks
and/or services security and integrity for all
services they provide to their subscribers,
including DNS services. AKEP has conducted
and continues to periodically conduct inspections
and audits in entities, to verify the establishment
and implementation of the relevant technical and
organizational security measures, and in

cooperation with NECCA it follows up on
security incidents reported by electronic

Page|1488


communication businesses. AKEP is the “.al”
domain administrator and has authorized 8
businesses as accredited registries to provide
_domain name registration services under the .al_
domain (TLD name registries).
With the inclusion of this service in the critical
and important information infrastructure list,
the registries accredited by AKEP to provide .al
domain name registration services will also be
subject to the provisions of regulation No. 37
“On Technical and Organization Measures to
guarantee Electronic Communication Network
and/or Services Integrity”.

Internet penetration in Albania is still

ongoing and the country currently has midlevel internet use. Some 67% of the population
and some 40% of households had internet
access in 2019.

**2.1.2 Cybercrime**
Similar to other countries, Albania is often a

victim of malicious cyber activity perpetrated
by criminal actors, including state and nonstate actors that can use network infrastructure
in the country and abroad. Alongside the
improvement of internet services, Albania has
also experienced the rise of various forms of
cybercrime. The most common forms of
cybercrime dominating in Albania include
fraud-related to internet banking such as
_phishing_ _and_ _spam._ Even when those

responsible for cybercrime against the Republic
of Albania are identified, it is often difficult for
law enforcement agencies in the Republic of
Albania and international organizations to
persecute when they are located in restricted
jurisdictions.

Currently, there is a lack of necessary tools

to obtain general cyber intelligence, using
human and logistical resources available for
law enforcement activities.

For this reason, it is fundamental to increase

capacities to address cyber challenges, which in
turn requires a change in structures, approach,
technical and logistical capacities, etc.

An important step forward in legislation

development and measures were taken against
cybercrime will also be the first national
cybercrime strategy, which will be


-----

developed by the relevant authorities and will
be put into action in a relatively short time.
This document will define the methods for
combating cybercrime in the cyberspace and
will provide more adequate tools for this fight.

**Cybersecurity legal framework**

A comprehensive national approach to

cybersecurity cannot be achieved through the
use of technologies and services alone, and it
should be accompanied by a proper and current
legal framework focusing on the dynamic
nature of the ICT space and the evolving nature
of cyberthreats.

Various national and international structures

have organized awareness-raising campaigns
for various stakeholders on protecting from
threats resulting from cybercrime and other
attacks against internet safety.

A legal and regulatory framework protecting

from various forms of electronic crime and
abuse is fundamental to the establishment of a
reliable environment for electronic

communication and transactions.

The main laws related to cybercrime are the

following:

Law No. 7895, dated 27.1.1995, “Criminal

Code of the Republic of Albania”, as amended;

Law No. 2/2017, “On cybersecurity”;

  - Law No.  9918 dated 19.5.2014, “On

Electronic Communications in the Republic of
Albania”, as amended;

Law No. 9887, dated 10.3.2008, “On

Personal Data Protection”, as amended;

  - Law No.  8457, dated 11.2.1999, “On

Classified Information”, as amended;

Law No. 9880, dated 25.02.2008 “On the

Electronic Signature”, as amended;

  - Law No.  107 dated 15.10.2015, “On

Electronic Identification and Trusted Services,”
as amended.

Regarding the above, legislation in the

cybersecurity field should be harmonized with
EU legislation, thus creating

a complete and codified mechanism to

adequately address and resolve issues.

Besides, where possible, international

internet security mechanisms should be

accessed, signed, ratified, and implemented,


including the allocation of sufficient resources
based on national priorities and considering
technological developments and applying the
neutral technology principles.

**_Safe internet for children_**

The increasing use of the internet by

children is the greatest issue regarding their
online safety, not only in Albania. Child online
safety is one of the priorities for Albania and
all institutions focusing on this issue in their
activity.

In 2018-2019, the government’s main and

strategic partner in child protection and rights,
UNICEF Albania conducted a study on
**“Children’s experiences of internet use in**
**Albania”[79], which surveyed 1000 children**
between the ages of 9 and 18 and their parents,
and its preliminary results found the following:

Surveyed children accessed the internet for

the first time at 9 years of age, with 37%
stating that they used the internet at 8 years of
age or even earlier. 51% of children

interviewed have permanent access to the
internet (whenever they wish).

In general, children interviewed use the

internet more and have more online

technological skills than their parents. This
creates an obstacle for parents in effectively
overseeing child experiences on the internet,
not only as regards controlling access but also
to help children in developing a critical
judgment of their online experiences and
content.

The study found that during their time

online, children have had upsetting situations.
Namely, 14% of children interviewed have had
upsetting experiences online, especially those
between 15 and 17 years of age. 1 in 10
children reported at least one unwanted sexual
experience through the internet.

The statistics of this research show that

children are exposed to harmful content online,
such as images of violence or abuse (1 in 5
children),

79 The “Children’s experiences of internet use in

Albania” will be published in 2019 by UNICEF Albania.
Its preliminary findings were presented in the “VIRAL”
Summit, organized by _UNICEF Albania in November_
2018: [https://www.unicef.org/albania/viral-summit-](https://www.unicef.org/albania/viral-summit-better-internet-children-and-adolescents-albania)

-----

content discussing physical violence (17% of
children) or content discussing suicide (1 in 10
children). 1 in 5 children has been subjected to
denigrating and hate messages, which is also an
indicator of possible online bullying situations.

Besides, the study shows that children find it

difficult to distinguish the difficult situations
they experience and to ask for help: 1 in 5
children never told anyone about what upset
them, while 75% of children interviewed asked
their peers and not adults for help and support.

Over 20% of children interviewed accept all

friend requests on social networks, while 25%
of children say they have interacted online with
someone they don’t know, and 16% of them
have met in real life someone they only knew
online. Parents are aware of only 9% of the
abovementioned cases.

Children interviewed note they are under no

control or supervision from their parents when
watching videos online (78%), when using
social networks (58%), when using texting
apps (57%), or when using the computer or
telephone web camera (56%).

As the study notes, the uncontrolled use of

the internet by children is at a very high level.
Often this results in grave consequences. Lack
of parental information regarding the risks of
unsafe internet is also at high levels.

Even though some internet service providers

offer the technical possibility to apply parental
controls, they are not applied. Besides, a study
of the situation in 7 regions of the country,
using information from awareness-raising

campaigns with some 12,000 middle school
children, found that the majority of children
confirm that their parents do not have clear
information on the risks of unsafe internet use
by children.

Another study conducted in 2019 by

UNICEF Albania entitled “WebFactor”80 has
found

80  UNICEF Albania, 2019, WebFactor: Assessment

of the legal framework and institutional readiness to
address child sexual exploitation and abuse

Page|1490


a series of legal and institutional gaps, which
hamper the efficient guarantee of child safety
online.

The study found that even though the

Albanian legislation is overall in line with
relevant international standards on child sexual
abuse, it is often fragmented and lacking very
important definitions related to child sexual
abuse, their engagement, and coercion to
participate in sexual and other improper acts.
The principle of protection from harmful and
illegal content online is hindered by two
factors: 1. The definition for harmful material
is very general and leaves much space for
individual judgment; and 2. The lack of clear
definitions for child exploitation in sexual acts
makes the identification of illegal acts difficult.

Another important finding is related to the

Albanian legislation regulating the operation of
internet service providers, which is unclear
concerning charging of administrative

authorities the competencies to block or delete
specific materials. This does not allow these
authorities to clearly understand their role and
functions, and to have appropriate mechanisms
to exercise them. Clear legislation on the exact
administrative authorities’ competencies and
procedures is necessary for this field.

When considering criminal investigation and

prosecution for cases of online sexual abuse
with children, the study notes that neither the
police nor the prosecution is fully equipped
with the adequate infrastructure to effectively
investigate online child abuse cases. The
cybercrime investigation unit of the State
Police lacks the resources to undertake active
online surveillance, thus hampering their ability
to start _ex officio and proactive investigations._
The failure of internet service providers to
quickly react to the requests of the prosecution,
and difficulties in identifying alleged

perpetrator IP addresses, gravely impact the
overall quality and efficiency of the

investigation, and

online in Albania

consequently, the possibility to bring
perpetrators to justice.

The study shows that Child Protection Units

and other professionals dealing with child
protection online need capacity development
and support in handling online child abuse.
Besides, there are no specific online child
abuse data that have been collected or
published.

**_2.4. Education, research, and training in_**

**_the field of cybersecurity_**

In developing countries, human resources

with adequate skills and qualifications in
cybersecurity have proven to be one of the
most difficult challenges as regards the
implementation of a national level CSIRT and
the improvement of the overall national
cybersecurity situation.  Ensuring an adequate
level of education, research, and training on
online safety, and supporting the internal needs
of professionals regarding cybersecurity is
critical.

Several study programs in the field of

cybersecurity are offered by higher education
institutions, but they are in their first steps and
more effort is required to reach an adequate
level. Besides, no cybersecurity research
initiatives have been undertaken in Albania.
The knowledge gained by students in

universities is insufficient to meet labor market
requirements in this field. Furthermore, even
academic staff has its issues in covering the
entire range of this field.

As a result, developing appropriate

cybersecurity curricula and enhancing

academic staff knowledge is an immediate
necessity to meet market demand.

On the other hand, human resources

capacity development through dedicated

training in the cybersecurity field in the public
administration and all other public sectors is
another necessity that public institutions should
consider.

Besides, a common approach is required for

the education of the government staff and the
public regarding safer practices on

cybersecurity awareness.

The National Cybersecurity Strategy will be

monitored by measuring core indicators

defined in the indicator Passport annex. The
core indicators, which will serve as a road map
for the Strategy implementation monitoring,
were developed to track the achievement of
specific objectives translated into a detailed
action plan.

The indicators were developed to be

understandable, measurable, and easily

compared over the monitoring periods. Two
core indicators were developed for each
specific objective, which can be simple or
complex depending on the sub-objectives they
are measuring.

PART II

POLICY GOAL AND

STRATEGY SPECIFIC

OBJECTIVES

The Government of the Republic of Albania

will achieve the following goals to improve the
cybersecurity level in the country:

Guaranteeing cybersecurity at a national

level through the protection of information
infrastructure, while strengthening

technological and legal tools.

Establishing a safe cyberspace, raising

awareness in society, and developing

professional capacities.

Developing mechanisms required for child

safety in cyberspace, while at the same time
preparing the younger generation to benefit
from the advantages of information technology
and overcome development challenges.

Page|1491

Improving national and international

cooperation with strategic partners in the
cybersecurity field.

**4.** **Policy goal 1. Ensuring cybersecurity at**

**the national level through the protection of**
**information** **infrastructure** **and**

**strengthening technological and legal tools.**
The rapid developments across the sectors of
the economy, heavily based on technological
innovation as well, makes it difficult for
decision-makers to understand and mitigate
risks related to the use of information and
communication technology. These risks are a
common global responsibility and include
national and international perspectives.
Domestically, the common responsibility

included the industry, and the administration,
and the citizens.

Development and implementation of

policies and tools to establish a safe

communication space, is the most valuable
component for cybersecurity incident

management and secure electronic transactions
in the domestic market, intending to guarantee
safe electronic interaction between public
authorities, citizens, and businesses, thus
improving the effectiveness of online public
and private services, and electronic business
and commerce.

The digital space is sensitive: information

systems and networks may be impacted by
security incidents, such as human error, natural
causes, technical faults, or attacks. These
situations are increasing in number and are
becoming ever more complex and may lead to
great financial losses and impact the wellbeing
of the society overall.

Establishing trust in the online environment

is the key to economic and social development.
Lack of trust, especially because of the
perceived lack of cybersecurity leads

consumers to hesitate in using electronic
transactions.

**_Specific objective 1:  Improving the_**

**_legal framework providing norms and_**
**_regulating cybersecurity in the country and_**
**_aligning this framework with European_**
**_Union directives and regulation._**

Security authorities in the country have

developed the legal basis for their activity.

Page|1492


However, even though even though laws,
secondary legislation, regulations, and standards
have been developed, the analysis conducted and
the evaluation of the cybersecurity maturity level
in the country, found the need to revise the entire
legal and regulatory framework achieve complete
alignment with European Union directives, and to
achieve domestic institutional coordination.

This specific objective aims at harmonizing

the Albanian legislation on cybersecurity with the
EU legislation. Besides, a national procedure will
be developed for action in case of extraordinary
situations created by cyber crises.

**Sub Objectives:**

Improving cybersecurity regulatory framework

in line with sector laws, to appropriately address
and resolve issues including, but not limited to
IoT, 5G technology, artificial intelligence.

Continuously adapting standards and rules to the

developments of the cybersecurity field.

Meeting engagements undertaken regarding

cyberspace as a member country of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Defining a national procedure for extraordinary

situations created by cyber crises, taking concrete
measures to resolve the situation in real-time.

**_Specific objective 2:  Establishing_**

**_and operation of CSIRTs in all industry_**
**_sectors nationally_**

According to the law “On cybersecurity” and

the obligations provided therein, and to guarantee
information and communication system security,
there is an obligation to dynamically identify
critical and important information infrastructure
and then establish incident response teams
(CSIRT). Currently, the initial measures for the
establishment of these teams in some of the
infrastructure defined by a relevant decision have
been taken, but this is a continuous process
monitored by NECCA.

Achievement of this policy 1 objective will be

measured with the number of established
CSIRTs. All critical and important information
infrastructure operators should have their relevant
CSIRT, which should meet minimum

requirements and be audited by NECCA.


-----

**Sub Objectives:**

Creating optimal work conditions for CSIRT

operation, in line with the duties to guarantee
cybersecurity in critical and important

information infrastructure.

Building CSIRT capacities through training

and cyber drills.

**_Specific objective 3:  Strengthening_**

**_and implementing security measures in_**
**_critical_** **_and_** **_important_** **_information_**

**_infrastructure_**

Based on the assessments made in 2018 to

2019 by the authority responsible for

cybersecurity, a major task for critical and
important information infrastructure remains
increasing and strengthening the

implementation of security measures.  Public
and private organizations should improve their
procedures and develop cyber defense strategic
plans against cybercrime or cyberattacks, and
risk management plans in case of such attacks.
The objective of this Strategy is to stimulate
and obligate all critical and important

information infrastructure to develop strategic
plans in case of cyberattacks and to take
measures to withstand these attacks and to
recover the damages or eliminate these attacks.

The achievement of this specific objective

will require all critical and important

information infrastructure operators that have
their CSIRTs, to implement specialized

systems for the identification, prevention,
analysis, and damage recovery of cyberattacks,
and to learn lessons for the future. Besides,
operators should conduct risk management
analyses and self-assessments on the level of
cybersecurity maturity in the infrastructure they
manage.

**Sub Objectives:**

Using advanced hardware and software
solutions to identify, prevent and manage cyber
incidents.
Analyzing critical and important information
infrastructure to assess their risk management.
Developing strategic plans to protect

cyberspace from potential incidents.


Conducting critical and important information

infrastructure self-assessments to measure

**_information_** **_infrastructure_** **_to_** **_combat_**

**_cybercrime,_** **_radicalization,_** **_and_** **_violent_**

**_extremism._**

On the one hand, the internet leads to the

development of society and facilitates quick
procedures and access to data, but on the other,
it is a tool for malicious individuals/groups to
perpetrate cybercrime or to radicalize

individuals from vulnerable or marginalized
groups for extremist purposes and to commit
punishable offenses. Concerning this, public
and private organizations should take a series
of measures to combat, control, and minimize
these activities.

To achieve this, the development of

mechanisms to regulate and provide safe
internet in public spaces is aimed. Besides, the
aim is to cooperate with civil society
organizations and businesses to control and
identify polluting elements circulating online
and threatening cybersecurity in the country.
In this context, mechanisms to monitor the
abovementioned phenomena will be developed.

**Sub Objectives:**

Monitoring and preventing phenomena that

stimulate violent extremism and radicalization
among vulnerable groups in cyberspace.

Continuously identifying polluting elements

circulating online and threatening cybersecurity in
the country.

Developing mechanisms to regulate safe

internet in public spaces, certified by the
regulatory entity for the cybersecurity field.

Developing the capacities of the authorities

responsible for fighting cybercrime.

Increasing regional cooperation in the fight

against cybercrime.

Ensuring professional skills and capacities

to respond to and manage cybersecurity
incidents is no longer just an option in our
times.

Building capacities in the cybersecurity field

aims at responding as effectively as possible
against cybercrime.  This is an integral
component of the international cooperation that
could improve harmonization with the EU
vision for a global, open, free, and safe
cyberspace for all, ensuring respect for human
rights.

The methods used to develop capacities and

raise the awareness of the society are
fundamental in determining the effectiveness of
establishing a safe space.

## 6. Policy goal 3: Developing
 mechanisms required for child safety in cyberspace, while preparing the younger generation to benefit from the
 advantages of information technology and overcome the challenges from the recent developments.

Providing safe internet for children and

youth in Albania remains one of the strategic
objectives of the Albanian government, as also
stated in the National Agenda for the Child
Rights 2017-2020.   The internet,
smartphones, and several other information
technologies have become a part of the daily
lives of a considerable number of children.
The family (parents), peers and the school are
three spaces where children socialize, while the
digital space has become the fourth.  For them,
the distinction between online and offline is
becoming increasingly blurred and they shift
incessantly between the two spaces.  Child
protection online requires specific and

articulated actions. At the same time, child
protection should be proportional to the risks
children face, and they should not restrict the
use of information technology for child growth,
education, and development. Government
policies should create a digital space that is
responsive to the needs of children while at the
same time guaranteeing the protection and
respect of their rights. Thus, taking immediate
steps to create safe digital spaces is paramount,
while also guaranteeing


-----

the respect for their rights and the fulfillment of
all children's development potential.

(ICT) rapid development dynamic. ICT
security and development in the state

administration can only be enhanced with close
cooperation and in coherence with technology
developments and trends. Increased

cooperation and coordination between state
institutions will be strengthened to guarantee
interaction and coordination in strengthening
security and minimizing damages from
cyber-attacks.

Albanian endorses and will be a part of

international initiatives aimed at improving and
strengthening security. Cooperation with

NATO and the EU will be specially

strengthened by becoming part of common
cybersecurity initiatives. Albania’s

membership in internationally recognized

cybersecurity organizations and forums and
improved cooperation are priorities.

In the quality of NATO member country,

Albania recognizes cyberspace as the fifth

PART IV IMPLEMENTATION,
INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY,
ACCOUNTABILITY

The development of the National

Cybersecurity Strategy 2020-2025 is based on
the European Union Cybersecurity Strategy
and is a continuation of the Cybersecurity
Policy Paper 2015-2017.

    - A participatory and comprehensive

methodology with all public institutions
contributing to cybersecurity in the country was
used, providing a large number of stakeholders
with the opportunity to contribute.


-----

  - The strategy was based on EU and other

international organization commitments and
standards, and on the two assessments conducted
by ITU and the Oxford University with the
support of the World Bank.

  - The engagement of public and private

organizations allows this Strategy to be
objective and implementable.   The interinstitutional working group and all the

stakeholders involved in the consultation process
provided valid comments leading to a series of
draft revisions, intending to adopt a

comprehensive strategy where everyone takes
ownership and contributes to guaranteeing
cybersecurity in the country.

  - This Strategy is not just for the institutions

but is also a strategy that stimulates and supports
cyber protection for individuals, citizens, and
especially children as the future of this country.
It also identifies measures to not only fight
cybercrime, but also incitement of terrorism and
violent extremism through the cyberspace.

The action plan accompanying the National

Cybersecurity Strategy 2020-2025 was

developed based on the following:

a) findings and recommendations of the

Cybersecurity Policy Paper 2015–2017

implementation assessment report;

b) findings and recommendations from the ITU81

and Oxford University82 assessment reports;

c) Public institutions budget plans for the

2020 to 2022 period.

As provided in the specific objectives and

main activities proposed in this Strategy and the
Action Plan, the coordinating role should be
taken by the National Electronic Certification
and Cybersecurity Authority in cooperation with
the National Agency for Information Society.

Besides, this document considers the

obligations stemming from the European

integration process, the recommendations made
in this regard by the NIS Directive and the EU
adaptations for ENISA as EU CERT, and the
relevant commitments as a NATO member
country.

[pdf](https://cesk.gov.al/Publikime/2019/AlbaniaCMMReport.pdf)


After having been assessed and completed by the
inter-institutional working group responsible for
developing the Strategy, all proposed
measures/activities were further detailed during
the review of financial effects resulting from the
implementation of this National Strategy and its
Action Plan 2020-2025, establishing the need to
review biannually based on the sector
development dynamics.

Any institution responsible for activities

should plan for their realization guaranteeing
earmarked budgets, human resources, and
technical capacities for their implementation.

An annual assessment will be undertaken to

review activity implementation and identified
objectives achievement, based on indicators met.
Institutions responsible for implementing

activities and achieving results must report
following reporting standards. The Strategy
Coordinator should develop and publish the
annual report.

PART V

ACTION PLAN AND FINANCIAL
RESOURCES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

_Activity costing methodology_
The expenditures required for the NAP

implementation have been determined through a
costing of the activities in this action plan.  The
methodology used to develop these costs presents
a combination of the methods that can be used in
multi-actor strategies.

The main methodology used is the Activity
Based Costing – ABC, where the responsible
institution and the sources for covering costs are
identified for each activity, and resources are
allocated for all products and services based on
the actual consumption for each activity

The budget was developed based on the cost

of each activity reflected in the action plan, the
length and frequency of its implementation, and
the number of beneficiaries per activity.

The following methodology has been used to

estimate costs for the main activities:

  - The estimation for human resources

expenses is based on the estimated time required
to implement the activity and an average daily
wage for a given category of civil servants.

Page|1497


-----

  - Services expenses estimation.
Service costs in the relevant institutions

based on adopted standards were considered
for these activities.

  - Costing of activities related to the

development and review of legislation,

monitoring, and functioning of permanent
structures, etc.

Estimations for these activities consider

running expenses incurred for example for
salaries, Social Security contributions,

international expertise (when planed), and
consumables.

  - Estimation of expenses for activities

related to studies, awareness-raising

campaigns, training programs, foreign

expertise, etc., was based on specific similar
initiates and the nature of activities and market
costs for such services.

  - In estimating training expenses, the

training cost per person was considered. ASPA
costs and/or costs applied to similar training in
the past were used as cost units.

Page|1498


  - For activities, information on which was

not complete (such as projects or studies), an
analogy method for costing is applied, meaning
that expenses for similar activities included in
previous budget programs were considered.

_Budget and financial resources for action_

_plan implementation_

The Nation Cybersecurity Strategy will be

implemented during the 2020-2025 period.
The expenses required for each activity,
specific objective and policy goal have been
costed to enable the implementation of this
strategy.

The overall budget for the implementation

of the Strategy is reflected in various forms:

  - The overall budget per year for each

activity, specific objective, strategic goal and
funding sources

  - The Budget is detailed according to

activity, financing source and institutions
responsible.
