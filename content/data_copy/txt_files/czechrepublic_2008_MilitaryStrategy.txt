# The Military Strategy of the Czech Republic

**Prague 2008**


-----

## A. INTRODUCTION

1. The Military Strategy of the Czech Republic brings forth a set of basic principles for
defence of the state and for development of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic
(hereinafter referred to as the Armed Forces)[1] and therefore provides a point of reference
for formulation of subsequent strategies and policies or may even bring about appropriate
legislative changes.

2. The Military Strategy reflects upon the current and future global security environment
while building upon security interests and defence as well as foreign policy principles
defined in the Security Strategy of the Czech Republic. Furthermore, this document keeps
true to the fundamental principles of the NATO’s Strategic Concept and Comprehensive
Political Guidance, and the EU’s European Security Strategy.

1 The Armed Forces are, for purposes of the Military Strategy, understood in a different perspective than Law no.
219/1999 Coll., on Armed Forces of the Czech Republic, and they comprise Army of the Czech Republic,
Military Police and Military Intelligence.

## B. DEFENCE STRATEGY

3. The current global security environment can be generally characterized by its growing
complexity, variability, unpredictability and a marked asymmetry which render it
a subject to continuous re-evaluation. Extremism, terrorism, proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction and their means of delivery including ballistic missiles rank among the
gravest threats that can directly or indirectly impact security interests of the Czech
Republic and her allies. Other serious threats could originate from regional crises caused
by long-lasting unresolved problems that can escalate into intrastate or interstate armed
conflicts. It is also apparent that growing economic and military power of some countries
may position them to pursue their national interests in a more aggressive manner
threatening to use and, in extreme cases, actually using military force. Finally, threats
such as instability caused by failed or failing states, disruption or deliberate cut-off of
strategic resources flows or disputes over their control, abuse of information and
information technologies, or humanitarian crises and natural disasters also require
appropriate attention. These threats have already manifested themselves up to various
degrees and it is necessary to face them in a timely manner. Nevertheless, a large-scale
conventional conflict in the territories of NATO or EU member states is still highly
unlikely in a foreseeable future; such a threat would be identified well in advance and
therefore met with effective countermeasures.

4. **The Czech Republic’s security interests are tightly interwoven with interests of our**
**NATO allies and EU partners. Her ability to effectively and efficiently prevent and**
**face any future threats stems solely from international cooperation. Therefore, Czech**
defence policy is based on active participation in activities of organizations the Czech
Republic is a member of, particularly NATO and the EU. Czech defence policy is also
maintained by acting in international organizations contributing to the strengthening of
confidence and security in the world (United Nations Organization, Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe and others), and by fostering sound bilateral
relations.

5. International confidence and security building measures and arms control, disarmament
and non-proliferation regimes are important tools of threat prevention and risk reduction.
Their obsolescence, destabilization and weakening can adversely affect the security
environment. Hence, the Czech Republic will in an appropriate manner continue to work
toward increasing their effectiveness.

6. **The cornerstone of defence of the Czech Republic against present or future threats**
**is her active participation in the NATO’s system of collective defence founded on**
**a strong transatlantic link. The Czech Republic is seeking to strengthen the principle of**
collective defence of common security interests of NATO member states throughout its
area of operation.

7. In the current security environment, collective defence within NATO is the only
effective, efficient and credible means of defence of the Czech Republic. The Armed
Forces fulfil their core task of preparing for defence of and defending the Czech Republic
against external attacks in this context. The national defence system will be tailored to
serve this purpose. The Czech Republic also assumes its share of responsibility for
security and defence of her allies and for protection and advancement of common
security interests of NATO member states. In accordance with the requirements resulting

from NATO defence planning, the Czech Republic will continue to build up her Armed
Forces and sustain her capability of providing host-nation support to allied forces when
necessary. The Czech Republic will also fulfil tasks within the NATO Integrated Air
Defence System using her own fleet of supersonic aircraft.

8. Given the continuing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of
delivery, including ballistic missiles, the Czech Republic will, in the spirit of the North
Atlantic Treaty, take part in the international defence projects to cope with this threat,
presented namely by ballistic missiles carrying weapons of mass destruction.

9. **The current security environment calls for an active involvement of the Armed**
**Forces in operations outside the Czech Republic’s, NATO’s and EU’s territories.**
Preserving stability and security in regions of interest[2] through NATO- and EU-led
operations or coalition operations is the most effective way of minimizing negative
effects of above-mentioned threats to security interests of the Czech Republic and her
allies. Active participation in such operations is therefore essential for safeguarding of
security interests of the Czech Republic and holds a correspondingly high place on the
priority list of the Armed Forces. Effectiveness of the Armed Forces’ deployment
depends on their ability to react promptly to the emergence and development of crisis
situations, and also on their ability to take a comprehensive approach involving concerted
cooperation of military and civilian actors in the planning as well as execution phase of
an operation.

10. Defence of the Czech Republic necessitates adequate and unfluctuating funding allotted
especially for the development of those elements of the Armed Forces that are to be
utilized in the most likely operations. The defence budget will over the coming years
have to correspond to the level adequate to fulfil the declared political-military ambitions,
solve the urgent necessity of modernisation of legacy equipment, cover training
requirements and infrastructure investments, and enable the Czech Republic to actively
participate in NATO and EU activities in the time when both organizations increase scale
and scope of their engagement.

## C. POLITICAL -MILITARY AMBITIONS

11. Outside the territory of the Czech Republic, the Armed Forces are deployed solely within
a wider effort of the international community – in operations led by NATO, EU, United
Nations or ad hoc coalitions while respecting the principles of the United Nations
Charter. With the exception of the arctic areas, the Armed Forces are deployable, in
principle, without any geographical limitation. Deployed task forces shall be composed
primarily of organic units augmented with specific modules, particularly combat support
and combat service support modules.

12. For the purposes of collective defence, in accordance with Article 5 of the North Atlantic
Treaty, the Czech Republic is to provide land and air forces from a set of forces
earmarked within the NATO defence planning. The main component is a brigade task
force built on the basis of a medium mechanized brigade. In case of an armed conflict
that would threaten the very sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Czech Republic,
all assets and capabilities of the professional armed forces will be used together with
general conscription.

13. Non-Article 5 (of the North Atlantic Treaty) military operations:

a) The Czech Republic is ready to actively contribute to non-Article 5 military
operations that represent the most likely scenario of the Armed Forces deployment.
Within operation tasks related to the conduct of combat activities as well as tasks of
humanitarian assistance and post-conflict stabilization and reconstruction can be
fulfilled successively or simultaneously.

b) The Czech Republic shall be capable of participating in simultaneous military
operations with the following task forces:[3]

i) a brigade task force for a six-month period without rotation;

ii) a sustainable battalion task force rotated after a six-month period. Within
deployment of a battalion task force, the Armed Forces shall be able to provide
headquarters for a multinational brigade task force for a period of up to one year;[4]

iii) a sustainable company task force rotated after a six-month period;

iv) stand-by task forces up to the level of a battalion earmarked for the NATO
Response Force or EU Battle Groups at the time, when the brigade task force is
not deployed.

c) Moreover, the Czech Republic shall be capable of contributing specialized task forces
or groups of experts to other operations. These may include special units and

3 Those task forces can be, besides units of land forces, also formed by units of air forces or combat support or
combat service support units. In this case, the period of their deployment can be shorter or the capability of
rotation can be limited.

4 Headquarters for the multinational brigade task force can be provided only if the brigade task force is not
deployed as stated in i).

detachments or training and advisory expert teams, in addition to groups of military
personnel who may serve in multinational headquarters and observation missions.

14. Support of civilian authorities in non-military crises:

a) Within the Czech territory, the Armed Forces shall be ready to provide, to a necessary
extent and according to the availability, assets and capabilities in support of the
Integrated Rescue System and the Police of the Czech Republic reinforced by active
reserve units when necessary. Generally, all assets and capabilities of the Armed
Forces could be used to this purpose.

b) Outside the Czech territory, the Armed Forces shall be capable of providing assets
and capabilities as per actual availability in support of civilian authorities and
organizations.

## D. DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES AND
 THEIR CAPABILITIES 

15. The Czech Republic shall focus on developing primarily those capabilities of the Armed
Forces that are usable and beneficial within multinational task forces. Development of
such capabilities will also ensure more efficient fulfilment of Armed Forces’ tasks on the
Czech territory. Therefore, in the view of the defence strategy given in the Chapter B, the
Czech Republic does not have to possess the full spectrum of capabilities that would be
otherwise necessary for autonomous operations of the Armed Forces. As a contribution to
the improvement of defence capacities of NATO and the EU, the Armed Forces shall
focus mainly on the ability to provide a sufficient number of deployable units of land and
air forces. The Czech Republic shall continue to maintain her significant international
position regarding capabilities of defence against chemical, biological, radiological and
nuclear weapons.

16. The Armed Forces shall fulfil the political-military ambitions of the Czech Republic and
tasks stemming from legal acts in their peacetime force structure. Replenishment and
reinforcement of the Armed Forces in crisis situations shall be attained through reserves.
A sufficient pool of reservists shall be ensured by appropriate parameters of obligatory
reserve. In case of temporary reinforcement of the Armed Forces when necessary to deal
with crisis situations within the Czech territory, especially during a state of emergency or
a state of war, other military units and installations can be activated to support civilian
authorities. Arrangements for wartime replenishment and reinforcement of the Armed
Forces shall be redesigned appropriately to a new system resting exclusively on
conceptual measures (in terms of planning, training, operational, mobilisation, economic,
legal, and organizational measures). Even though the defence of the Czech Republic
relies on the professional armed forces, the defence remains to be a concern of the whole
society, which is, _inter alia, signified by preserving the institution of general_
conscription.

17. The composition and amount of supplies shall be maintained in accordance with accepted
NATO standards. Supplies availability shall be consistent with the readiness of respective
units.

18. The Armed Forces are being designed as a single set of efficiently structured, universally
usable, interoperable and deployable forces, which are capable of joint action and
coordination with civilian actors, and fully utilize advantages of international
cooperation. Their build-up and development shall focus on requirements of the most
likely operations and shall allow for flexible reaction to changing conditions.

19. The Armed Forces shall focus primarily on strengthening of deployable capabilities.
Modernisation projects shall mitigate the generational obsolescence of weapon and
support systems as available funds allow and with due regard to the priorities of the
Armed Forces development.

20. Principles of the Armed Forces development:

a) **Single set of forces. Single set of forces and capabilities is formed to meet the defined**
political-military ambitions and to fulfil tasks resulting from legal acts. Forces shall be

7

built and trained to fulfil military tasks as well as to support civilian authorities in
non-military crises.

b) **Effectiveness. The given defence strategy and adequate availability of technological**
and production capacities shall enable efficient and flexible adjustment of the force
structure to the needs of the most likely operations while preserving the ability to react
effectively to less probable situations.

c) **Deployability. Combat units, combat support and combat service support units shall**
be built as deployable and increasingly more sustainable in the full spectrum of
coalition operations. Of those Armed Forces’ components, which are by their nature
not deployable, certain branches bearing selected capabilities shall be also prepared
for deployment. All members of the Armed Forces shall be deployable to operations
both within and outside the Czech territory.

d) **Joint operation. Deployable forces shall be developed and trained so that they can**
operate effectively and efficiently in joint task forces.

e) **Interoperability. Deployable forces shall be interoperable with allies in NATO and**
partners in the EU.

f) **Modularity. Units of the Armed Forces shall be built so as to be able to compose**
required task forces through mutual combinations in accordance with the operational
requirements. The basic element of the land forces force structure shall be a modular
combat battalion. The organisation of the Armed Forces shall enable generation of
tactical task forces based primarily on organic units augmented with specific modules,
particularly combat support and combat service support modules.

g) **Coordination with external actors.** In order to achieve desired effects, the Armed
Forces shall develop their ability to coordinate and closely cooperate with state and
non-state civilian actors when planning and conducting operations.

h) **International cooperation. Advantages of international cooperation shall be utilized**
in acquiring and enhancing Armed Forces capabilities, _inter alia, by sharing_
collectively-owned capabilities, particularly the strategic ones. International
cooperation shall, to a suitable extent, also include participation in establishing
multinational units, training and education, and international research, development
and armament projects. Reinforcement of mutual cohesion of the defence industry
within the EU will be an important factor in the previously-mentioned area.

i) **Competent personnel. Personnel policy shall create conditions to recruit and retain**
qualified and highly motivated military professionals and civilian employees who are
indispensable for successful implementation of this strategy.
