### INDIA’S
 NATIONAL
 SECURITY
 STRATEGY


##### MARCH 2019


-----

#### PREFACE

National Security is an all-encompassing term that includes the protection of a nation and its citizens

from a range of multi-dimensional threats and coercion. The overwhelming scope of a strategy to deal

with these threats in a fast-evolving national and international landscape is sometimes a hindrance in

formalising a ‘National Security Strategy'. However, a well-defined National Security Strategy is also a

clear vision of the path that a nation should take in the pursuit of attaining its national objectives. It also

provides a guide for all organs of the state on the policy directions that they should follow.

The lack of a formal National Security Strategy for India has been the subject of some criticism among

the strategic community. Therefore, the initiative by the Indian National Congress to commission this

report deserves credit. This report will generate a broader discussion and help refine the contours of

India’s National Security Strategy.

In preparing this report, we neither ignore the strength of India's growing power nor the difficulties that

shackle us from achieving our real potential. We live in a time of considerable uncertainty, but what is

certain is that the choices we make today will define our future place in the world.

Each period in history comes with its unique set of challenges. We have attempted to suggest solutions

to the security risks that India faces today. We do not seek to dissect history and dig into past missteps.

We look to the future to see how it could be shaped to build a safer and more prosperous India.

The preparation of this report owes a lot to the wisdom of many respected and experienced

practitioners in the fields of governance, diplomacy, defence, internal security, intelligence, economics,

media, and social sciences. Without their support, this report would not have been possible. However,

the final copy is my work, and any shortfall rests on my shoulders.

#### INTRODUCTION


he framing of a National Security

Strategy must necessarily start

with an examination of India’s

# T

security objectives. At the heart of this are

the people of India and the character of the

Indian state. India is home to one-sixth of

the world's humanity, and its people aspire

for a prosperous and safe future in which

they can pursue their dreams without fear.

This requires the state to create a

conducive external and internal

environment in which India occupies its

due place in world affairs, is shielded from

global and regional risks, and lives in

peace.

India’s ancient history of cultural

assimilation, her harmonious diversity,

and our Constitution are strong guiding

factors for a vision of the course that India

must take. In achieving this vision, there

are significant challenges. We are still

home to more than 47 million people living

in extreme poverty; we rate below the

global average in gender equality, and our

income inequality is among the highest in

the world. Unless these trends are

reversed, we cannot achieve real security.


We are mindful of the uncertain geopolitical

environment in the world, threats of

transnational terrorism, and our troubled

neighbourhood. Globalisation is under

pressure, and restrictive trade practices buffet

the international landscape. The rise of

nationalism is constraining migration flows

and leading to policies of insulation and

protectionism. This could have a serious

impact on developing economies like India.

We live in an uneasy neighbourhood. To our

west and north, India has unsettled borders

that could be a flashpoint for future conflicts,

to our east there is a potential danger of

refugee influx, and to our south is the Indian

Ocean that is becoming an arena for strategic

rivalry. There are continuing internal conflicts

in parts of India that are increasingly playing

out in social media with the prospective

danger of dividing communities.

To ensure a secure and stable India that can

guarantee safety and prosperity to its people,

India's national security objectives could be

defined as:

- Protecting India’s national sovereignty.


-----

INTRODUCTION



- Securing the territorial integrity of India.

- Promoting India’s rise to its rightful place in

international affairs.

- Ensuring a peaceful internal environment

within India.

- Creating a climate for our citizens that is

just, equitable, prosperous, and shields

them from risks to life and livelihood.

Flowing from these objectives are the tenets of

our Security Strategy. These tenets lay down

our fundamental approach to achieving


holistic national security for India. These are,

**Assuming our Rightful Place in Global Affairs,**

**Achieving a Secure Neighbourhood, Peaceful**

**Resolution of Internal Conflicts, Protecting**

**our** **People,** **and** **Strengthening** **our**

**Capabilities.**

This National Security Strategy describes the

path towards achievement of the fundamentals

listed above. No strategy comes without risks

and uncertainties, but the start point must be a

clarity on the direction that we take.


-----

#### ASSUMING OUR RIGHTFUL PLACE IN
 GLOBAL AFFAIRS


###### A Strategic Global Scan
 Great Power Rivalry

he current global strategic landscape

is marked by a growing polarisation

among the major powers - China,

# T

Russia, and the United States (US). The primary

drivers of this polarisation are not ideological,

but political and economic in nature. Individual

major powers are attempting to assert their

national sovereignty by prioritising their

unilateral policies over commitment to

international cooperation. This strikes at the

very heart of the structure of international

relations created after the Second World War.

The US has imposed sanctions against Russia

for violating US laws against corrupt business

practices in 2012, over Russia’s annexation of

Crimea in 2014, and, more recently, allegations

of Russian involvement in cyber measures to

influence the outcome of the US Presidential

elections of 2016.

Russia has reciprocated with symbolic sanctions

against the US and the European Union (EU),


arguing that NATO’s eastward expansion is

contrary to the understanding that Russia had

reached with the West for the reunification of

Germany and the end of the Cold War in 1989.

Russia’s “Greater Eurasia” initiative of June 2016

seeks to reconstruct some of the former Soviet

Union’s inter-linkages through the creation of a

Eurasian Economic Union bringing together

Russia, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, and

Belarus.

As China grows more powerful, its relationship

with the US is becoming more tense. The US is

in a trade war with China to lower tariffs on US

exports and on alleged violations of US

intellectual property rights. At the regional

level, the US has unveiled an “Indo-Pacific”

strategy spearheaded by its Indo-Pacific

Command (earlier Pacific Command) based in

Hawaii. The objective of this strategy is to

contain China in East and Southeast Asia.

On its part, China has launched an ambitious

"Belt and Road Initiative" (BRI). The BRI seeks

to enhance China's dominance in economic

relations with a vast number of countries,


-----

including many considered to be in the

traditional spheres of influence of the US, EU,

and Russia. While Russia and China have

expanded their bilateral relations, the two

powers are still wary of each other in strategic

areas such as Central Asia and the Far East,

where their interests compete.

One result of great power rivalry has been the

weakening of the moral framework for fighting

global terrorism, with geopolitics and national

interests becoming the dominant factor. The

US entry into Iraq in 2003 led to a complete

destabilisation of the Middle East and the

creation of the Islamic State. The US-Russia

competition in Syria has little to do with

fighting terrorism but more to assert

themselves in the region. In the process, they

have directly and indirectly aided various terror

groups. The Saudi Arabia intervention in Yemen

is a manifestation of the larger Shia-Sunni

conflict. Apart from the horrific humanitarian

cost, one consequence of this conflict has been

the strengthening of the al Qaeda in Yemen.

###### Retreat of Multilateralism 

In terms of international peace and security, the

most significant impact of this polarisation

among the major powers has been on the

effectiveness of the United Nations Security


Council (UNSC). The permanent membership of

the five powers of the UNSC was justified in

1945 by their assertion of a special privilege for

policing the world. The breakdown of

international peace and security, with over 68.5

million people displaced by violent conflict

around the globe, illustrates the ineffectiveness

of the UNSC vividly. This has implications for

international cooperation beyond peace and

security, both for upholding fundamental

human rights and freedoms, as well as for

achieving sustainable development.

The rise of nationalism in politics is being

witnessed across the world and is reflected in

election results in diverse countries. These

include major powers such as the US, Russia,

France, and China. The nationalist sentiment is

geared to prevent a perceived erosion of

national identity and is strongest in

homogenous societies. However, nationalism

in pluralistic societies has also become an

important political factor, which often uses

economic issues for political purposes. There is

an inherent confrontation between the policy

of insulation and protectionism, spearheaded

by nationalism, and the policy of integration

and expansion, represented by globalisation.

Rising inequalities in income levels, which is

related to the way policies of globalisation have


-----

been implemented, have fed into nationalist

sentiment, creating policies that seek to target

the competitive advantage of trading nations

through political rather than economic

measures. The “tariff wars” initiated by the US

Administration under President Trump, and the

response to these by the affected countries,

illustrates this phenomenon.

In this context, a major issue that has been

debated at the multilateral level in the United

Nations is the impact of migration on both

nationalism and globalisation. In December

2018, the United Nations adopted a non-binding

Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular

Migration at a special meeting in Marrakesh,

Morocco. This inter-governmental agreement is

aimed at "fostering greater international

cooperation to better address the complex

situation facing the world's 258 million migrants

— 3.4 percent of its population". At the same

time, the agreement reaffirmed the "States'

sovereign rights to determine their national

migration policies and to govern migration

within their jurisdictions."

###### The Middle East and North Africa

The current situation in the Middle East and

North Africa (MENA) has its origins in the “Arab

Spring” movement of 2011. Seen widely as an


attempt to empower ordinary citizens of Arab

states from Tunisia to Libya, Egypt and Syria,

the movement fractured within a short period.

In broad terms, the attempt to empower

ordinary citizens in the MENA through street

demonstrations has resulted in unexpected

volatility across the region, with varying

outcomes.

Festering sectarian confrontation between the

Sunni and Shia groups in the Middle East, which

emerged from the devastation of the Iraq War,

has spread into Syria and the Gulf. The

dominance of the Shias in Iraqi politics is linked

with the rise of violent extremism and terrorism

among Iraq’s Sunni population. Saudi Arabia

has mobilised military action against alleged

Shia militancy of the Houthi tribes in Yemen,

accusing Iran of supporting them. Israel has re
energised its campaign against Iran as the

instigator of instability in the region and called

for economic and military action against Iran

for alleged nuclear weapons proliferation. The

activities of pro-Assad groups in Syria, and

Hezbollah in Lebanon are perceived by Israel as

proxies of Iran, acting in coordination with

Hamas in Palestine.

Volatility in the Middle East will be impacted by

the approach of the major powers and

countries like Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and


-----

India towards Iran. The division between the US

and its European allies on implementing the

Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to deal with

concerns on Iran’s nuclear weapons ambitions

will be tested on the ground by the effectiveness

of US unilateral sanctions on Iran, especially in

the financial services sector. Iran’s geographic

location in terms of hosting alternative North
South connectivity links to existing maritime

links between Asia and Europe and the

dependence of Japan, India, and China on Iran's

energy exports will play a significant role in the

response to calls to isolate Iran.

The role and influence of external powers like

the US, Russia, and China in the current

situation in the Middle East is determined by

their individual domestic interests. The US

appears to have recalibrated its support for

democracy in the Middle East and is now guided

by the alignment of US economic interests in

the oil sector and its strategic defence

cooperation with the Middle East powers like

Israel, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates

(UAE), and Kuwait.

Following the deployment of its military assets

in Syria in support of the government of

President Assad, Russia has used the crisis in

Syria to re-establish its credentials as a power
broker in the region. This proactive engagement


in Syria has enabled Russia to establish an

ongoing dialogue with other major Middle

Eastern powers, including Saudi Arabia and

Turkey, which impacts on Russian foreign policy

interests in Iran and Afghanistan.

China activated its foreign policy interests in

the Middle East by casting its veto with Russia

in the UNSC on the Syrian issue from October

2011 onwards. So far, China has cast four vetoes

on the Syria issue, which is remarkable for a

regime that has used its veto privilege sparingly

in the United Nations. However, since 2015,

China has opted to abstain rather than align

with Russia, which is indicative of both a

reappraisal by new Chinese leadership under

President Xi Jinping of China’s position, as well

as positioning China as a bridge in a revived

Cold War confrontation between the US and

Russia. With more than 45% of its oil imports

being sourced from the Middle East, China has

sought to insulate its energy interests through

this nuanced position.

###### Navigating the Global Space

 A Global Role

India has benefited from international

cooperation in transforming herself since her

independence in August 1947. The linkage


-----

ASSUMING OUR RIGHTFUL PLACE IN GLOBAL AFFAIRS


between security and development, including

upholding human rights and freedoms, is

intrinsic to India’s experience. Many of India’s

major security partners have responded to this

experience, recognising India’s credentials as a

reliable international partner.

Today, when nationalist and protectionist

sentiments threaten international

cooperation in many countries across the

world, India must become a leading player

supporting the benefits of international

cooperation. This can be achieved through

proactive diplomacy to create partnerships,

both regionally and globally, to give shape to

many other countries that share India’s

aspirations.

Two areas which India should prioritise in

expanding her diplomatic influence and

establishing her place among the leading

powers of the 21st century are:

- Creating an equitable and inclusive digital

world, where advances of technology are

secured to sustain development. This

requires India to lead the adoption of a

people-centric digital society, building on

her own national experience of Digital

India.



- Providing an intellectual dimension to

international cooperation, which will enable

an inclusive and forward-looking vision to

the way in which the world will evolve during

the 21st century. India’s core civilisational

values (Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam) will play a

significant part in catalysing such a role for

India.

As a country with growing geopolitical and

economic influence, India must also ensure

that she has a place in all decision-making

structures of international relations. This

includes the UNSC whose decisions have a

direct impact on India’s core national interests.

India’s case in attempting to list Masood Azhar

in the sanctions list of the UNSC Resolution

1267 against al Qaida/Taliban is well known.

Unless India is permanently represented in the

Council as an equal member, its national

security interests will not be adequately

addressed.

###### Bilateral Engagements

India must engage with other nations

confidently in a multi-polar framework, based

primarily on her own national interests. The

forging of partnerships and alliances must be

based on a clear understanding of geopolitical


-----

ASSUMING OUR RIGHTFUL PLACE IN GLOBAL AFFAIRS


realities and the fact that the rules-based

international order is under pressure.

Relations with the US must be nurtured on our

shared commitment to democratic values and

mutual respect. Our divergent definitions of the

Indo-Pacific strategic framework should be

harmonised as a priority. Trade and investment

relations should be placed on a predictable and

secure basis, underwritten by internationally

agreed trade laws. The links between ordinary

people of India and the US, including the large

Indian diaspora, must be strengthened so that

they can help both countries connect more

closely with each other.

Relations with Russia must be pursued on their

own merit to sustain the privileged and

strategic partnership between the two

countries. Russia’s existing participation in

India’s manufacturing, energy and defence

production sectors should be expanded, as

must India’s participation in Russia’s economic

activities, including in Russia’s Far East and the

Indo-Pacific. Priority must be given to

expanding people-to-people interaction,

including in the media, cultural, scientific and

technological areas.

Relations with China must be calibrated with

care, based on the principle of reciprocity. The


border dispute must be resolved through

political will, based on technical discussions

that have taken place between the two

countries so far. India must seek greater

participation in China’s services economy and

negotiate the early removal of non-tariff

barriers to exports of Indian products.

Relations with other major powers like France,

the United Kingdom and Germany must be

developed on the principle of equality. With

these European powers, India would need to

activate a diplomatic initiative to meet the

post-Brexit situation in Europe, in order to

safeguard her political, economic and consular

interests.

The focus on an India-Middle East narrative

must be anchored on our shared strategic

interests in energy, trade, culture and security

in the western Indo-Pacific region. India should

consolidate her profile with major Middle

Eastern powers like Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia,

Iran, and UAE while maintaining a strategic

dialogue with individual countries in the region.

In addressing issues connected with countering

violent extremism, India’s dialogue with her

Middle Eastern partners should focus on

preventing any attempt to include India in

sectarian issues, especially the Shia-Sunni

divide.


-----

ASSUMING OUR RIGHTFUL PLACE IN GLOBAL AFFAIRS


Pakistan blocks India's land movement

towards the west. India must find an alternative

to bypass Pakistan, and in this Iran will play a

key role. It is a strategically located country

that provides warm water ports for the Central

Asian states, westward access to the Indian

trade, and entry into Afghanistan via the

Chabahar Port. India's engagement with Iran

may bring up some differences with the US, but

our strategic interests must be clearly

explained.


Relations with Japan, South Korea, and

Australia should focus both on synergising

investments and technology, as well as

enhancing security cooperation. Relations with

emerging powers in Africa and Latin America

should be strengthened with new dialogue

platforms for strategic discussions on peace,

security, and development.


-----

#### ACHIEVING A SECURE
 NEIGHBOURHOOD


###### A Troubled Neighbourhood

outh Asia remains one of the most

troubled regions of the world. Violent

conflict rages on in Afghanistan, with the

## S

UN Mission recording 3804 civilian deaths in 2018,

the highest count since 2009. The withdrawal of

US forces from Afghanistan could result in an

upsurge in fighting and increased refugee inflows

into neighbouring countries. Regional powers will

jockey for influence in Afghanistan, increasing

instability.

Pakistan's hostility towards India remains

unabated. Despite its problem of severe political

and economic weakness, Pakistan continues to

sponsor terrorism as a state policy. Growing

Indian impatience and a strong response to terror

incidents have the potential for escalating to a

war-like situation.

The rise of China and its growing assertiveness

poses the most significant long-term challenge to

India. An unsettled border provides China the

opportunity for selective provocation at a time of

their choosing. The Himalayan barrier, which


separated South Asia from China, has been

flattened by massive infrastructure development

along our northern borders. Road links from the

north have also been extended into Pakistan,

Nepal, and Myanmar.

China has not been a traditional naval power but

is now increasing its presence in the Indian

Ocean, across which flow not only Chinese oil but

also raw materials sourced from Sub-Saharan

Africa. It is developing the Gwadar port in

Pakistan, has taken over the operation of

Hambantota port in Sri Lanka and

operationalised the gas and oil pipelines from

Myanmar’s Kyaukpyu port to Kunming. Using its

economic strength, China is today the largest

trading partner of Pakistan, Sri Lanka,

Bangladesh and Myanmar.

However, we must also not underestimate our

opportunities. India’s economic growth can be a

driver for greater prosperity in South Asia and

lead to enhanced regional cooperation. Chinese

influence in Southeast Asia is coming under

some strain due to maritime disputes and ethnic

tensions. Military expenditures in ASEAN remain


-----

consistently high, in part due to China’s growing

power. Wary of falling in China’s debt trap, many

countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Nepal,

Bangladesh, and even Pakistan have pulled out

of major development projects with China. Many

of these countries look towards India as a

balance to China.

###### Ensuring Regional Security

 Engaging China

Future strategic rivalry between China and India is a

certainty, and a successful trading partnership

cannot overcome the reality of this competition.

The manner in which our relationship is handled will

define the geopolitics of not only South Asia but also

of the larger continent of Asia. In suggesting our

future approach, we neither ignore China’s

comprehensive national power and its great power

ambitions, nor India’s potential strength.

India desires a peaceful relationship with China.

However, India’s core interests cannot be

compromised, and these interests are the integrity

of our borders, our stance on terrorism and our

sensitivities in the South Asian and Indian Ocean

regions.

The ongoing border talks are achieving no

major breakthroughs and focus of negotiations


must shift to accurately defining the Line of

Actual Control (LAC). This too is a complicated

task but if successful, will go a long way in

preventing the occurrence of flashpoints like

Depsang, Chumar, and Dokalam. Meanwhile,

India must be prepared to strongly contest any

incursion of our perception of the LAC that

breaches the norms laid down in the _Border_

_Defence Cooperation Agreement between our_

two countries.

Over the last ten years, PLA Navy flotillas in the

Indian Ocean have become more capable with

the deployments extending for longer

durations. Unlike the agreements governing

the handling of incidents along the LAC, no

formal mechanism is in place to discuss details

of how a situation at sea can be de-escalated,

and what rules of engagement must be laid

down for military commanders at sea.

Given the increasing dependence on maritime

trade, India and China have much at stake in

maintaining peace and harmony, both in the

Indian Ocean Region and the South China Sea.

There is, therefore, a need to facilitate regular

dialogue between the two navies wherein

sensitive issues could be discussed, leading to a

bilateral ‘Framework for an India China Naval

Engagement’ that is similar to the Border

Defence Cooperation Agreement.


-----

China’s stance on terrorism emanating from

Pakistan has not only been disappointing but

strikes at the heart of India’s national security.

This must be conveyed in clear terms in all our

dealings with the Chinese government. China’s

acceptance of this concern will strengthen

relations between the two countries.

India-China relations do not have to be viewed

only in terms of a long-term strategic rivalry.

There are many areas of cooperation. As

growing economies, the two countries share

comparable challenges, aspirations and

development goals. India is a growing market

for China with bilateral trade in 2017 being over

$84 Billion. A more balanced trade will be in the

interest of both countries.

India and China have similar views on free trade

and globalisation. Restrictive trade practices

and a retreat of developed economies from

globalisation could impact the economies of

both countries. Environmental concerns are

another common area. A 2016 Pew poll found

that 50 percent of the Chinese were willing to

trade growth for cleaner air. The same problem

plagues India. These are the growing demands

of the people that have to be met by the

respective governments. Growing cooperation

in the field of environment could be

subsequently expanded to include the issue of


sharing the water of rivers originating from

Tibet.

As confidence grows between the two

countries, some of China's security concerns

could also be assuaged. China is highly

sensitive to the flow of imports through the

Indian Ocean and is, therefore, pursuing

alternative road corridors through Pakistan and

Myanmar. At a future stage, India could offer

access to China through Indian ports, though

this will entirely depend on China's willingness

to show an understanding of our core interests.

###### Dealing with Pakistan

India-Pakistan relations are at a new low.

Pakistan’s attempts to bring India to the

negotiating table by destabilising Kashmir have

not only failed but also hardened India’s stance.

The events following the Pulwama bombing have

established new redlines in India’s response to

terror flowing from Pakistan. The international

support to India’s airstrikes at Balakot has also

reinforced our policy on cross-border operations.

However, there is also no doubt that military

actions carry the risk of escalation and this needs

to be factored into our future plans.

There is a need to have a sustained and long
term strategy to build consistent pressure on


-----

Pakistan to desist from supporting terror.

Diplomacy and economic isolation will play a

large part in this strategy. Pakistan’s role in

nurturing terrorism is increasingly being

condemned by nations around the world, and

combined with its economic woes, it can be

induced to crack down on terror organisations.

When required, India must also be prepared for

unilateral, limited military actions against

terror groups in Pakistan.

India must also not rule out dialogue with

Pakistan. However, talks with Pakistan must be

structured, and further progress must be based

on visible results. Confidence building

measures cannot be pursued if there is a daily

flare-up on the borders and infiltration

continues. India and Pakistan must also

seriously engage on nuclear issues. Nuclear

sabre rattling by Pakistan is a major hindrance

to stability in South Asia.

###### Afghanistan

India has major strategic interests in a peaceful

resolution of the Afghanistan conflict. However,

such a resolution is looking increasingly

unlikely. India has always supported an Afghan
led and Afghan-owned process of peace and

reconciliation, but both the US and Russia are

currently engaging in direct talks with the


Taliban. Despite this, India must not

compromise on its position and get drawn into

supporting the Taliban.

The US, Russia, Iran, and China have their own

strategic interests in dealing with the Taliban.

Our strategic interests do not lie in abandoning

the years of goodwill created with the Afghan

people and the government. This will require a

patient and well-thought-out approach and

greater proactivity than shown in the past.

###### Cooperation in the Neighbourhood

Our South Asian neighbourhood, with deep

historical, cultural and economic links, should

have been an area where India’s leadership and

growth resulted in the well-being of all the

people of this region. Our relations with our

neighbours, barring Pakistan, are strong but

often dependent on the political dispensation

in that country. This has enabled China to

increase its influence in the region.

Enduring relations will come about if mutual

interests can be better aligned. India must

make better use of its soft power, significantly

improve road and rail connectivity, and

increase regional trade. Easing the movement

of people for education, commerce and tourism

should not be viewed from the narrow prism of


-----

security but as a way of drawing the region

together. Common cause can be made of issues

like climate change that seriously affect all the

countries.

Due to India-Pakistan tensions, SAARC is slowly

losing its value. In its place, greater energy

should be devoted to groupings like the

Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal (BBIN)

initiative and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for

Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic

Cooperation (BIMSTEC). India’s Act East policy

and relations with ASEAN countries should be

strengthened. However, India will only be

considered seriously if it enhances its credibility

by visible actions. The India-Myanmar-Thailand

Trilateral Highway, conceived in 2002, will only

be completed by 2020. The Imphal-Mandalay

bus service, which had a trial run in 2015, has

not yet commenced. Along with improving

connectivity, institutional measures must be

put in place to ease the flow of goods and

services.

###### Indian Ocean Region

The primary objective of our maritime security

strategy is to deter conflict and coercion

against India. The Indian navy contributes to

shaping a positive maritime environment and is

formally mandated to be the net provider of


maritime security to the smaller states in the

Indian Ocean.

As India looks beyond its primary areas of

interest to the Western Pacific, and China

increases its maritime footprint into the Indian

Ocean, the growing rivalry between the Asian

giants could cause anxiety amongst the smaller

countries of the region. A start point should be

the enunciation of an Indian Ocean strategy to

help the littoral states perceive our point of

view.

We should move towards strengthening

maritime cooperation and security. Formal

mechanisms that could influence maritime

governance include the Indian Ocean Rim

Association (IORA), Indian Ocean Naval

Symposium (IONS), Western Pacific Naval

Symposium (WPNS) and the Djibouti Code of

Conduct. An effort must be made to expand

IORA’s membership to include all the littoral

countries. The IONS should be empowered by

giving it a permanent secretariat and should

attempt to strike a formal relationship with the

WPNS to knit an Indo-Pacific maritime

construct.

The Indian navy has considerable capacity for

Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief

(HADR). However, while we have the


-----

wherewithal, the means to coordinate

multinational HADR operations are absent.

Commissioning of an HADR coordination centre

with representation from other countries

would help in building confidence amongst

nations of the littoral.

With a continuous overlapping of the footprints

of international navies, it is also time that India

led an initiative to conclude a ‘Code for


Unalerted Encounters at Sea’ encompassing

the entire Indo-Pacific. It is customary for a

navy to mark its presence to an outsider to

assert jurisdiction, but a rush of adrenalin

during such unplanned encounters has the

propensity to spiral into nationalistic displays

and could lead to unpredictable situations.


-----

#### PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF
 INTERNAL CONFLICTS


nternal conflicts are a grave danger to

national security, imposing enormous

economic, political, human and social

# I

costs. India's struggle with insurgencies began

soon after independence, and it has had its

share of successes in dealing with these

movements, but challenges remain,

particularly in Jammu and Kashmir, the North

East and Left-Wing Extremism.

The threat from transnational terror groups like

the al Qaeda and the Islamic State may

currently be limited, but it cannot be ignored. In

September 2014, al Qaeda announced the

setting up of al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent

(AQIS). A month later, AQIS published the first

issue of its magazine Resurgence, which focused

on the plight of Muslims in South Asia and called

for Jihad. On 26 January 2015, The Islamic State

announced its expansion into Wilayat Khorasan.

They have released videos calling for avenging

the demolition of Babri Masjid and killing of

Muslims in various parts of India.

A peaceful resolution of internal conflicts will

significantly boost our security, enabling our


people to live in harmony and fully utilise the

benefits of India’s growth. It will also lessen

opportunities for inimical forces to exploit our

fault lines and impede our progress.

###### Jammu and Kashmir 

After almost three decades of conflict, Jammu

and Kashmir remains India’s biggest internal

security challenge. Violence has significantly

dipped from its peak in 2001 that saw over 4500

deaths in the state. However, from a low in

2012, there has been a steady increase in

violence levels in the past six years.

There are two key factors responsible for the

continuing strife in Jammu and Kashmir. The

first is the constant support of Pakistan to terror

activities in the state. From 2013 onwards,

Pakistan-based terror groups have intensified

their attacks on security forces camps and

convoys. Ceasefire violations by Pakistan have

jumped from 114 in 2012 to 2140 in 2018. These

ceasefire violations are a clear attempt by

Pakistan to vitiate the security environment

and assist the infiltration of terrorist groups.


-----

Following the Pulwama attack on the Central

Reserve Police Force convoy, and Indian

airstrikes on the Balakot terror camp, there was

a period of extreme tension between India and

Pakistan. While the crisis has currently been

defused, it is far from clear whether Pakistan will

scale down its support to Kashmir-specific terror

organisations.

The second factor fuelling the conflict is the

sense of anger and alienation among sections of

the population in Kashmir valley. This is

exacerbated by growing radicalisation, and the

separatists exploiting the narrative of the

Kashmiri identity being under threat. Street

protests have become common, and there is

regular interference by civilians in military

operations, leading to rising civilian casualties.

Another worrying trend is the rise in number of

local youths joining terror ranks. Local

recruitment has jumped from 16 in 2013 to

almost 200 in 2018. Poorly trained and

equipped, these local terrorists are no match for

the army, but their funerals attract thousands of

mourners and become a recruiting ground for

more youth to pick up the gun.

This conflict plays out daily on social media and

has resulted in a growing emotional divide that

leads to further alienation of the community.


This divide is also visible within the state,

particularly between the Jammu and Kashmir

regions.

There are also some positives. The Jammu

region has remained mostly free from resident

terrorists, and even the Muslim-majority areas

do not show support for terrorism. The army’s

posture along the Line of Control has ensured

that infiltration into the state from Pakistan

remains controlled, and the success of the

security forces in neutralisation of terrorist

leadership has ensured that the overall security

situation is within control. There are also many

people in Kashmir who believe that dialogue

should be the primary instrument for resolving

the problem.

###### Mainstreaming Measures

A search for solutions in Jammu and Kashmir is

complex as it has both a transnational (support

from Pakistan) and an internal dimension. Both

dimensions need to be tackled with equal

emphasis. An approach to our overall relations

with Pakistan has already been outlined, and in

this part, the focus is on the internal aspects of

Jammu and Kashmir.

The immediate focus should be on bringing

calm to the streets and reducing violence levels


-----

in Kashmir. It is only after this that further steps

can be taken for a long-term resolution to this

difficult problem. And calm will come only if we

deal with the people of Jammu and Kashmir

with empathy and understanding. Contentious

issues that could provide a trigger for more

disturbances should currently be kept on the

backburner, while attempts are made to arrive

at a political consensus on these subjects.

There must be a clearly defined political

objective that aims to mainstream Jammu and

Kashmir with the rest of India. This will set into

motion an "All of Government" approach that

synergises the actions of various central and

state agencies. This will also provide clear

guidelines for the security forces to formulate

their military strategy and define metrics for

realistically gauging success. This will bring in

the much-needed consistency in holistically

dealing with the problem.

Perceptions and a fear of the future are key

factors in triggering and sustaining conflict. The

government must have a well-crafted

information campaign that attempts to replace

uncertainty and fear with hope. This needs

transparent and visible actions by the

government and an outreach to the people, in

particular to the youth. A well-thought-out

surrender and rehabilitation policy could be an


effective step in reversing the growing trend of

locals joining terror ranks.

Healing must begin from within the state. An

intra-state dialogue among the people of

Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh is essential to

bridge their differences. The civil society must be

encouraged to take the lead in this initiative. The

vexing problem of the displaced Kashmiri Pandit

community must be squarely faced to find an

honourable solution. As long as any part of the

population feels ignored or discriminated, it will

be difficult to find appropriate answers.

Killing terrorists is an integral part of military

operations to ensure that the state does not

descend into chaos. However, this is not the

primary measure of success or conflict
resolution. Serious efforts are required for

countering radicalisation. There is a need to

initiate structured programmes that bring

together civil society members, family groups,

educationists, religious teachers and even

surrendered terrorists in an effort to roll back

radicalisation.

It is the responsibility of the state to maintain

law and order and act against those who resort

to violence. The security forces have displayed

tremendous professionalism and restraint in

carrying out their task. However, they are also


-----

paying a heavy price in deaths and injuries.

They need better protective equipment, bullet
proof vehicles, counter-IED technology,

surveillance and early-warning devices, and

strong garrison security. These provisions must

be made on priority.

###### The North East

The North East region has 8% of India’s area

and 4% of its population. Its diversity is

reflected in the 475 ethnic groups that inhabit

this area. The North East is connected to the

India heartland only by a narrow 22 km Siliguri

Corridor while sharing borders with five

neighbouring countries. Each state has its own

unique set of issues, but a common thread that

runs through the region is a lack of

development, a feeling of segregation from the

rest of the country and a sense of alienation.

This has led to a rise of ethnic identities that

are often in conflict with each other and

demand greater self-governance.

Sustained counterinsurgency operations have

resulted in most insurgent groups having

shunned violence or entering into ceasefire

agreements with the government. However,

this has not led to complete peace returning to

the region. Groups like the NSCN (IM) retain

their armed cadre and run a parallel


government in Nagaland while other

surrendered groups continue to engage in

extortion. The Meitei insurgent groups have

their armed wings located in Myanmar, and

weak border management permits them to

move into and out of Manipur with relative

ease.

###### Integrating the North East

A resolution to the issues in the North East lies

in greater development, integration and in

understanding the ethnic sensitivities of the

region. Our first attention must go to the

vulnerability of the Siliguri Corridor. Free

movement from Nepal and Bhutan and

infiltration from Bangladesh could be

exploited to stir up trouble. A resolution of

the Gorkhaland problem would also enhance

the security of the Siliguri Corridor. The issue

of Gorkhaland needs to be viewed from a

national security perspective and not narrow

political advantages.

Major initiatives should be undertaken to

address the weakness in infrastructure

development in terms of road, rail, air, and

water transportation systems. There is also a

need to create better facilities in the fields of

education, health care, and sports. Success in


-----

India's Act East policy will also usher in higher

economic activity in the region.

The resolution of the Naga insurgency would

have a positive effect on the entire region.

However, this problem cannot be addressed

by solely talking to groups based in Nagaland.

Any agreement will also have an impact on

neighbouring states, particularly Manipur. It

is essential that Manipur be fully integrated

into finding solutions to bring a resolution to

the Naga problem.

Illegal immigration is an emotive issue

throughout the region and needs to be

tackled with wisdom and maturity. Issues

related to people who are finally excluded

from the National Register of Citizens will

have to be well thought-out because a large

excluded population could be vulnerable to

exploitation and become a security risk. The

hasty introduction of legislation like the

Citizenship Amendment Bill, without prior

political consensus, could reignite identity

fears and lead to violence.

###### Left Wing Extremism (LWE)

A former Prime Minister once described LWE as

the "greatest internal security threat to our

country." The situation has since improved


considerably, and today there are 106 LWE

affected districts in 10 states with 35 most

affected LWE districts in 7 states. This success

can be attributed to the holistic approach of the

Anti-Naxalite Division of the Ministry of Home

Affairs that focuses on inter-state coordination,

development schemes, and in addressing

grievances of affected communities such as

protection of forest rights and providing

livelihood opportunities for youth.

Notwithstanding the improvement in the

situation, the Maoists remain a potent threat.

Their intelligence system is effective, as is the

network of over-ground activist ‘fellow
travellers’. They show thoroughness in attack

and ambush planning, have carried out deadly

IED attacks, and are ruthless with police

informers and all those who oppose them. Using

couriers and cut-outs to avoid compromising

communications, their security systems are

strictly enforced. ‘Tax’ collection from

‘compradors’ engaged in mining, road

construction, tendu leaf purchase etc in areas

under their influence provides annual funds that

are estimated to be over Rs 1000 crores.

###### Tackling LWE

A strategy to deal with LWE must address the root

causes of the problem. The deprivation of the


-----

Adivasi tribes, and their exploitation and

displacement due to large-scale mining feeds

discontentment. Development schemes have not

been able to adequately rehabilitate the tribals

since they lack the necessary skills and education.

Tribal youth often feel left out of the conspicuous

wealth creation generated by mining, or even in

government employment. They form the bulk of

the Maoist foot soldiers and field commanders.

The government must address the aspirations of

the tribal communities by bringing in

development while respecting their traditional

rights and practices. This will require visible

improvement in governance, a transparent

justice system, and suitable land reforms.

A serious attempt must be made to adopt a

unified approach. The architecture of the Maoists

cuts across state boundaries and is bound by a

common political philosophy and unitary

strategy, driven by ideologically committed

leaders. On the other hand, differing political

perceptions is a hindrance to the adoption of an

collective approach. The challenge will be to

evolve a political and legal framework that

enables the adoption of a unified strategy cutting

across all affected states.

The security forces are doing an outstanding

job but need to be strengthened in three crucial

areas:



- **INTELLIGENCE.** This is the backbone of

effective counter-Maoist operations. Efforts

of central agencies, state, and Central Armed

Police Force’s (CAPF) intelligence units need

to be coordinated to be able to build up a

credible picture. State police can play a

crucial role in getting early warning of Maoist

attacks.

- **JOINT OPERATIONS.** CAPFs have more

firepower, training, and superior

logistics/discipline, while state forces have

better local networks. Innovative solutions

need to be adopted to achieve better synergy.

Adivasi youth are at home in jungle terrain

and can be recruited as scouts. This will give

better situational awareness while

conducting operations.

- **TRAINING.** Before deploying, all personnel

must meet defined benchmarks in basic skills

such as marksmanship, physical fitness,

tactical drills, counter-IED precautions, first

aid, orientation to Maoist tactics and

terrain/local culture familiarisation. Equally

important, small unit cohesion and

leadership skills need to be built up.

###### Transnational Terrorism

The success of both al Qaeda and the Islamic

State in recruitment or carrying out attacks in


-----

India has as yet remained limited. This can be

credited to the vast majority of the Indian

Muslim population that finds little resonance

with the harsh ideology of these two groups.

However, while analysing any threat, it is

essential to look at both the intent and the

capability. Even if the current capability is

small, but the intent is strong, the latter will

drive the development of the means to achieve

the aim.

For transnational terror groups, the battlefield

is virtual, and the objective is the individual

mind. Perceptions, attitudes, and grievances,

real or imaginary, are vital weapons. The

Islamic State, in particular, runs a very

sophisticated perception campaign. This

campaign might appear abhorrent to most of

us, but it has been very successful in attracting

a section of Muslims from all around the world

to their cause. Limited recruitment has also

taken place in India.

###### Combating Terrorism

Tackling transnational terrorism requires a

review of our structures and practices. The

investigation into a terror group involves

cooperation with foreign agencies,

understanding and choking of financial

networks, probing into the darkest spaces of


cyberspace, and finally the physical ability to

neutralise the target. This can only be

accomplished by setting up inter-agency task

forces designed to deal with specific threats.

Such task forces should be formed for al

Qaeda, Islamic State, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and

Jaish-e-Mohammed. In addition to

government functionaries, the task forces

must comprise experts as required in the field

of language and cyber skills.

Strategic communications and effective

narratives must form an essential part of our

strategy. There is a need to set up an

organisation that will focus on countering the

extremist narrative. This programme must

target all extremist content, irrespective of

religion and ideology. Focus should also be on

media/social media content that can fuel

radicalisation and promote divisiveness in

society. This must be accompanied by

structured counter-radicalisation and de
radicalisation programmes for affected youth.

Local police play an important role in

countering radicalisation and terrorism. The

beat cop is critical in gathering intelligence,

understanding the pulse of the locality and

identifying youth who are vulnerable to an

extremist narrative. Police must both be

modernised and trained for this role.


-----

#### PROTECTING OUR PEOPLE


he ultimate test of an effective

national security strategy lies in its

ability to protect the common

# T

woman and man. As India becomes

economically stronger, the benefits must flow

down to all our citizens in an equitable

manner. We must also enhance our abilities

to protect our people from impending risks.

Some of these risks are a global phenomenon,

e.g. climate change, cyber threats, and

technology disruptions, while some arise

from physical and social evolutions in India

driven by our demography, urbanisation, and

perceived inequalities. Some of these risks do

not appear to pose a short-term threat and

therefore tend to be ignored, but mitigation

measures to minimise their impact can also

not be applied in a short timeframe. These

risks, if not addressed, can create a large,

disaffected section of the population and

confront us with a more significant challenge

to our national security than external threats.

###### Economic Security

Any conversation about India’s national

security is incomplete without discussing

India’s economic security since this will


provide the financial engine to power the

resources needed to build a comprehensive

strategy on national security. The strategy for

economic security must protect the drivers of

economic growth and reduce the

vulnerabilities to India’s economic progress.

**MONETARY POLICY. It is critical to maintain**

the independence of the Reserve Bank of

India and its Board, and to judge the success

of the Monetary Policy not on rhetoric but by

balancing the following metrics:

- Low inflation.

- A level of interest rates that provides

economic stimulus without overheating

the economy with too much easy money.

- Adequate liquidity to ensure the stability

of the banking system.

- Economic growth to maximise

employment growth.

**FISCAL POLICY. The role of the Fiscal Policy**

in providing economic security will require

the following:


-----

PROTECTING OUR PEOPLE



- Progressive taxation and programs to

promote social equality and provide

economic incentives at every income level.

- Infrastructure investments to maximise

economic growth and remove bottlenecks

to growth.

- Social and educational training programs

to promote economic mobility for the

economically challenged.

- Managing national debt levels to maintain

global confidence in India’s ability to repay

its debt and interest.

**REDUCING VULNERABILITIES.** Building a

strong base for Economic Security will also

require defensive actions to reduce the

vulnerabilities to India’s economic engine. The

key vulnerabilities and the actions to be taken

are:

- Prevent devaluation of the Indian Rupee by

maintaining low inflation through a rigorous

monetary policy and a coordinated fiscal

policy. Incentives must be provided to boost

exports and reduce imports dependence,

especially in oil and technology.

- Focus foreign policy to strengthen bilateral

relations with the specific objective of

lowering the impact of tariffs on Indian


goods and accelerating corporate

investments in India.

- Build a national ‘Digital Security

Organisation’ with capabilities to defend

and protect our governmental agencies, our

citizens, our utility, electricity, banking,

telecommunication, computer, and internet

networks.

- Invest in offshore oil exploration as well as

renewable energy sources to reduce India’s

long-term dependence on oil exports and

move towards energy independence as a

nation.

###### Climate Change and Environment

In the Climate Risk Index for the period of 1997

to 2016, published by Germanwatch, India

ranks 12[th] in the world. Numerous reports have

pointed to Indian cities being among the most

polluted in the world. A United Nations

Environment Programme report of January

2019 has pointed out that air pollution can alter

long-term rainfall patterns in India, affecting

millions of farmers. Ground level ozone

pollution has reduced wheat and rice yields in

India by 20 to 30 percent even as the agriculture

sector has been the worst hit by rising

temperatures, losing 60 billion hours of labour


-----

due to heatwaves in 2017. The Indian Economic

Survey 2018 points out that climate change

might reduce farm incomes by up to 20 to 25

percent in the medium term. This would further

exacerbate the ongoing farm distress.

A Niti Aayog report has stated that 600 million

people are facing acute water shortage and 21

Indian cities are likely to run out of

groundwater by 2020. 70 percent of India’s

surface water is polluted and the highest

number of people without access to clean

drinking water live in India. Environmental

degradation comes with enormous costs in

healthcare, loss of livelihood and depressed

living standards, and could lead to social

disturbance and violence.

The problem is not limited only to India. All

countries in South Asia are at an equal or higher

risk than India. The next wave of immigration

into India will not be due to conflict or

economic opportunities but forced by climate

change.

In 2008, India adopted a National Action Plan on

Climate Change (NAPCC). However, the

implementation has been tardy and needs to be

accelerated. India needs to urgently put in

place transformative environment policies to

reduce air pollution, improve waste


management, check land degradation and

promote efficiency in water use. There is also a

greater scope for adopting modern technology

to reduce environmental degradation while

continuing with sustainable development. We

also need to build a strategic plan to meet the

drinking and agricultural water needs of India

for the next 25 years.

Climate change is responsible for extreme

weather events and increases the risk of natural

disasters. Despite this linkage, disaster

management, climate change planning, and

sectoral development are compartmentalised

as separate streams in national policy-making

systems. As long as disaster relief and climate

change adaptation remain in different policy

domains, achieving systematic, risk-informed

sectoral development planning will remain

elusive. There is a need to establish a structure

of shared responsibility and decision-making

that allows for sustained and effective

coordination and consensus building between

ministries and other stakeholders.

Disaster management must also move beyond

a reactive approach that is focused on relief. We

must implement appropriate development

policies that can reduce the risks and costs of

disasters. These involve the adoption of

suitable regulatory and other legal measures,


-----

PROTECTING OUR PEOPLE


institutional reform, improved analytical and

methodological capabilities, education and

awareness. Risk reduction should be seen as a

comprehensive process that goes beyond

traditional responses to the impact of

individual national hazards. This process

should be multi-sectoral and interdisciplinary

in nature and include a wide range of

interrelated activities at the local, national,

regional and international levels.

###### Demographic Pressures

India is a country of young people, and its

demographic window of opportunity goes on till

2050. However, this opportunity will not

automatically translate into a dividend unless

there is sustained economic growth that is

equitable and creates opportunities for all. There

is much debate about data on job growth and the

annual requirement of jobs, but what is not in

doubt is that in India, unemployment is a major

concern, gender inequality in employment is

high, and vulnerable employment, without a

social safety net, is pervasive. These issues need

to be tackled with urgency.

Lack of opportunities in the rural areas will

drive a migration of youth to urban centres.

India's urban population could rise from 33

percent to 50 percent in the next 25 years. This


will require major investments in smart cities,

infrastructure, civic facilities, and job

opportunities. If youth migrating to cities do

not find adequate opportunities, they could

quickly turn to crime.

We also have to seriously focus on inequality. In

India, the wealthiest 1 percent own more than

50 percent of total wealth. In this age of

information and understanding, the rich-poor

gap has to be addressed so that it does not

cause social disharmony. This will require

changes in our education systems to ensure

that skills being taught are aligned with market

needs, providing health care for the poor,

improving agriculture policies, ensuring gender

equality, and equitable distribution of the gains

of India’s economic growth.

###### Technology Disruption

The world is in the midst of the 4[th] Industrial

Revolution that is characterised by technology

breakthroughs occurring with unprecedented

pace. There is a blurring of the digital, biological

and physical space with rapid advances in

Artificial Intelligence (AI), advanced robotics,

Internet of Things, quantum computing,

nanotechnology, 3D printing, autonomous

vehicles, and biotechnology. There are definite

advantages to these technologies, but they are


-----

also disrupting traditional patterns of

employment, governance and social relations.

The most immediate impact of technology

disruption could be on jobs, putting pressure on

an already stressed area. The manufacturing

sector will be hit as automation replaces

humans, and the service sector will see the

intrusion of AI. It is often said that technology

also creates jobs and that India has a talent

surplus in the information technology field.

However, this talent is not currently aligned to

requirements of cutting-edge technology, and

our education and skilling systems are

inadequately structured.

Technology disruption also runs the risk of

increasing inequality. People without digital

access are in the danger of being entirely left out

of the benefits of emerging technologies.

Despite the impressive growth in internet

penetration, there is still a deep digital divide in

India. According to a 2017 global survey by the

Pew Research Centre, only one in four Indian

adults uses the Internet or owns a smartphone.

Advances in biotechnology, gene editing,

longevity, and performance enhancing drugs

have enormous benefits for people and could

significantly impact the quality of health care.

However, in the short term, such technologies


are likely to be available only to the wealthier

sections of the population, and this could further

add to a sense of marginalisation and inequality

among segments of the population.

It is not difficult to predict the type of skills that

would be required in the future workplace. We

need to start aligning our education to focus on

the kind of workers that are required for

tomorrow’s jobs. The industry must start a

programme for reskilling its current workforce to

adopt new technologies smoothly. Most

importantly, the government must put in place

policies that minimise the risks of technology

disruption and ensure that large sections of the

people are not left out of the benefits that would

accrue from technology breakthroughs.

###### Cyber Threats

Today, the cyberspace has become central to

all facets of modern human existence. That this

domain has great potential for good and an

equal potential for immense destruction is now

evident. As ‘Digital India’ grows, future

vulnerabilities will only increase. A 2017 study

conducted by Symantec found that India

ranked fourth in online security breaches,

accounting for over 5% of global threat

detections.


-----

Cyber threats can manifest in many ways and

affect millions of people through cybercrimes,

cyber theft, data theft, and cyber intrusions

There is an even greater danger if hostile powers

target our critical infrastructure like

communication links, transportation, energy

and financial institutions, literally bringing the

country to a halt. Dealing with this threat will

require robust countermeasures, not only by the

government but also by private companies. It is

a reality that cyber defence has a cost and that

many companies do not make the appropriate

investment. Companies must be encouraged to

report cyber intrusions honestly, and in return,

the government should assist in providing them

the requisite tools for securing their networks.

Another major challenge lies in the use of social

media as a weaponised platform. Hostile and

inimical powers will seek to sow discord

amongst people, spread propaganda and

weaken faith in the government. This is a form of

warfare that does not require any use of force,

and due to its nature, can continue to be

pursued even during peace. This could cause

long term damage to society and undermine

trust in public institutions and democratic

processes.

The vulnerability of individuals to misinformation

is a result of our unprotected personal data that is


being used for creating targeted messages. The

Supreme Court has declared privacy as a

fundamental right, but as yet there are no privacy

laws governing the security of personal data.

Even data stored in India is not safe as the owners

of this data are the giant technology companies,

mostly based in the US and not under our legal

control. In September 2017, it was reported that

Google has quietly stopped challenging most

search warrants from US judges in which the data

requested is stored on overseas servers.

There has been much debate on data localisation

in India. The dangers to our social fabric in the

Information Age are absolutely clear, and it is well

known that our laws can only be enforced in our

territorial jurisdiction. These are the primary

drivers that automatically point us towards

adopting a data localisation policy. The

enormous economic potential that can accrue by

utilisation of this data gives an added impetus to

adopt such a policy.

###### Energy Security

In the 20th century, our primary concern was the

supply of energy, particularly the supply of oil.

This concern was addressed through self
sufficiency, access to sources, and development

of non-fossil alternatives such as nuclear power

and renewable energy.


-----

In the 21st century, the emphasis has shifted

from quantity to quality. Indian policies should

now focus on three simultaneous transitions,

i.e. the market transition, the low carbon

transition, and the energy access transition.

India’s journey through these three transitions

will decide the nature and direction of India’s

energy and economic policy trajectory in the

future.

The transition that is attracting the most global

attention is the low carbon transition, as it is

expected to transform a coal-dependent

country into one that is less so. While this

transition is important, what is equally

important is a transition that will increase

access to modern energy sources to millions of

our people who depend on traditional sources

of energy such as kerosene, firewood and dried

animal dung for lighting and heating.

This access transition could change the energy

landscape from one of relative energy scarcity to

one of energy abundance and improve the

economic and technical efficiency with which

energy is produced, delivered and used in India.

This will happen if there is a shift from a mostly

state-led energy sector to an increasingly

market-led sector. The government should be a

‘market facilitator,’ with a concept of

independent regulation that can deliver


efficiency and introduce fairness based on rules,

rights, and transparency.

###### Policy Recommendations/Initiatives 

- The Government or Government Public

Sector Undertaking’s (PSU) role in the last

mile should be minimised e.g. in the last

mile retailing and distribution of fuel, LPG,

natural gas, and electricity. Last mile

deregulation will lead to a possible

packaging of energy with other household

products, thus providing value-added

concepts to the consumers and industry.

- Carry out a separation of the infrastructure

and energy market. In India, the three main

functions of energy, i.e. energy production,

energy transportation, and energy

distribution are generally under the same

umbrella of a PSU. For effective development

of energy infrastructure, infrastructure

development market should be segregated

from energy producers/marketers, with a

regulated third-party open access concept to

ensure effective development and utilisation.

- Change in government regulation for coal
bearing land for increasing private

participation in the coal sector.

- The government should consider the

setting up of an independent industry


-----

regulator for the extraction of natural

resources. This will foster a holistic level

playing field for private participation,

ensure contract stability and speed up the

resolution of any conflicts.

- Today, natural gas is about 6% of India

primary energy basket compared to the

world average of 24%. With the government

target to increase the natural gas share to

15% by 2030, liberalisation of the gas

markets in India is essential. The move

towards a more diverse, flexible and liquid

global gas market has important

implications for investment and can bring

significant benefits for India's energy

security.



- Consider the development of strategic oil

storage in the country with foreign equity oil.

A dedicated Strategic Petroleum Reserve

(SPR) to be constructed from each oil

supplier or country from where oil is

imported in India, with a specific percentage

of total annual supply being stored in SPR.

- Promote strategic investment by

International companies in Indian mid
stream and downstream market.

Investments by large international energy

suppliers, along with the concept of

dedicated SPR, will go a long way in

mitigating supply risks.


-----

#### STRENGTHENING OUR CAPABILITIES


National Security Strategy would be

incomplete if it only defines our vision

and the path that we should follow,

# A

without the means to achieve our objectives.

We need to strengthen our capabilities to

protect our citizens and deter any adversary

from threatening India’s sovereignty or

interfering with our strategic interests. We must

take a realistic look at the weaknesses in our

current structures and also gaze into the future

to visualise emerging threats that will need to

be countered.

###### Securing our Land and Maritime Borders

India has a land border of approximately 15000

km and a coastline of over 7500 km (including

the island territories). The demarcated section

of our land border is classified as the

International Border (IB), while the disputed

part of the border with Pakistan is called the

Line of Control (LC), and with China is called the

Line of Actual Control (LAC). The Actual Ground

Position Line (AGPL) defines the position of our

troops in Siachen.


The IB and LC sector in Jammu and Kashmir is

highly active, with regular firing from both

sides, and Pakistan supported infiltration of

terrorists into India. The LAC is contested, with

Indian and Chinese patrols regularly facing off

over intrusions across a border that has not

even been delineated. On the LAC, the massive

infrastructure development in Tibet has given a

significant advantage to China in most areas.

Border management along the Myanmar

border remains poor, and this has permitted

easy movement of insurgent groups that are

mostly based in Myanmar.

The Group of Ministers (GoM), set up in 2000

after the Kargil Review Committee, had then

stated, “At present there are instances of more

than one force working on the same border and

questions of conflict in command and control

have been raised frequently. Multiplicity of

forces on the same border has also led to lack

of accountability on the part of the forces. To

enforce the accountability, the principle of ‘one

border one force’ may be adopted while

considering deployment of forces at the

border.”


-----

Unfortunately, this recommendation of the

GoM remains unimplemented for the LAC. The

Indo-Tibetan Border Police, (ITBP) is

technically responsible for this border,

although it is the army that primarily responds

to all border incidents and takes the lead in

holding meetings and discussions with Chinese

troops to resolve any dispute. Two forces

operating under different ministries along an

unsettled border is not a recipe for success. The

best resolution of this issue is to place the ITBP

under the command of the army.

The Myanmar border needs immediate focus. It

is the responsibility of the Assam Rifles, and

transferring this responsibility to another force

like the ITBP will not automatically solve the

weakness in border management. The problem

of the Myanmar border is the present lack of

infrastructure, and a comprehensive plan for

the development of roads, fencing and posts

along the border will enable the Assam Rifles to

carry out its mandate effectively.

The requirement of a ‘smart fence’ that

combines technology with a physical barrier is

essential to check infiltration and smuggling.

The Comprehensive Integrated Border

Management System (CIBMS) is planned to be

set up along the IB with Pakistan and

Bangladesh. This must also be extended to the


Indo-Myanmar border. The army's fence along

the LC suffers extensive damage each year due

to heavy snowfall. This should be replaced with

a more robust, smart and all-weather solution.

The lack of roads and other infrastructure along

the LAC and Indo-Myanmar border is a major

handicap in effective border management.

Despite the purported push to Indo-China

Border Roads, there has been no significant

change in the pace of road construction.

According to a written reply in the Lok Sabha,

the length of roads constructed along the LAC

in the last three years has been 95 km, 101 km,

and 103 km. Speeding up infrastructure

development will require a comprehensive plan

that includes restructuring and strengthening

of the Border Roads Organisation, dedicated

allotment of funds, the involvement of private

companies, and fast-tracking of land

acquisition and forest clearance cases.

After the 26/11 Mumbai attack, a number of

important steps for strengthening the coastal

security setup were initiated. Joint Operation

Centres have been set up, coastal patrolling has

been intensified, a chain of coastal radars has

enhanced surveillance, and coordination

between national and state agencies has

improved. However, many security concerns

remain.


-----

Currently, there are 15 agencies involved in

managing coastal security, and this leads to

jurisdiction and coordination problems. There

is a need to review existing coastal regulations

and the role of different agencies, in order to

streamline their functioning. The Coastal

Security Bill, proposing the setting up of

‘National Maritime Authority’, should be passed

by the Parliament. The coast guard has a key

role in security and should be strengthened.

There is also a need to significantly enhance the

security of ports and offshore assets/

installations.

###### Strengthening Military Capability

Military capability is a critical component of

national power. While India wants peace with

her neighbours, we also cannot be oblivious to

a revisionist and hostile Pakistan, the rising

military power of China, and our own internal

security challenges. We will only be assured of

peace if we can visibly demonstrate our

capability to defend our national interests

through the use of force.

Future conflicts will see an increased blurring

between the tactical, operational and strategic

levels of war. Our military preparedness will

have to cater for a range of response options


from surgical strikes to an all-out conflict.

Technology, information, cyber and space will

increasingly gain importance, as will the

requirement of smart and motivated soldiers to

fight in this complex environment.

Today, there are significant capability shortfalls in

the three services. Most of the army's equipment

is in the vintage category, and the induction of

modern weapon systems is extremely slow. The

air force is faced with a reducing fighter strength

and a lack of air-to-air refuelers, Airborne Early

Warning and Control platforms, and trainer

aircraft. The navy faces a capability gap in

conventional submarines, unmanned aerial

vehicles, mine countermeasures vessels, anti
submarine warfare, and naval utility helicopters.

Our current budgetary allocations for defence,

tardy procurement procedures, existing force

composition, and decision-making structures

pose a serious challenge to force modernisation.

The following measures need to be taken:

- **DECISION-MAKING** **STRUCTURES.** The

Ministry of Defence (MoD) should become a

fully integrated headquarter with the

posting of service officers in the ministry. A

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) should be

immediately appointed as the primary

advisor to the political leadership. Together,


-----

the integrated MoD and the CDS should

oversee and coordinate the force

modernisation plans of the military. The

focus should be on increasing

interoperability, enhancing jointness, and

optimising the resources between the three

services.

- **FORCE COMPOSITION.** The three services

should undertake a comprehensive review

of their current and future force structures to

transform the army, navy and air force into

an integrated warfighting force. The force

composition that emerges from this review

will form the basis for a capability

development plan over a mid to long-term

period. The review also must look at

improving our technology adoption and

fighting in the cyber and space domains.

- **BUDGETARY ALLOCATION. The current**

system of ad-hoc budgetary allocation must

be replaced by one where budgets are based

on a capability development plan that has

been approved by the government. This will

bring harmony in planning and

procurement.

- **PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES. The current**

Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) has

failed to simplify or speed up procurements.

Qualitative Requirements need to be

realistically framed, based on current


requirements and prevailing threats. There

is a need to guard against the impulse to

future-proof systems. Evaluation trials need

to be combined so that platforms under

development do not have to undergo

repeated and time-consuming trials. Repeat

orders should be placed for platforms and

equipment already in service, which have

been developed and built by the domestic

defence industrial base. Finally, authorities

responsible for the processing of cases must

be held accountable for any delays that

occur.

The men and women of our military are our

greatest asset, and their morale and motivation

are crucial factors in their outstanding

performance under the most challenging

conditions. Issues of status equation, a

plethora of court cases on pension matters, pay

and allowance anomalies and poor civil
military relations can slowly chip away at pride

and professionalism. These matters need to be

seriously addressed through visible action.

###### Indigenisation of Defence Production

India cannot be a strong military power unless

it develops a strong, indigenous defence

production capability. This will require the


-----

government to accept responsibility for

financially supporting the design and

development of indigenous defence platforms.

The MoD appears to have prioritised building

foreign equipment under technology transfer in

the Buy & Make (India) category, or the

Strategic Partner model. Both these mandate

the purchase of "proven and in-service"

equipment. This commits the military to buy

equipment that has already gone through its

development cycle, and its induction into

service and maturation phase, which means it

is already a decade away from being state-of
the-art.

The MoD must assume a leadership role in the

creation of a robust defence industrial base.

The government must pay the design and

development costs for complex defence

systems. For those companies that are willing

to fund the research and development (R&D)

costs, there must be incentives in the form of

access to capital at lower interest rates. We

need to recognise the benefits of creating and

trusting Indian solutions optimised for our

military and provide equal opportunities for

both the public and private sector.

The defence public sector undertakings (DPSU)

have acquired a bad name. However, we must

also be realistic enough not to ignore their


capabilities. Today, we do not have any

alternative to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited

when it comes to building an indigenous fighter

aircraft. The answer lies in improving the

practices and accountability of the DPSUs by

greater integration of service users in the

management structure and adopting successful

private industry practices.

In order to boost defence exports, we should

identify and target promising platforms for

export, promote their early induction into the

military, work with the external affairs and

economic ministries to develop lines of credit

for prospective buyers, ensure production lines

are built in sufficient numbers, and develop life

cycle support measures for platforms in service

in other countries. Only by ensuring a smooth

experience for countries that buy Indian

weaponry, can India become a weapons

exporter.

Indigenisation also requires a strong R&D base.

Currently, the country lags in cutting edge

technology and the adoption of Artificial

Intelligence, robotics, autonomous systems,

quantum technology, and hypersonic

weapons. The Defence R&D Organisation

(DRDO) needs to focus on these areas and move

out of peripheral technology by offloading

these to the industry. The DRDO must pursue


-----

avenues of joint R&D with countries like the US,

Russia, Israel, and France. There is a need to

harness and synergise efforts of the DRDO,

DPSU R&D centres, private sector R&D centres,

and academia. This will require a cultural

change in the way the DRDO is currently

operating, and this change will have to be

pushed by the government.

###### Transforming the Police 

The primary role of any nation state is to ensure

the safety of all its citizens. Today, state civil

police forces number over 1.5 million,

delivering policing services from 16,000 police

stations across the country. Armed police of the

centre and states are an additional 1.5 million

personnel. The government’s focus in the past

50 years has been on the expansion and

upgrading of CAPFs. The Modernisation of

Police Forces (MPF) scheme of the government

allocates 80% of its funds to central police

forces. Even as a percentage of the state

budgets, police budgets are declining across

India. This has adversely impacted on the

professional capacity of both the civil and

armed police component of the states.

The criminal justice system is in danger of being

overwhelmed. About 8 million cognisable

crimes are recorded annually. Over 30 million


cases choke Indian courts and appeals in

criminal cases take 20 years and more to be

heard. 6.5 lakh exhibits await examination in

state and regional forensics labs. The

conviction rate has dropped drastically. Even in

heinous offences like murder and rape, all-India

conviction rates hover around 20%.

Transforming the police will require a focus on

five main pillars, with particular attention to

engaging with the communities.

- **POLICING PRESENCE. A modern policing**

system requires an adequate presence on

the ground. The UN recommends 220 civil

policemen for every 100,000 population.

Most conflict-areas in India have less than

25% civilian police strength of this

benchmark. Sufficient police stations can

act as early warning systems and ensure

closer contact with communities to contain

the intensity and spread of violence. At the

same time, structures need to be developed

that can address policing challenges that

spill over local jurisdictions or require

specialist capabilities such as cyber or

complex white-collar crime.

- **TECHNOLOGY** **APPLICATION.** In

addition to obvious areas like forensics

support and less-lethal mob-control


-----

technology, there is a need to explore the

application of cutting-edge developments

in neuro and behavioural sciences, big data

analytics, modelling, and robotics.

- **CAPACITY BUILDING.** Skill-development

is the backbone for effective modernisation

and training needs to be scaled up.

Expenditure on training is currently only 1%

of the overall police budget. Use must be

made of digital platforms for distance in
service training, along with an evaluation of

whether current training design and

andragogic methods are imparting the

required skills. There is little cognitive

research on policing policies, processes

and outcomes. There is an urgent need to

identify multi-disciplinary institutions to

fund studies of existing structures, policies

and processes, and conduct evidence
based research into organisational

innovations and behavioural changes

needed for modern management practices.

- **MORALE & ACCOUNTABILITY. Morale**

and accountability are key to improved

human resource development. Better

working conditions and housing for lower

ranks are two crucial areas. The police

leadership needs to be insulated from

external pressures in the discharge of its

legal role. There is a critical need to restore


the principle that a police chief "is not the

servant of anyone, save of the law itself." At

the same time, all forces engaged in

counter-militancy operations need to be

clear that there are boundaries in the use of

force against our own citizens, and human

rights are not violated.

- **COMMUNITY** **SUPPORT.** Engaging

vulnerable communities/ethnic groups and

working with local leaders can prevent

minor incidents from escalating. There is an

acknowledged need for greater public

engagement, with the police required to be

seen more as a provider of services related

to the rule of law and public safety, not just

an instrument to enforce the state's

sovereign authority. We also need to

explore ways to restore the social

responsibility of village and traditional

communities for maintaining routine public

order and perhaps even to deal with petty

offences within a framework of

contemporary legal and ethical principles.

###### Intelligence

Intelligence is a very critical imperative in the

safeguarding of national security. Timely and

actionable intelligence can be a game-changer

in all theatres of operations and the conduct of

diplomacy. However, our intelligence structure


-----

is unable to perform to its potential due to

problems of inadequate resource allocation,

shortfalls in manpower and an over-reliance on

the Indian Police Service officers, many of

whom do not have adequate intelligence

training or experience. The over-centralisation

of decision making and micromanagement has

also led to some erosion of institutions.

The current intelligence architecture needs to

be restructured with clear-cut responsibility

and accountability. The contours of the

restructuring could be:

- Establish a career intelligence cadre with

qualifications of subject and regional

expertise, proven language capability, and

familiarity with local customs.

- Personnel with a tested acumen for

intelligence work should be drawn from the

broadest spectrum of society including civil

services, armed forces, technology experts,

and economists.

- The over-dependence on technical

intelligence and the inadequacies in human

intelligence should be corrected.

- Security of operations and safeguarding of

operational details must be given the

highest priority.



- We should make use of trusted institutions

in the private sector to widen and extend

intelligence-oriented reach for the

furtherance of national interest.

- There is an urgent need for a cross-party body

like a Parliament’s Standing Committee on

Intelligence, to regularly audit standards and

performance, and make recommendations

for improvement. Experience teaches us that

without independent oversight, reform does

not happen.

###### Cyber Warfare

The cyber threats to our critical infrastructure

and to our way of life are apparent. However,

we often tend to view cyber threats through a

technical prism rather than as another

dimension of warfare that threatens national

security. Combating this threat will require

formal structures, policies and an explicit

declaration of intent.

In order to secure the nation from cyber

attacks, particularly those emanating from

hostile countries, the following priority actions

need to be taken:

**DETERRING CYBER ATTACKS. Deterrence in**

cyberspace is a hugely complex issue as cyber


-----

warfare is characterised by an absence of

clarity. Tracing the source of the attack is not

easy, and we can neither be sure about the

exact capability of the adversary nor accurately

assess our chances of success if we launch a

cyber counterstrike. Notwithstanding these

limitations, we must have a clearly stated policy

that a malicious cyber attack is considered as a

hostile act against our national sovereignty and

that India will respond by using all national

resources at our disposal – cyber, military,

diplomatic and economic.

**CREATION OF CYBER COMMAND. If we**

clearly understand that cyber attacks conducted

by an external state threaten the national

security of India, we must also realise that this

threat cannot be countered by intelligence

agencies like the NTRO or by a Cyber Security

Coordinator. The defence services are

responsible for protecting India from external

threats and must become the lead agency for

responding to cyber attacks. India is one of the

few countries that still does not have a dedicated

cyber component in its military. The setting up of

a Defence Cyber Agency has been announced

but this must be upgraded to a Cyber Command.

The Cyber Command must have a clear mandate

to conduct full-spectrum cyberspace

operations.


**INDIGENOUS TECHNOLOGY FOR CRITICAL**

**INFRASTRUCTURE.** In India, we seem

oblivious to the vulnerabilities that exist in our

critical networks due to foreign hardware and

software. This needs to be quickly reversed. The

technological component of India’s digital

sovereignty has to be a gradually planned

adoption of software and hardware that is

designed and manufactured by Indian private

companies. The government should promote

and support Indian companies through funding

assistance and give them preference in the

purchase of equipment for critical

infrastructure. Indigenisation must take place in

the following areas:

- Operating systems and software.

- Microelectronics.

- Networking equipment.

- Cryptographic algorithms.

- Navigation systems.

###### Nuclear Forces

India has a ‘No First Use’ policy and a

commitment to the goal of a nuclear-weapon
free world. However, we are conscious that we

live in a region where two of our neighbours are

nuclear-armed states. Pakistan has a fast

-----

growing nuclear arsenal while Chinese nuclear

modernisation has significantly improved the

quality of its land and sea-based nuclear forces.

To ensure deterrence against nuclear threats,

India should continue to build up its triad of

land, air, and sea-based missiles, while

modernising its older land missile systems. The

nuclear command and control system should

be hardened against cyber attacks. India also

needs to gradually start building up a missile

defence system to protect major cities.

Capacity should be created for dealing with the

threat of Weapons of Mass Destruction by state

and non-state actors.

###### Space

Today, India is hugely dependent on space for

communications, commerce, navigation, and

intelligence. In this dependence, we are no

different from most countries around the

world. However, while space is considered one

of the global commons, there is no global

acceptance on the rules that should apply in

regulating behaviour in space. In the absence of

any rulebook, India must develop capabilities

to defend itself and develop deterrent

capabilities in case a conflict transcends to the

space dimension.


###### Strategic Communications

With the proliferation of media, and the social

media serving as a medium of enormous

amounts of fake news, it is imperative that the

government is able to convey the accurate

picture to its citizens. This is particularly

important during a crisis when an absence of

information or miscommunication could

trigger rumours that erode faith and trust in the

government.

There is a need for a structured crisis

management communication group that

comprises representatives from the Ministries

of Foreign Affairs, Home Affairs and Defence,

and the Prime Minister’s office. This group will

be tasked for all interaction with the media

during any national crisis.

A large number of media cells have sprung up in

various departments of the government. Often,

they operate in a competitive mode. These

organisations should be reviewed, and

integration carried out, where necessary. There

is also a need to enhance the credibility of

Doordarshan and All India Radio by granting

them complete autonomy and professionalising

their functioning.


-----

#### CONCLUSION


steadily rising democratic India

must ensure peace and prosperity

for its citizens and a prominent

# A

place for the country in international affairs.

We must look realistically at the global and

regional geopolitical environment, and

honestly assess both the challenges that

confront us, and the opportunities offered

by our growing national power. This

National Security Strategy provides the

direction that India should take to achieve

our national objectives.

This strategy recognises the centrality of our

people. We cannot achieve true security if

large sections of our population are faced

with discrimination, inequality, lack of


opportunities, and buffeted by the risks of

climate change, technology disruption, and

water and energy scarcity.

The National Security Strategy also

examines the current shortfalls in our

capability and suggests measure to

strengthen the essential elements of

national power. A weakness in capabilities

will leave us with an inability to convert our

vision into reality.

As we pursue or strategy, we could be faced

with unexpected challenges. However, as

long as the basic tenets are followed,

progress is assured.
