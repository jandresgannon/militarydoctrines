**DEFENSE DIRECTIVE 2019**

The Albanian Armed Forces (AAF) achieved tangible results in all areas during 2018, as part of
their constitutional mission and legal obligations. During 2018 the Armed Forces increased their
operational readiness level and considerably improved the training system.

Completion of the Albanian Defense Strategy Review (DSR) document and other several
documents in the field of legislation, increased transparency in human and financial resources
management, continuation of modernization process in infrastructure and equipment, have
responded and supported the activity of AAF structures at all levels.

The global, regional and national security environment continues to be under pressure from
continuing and unexpected changes, as a result of increased geopolitical rivalries, emergence of
increasingly aggressive countries adopting an unfriendly attitude to the West, its economic,
political integration policies, and security in different regions, including the Western Balkans,
accompanied by new threats and dangers. In adapting to this security environment, the Albanian
Armed Forces have successfully fulfilled their obligations by developing operational capabilities
and necessary defense capacity.

Tangible results have been achieved in the field of modernization. Implementation of the project
for the Integrated Airspace Surveillance System of the Republic of Albania, equipment of
"Iliria" class vessels with the modern armament system, implementation of repair and service
projects for the Integrated Sea Surveillance System, purchase of individual soldier gear,
equipment of individual NATO-standard armament, as well as equipment of Armored transport
vehicles (HMMWV) for Land Force structures have significantly contributed to the increase of
operability and interaction of AAF structures.

Participation of AAF troops in NATO-led missions increased significantly during 2018,
responding to changes in the security environment and the constant need to show the Alliance's
presence. Certification of the Light Infantry Battalion Group (LIBG), participation in "DSR"
operations in Afghanistan, "KFOR" in Kosovo, in the Aegean Sea, and continuation of
participation in enhanced Forward Presence – eFP”, and Very High Readiness Joint Force
(VJTF), are indicators for assuming responsibilities in the Alliance, precisely to strengthen this
presence. Also, there has successfully continued the fulfillment of obligations on EU missions to
EUTM Mali, and EUFOR "ALTHEA" to Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The engagement of the Armed Forces in coping with civil emergencies, support for the
community and other institutions have improved the image and credibility of the Armed Forces
institution, but at the same time have increased expectations toward them.

All of these processes and activities produce real and tangible values when properly oriented to
the personnel of the Armed Forces. Effective implementation and execution of the abovementioned processes, activities, and measures requires a comprehensive commitment and
engagement to make the Armed Forces a desirable place to build a military career. Our job is to

think and act accordingly, so as to recruit and retain dedicated citizens of our society as the rank
and file of the Armed Forces.

**MAIN DIRECTIONS FOR 2019**

Given the constitutional responsibilities, mission, legal obligations of AAF, as well as
obligations deriving from NATO, the main objective will be the realization and completion of
the level of ambition foreseen in the Military Strategy of the Republic of Albania. To this end,
through harmonization and synchronization of the defense planning with national planning and
the NATO Defense Planning process, work during 2019 will focus on these main directions:

1. Assessment of the security environment and adaptation to it;
2. Improvement of the legal framework;
3. Development and modernization of defense capabilities and infrastructure;
4. Staff motivation and increase of professionalism;
5. Continuation of engagements, active role, and credibility in the international arena;
6. Effectiveness in civil emergency management and assistance to community;
7. Increase of transparency from all structures of the Armed Forces.

Based on the main directions of work for 2019, the activity of MoD and AAF structures will
focus on:

**1.** **Assessment of the security environment and its adaptation.**

Risks and threats to the security environment in the Republic of Albania, also as a NATO
member country, in the short to medium term will significantly affect the development of the
respective AAF capabilities and the specter of their operations. This requires AAF and MoD
structures to identify, recognize and evaluate these threats and take measures to cope with them,
which will positively influence the management of the security situation in our country.

Accomplishment of the AAF constitutional mission in the best way possible, considering
changes in the security environment, nature and forms of risks and threats, will require that our
intelligence capabilities and capacity continue to support AAF leadership and command
authorities with information on these changes, as well as identification of timely warning for
risks and threats to AAF's security in permanent deployments, and deployment areas and
operations at home and abroad.

Climate changes have caused difficulties with accurate predictions, as well as increased the
devastating scale of natural phenomena. The threats posed by these climate changes require
MOD and AAF structures to adopt effective measures, and develop appropriate operational
capabilities in response to civil emergencies.

**2. Improvement of legal framework.**
Continue the support with necessary legal framework for the implementation of the military
status law, command and strategic leadership power and authority, and to improve the law on
promotion process and military career. Review of the Civil Emergency Law; drafting
subordinate legal acts for the functioning of the Institute of Geography and Military


-----

Infrastructure; establishment and operation of the Reserve Force elements; compiling draft acts
for the approval of international agreements. Priority will be given to compiling of draft acts for
the continuation of the handling and reduction process for properties out of AAF Settlement
Plan.

**3. Development and modernization of defense and infrastructure capacities.**

Modernization is an indispensable and continuous process that the relevant structures should be
guided with maturity and intelligence. This process aims at developing and providing the
necessary capacity to act independently or in co-operation with allies in military operations and
missions, as well as coping with civil emergencies.

Continue to implement the Capacity Objectives Package to develop combat capacity, combat
support and combat support services. Capacity Objectives are subject to a realistic assessment to
best harmonize NATO requirements and financial support in accordance with defense programs.

Also, continue investing in infrastructure improvements for living, education / training, support
operations and command and control of military structures in times of peace, crisis and war for
each AAF component.
The main priorities in the field of modernizing defense capacities and improving infrastructure
for 2019 will be:

 Continuation of the modernization of the structures within the Light Infantry Battalion

Group of (LIBG), aiming at further consolidating the operational capabilities of the
LIBG, declared units and subunits to the "enhanced NATO Response Force" (eNRF), the
Special Operations Land Task Group (SOLTG), combat support capabilities and combat
services support. Maintain a high level of readiness as well as Logistical support at all
levels of command-control (C2) to respond rapidly to unforeseen crises;

 Establishment of operational capacities for observing and monitoring the airspace of the

Republic of Albania, as well as improving operational concepts for the use of helicopters
in different operating scenarios and situations. Particular importance is to be given to
cooperation and coordination with national and NATO structures for the implementation
of Alb-NATO Project at Kuçova Air Base. The aviation training is to aim at supporting
the Light Infantry Battalion Group for the use of helicopters on the battlefield, support for
SARs on land and at sea, and consolidating the standards required for participation in
joint training with NATO countries.

 Maintaining a picture of the maritime situation, through continuous monitoring of the

marine space, and building the capacity for secure communication through the Military
Messaging System Management as a condition for successfully fulfilling the duties in the
"Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 "for 2019;

 Enhancing the Response Capability of the Marine Force through a high operational

readiness and more flexible concepts in their use;

 Fulfillment of commitments for the establishment of Military Cyber Security Unit.

**4. Motivating staff and increasing professionalism.**

**4.1. Human resources.**

The continuous transformation of the security environment requires a continuous adaptation of
the Armed Forces where permanent attention should be paid to one of the main elements of
defense resources, consolidation of the human resource management system, throughout the life
cycle of uniformed personnel. Human resource management is to be guided by:

-  Reliability, by providing and developing transparent procedures to all staff;

-  Competence, by constantly updating to respond to ongoing needs of AAF;

-  Initiative, by accompanying the process of managing new ideas by identifying and improving
the potential shortcomings in the military education system;

-  Motivation, by providing full support and continuous ongoing care towards staff.

Personnel is the main asset of the Armed Forces, the foundation of operational and defense
capabilities. For this reason, staff motivation through progressive treatment with salaries and
bonuses for specific working conditions, with effective health care, transparency, meritocracy
and providing equal opportunities for education, career development and improving social
policies will be a priority policy throughout the life cycle of the military. Also, in 2019, the
positive experience gained in the program "Youth-Talent-Opportunity-Dignity" should continue,
guiding young people in respecting national values, aiming at updating AAF's with dedicated
new staff. Recruitment is to be done through a professional marketing based on current needs
and AAF's perspective, adapting to demographic developments and information technology.

Aim to achieve and maintain 15% representation level of women in uniform in recruitment and
promotion process. The gender perspective should be part of the policies and plans of the
structures of the Ministry of Defense and the AF General Staff, not only in representation but
also in level of responsibility. Continue the process of data entry into the Human Resource
Management System for all active, reserve / released personnel as well as citizens who have
performed compulsory military service.

**4.2. Education and training.**

The unpredictable nature of military operations requires that, regardless of the preparation or
education in the AAF, everyone should be aware that they never have enough knowledge about
strategies, technologies, culture or even the opponent themselves. Education should be based on
the new education concept, individual and collective training and to be more consistent with the
mission and main tasks of AAF. To address the abovementioned, the military education system
is to be based on:

-  Analytical techniques, more realistic approach and integration into strategic documents;


-----

-  Inspiration and innovation in the way of thinking and pedagogical organization;

-  Diversity, where experiences and creativity of each student, as well as their exchange, are the
main incentive.

The focus of work is to develop research and doctrinal thinking in line with the current and
expected developments of the security environment in order to increase the quality and
professionalism of military and civilian personnel of the Armed Forces structures at all levels.

Training should be guided by the principle of adapting the training plans, according to the
specifics in which the military units will operate. Pre-dislocation exercises should continue to
extend to all participating bodies in operations outside the territory of the Republic of Albania,
thus increasing the autonomy of contingent commanders in recognizing the operational
environment.

Synchronize national core exercises with those of the Alliance and utilize all opportunities for
participation in international trainings within the Alliance or regional ones. Inter-institutional
training should continue to be developed as an instrument in order to reach a high degree of
coordination and cooperation between the responsible national structures. The lesson learned
system is to aim at continuously improve the functioning of AAF structures, enhancing
operational capabilities.

**4.3. Readiness and operability.**

Maintaining operational capabilities through the enhancement of interoperability, sustainability,
suitability and use of technology with the primary purpose of meeting the constitutional mission,
ensuring national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Priority is to be the continuation of
operational commitments and the contribution of the Armed Forces in line with the three main
tasks of the Alliance. Armed Forces even during 2019 are to continue their contribution to
missions / operations led by NATO, the EU and the UN. Particular importance is to be given to
the materialization of AAF's participation in the United Nations mission.

Participation in international and regional initiatives is to serve the enhancement the AAF's
professionalism and interaction with the Alliance, increasing their role and credibility in the
region and beyond. Their community-based engagement, as the first response to civil emergency
operations, will continue to be considered a major task in peacetime.

**4.4. Material Resources.**

Material resources aim at supporting the activity of AAF structures and the concept of their
operational use in peace time, crisis and war. The support of structures that will be / are ready to
fulfill the constitutional mission and participate in the military operations of the Alliance is to be
achieved. Also, special attention should be paid to supporting the structures involved in dealing
with civil emergencies.


-----

Health support aims at the implementation of preventive measures and health treatment of AAF
personnel. It is important to pay attention to the medical treatment of personnel engaged in
missions abroad before, during and after the end of mission.

Supporting and assisting the community is to focus on improving infrastructure, remote areas,
clearing and certification of areas contaminated by UXOs, as well as continuing engagement to
assist other institutions in the country.

The handling of properties outside the AAF Settlement Plan should be realized based on the
legal and sub-legal acts through privatization, lease, transfer, registration, and application for
ownership certificate of any property in the administration of its structures.

**4.5. Financial resources.**

The defense budget is to be planned and effectively spent, providing balanced support among
budget items aiming at providing priority support to staff needs and increasing capital spending
to modernize operational capacity and priority infrastructure. Responsibly disciplining the annual
budget of the Ministry of Defense, as well as the fulfillment of budget requests and support of
defense programs should be the essential requirements that will enable us favorable options in
the field of defense. During 2019 should be worked to ensure better alignment of defense
programs with budget programs, reducing the volume of work and synchronizing efforts to
prioritize and timely and quality budget execution.

**5. Continuation of engagements, active role and credibility in international arena.**

**5.1. International co-operation.**

International co-operation is to be in full harmony with the foreign policy objectives in support
of the integration processes of our country in the EU, in the interest of developing the capacity of
AAF and aim for results in modernization, education, training and joint exercises.

NATO engagement and co-operation with partner countries have priority as activities that
support the AAF's constitutional mission, development and implementation of the Capacities
Objective Package. Also, the 10th anniversary of our country's membership in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) is a special event for the Armed Forces of the Republic of Albania
for their contribution and commitment to national, Euro-Atlantic and global security . Focus, in
addition to the jubilee activities, is to be the development of the multinational exercise "Albanian
Effort 19".

The Chairing by Albania of the NATO Military Intelligence Committee (MIC) during 2019
should be a key priority for intelligence structures in order to meet the Alliance Intelligence
objectives and national obligations.

Active engagement, qualitative representation in the fulfillment of obligations within NATO,
EU, UN, OSCE or regional initiatives for enhancing confidence, peace, security in the region and
beyond is to continue.


-----

**5.2. Regional cooperation.**

Regional cooperation aims at interaction on various military issues, such as education, training,
exercising, participation in joint operations, and support to the Euro-Atlantic integration
processes of the region.

Taking the lead of the SEDM regional initiative (2019-2021) and the Adriatic Charter (A-5) are
to be key priorities within regional cooperation.

**6. Effectiveness in Civil Emergency Management and Community Assistance.**

In the area of civil emergencies, the legal and structural framework of the Civil Protection
System and its modernization should be improved, to ensure citizens' lives, to minimize material
losses, damage to property, cultural heritage and the environment.

The consolidation of the General Directorate of Civil Emergencies and the National Research
and Rescue Center is to continue as the main structure in the management, coordination of search
and rescue operations and civil emergencies. Special attention should be paid to coordination and
cooperation with all national actors, as well as allied and partner countries, in the course of
operations in response to civil emergencies.

Also, it is importance should be placed on drafting reserve plans for dealing with civil
emergencies, as well as planning the necessary reserves materials.

Inter-institutional cooperation with central and local government bodies and the media should be
quality and driven by the principle "zero risk does not exist", in order to successfully implement
the warning and engagement in support and community assistance.

**7. Increase transparency from all structures of the Armed Forces.**

All Armed Forces structures are to focus on increasing transparency and the fight against
corruption. Particular attention should be paid to transparency in personnel management,
spending of public funds, personnel complaint system and the "Albania we want" program.

**CONCLUSIONS**

2019 is an important year for the AAF, as it coincides with the 10-th anniversary of our country's
accession to the Alliance, therefore, for the implementation of this directive, I request from all
MoD / AAF structures to draw up concrete action plans and programs, as well as to take all
measures for their timely realization.
