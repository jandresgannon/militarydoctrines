## FOREWORD BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE GOVERNMENT


-----

### FOREWORD

Over the course of the last quarter of the
20[th] century—during the reign of HM Don
Juan Carlos—Spain has found itself again. It
has also realised that its interests cannot be
defended in isolation, but rather
collectively, with all the nations that share
its commitment to peace, freedom, the
defence of democracy, and respect for
human rights and the rules of international
law.

We Spaniards form an open society and
want Spain to attain its rightful place in the
world in accordance with its history and

**José María Aznar López**

political, economic and cultural weight. _President of the Government_
Throughout the past decade, the regular
participation of our soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen beyond our borders has been a
valuable Spanish contribution to international peace and stability.

Spanish society can feel proud and thankful for the effort that the Armed Forces have
been making to defend our values and interests overseas. In the new world order, the armed
services have become a privileged agent of external action, supporting our efforts to
guarantee a more stable and secure international environment.

Defence White Paper Page 11

FOREWORD

Therefore, the government I head began the 6[th] parliamentary term determined to
strengthen Defence by adapting it to the requirements of the new strategic landscape.
Overhauling the Armed Forces, which are the specific instrument of defence, is a major task
that requires the participation of society as a whole, since it affects everyone and the
resources needed to undertake it belong to all. The efforts required to achieve a secure and
stable geostrategic environment are always useful and beneficial to the wellbeing of society.

With this idea in mind, the Government obtained from Parliament the backing it
considered necessary for this purpose. This backing was granted through the report of the
Joint Congress-Senate Commission establishing the formula and timetable for attaining the
full professionalisation of the Armed Forces.

The Government’s objective was thus threefold: to secure Spain a position as a member
of the western community fully integrated into the Atlantic Alliance; its firm commitment to
European security; and the adoption of a new model of Armed Forces based on the total
professionalisation of its members.

Today, Spain’s full participation in the structures of the Atlantic Alliance and its attitude
in promoting the Common European Policy on Security and Defence, in accordance with
the report drawn up by the Cortes Generales (Parliament), are facts that evidence our efforts
in collective defence with our partners and allies.

The publication of a Defence White Paper should not be an extraordinary event but
rather a completely normal fact. However, this is not possible on this occasion as it is the
first time that a document of these characteristics has been published in Spain. By doing so,
the Government is exposing itself to healthy criticism and opening a debate on our defence
and security that can shed the light needed to guide us on our path over the next few years.

Spain is currently in a position to set itself new goals and to assume supportively the
responsibilities deriving from its role in the international community. The conclusions
inferred from this collective thinking will provide the basis for proceeding, when the time
comes, to a strategic defence review, in order to equip the Armed Forces with the essential
military capabilities they need to act in the strategic landscape of the century that is
dawning.

## PREFACE BY THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE

### PREFACE

It is a pleasure for me, as Minister of Defence, to
write the preface to this Defence White Paper. This is a
special occasion, as it is the first time that a work of this
kind has been published in Spain. The idea of bringing
out such a publication is not new, of course, but it can
be done now that Spanish society has overcome many
of its prejudices and is able to discuss the meaning and
importance of Defence and the Armed Forces with
interest, objectivity and equanimity.

Defence is necessarily a matter of State and, while
this cannot give us reason to think that the specific
choices made in defence policy are free from
controversy, we should recall the considerable degree
of political and social consensus reached in recent
years. Our country’s full membership of the new NATO
and the professionalisation of the Armed Forces have **Eduardo Serra Rexach**

_Minister of Defence_

secured majority parliamentary support and the general
approval of society. The clichés about obsolete,
politicised Armed Forces with no international presence have gradually lost meaning in
recent years, thanks to the parallel development of the Armed Forces and society.
Nowadays there is no denying that our soldiers are more professional and, at the same time,
more highly valued—aspects that are mutually reinforcing.

PREFACE

The gradual normalisation of Defence as just another state function that is beneficial to
citizens not only requires greater transparency, but also a deeper awareness of the basic
aspects. As I understand it, there are issues of Defence Policy, which, owing to their nature,
must be kept in strictest secrecy (such as, for example, detailed analysis of risks and threats);
but apart from that, treating it with maximum transparency and according it the significance
that it merits as a public institution will only afford strength and social backing to the
decisions that are adopted. Defence must cease to be a mystery for citizens and become a
familiar instrument, which, as such, enjoys the greatest possible social support.

This White Paper reflects the maturity attained by a project of significant change, which
aims to provide Spain with Armed Forces that are modern in a broad sense of the word—
from personnel to materiel, including doctrine and training. Information and transparency
have always been an objective of this Government, and the reason for not publishing the
Defence White Paper until now, at the end of the parliamentary term as opposed to earlier
on, is the preference that its content should stem from the assimilation of the changes that
took place in the Atlantic Alliance and the European Union in 1999, and from intense
consultations and collaboration within the Armed Forces.

But there is another reason, one that transcends the national framework, for waiting until
now as the opportune moment for bringing out this White Paper: the world is undergoing
transformation at a hitherto unseen pace, and Spain with it. And the strategic and military
aspects of the international situation are not unaffected by this development, as the content
of the paper evidences.

We are probably at the threshold of a change that affects the very foundations of defence.
Indeed, for centuries the purpose of wars was to conquer or defend a territory, as land was
the mainstay of the economy in agrarian societies. Following the birth of the modern state,
which exercises its sovereignty and administration over the nation, defence became centred almost exclusively on safeguarding the nation’s land and overseas dependencies.
Defence, at the outset, thus entailed defending one’s territory from possible enemies.

However, an element that has been developed over the past fifty years is pointing to a
change in the classical conception of defence as defence of the nation: nuclear weapons,
which, in the context of rivalry between East and West, conjure up the spectre of an atomic
holocaust, a widespread conflict in which, for the first time in history, the whole of Mankind
is under threat. In such a strategic environment, a conflict of this kind could be suicidal,
since nobody stands to win from a nuclear exchange. In other words, defence has begun to
play a role of deterrent from possible attacks.

Moreover, the Cold War and the huge potential threat of the then USSR led to another
significant change in national policies: no European country alone could muster a credible

PREFACE

defence, despite the proximity of this threat. A collective effort was needed to safeguard
nations’ interests, even their very survival. It is no coincidence that during this period a
collective defence organisation like the Atlantic Alliance attained such a degree of
development and institutionalisation. The allies will understand that the best deterrent to
which they can aspire will be the result of their combined efforts and that their best defence
does not always lie inside their borders.

National defence, in the exclusive sense of the immediate defence of a country’s
borders, is thus rendered meaningless when threats are global and total.

We know, however, that this deterrent-based conception was only valid in East-West
relations, and that in certain parts of the world, where the tension between the blocs
erupted, destruction and violence were the order of the day.

Nonetheless, following the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, the world ceased to be
organised around the East-West and North-South cardinal points and adopted a new
structure of successive concentric circles. Stability and security are at their greatest in the
centre, and gradually diminish the further outwards we move. Outside the circle of
advanced democratic nations, some still regard force as an integral part of their way of
doing politics.

The prospect of a globalised world which constitutes the framework of economic
relations that generate wealth and progress for all peoples is incompatible with the serious
disruptions to international stability that such behaviour can cause. Modern industrial and
post-industrial societies, in particular, have interests that stretch much further than
defending their territories—interests that they necessarily agree must be safeguarded, as
they are interdependent. This political will to maintain and expand stability is today one of
the chief aims of collective security and arouses the efforts of collective defence
organisations, particularly the Atlantic Alliance.

In less than fifty years, we have thus witnessed a shift from the traditional concept of
defence as defending a territory to a concept of collective deterrence, finally arriving at the
current stage which entails conceiving defence also as the projection of stability.

Precisely that co-existence, under the umbrella of globalisation, of a post-modern and
stable world and another pre-modern, violent one, commits those of us who enjoy peace
and security towards those who lack the stability needed to cater to their most basic
necessities of subsistence, co-existence and wellbeing. Indeed, financial and commercial
affairs in today’s world know no frontiers of time or distances. The time has perhaps come
for morality and politics not to know such frontiers either. Governments are aware of the
need to guarantee world stability, since the peace and prosperity of their nations are
ultimately at stake; but they are also under moral pressure to do something in response to

Defence White Paper Page 17

PREFACE

their societies’ displeasure at barbaric acts. In this world of concentric circles, it is we, the
advanced democracies, who enjoy the central, most secure position.

Therefore, defence can no longer be a question that stems from a narrow conception of
interests concerning a particular territory or assets; rather, it must become a privileged tool
for exporting security and peace to a world in which violence is, unfortunately, a frequent
temptation.

NATO has had to adapt to this new situation, which no longer requires it to serve merely
as an instrument for defending its members’ territory vis-à-vis armed aggression, but rather
to intervene on a wider scale to try to remedy situations triggered by aggression and the
indiscriminate use of violence. In short, to spread the stability and peace that its members
enjoy.

And not just the Atlantic Alliance. The European Union itself, broadening the scope of
its responsibility, has been endeavouring since 1999 to formulate a genuine security and
defence policy to equip it with significant military capabilities.

This marks a considerable shift away from traditional ideas about what defending a
country and military and defence alliances should entail. From now on, missions,
command structures, procedure for collective action, in short, the way that the forces and
their use are conceived, will be understood differently. The scope of action is changing and
missions are of a different nature. Hence the importance of having a White Paper to guide
and steer our Defence and Armed Forces through this sea of changes.

For many years the world order was based mainly on the strategic balance between two
superpowers, on which the medium-sized and small powers scarcely had any influence.
Nuclear deterrence was everything. Today things have changed: nowadays, all nations
count in missions that support peace in the broadest sense of the word, though more so
those which are not only willing to collaborate in this collective effort of the international
community, but also have the technical, human and material resources to do so.

Finally, a new phenomenon that has emerged over the past few years, and one that has
strategic implications, is the inrush of the media, and most particularly television, as a
vehicle for raising society’s awareness of disasters and wars. On the one hand, the
possibility of obtaining information in real time of what goes on all round the world
confronts television viewers’ consciences with the human misery of conflicts. On the other,
however, insofar as television language is very simple, intense and sporadic, the images of
one war are followed by those of another, with no explanations or solutions—in many cases
just the horror. This brief but intense attention arouses feelings that are equally intense but
not long lasting. Even so, the dedication of the media is largely behind this spectacular
development of today’s international solidarity.

PREFACE

Spain has understood very well the rules of the new strategic chessboard and is firmly
committed not only to its own defence, but to world stability. This commitment was
evidenced on different occasions during the nineties, from the Gulf war to Kosovo, and will
continue to be seen wherever it is needed. The domestic efforts are centred on the thorough
and overall modernisation that our Armed Forces are undergoing to make them among the
most advanced in Europe, as reflected clearly in the following pages.

Ortega[1] wrote in his _España invertebrada_ that “the degree of perfection of an army
measures with amazing accuracy the carats of national morality and vitality”. Indeed, the
development of our Defence and Armed Forces has been accompanied by a substantial
change in society. During the Cold War decades, the chief purpose of arms—to deter
aggressors—caused a major sector of western society to fail to see the point of having
Armed Forces, which, after all, were an instrument that did not seem to be put to any use.

In the case of Spain, which remained on the margin of the major international structures
for years, its role was seen through the particular prism of our recent political history, which
largely distorted everything relating to the defence of national interests. Nonetheless, the
participation of Spanish soldiers in humanitarian tasks and the progressive assumption of
greater responsibility in peace missions in the broad sense of the word have changed the
way in which Spaniards regard and value their own Armed Forces. Today, people not only
are aware of their meaning, but appreciate their inestimable devotion and good work in
areas very distant from Spanish soil.

The changes in society’s perception of the Armed Forces are, to an extent, the result of
a broader social change, the change that Spain has been undergoing in recent decades. In
less than fifty years, Spain has gone from being a poor, agricultural, rural country, under the
sway of a dictator and closed to the outside world, to a rich, industrial and post-industrial,
urban country with an advanced democracy and open to the world in all aspects. In other
words, Spain has fully come to be a part of modernity.

In economic terms, it is not merely a case of generating levels of wealth and income that
are gradually closer to the European Union average; rather, the structure of the nation is
undergoing highly revealing changes. Basically, Spain has ceased to be a closed economy
and is now an open and internationalised economy. To cite an example, in 1960 foreign
trade and imports accounted for 16% of GDP. In comparison, the latest data show that in
1997 the foreign sector amounted to over 55% of the national economy. What is more, in
1999, for the second consecutive year, Spain’s capital balance was positive, since, despite
the substantial inflows of foreign capital, Spain was a net investor abroad.

1922.

PREFACE

This economic and social dynamism undoubtedly has clear repercussions on Spain’s
international action and presence. This branching out into the international sphere also has
a positive impact on social awareness, which today is more open and linked to the world.
Spaniards travel more and are much more proficient in languages than in the past. Spain is
no longer “different”, idiosyncrasies are dying out and Spaniards are becoming aware of
their horizons as a group.

As mentioned earlier, proof of Spanish society’s maturity is its attitude towards military
interventions to support peace and in humanitarian assistance missions. For the first time in
recent history, Spanish public opinion behaved like our European neighbours towards such
a thorny issue as NATO’s intervention in Kosovo.

A few years ago, much of the population might have thought that defence was generated
spontaneously, not realising the careful planning it requires. This is no longer the case.
Society has become aware that it has at its service a genuine instrument of peace, whose
action affords Spain credibility and international importance, not to mention other benefits
linked to industrial and technological development. Society must therefore be coherent and
allow its Defence resources to be in keeping with the greater international role of its Armed
Forces, of Spain, after all. It is not Spain’s military, or Defence, but our country that needs
this. The White Paper aims to bring Defence closer to society, increasing the latter’s
awareness of defence.

We are a fortunate country in that our position makes us a genuine crossroads between
different worlds. Europe and North Africa, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, the Old and
New continents. We have an ambitious and exciting project in the European Union, for
which the time has now come to consider defence. We have a collective organisation—
NATO—that safeguards our own Defence and, together with the growing European
capabilities, will enable us to contribute to stability in the Euro-Atlantic region.

I believe that all these factors clearly explain the reasons behind the White Paper:
reasons of social development, international and strategic changes, and the importance of
the transformation our Armed Forces are undergoing have made it advisable to bring out
this publication. We are now embarking on a new stage that will give a meaning to its
purpose.

As I said at the beginning of this preface, Defence is, in itself, a potentially controversial
issue that requires debate, provided that it is honest and calm. Discussing the possible
successes and weaknesses of the different options will lead to a better, more consistent
result that is more fully understood and supported. The Government is committed to an
ambitious plan to transform and modernise Spain’s Defence, and the knowledge obtained
through discussion and debate can only serve to prepare Spanish society better to assume,

as a whole, the responsibilities that lie ahead of our country and its Armed Forces in this
21[st] century.

This White Paper gives an outline of our Defence, of what it is and what we want it to
be. It has been drawn up bearing in mind the need for information that is reliable, up-todate and as thorough as possible. I trust that it will serve to make Spanish society aware of
the challenge we face and be generous with its Armed Forces, realising that in doing so we
are being generous with ourselves.

### INTRODUCTION

Spain has emerged from a long period of historical isolation and is once again an
important member of the international community. Today it belongs to the European Union
and is fully integrated into the western defence system, the most prominent element of
which is the Atlantic Alliance.

This approach to defence is backed by the report of the Joint Congress-Senate Commission establishing the formula and timetable for achieving the full professionalisation of the
Spanish Armed Forces, which was approved by the Congress of Deputies in full session on
28 May 1998. The Senate in full session subsequently approved it on 9 June that same year,
stating that, “it is a fact that one of the most important consequences of the strategic changes witnessed in the past ten years is the strengthening of the collective defence and security organisations. The autarkic approaches to defence based on national self-sufficiency
have been superseded and, although the conceptions of security and defence based on
nations’ own military capabilities continue to be valid, political and military co-operation
is sought between nations as a means of obtaining greater security at a lower cost”.

Now that the threat posed to the western nations by the Soviet bloc has vanished, the
medium-term outlook for the world in fifteen or so years’ time—the period that this Defence
White Paper addresses—points to greater security than in the past, though also greater
instability, owing to risk factors that stem for a much more complex and dynamic
international situation than the bipolar world.

The Atlantic Alliance, a shared security organisation on which the guarantees of Europe’s
defence—and therefore Spain’s—depends, has had to adapt its strategy and structures,

INTRODUCTION

conceived for the Cold War, to a new strategic environment in which hitherto latent
tensions, risks and regional instability are emerging.

Europe too has felt the need to boost its defence and security instruments. The process
of bringing European countries’ national stances closer together in defence matters—a logical consequence of political and economic convergence—was first glimpsed even before
the Kosovo crisis. This process is aimed at starting to develop a European military capability for carrying out humanitarian, peacekeeping and peacemaking and crisis-management
tasks, using combat forces if necessary, as envisaged in the Treaty on European Union.

In order to ensure an adequate response to the requirements and challenges of the
strategic environment at the beginning of the 21[st] century, Spain also faces the unavoidable
need to upgrade its defence mechanism with modern criteria, in consonance with our
active participation in major international issues, our firm commitment to European
defence and our full integration into the Atlantic Alliance.

For the above reasons, Spain now has an extraordinary and perhaps historic chance to
undertake boldly and firmly the design of a more effective defence system and to give
definitive impetus to the process of restructuring the Armed Forces that was begun in 1977
when the Ministry of Defence was established at the start of the transition to democracy.

This White Paper aims to give a realistic and transparent outline of Defence Policy,
which is firmly established and based on the consensus of political and social forces and
on the boost given by the Government, together with the necessary parliamentary backing,
of specific plans to achieve a defence mechanism in keeping with the general principles
enshrined in the 1998 parliamentary agreement.

In the following chapters the reader will find, first of all, a synthesis of the salient features
of the current strategic environment, including a review of current risks and the new
physiognomy of conflicts. This is followed by a summary of how the allies and Europe
respond to this new environment, with special emphasis on the adaptation of their strategic
concept and structures. The Paper then deals with Spain’s strategic conception and the ends,
means, objectives and guidelines for action of Spanish Defence Policy.

The White Paper continues with an explanation of the criteria governing the design of
the new model of Armed Forces and the plans hatched to develop the three processes
currently under way: professionalisation, modernisation and rationalisation of the
organisation, all with the intention of adapting the forces to the strategic requirements of
the 21[st] century. It therefore analyses the missions and military capabilities needed to meet
these requirements, the necessary human resources and the plans for modernising
armaments, equipment and infrastructure, paying particular attention to the environment,
since this obviously affects society.

INTRODUCTION

Finally, guidelines are given for rationalising and adapting Defence to the new strategic
environment as a necessary condition for the effective use of military potential, and the
economic support of the aforementioned policies is considered. The human and material
resources needed to achieve and maintain an appropriate military capability and to sustain
increasing operational activity entail a financial Defence effort, provided this is within
realistic and reasonable limits. This effort must be understood as the price to pay for our
peace and security, the demonstration of our solidarity with our partners and allies and the
certain possibility of our freedom of action as a sovereign nation.

All in all, on the threshold of the new century, the Government has outlined its view of
Defence and the way in which it is fulfilling its commitments to Spanish parliament and
Spanish society to overhaul the military instrument that Spain needs to guarantee its
security and to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and stability.

##### CHAPTER I

### THE STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT

Since the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, the western community
has shown signs of a flexibility and dynamism that were unknown
during the Cold War, when all efforts were concentrated on containing a specific threat. The decade that is now coming to a close
has seen the emergence of a constant majority will to open up channels for dialogue, step up co-operation, strengthen shared security
organisations and even establish new ties of partnership—all with
the aim of consolidating the long-awaited international situation of
a true peace between nations, without confrontation or tension, in
which freedom and the progress of all citizens are possible.

Without a doubt, the nineties will go down in history as the decade that marked the end of East-West confrontation. Humanity was
freed from the feeling of imprisonment caused by the threat of
nuclear holocaust, which gave way to the conviction that the concept
of security surpasses that of defence. Amid an unexpected climate of
understanding between the countries that belonged to the formerly
antagonistic blocs, treaties were signed and agreements reached on
arms control, disarmament, conflict prevention and crisis management.

truly stable. At the
dawn of the 21[st] century, the hope of a world in peace is clouded by the emergence of fresh
tension and conflicts, mostly triggered by instability factors stemming
from ethnic, religious and cultural differences, historic territorial
claims and irredentist or exclusionist nationalism, long forgotten
under the weight of the former geopolitical order. On top of this are
the social problems arising from the transition to political and economic freedom, which are giving rise to a new set of risks, particularly
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to
launch them. This could come to pose a major threat to security.

Genocide and outbreaks of violence in certain African countries,
the long drawn out Middle East conflict and the frequent clashes
and crises in Asia are obvious signs that world peace is still a
distant goal. And in this respect, Europe is no exception, as
evidenced by the successive Balkan crises that unleash armed
conflict—something that we only thought possible in other parts of
the world—on European soil.

CHAPTER I: THE STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT

In short, although the nineties were marked, at the outset, by the
Persian Gulf War and later by the long, cruel conflict in the Balkans,
it can be said that, in general, this decade has been characterised by
the pursuit of international security and stability in a new spirit of
co-operation.

###### Globalisation of the strategic environment

The globalisation of human activity is one of the essential
characteristics of the strategic environment at the beginning of the
new century. We live in an interdependent world in which walls
tend to tumble and borders to become increasingly permeable.
Nobody can regard themselves as unaffected by what goes on in
any other part of the world, as isolation is an option that is as
illogical as it is inadvisable. The prodigious advances in the fields
of communications and information systems, the flows of capital
and investments and trade relations on a world scale have been
conducive to the integration of the financial markets and have
stimulated the transmission of ideas and the movement of people
and goods. The world has become smaller and the globalisation
process seems irreversible.

There is reason to believe that the acceleration of development
and the advancement of new technologies are unstoppable trends
that are linked to progress. Their potential for change is enormous,
and it seems undeniable that the countries which dominate the
field of innovation and apply new technologies will be the only
ones capable of successfully coping with the future. Those that are
left behind will depend on what assistance others are willing to
afford them and, in many cases, will have to pay a high price for
this in terms of freedom of action.

Globalisation is, in principle, a stability factor, since free trade
and competition generate development. As economies become
interlinked and the interdependence of some countries on others
becomes consolidated, relationships and ties are strengthened,
giving way to the idea that instability is damaging to everyone.

However, we cannot be assured that this development will
always be balanced or that globalisation will be risk-free.

CHAPTER I: THE STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT

It is worrying that the gap between developing countries and
the industrialised countries that produce high-tech capital assets is
tending to widen. And this effect, which has emerged as an indirect
consequence of globalisation, is more difficult to correct insofar as
certain private multinational entities become the focus of decisionmaking. Indeed, they sometimes have considerable political impact
and are capable of escaping the control of national authorities, or
even conditioning them.

This means to say that globalisation as a progress factor also
sows the seeds of instability which, unless appropriate corrective
measures are taken, can deepen inequality and create potentially
dangerous situations from the security point of view. In order to
prevent this happening, it is necessary to find solutions to political,
economic and demographic imbalances, whether internal or
regional, and this only seems to be possible through dialogue and
co-operation.

Any political measure centred on closing the gap between the
technologically more advanced developed countries, which have
more encouraging future prospects, and the developing nations
makes a valuable contribution to stability. The world will
undoubtedly be safer and more inhabitable the smaller the
differences between the economic, social and cultural levels of the
human communities which constitute it.

###### The European security environment

The past few years have witnessed the birth of twenty-two
states in Central and Eastern Europe and the surrounding area as
part of this environment of economic interdependence and pursuit
of political convergence in security matters. These countries until
not long ago were part of the Soviet bloc or were non-aligned
states, and some of them are currently fully immersed in the
process of joining the western model, though they are weighed
down by a variety of internal difficulties.

The opening up of Western Europe to these nations entails a
natural process of acceptance of, and support for, their nascent
democracies, and facilitates their access to a world based on free

competition and to the institutions of the western community. This

no doubt poses an additional challenge to the process of building
Europe and to the renovation of the Atlantic Alliance. It is
necessary to strike a balance between solidarity and realism, since
we cannot ignore Russia’s misgivings about its former allies
acceding to organisations that it continues to regard with caution.

Europe’s political and strategic situation has ushered in an age
of greater security, at least for most of the continent. Decisions and
initiatives such as the implementation of the Treaty on
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe; the adoption of
transparency and confidence- and security-building measures; the
recent advances in the field of arms control, particularly the
implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, the
Biological Weapons Convention and the Ottawa Convention on the
prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of antipersonnel mines and their destruction; the monitoring of the
fulfilment of the Dayton accords; the indefinite extension of the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; and the new
reductions of nuclear arsenals to be carried out following the
ratification of the START II Treaty by the Russian Federation and
the negotiations for START III have brought about deep changes in
the international environment. These changes have been conducive

to the establishment of new relations based on dialogue, cooperation and partnership between former adversaries and have
banished the threat of a massive and potentially immediate attack.

A new Europe is thus emerging, characterised by a complex
security architecture and built on international organisations,
which, despite being founded at very different moments in history,
have proved to some extent their validity and ability to adapt to
present-day requirements. The United Nations (UN), the
Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the
Atlantic Alliance (NATO), the Western European Union (WEU) and
the European Union (EU) itself mutually enhance their action in a
continent where security requires a variety of instruments capable
of addressing the complex geopolitical structure.

Founded to defend its members in Europe and North America,
NATO not only expresses the Atlantic links of European security, but
the will to face up to the risks posed by instability in regions adjacent
to the area defined in its founding treaty. The Partnership for Peace
initiative, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the NATO-Russia
Permanent Joint Council, the special relationship with Ukraine and
the Mediterranean Dialogue give specific form to the collaboration
efforts to extend security to the whole of the Euro-Atlantic area.

Europe’s security unavoidably encompasses the Mediterranean
dimension of the continent, whose importance not only affects the
southern regions but also Central Europe, whose Balkan region
extends to the Adriatic Sea. The Mediterranean is an area of contrasts
and disequilibrium in the political, economic and social spheres and,
as a result, is prone to instability. It should nonetheless be pointed
out that the countries around the Mediterranean basin make up an
area with its own characteristics and development potential, and all
look set to work together and co-operate with each other.


Finding a solution to the security problems in the
Mediterranean and creating an area of peace and stability require
communication and confidence between the two shores. This is the
aim of several forums for dialogue, such as those that take place
within the Atlantic Alliance and in the European Union’s Barcelona
Process, which complement each other and are backed and
promoted by Spain.

In this international environment, economic and social factors
have become more important than ideological ones, and the
pragmatic approach strengthens the need to adapt to the new
situation. In Europe, where the changes are more visible, initiatives
to boost the economic and political integration processes—among
which monetary union could be a paradigm—and the
development of co-operation between former adversaries in all
fields, but particularly in military aspects, arouse expectations of a
future that is promising, though perhaps uncertain.

CHAPTER I: THE STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT

###### Risks on the horizon

During the Cold War, world stability was based on bipolarity.
Now that we are no longer troubled by the fear of the consequences
of widespread conflict and the threat of certain mutual destruction,
different sources of instability point to the prospect of
multidirectional and multifaceted risks and uncertainties and make
for an international situation that is indeed complicated. The world
faces risks arising mainly from the social tension sparked by
economic imbalance, the demographic explosion, democratic
deficit, environmental aggression and cultural clashes.

In global terms, now that the blocs have disappeared,
international relations have become much more dynamic and we
are more likely to witness the emergence of crises which are no
longer focused on the attachment of the states in question to certain
spheres of influence of the superpowers. Situations are thus more
complex than in the past, as evidenced by the large number of
conflicts that continue to trouble the world.

During the previous historical period, much of Eurasia revolved
around the Soviet Union. Now that the Warsaw Pact no longer
exists, the possibility of a large-scale aggression in the EuroAtlantic region has faded, but a situation of genuine stability has

CHAPTER I: THE STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT

not yet been achieved in Central and Eastern Europe following the
vacuum left by the former Soviet Union.

Nonetheless, the states that have regained their external
freedom of action are in the process of joining the international
community. Their path is strewn with difficulties arising from the
reconstruction of their civil societies and from their finding their
place with respect to their neighbours and the rest of the world.
This delicate transition to freedom, democracy and a market
economy is giving rise to tensions to which Europe was not
accustomed, and which can potentially sow the seeds of instability.

Instability is therefore a phenomenon of our time and a risk that
must be borne very much in mind, all the more so because its
consequences in a globalised world like today’s can affect us all. It
also triggers uncertainty regarding the possibility—undoubtedly
real—that the climate of confidence, security and co-operation
created in the world at the end of the 20[th] century may disappear.

First, although there are currently no threats of this kind, we
cannot rule out the possibility that a deterioration in the situation
in the long term could again give rise to the possibility of a largescale aggression, as we must be highly conscious that there are still
vast nuclear arsenals. This risk, owing to its far-reaching
consequences, must be averted by prevention and co-operation and
by maintaining military capabilities that enable us to react in the
event of a change of scenario.

Second, the possibility of the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction—nuclear, chemical and biological—and the means to
launch them is a matter of particular concern, as these are a serious
instability factor since they alter the strategic balance and have
enormously harmful effects. Measures to control and combat the
proliferation of weapons come up against the added difficulty that
much of the technology used is also civilian—known as “dual use”
technology—and is available on the commercial networks that are
becoming increasingly sophisticated. Therefore, the monitoring of
this kind of traffic requires close international co-ordination, which
is considerably difficult to achieve in practice.

In addition, the economic imbalance between developed and
developing countries is a tension factor that needs to be taken very

CHAPTER I: THE STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT

much into account in the new strategic environment. To prevent
this becoming a risk, a pragmatic stance by the West no doubt
requires solutions in the field of co-operation and development aid,
supplemented by measures to control arms, combat the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and, of course,
maintain a decisive military capability as a deterrent.

In the economic field, owing to the size of markets of all kinds,
even energy resources and commodities, a seemingly distant crisis
can have far-reaching repercussions on the performance of the
overall economic system, so much so that a major change in the
flow of primary resources can pose a real threat to stability.

Demographic disequilibrium encourages population
movements that should be controlled in order to adapt them to
changes in the labour factor, preventing, in any event, the illicit
traffic entailed by clandestine immigration. A more serious factor is
the possibility of mass human displacements as a result of
situations of violence or an extreme shortage of vital resources.

The social and technological dynamism of today’s world is so
great that the fight against organised crime can hardly be
addressed from a strictly internal perspective, since it has reached
international dimensions. Thus, the huge international
development in means of transport and communications makes it
very difficult to crack down effectively on transnational organised
crime, another great scourge of our time that mainly takes the form
of drug trafficking and terrorism. Security is thus a complex affair
that calls for a broader concept to enable the different elements
available to be co-ordinated to protect society.

###### The new profile of conflicts

In view of the current and foreseeable risks on the horizon, it
seems highly unlikely that total war, of the kind that characterised
the first half of the 20[th] century, could break out in the near future
or in the medium term, and the likelihood of a widespread nuclear
exchange is even slimmer. By contrast, some of the features
witnessed in the conflicts that are erupting currently will become
accentuated.

CHAPTER I: THE STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT

_The Air Force is an effective deterrent in peacekeeping._

It is therefore reasonable to believe that future conflicts will be
limited with respect to the political ends and objectives pursued
and to the means used. The limitation of conflicts signifies, in a
sense, a return to the past and a shift away from the 20[th] century
model of all-out confrontation, which, in the nuclear age, could
lead to situations in which all the sides in the conflict would be
losers and none could achieve its political objectives.

In these circumstances, in practical terms, the Cold War
endorsed the abstention from the widespread use of force as a
means of settling conflicts, in the same way that the Charter of the
United Nations, back in 1945, condemned war as an illicit means of
resolving international disputes, unless in self-defence. In this
framework, which is now history, what really mattered was the
need to avoid large-scale war, even if the tensions between the
major blocs erupted into minor or limited conflicts.

Having left this period behind, the international community
now aspires to true peace, a situation in which the risks that
threaten international stability are averted to the advantage of the
security and progress of peoples. In order for this to occur, it is
necessary, above all, to anticipate the causes of any possible
conflict—which is what prevention entails. Any potential aggressor
must furthermore be discouraged, and this is the purpose of


_Future_

_foreseeably_

_in scope_


Defence White Paper Page 37


-----

CHAPTER I: THE STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT

deterrence. As a last resort, if peace is disrupted, it will be necessary
to manage the crisis.

The importance of diplomatic action should be stressed in this
connection. Diplomatic efforts, even while operations are being
conducted, are an indispensable means of negotiating the interests
at stake and preventing the causes of a possible conflict from
becoming critical. They can furthermore offer an alternative to
escalation, should this occur, and, if armed conflict erupts while
they are being conducted, they can at least limit its intensity and
duration and control the results.

Quite often conflicts arise in states that tolerate repeated and very
serious violations of human rights, the suffering or death of a large
number of people and even, at times, true genocide. The international
community should not remain impassive in the face of such situations.

The infringement of human rights and the need to prevent the
civilian population from suffering are increasingly becoming a
priority concern of security, as factors that can trigger conflicts. It is
therefore to be hoped that the action of the western nations
becomes oriented towards upholding common values and
interests, such as maintaining international peace and stability
rather than territorial defence.

Page 38 Defence White Paper

CHAPTER I: THE STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT

Peace is emerging as a universal value and the stability which
makes it possible is an interest that is widely shared by all nations.
Therefore, the existence of a system that ensures prevention,
deterrence and, if the need should arise, an effective response to a
possible rupture of the peace in a crisis situation concerns the
international community as a whole.

In these circumstances, legitimisation of the use of force falls to
the international community, through the international
organisations and the United Nations in particular, though if this is
blocked by the Security Council, the international community
could respond on the principle of humanitarian intervention in
cases of blatant violation of human rights. In the area of operations,
the population may not only be victim, but even become the target
of violence and fall hostage to those causing it, and these
circumstances should be borne in mind when deciding on possible
courses of action.

Multinationality will probably be another of the characteristics
of future conflicts. The shared interest of the international
community in preventing their development and expansion goes
beyond purely territorial factors and will lead states to use their
forces, even far from their borders, with the firm intention of
preserving international stability as best they can.

##### CHAPTER II

### THE WESTERN RESPONSE TO THE STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT

Today’s strategic environment is largely the result of successive
historical challenges, the latest of which was manifested throughout the second half of the 20[th] century. The Atlantic Alliance was the
West’s response to an alternative model that was established in
Eastern Europe and showed clear signs of spreading necessarily to
the rest of the continent. An area of freedom and progress was thus
created in which not only was post-war Europe rebuilt, but the
seeds of economic integration were sown.

The collapse of the Soviet system in the early nineties dragged
down the old order in Central Europe and the purposes for which
the Alliance had been founded appeared to be achieved. It was
soon realised, however, that an organisation which had been capable of channelling the defence efforts of a large number of sovereign nations could also organise a common response to the risks
threatening the plan to build a new division- and threat-free
Europe in peace.

The process of adapting NATO to the new strategic environment was developed throughout the nineties. During this time,
without modifying the defence commitments adopted in the Washington Treaty, a series of new ideas were formulated to maintain
stability in a threat-free area, including new missions for its forces,
a new military structure capable of implementing these ideas and,
to round this off, in 1999 a new strategic concept that embodied the
foregoing.

uncertainties and risks at the beginning of the new century. Against
the backdrop of the Kosovo crisis, the NATO Summit held in Washington in April renewed the allied strategy. For its part, the Council of the European Union, which met in Cologne in June,
announced its decision to promote a Common European Policy on
Security and Defence to back the Union’s foreign policy. Later on,
at Helsinki, the Council defined the civilian and military structures
for developing this policy.

Both initiatives, allied and European, are complementary and
based on Atlantic solidarity, which was put to the test with encouraging results during the thorny Kosovo crisis and mark, as a whole,
the culmination of a process of co-operation that will give way to a
new security and defence policy for the 21[st] century.

In order to face up to these new strategic realities, the Atlantic
Alliance, to which Spain has belonged since 1982, has evolved from
being exclusively a defence organisation to a broader conception of
security and defence in which initiatives for co-operation and rapprochement towards former adversaries are compatible with a suitable military capability.

This adaptation of the Atlantic Alliance, carried out on the principle that security is indivisible, has entailed accepting new missions without losing sight of the essential task of collective defence.
As a result, new instruments and structures have been created
to implement military capabilities as flexibly as possible. This
broader conception of security has also made it necessary to develop
ideas of dialogue and co-operation, which have progressively
become consolidated over the past decade. Spain has upheld,
upholds, and will continue to uphold the idea of their evolving into
more advanced forms such as partnership or accession.

This new Alliance, the communiqué goes on to state, must be
larger, more flexible and able to undertake new missions such as
conflict prevention and engaging actively in crisis management,
including crisis-response operations.

One of the most noteworthy decisions adopted is that of devel

oping the European Security and Defence Identity within the
Alliance. Mention should also be made of the allies’ reaffirmation
of their promise to take in all European states wishing to join and
meet certain conditions, and to intensify relations with the member
states of the Partnership for Peace initiatives, the Euro-Atlantic
Partnership Council and the Mediterranean Dialogue.

As regards the Mediterranean, it should be stressed that Spain,
as explained in the following chapter on the Spanish strategic conception, has promoted the idea of the need to boost relations with
the countries in this area.

**_The 1999 Strategic Concept_**

The Alliance’s Strategic Concept is undoubtedly the main result
of the aforementioned Washington Summit. It defines the
Alliance’s purposes on the basis of the aims set forth in the Washington Treaty and shapes them into specific missions or tasks.

The main purpose of the Alliance continues to be to safeguard,
by political and military means, the freedom and security of all its
members, which can be endangered by crises or armed conflict
affecting the Euro-Atlantic area. It is therefore necessary to contribute to the expansion of peace and stability in this area.

CHAPTER II: THE WESTERN RESPONSE TO THE STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT

It is important to stress that the Atlantic Alliance does not consider itself to be any country’s adversary and expressly states this.
Indeed, half a century after it was founded, the Alliance continues
to strive to settle political differences using peaceful means, by promoting friendly international relations and backing democratic
institutions as set out in the Charter of the United Nations. It thus
acknowledges the primary responsibility of the Security Council in
maintaining international peace and security and, as such, the crucial role it plays in contributing to security and stability in the EuroAtlantic area.

In accordance with these premises, in order to achieve its essential purpose, the Alliance continues to perform its traditional security, consultation, deterrence and defence tasks.

Security is one of the indispensable pillars of a stable EuroAtlantic environment, based on the growth of democratic institutions and commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes—an
environment in which no country would be able to intimidate or
coerce any other through the threat or use of force.

Consultation, as provided for in Article 4 of the Washington
Treaty, serves as an essential transatlantic forum for addressing any
issues that affect allies’ vital interests, including possible developments posing risks to members’ security, and for appropriate coordination of their efforts in fields of common interest.

Deterrence and defence tasks are the core of solidarity between
NATO members. If necessary, this solidarity would go as far as collective defence against any threat of aggression against any NATO
member State, as laid down clearly in Articles 5 and 6 of the Washington Treaty.

The truly novel feature of the new strategic concept lies in the
fact that it incorporates the idea of promoting security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area. This explains why the essential tasks
include activities such as dialogue, co-operation and partnership
with other countries in the region, in order to increase transparency, mutual confidence and the capacity for joint action with the
Alliance. They also include crisis management in order to contribute effectively, case by case and by consensus, to conflict pre

strategic mobility,
possibilities of self-protection and maintenance of prolonged
efforts, and their command, control and intelligence capabilities.
Modernisation and interoperability are regarded as crucial requirements, particularly in order to strengthen the European pillar of the
Alliance.

**_The European Security and Defence Identity_**
**_within NATO_**

One of the key issues addressed at the Washington Summit was
to give impetus to the European Security and Defence Identity. This
initiative, which stems from decisions adopted at Berlin in 1996,
will continue to be developed within NATO and will require close
co-operation between the Alliance, the Western European Union
and, when appropriate, the European Union.

undoubtedly marked an important step. Shortly afterwards, at the
European Council meeting held in Cologne, the baton was handed
to the European Union and the heads of state and government of
the member states agreed to provide the Union with capabilities for
undertaking conflict-prevention and crisis-management operations. They also adopted a series of agreements that range from
improving decision-making processes to the necessary modernisation of the Armed Forces.

NATO has begun internal reflections to enable the decisions
adopted at Washington to be implemented. The European Union,
for its part, has taken the first steps towards incorporating a
defence dimension into its structure. The two processes must keep
in step with each other in order to prevent the differences in the
nature of the two organisations from giving rise to processes that
are parallel but progress at a different pace. The establishment of
direct links between the Atlantic Alliance and the European Union
will no doubt help solve this problem and, at the same time, foster
transparency between the two organisations.

**_The challenge of enlargement_**

At the Washington Summit, the first in which the three new
allies invited to join at the Madrid Summit took part, the Alliance
expressed its commitment to continue to take in new members
wishing to promote the principles of the treaty and able to contribute to the peace and security of the Euro-Atlantic area. This
commitment to enlargement is part of a strategy designed to boost
stability and work alongside our partners to build a full and free
Europe.

To this end, the Membership Action Plan was approved at
Washington. This document is the alliance’s blueprint for addressing the enlargement process. Spanish collaboration in this field has
been focused on providing assistance in drawing up annual programmes for would-be members who have made the relevant
bilateral requests. Spain has thus collaborated with Bulgaria,
Romania and Slovenia in preparing their respective programmes
for 2000.

###### Europe and defence

The Amsterdam Treaty, signed in October 1997, stated the European Union’s wish to secure a presence on the international scene
by implementing “a common foreign and security policy including
the progressive framing of a common defence policy, which might
lead to a common defence”.

The treaty likewise defines the Western European Union as an
integral part of the development of the Union that provides the
Union with access to an operational capability for carrying out
humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of
combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking. These
tasks as a whole are known as the “Petersberg missions”, after the
district of Bonn where they were agreed on 19 June 1992.

The Treaty on European Union expressly grants the member
States great responsibility in defining and implementing the Common Foreign and Security Policy—an intergovernmental policy
which, as such, must be agreed on unanimously. In order to prevent this fact from hindering Community decisions, the member
States agreed at Amsterdam on a mechanism to prevent this: constructive abstention. The Council may adopt actions and common
positions by qualified majority, provided they do not have major

tegrity; strengthening its security and maintaining international peace and security in
accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations; and fostering international co-operation and the development and the consolidation of democracy and the rule of law, as
well as respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.

The inclusion of the Petersberg missions in the Treaty on European Union led to the commencement of activities enabling them to
be implemented. At Amsterdam it was agreed to set up a Policy
Planning and Early Warning Unit and create the figure of a High
Representative for the CFSP.

**_Towards a Common Defence Policy_**

The European Union has been endeavouring for some time now
to overcome the abnormality of an economically buoyant Europe
that nonetheless lacks a security and defence system to underpin its
Common Foreign and Security Policy. As has been repeatedly
stated on many occasions, an economic power like Europe should
have a suitable political presence which should naturally be backed
by the military structures and military capabilities needed to
decide and act effectively in conflict prevention and crisis management within the framework of the Petersberg missions.

CHAPTER II: THE WESTERN RESPONSE TO THE STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT

The first step in this direction was taken in autumn 1998 in the
Franco-British Saint Malo declaration on European defence, which
had the virtue of rekindling expectations in this field. For its part,
the Vienna European Council held in October 1998 asked the Western European Union to embark on a process of reflection to assess
its resources and structures, identify shortcomings and analyse the
ways of remedying them. It considered that in order for the European Union to fully perform its role on the international scene, the
CFSP must be backed by creditworthy operational resources.

In June 1999 in Cologne, the European Council subsequently
announced its decision to begin a new stage in the building of the
European Union and expressed its intention to furnish the means
and resources needed to assume its responsibilities with respect to
a common European security and defence policy.

To this end, at the same Cologne European Council, which, like
the Washington Summit, had the Kosovo conflict as its backdrop,
the EU pledged its commitment to develop more effective European military resources from the existing ones. It also acknowledged the need for a sustained defence effort and the need to
enhance strategic reconnaissance and transport capabilities and the
command and control systems.

The interdependence of the European Union and NATO was
also recognised at Cologne and, in this connection, it was stated that
“a more effective role for the European Union in conflict prevention
and crisis management will contribute to the vitality of a renewed
Alliance”. In performing this task, the European Union undertakes
to hold consultations with NATO in a framework of co-operation
and transparency. The EU also affirmed that the Atlantic Alliance
continues to be the mainstay of its members’ collective defence.

The task of defending Europe will thus continue to rest with
NATO and, as a result, the development of the European Security
and Defence Identity will require the European allies to take on
greater responsibilities and become more involved in the common
allied effort. In other words, it will call for Europe to commit itself
more firmly to its own defence.

On the basis of the guidelines established at Cologne, the heads
of state and government of the European Union at their Helsinki

meeting in December 1999 agreed to define the necessary consultative, political and military bodies and structures and the size of the
force the Union requires to be able to perform the full range of
Petersberg missions, and the date by which this force should
become operational.

In order to facilitate decision making and to exercise political
control and strategic management of the operations, Helsinki provides for the future creation of new bodies and structures: a Brussels-based standing Political and Security Committee; a Military
Committee made up of the chiefs of defence represented by their
military delegates; and a Military Staff, which will provide the
essential military expertise.

Another important decision the EU took at Helsinki involved
undertaking to create a force consisting of between 50,000 and
60,000 persons to carry out Petersberg missions. This force must be
available by 2003, capable of deploying within sixty days and
remaining in the theatre of operations for at least a year.

But above and beyond all forecasts, an effective defence requires
developing the relevant military capabilities. This involves greater
co-operation between the European defence industries, harmonising national military requirements with respect to arms and stan

**_Institutional interaction between the European Union_**
**_and the Atlantic Alliance_**

The integration of the Western European Union into the European Union and the establishment of a common defence are both
ambitious goals, which will only be achieved through a lengthy
process that is not without its pitfalls. On the one hand, defending
Europe is inseparable from defending the West as a whole, and for
decades this has rested on Atlantic solidarity in the form of NATO.
On the other, the compulsory task of building a united Europe
requires the European Union to take in countries with different perceptions of security, including some that have traditionally upheld
neutral stances.

The Atlantic Alliance continues to be the cornerstone of its
members’ collective defence and the commitments deriving from
Article 5 of the Washington Treaty must therefore be honoured. The
same is true of the commitments arising from Article V of the
amended Brussels Treaty, although the Western European Union is
to be integrated into the European Union.

CHAPTER II: THE WESTERN RESPONSE TO THE STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT

For any type of operation other than collective defence, the
European Union’s role is merely to acknowledge that certain crises
which affect Europe directly can be managed under European
political leadership. This autonomous decision-making and management capability calls for a permanent organisation, avoiding in
any event unnecessary duplication with the Atlantic Alliance structure. The possibility of using the same forces for different operations led by one organisation or the other under the concept of
“separable but not separate” continues to be important in this new
situation in relations as defined at the Washington, Cologne and
Helsinki summits. This does not exclude the possibility that all the
members of the Union—irrespective of whether they belong to
NATO or the Western European Union—can take part fully in
operations should they wish.

It will furthermore be necessary to establish satisfactory agreements between NATO and the European Union on the basis of
existing mechanisms with the WEU to ensure the greatest possible
involvement in these operations of the European allies who are not
members of the European Union.

##### CHAPTER III

### SPANISH DEFENCE POLICY

The peace, freedom, prosperity and stability that Spain currently enjoys, its level of political, human, cultural and economic development and the degree of tolerance our society has achieved, the
establishment of an advanced democracy and the protection that
the Constitution guarantees to all Spaniards and peoples of Spain
in the exercise of human rights, their cultures and traditions, languages and institutions are values that have not arisen spontaneously. They have been achieved through the effort of previous
generations and it is our duty to preserve them and hand them
down to our successors. The task of defence is none other than to
help guarantee these values and protect our way of life, goods and
interests, wherever they lie.

As stated in the Preamble to the Guidance on National Defence
1/96 signed by the President of the Government on 20 December
1996, Spain, convinced that our security is closely linked to that of
the neighbouring countries and others in areas of strategic interest,
is today fully committed to achieving a more stable and secure
international order based on peaceful co-existence, the upholding

As part of its concept of security, and in keeping with its role of

As part of its concept of security, and in keeping with its role of
medium-sized power, Spain has drawn up a Defence Policy conditioned by the need to reconcile what is desirable with what is possible. This policy is aimed at achieving a number of ends—national interests—using a set of means, specifically national resources
and the mutual defence commitments to our partners and allies,
whose security is inseparable from our own.

Defence Policy is thus closely linked to Foreign Policy. It can be
said that these two policy areas account for much of the State’s
external action aimed at realising our aspirations as a nation and
protecting our interests. This overall idea of State action stems from
Spain’s strategic conception, which is the cornerstone of our
Defence Policy.

###### The Spanish strategic conception

The Spanish strategic conception, which is the framework for
external action and the defence of national interests, represents our
global understanding of our role in the world, how we assert ourselves as a nation in the international arena and define our vocation


Page 56 Defence White Paper

CHAPTER III: SPANISH DEFENCE POLICY

on the basis of geographical factors, historical reasons, political
reality and projects for the future.

Spain’s supportive and active approach to defence and security issues is characterised by the endeavour to establish peaceful relations
and effective co-operation between all the peoples on Earth, as laid
down in the Preamble to our Constitution. Therefore, Spain, which as
a matter of principle does not identify any country as an enemy, expressly renounces the use of force as a means of settling any political
differences, gives priority to diplomacy over military solutions in resolving the crises in which it could be involved, and expresses its firm
will to defend its legitimate interests wherever they lie.

Although Spain’s strategic conception is described in detail
throughout the White Paper, it seems appropriate to outline some
of the main points to enable the reader to focus on the different
aspects of Defence Policy from a global perspective.

**_The universalistic perception of Spain’s world presence_**

First, our geopolitical position in the current strategic environment characterised by the world-wide phenomenon of globalisation undeniably gives a universalistic slant to the perception—and
accordingly the protection—of our interests, to our presence in the
world and to our international co-operation efforts in support of
peace and stability.

Nonetheless, Spain has, in the past, had a greater presence and
influence in three geopolitical areas: Europe, the Mediterranean
and the Atlantic, which continue to be of particular importance to
Spanish external action. Since the 16[th] century, the European axis
projected Spanish power, culture and influence to the very heart of
Europe through Flanders. The Mediterranean axis stretched eastwards in the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, which were extensions
of Spain, while the Atlantic axis linked Spain to the New World as
far as the Philippines, at the gateway to the East.

**_Protecting Spanish interests_**

Second, although an obvious point, it should be stressed that
Spain, like any nation, has its own national interests—intangible

CHAPTER III: SPANISH DEFENCE POLICY

values and assets that comprise its basic aspirations in the international order and are the cornerstone of the wellbeing and prosperity of Spanish people.

Some of these national interests are particularly significant and,
should the need arise, safeguarding them warrants a defence effort.
These are the national security interests, which are the ends that
Defence Policy must achieve. They are always defined broadly and
generically, as it is not possible to foresee a priori all the possible
scenarios that could arise.

**_Shared security and collective defence_**

Third, it should be stressed that national security and defence
are based on the combination of two factors. The first of these is the
nation’s own defence capability, which serves the twofold purpose
of a genuinely national deterrent, always necessary in an unstable
strategic environment, and a contribution to Spain’s importance by
providing forces to the European and allied defence organisations.
The second factor is shared security and collective defence, which
stem from the solidarity and cohesion between Spain and its partners and allies.

This pooling of efforts springs from the conviction that all partners and allies uphold the same principles and values and the same

addressed from a
supranational viewpoint, as today it is difficult to conceive of a risk in our environment
that does not affect all the allied nations to some extent or arouse
active solidarity, as the experience of recent conflicts has shown.

The multinational option of collective defence that Spain has
adopted marks a Copernican revolution in our traditional
approach to defence and the end of a chapter of history characterised by isolation and autarky, and confirms our full membership
of the western community.

Spain fully shares the main guiding principle of the Atlantic
Alliance: “of common commitment and mutual co-operation
among sovereign states in support of the indivisibility of security
for all of its members”. Therefore, no single Ally is forced to rely
“upon its own national efforts alone in dealing with basic security
challenges.” Thus, without interfering in any way with states’ right
and duty to assume their sovereign responsibilities in defence matters, the Alliance “enables them through collective effort to realise
their essential national security objectives”.

Following the decisions of the Washington and Cologne Summits, Spain, together with other European Union countries, and
loyal to its international commitments, firmly promotes the development of the European Security and Defence Identity within the
Alliance and the progressive development of a Common Defence

CHAPTER III: SPANISH DEFENCE POLICY

Policy for Europe. Congress in full session on 23 June 1999 pledged
its political support to this initiative, urging the Executive to give
impetus to the decisions adopted at the aforementioned summits.

The synergy between our own defence capability and the added
security that comes from belonging to the system of alliances thus
guarantees our security interests in the best possible way with a reasonable effort, as a result of the interaction of our Armed Forces’ capability and Spain’s active participation in the Atlantic Alliance and the
Common European Security and Defence Policy. The means Spain has
at its disposal to achieve its security aims through Defence Policy are
thus its own national resources, shared security and collective defence.

**_The Armed Forces, a guarantee of security_**
**_and the cornerstone of defence_**

Finally, the Armed Forces must be ready to defend national
security interests under the direction of the Government, as provided in the Spanish Constitution. Performance of this task in the
framework of collective defence, which is also an instrument of our
security, is most likely to entail the participation of the Armed
Forces in multinational actions.

The tasks the Armed Forces are required to perform range from
habitual presence in areas over which Spain has sovereignty and
those in which it has an interest, to the possible use of force as a
military instrument to settle a conflict, including all the options that
the Government could decide on with regard to managing and
steering any crisis situation. In order to carry out such tasks, there
is a need, above all, for the Armed Forces to be better equipped.
The effectiveness of our forces will be based on the quality of their
human and technological resources rather than on size, as operational effectiveness takes priority over size of the force.

**_The defensive nature of military strategy_**

In consonance with the Spanish strategic conception, and within
the framework of the allied strategy, our military strategy is purely
defensive and based on deterrence, prevention and, should the need
arise, a military response. The aim is primarily to prevent conflicts
from emerging; second, to deal with them when and where they
first arise; or, as a last resort, muster a military response if required.

CHAPTER III: SPANISH DEFENCE POLICY

_Troops from the Spanish-Italian amphibious brigade fall in alongside the Príncipe de_
Asturias during the ceremony to activate the SIAF.

A military response to an external aggression is a maximum priority requirement of national policy and a firm commitment to the
Atlantic Alliance towards mutual assistance pursuant to Article 5
of the Washington Treaty. Although it should be pointed out that it
is unlikely in the foreseeable medium-term strategic environment
that the risks to the stability of the international situation would
lead to situations in which such aggressions could occur, we should
not forget that this depends, in turn, on the deterrence provided by
a suitable defence capability.

In the new 21[st]-century strategic environment described earlier
on, an analysis of the risks which threaten the international situation or could affect our security leads us to think that, in the foreseeable future, the Armed Forces will mainly engage in deterrence
and the maintenance and expansion of stability, both in our immediate geographical area and in the broader Euro-Atlantic area. It is
to be hoped that, if conflicts arise, they will be limited in nature, as
it is unlikely that developments in the international situation will
require collective defence against a widespread attack.

The Armed Forces are also a necessary instrument for the maintenance of international stability. This new field includes different
attitudes that represent their contribution to, and support for, for

eign and security policy. Arms control, with the related verification
measures, and the fostering of mutual confidence with other countries, including exchanges between military staff and unit visits, is
today a meaningful instrument at the service of peace and must be
given the proper attention and be suitably valued and systemised.

The use of the Armed Forces to support the State’s external
action expresses with facts the commitment to contributing to a
more just and secure international order and backing respect for
international law and human rights throughout the world. By acting in this way they contribute directly and indirectly to protecting
Spain’s security interests. Directly, because our interests will
always be better served in a world situation free from sources of
conflict, and indirectly, because a Spain that is committed to maintaining international stability can assert its influence in any other
field, economic, cultural or social, in which its interests are focused.

Spain has always maintained—and this was expressed by the
Government in Congress on 6 October 1998—that “any international use of force must, in normal circumstances and with the exception
of legitimate defence situations, previously be authorised by the
United Nations Security Council”. Nevertheless, in pressing circumstances, when large-scale human disasters have occurred or are
imminent, the blocking of the Security Council, the exhaustion of all
diplomatic channels and continued failure to abide by its Resolutions should not hinder the international community’s determination to avert human tragedies. On such occasions, Spain could consider the appropriateness of using force, through consensus or a
general agreement with the other partners and allies of the international security and defence organisations to which we belong.

###### Significant geopolitical areas

As mentioned earlier, throughout the History of Spain, the
country’s influence has spread along three different axes—Europe,
the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.

These three axes have passed the test of time and survive today,
albeit adapted to a reality that has evolved over the centuries. What
was, in the past, an axis for projecting Spanish power has today
become what can be called “vocation”, that is, the political will to be

present in a certain sphere, for its influence to be acknowledged and
its opinion appreciated and taken into account in decision making.

In this respect, today’s Spain lives and stems from this triple
European, Mediterranean and Atlantic vocation that has marked
the course of its history and its commitments.

**_European vocation_**

Europe is not just a geographical concept, but also a historical,
social and cultural identity. Europe has been the cradle of the western civilisation and the transmitter and promoter of the values that
underpin western civilisation today. Throughout its History, Spain
as a nation has taken an active part in defining and shaping
Europe. Just as any identity cannot be divided or any of its parts
separated if it is to maintain its ethos intact, so is Europe inconceivable without Spain, and Spain without Europe.

In the wake of the two world wars, the need to create a Europe
that could achieve political unity after economic reconstruction arose
from the wish to establish a permanent peace and progress in the
continent. Spain joined this project—which is today a reality, the
European Union—in 1986, convinced that the member nations share
a series of interests based on the defence of democracy, the protection
of common values and respect for individuals and for human rights.

_Spain has thus_
_given impetus to_
_the European_
_Union’s relations_
_with what are its_
_two other_
_vocations: the_
_Ibero-American_
_world and the_
_Mediterranean_
_area._

_The main thrust of_
_the security and_
_defence system_
_that Spain_
_supports and_
_advocates is the_
_NATO-European_
_Union axis_


The European Union has been the driving force behind change
and progress, not only in the economic sphere but also in political
and social matters. This has required Spain to rise to the challenges
of economic convergence in order to join economic and monetary
union. Our income levels have gradually been brought into line
with the EU average and the weight our country carries in the
international community has increased accordingly.

But while our nation has become progressively more European,
it is equally true that the European community has been turning
increasing attention to our country, as Spain contributes new perspectives that enrich Europe’s viewpoint in its relations with other
communities. Spain has thus given impetus to the European
Union’s relations with what are its two other vocations: the IberAmerican* world and the Mediterranean area.

Spain considers that the European Union as a political entity
should be built in a balanced way on economic, political and security aspects. Today, the European Union is heading rapidly towards
economic and monetary integration and is asserting its presence as
a major economic, financial and trading power. However, the
Union will not make decisive headway in its historic process of
integration unless it develops a common foreign and security policy, together with credible and autonomous security and defence
capabilities in keeping with its citizens aspirations, without prejudice to the commitments some of its members have undertaken
within the Atlantic Alliance.

The experience of shaping a Common Foreign and Security Policy that includes a collective Defence Policy was hitherto unknown,
but the new challenges and Europe’s new geostrategic situation
require imaginative responses that are not anchored to the past.
The Bosnian and Kosovo crises have led us to the conviction that
Europe needs a security and defence system capable of facing up to
the risks that can affect it. The main thrust of the security and
defence system that Spain supports and advocates is the NATOEuropean Union axis.

-  Translator’s note: The Ministry of Defence opted for this term rather than the more
commobly used “Latin American” in order to reflect the Iberian peninsula’s special links
with those countries.

CHAPTER III: SPANISH DEFENCE POLICY

The success of Europe’s defence in the 21[st] century will depend
largely on ensuring transparency, confidence and an appropriate
system of consultations between NATO and the European Union,
and on shaping a sound initial core, preventing duplication. It is
true to say that the European Security and Defence Identity within
the Atlantic Alliance is essential to making this relationship a
reality.

**_Mediterranean vocation_**

Since the Cold War ended, the Mediterranean has come to be
perceived by the European institutions and NATO as a region that
requires greater attention when addressing security issues. This is
true—though for quite different reasons—of both the eastern and
the western Mediterranean basins, both of which exercise considerable influence on world and European stability.

The Mediterranean Sea is of great strategic importance to Spain.
The political initiatives that materialised in the Barcelona Conference (1995) and later in the Malta meeting (1997) served to make
the allies realise that the economic, political and social problems
affecting both shores of this sea are a common challenge that
requires a general and co-ordinated approach, since Spain considers that the essential aspect of the Mediterranean area is not risk
but the unavoidable need for co-operation.

Within the geostrategic unity of the Mediterranean, where problems and tensions spread easily, Spain considers that its western
basin requires much attention as a nearby area with specific characteristics. Events occurring in this geographical area do not fail to
interest us.

As an area of relations between neighbouring peoples and of
historical conflicts, the Mediterranean reflects the economic, demographic and cultural tensions that emerge in the environment.

In order to maintain and bolster stability in this area, shared
political solutions are required from the countries on both shores,
based on co-operation and a flow of investments capable of mobilising local economic agents and committing them to their own
development.

CHAPTER III: SPANISH DEFENCE POLICY

Spain shares and encourages the allies’ growing attention
towards what was traditionally known as the “southern flank”. It
likewise offers its possibilities and experience in an area that it
knows well and with which it has traditionally been bound by firm
ties of friendship, with the exclusive aim of maintaining stability
and security to the advantage of all the countries in the area.

Spain’s ongoing efforts are centred on ensuring that this security continues to be a common interest shared by all the countries in
the Mediterranean area. Indeed, this is the message contained in its
prominent role in the Southern Region of the Atlantic Alliance and
its participation in the European multinational forces and the initiatives of the Mediterranean Dialogue, as instruments that contribute to stability in an area of common interest.

**_Atlantic vocation_**

Spain’s ties with the countries on the other side of the Atlantic
are a constant historical feature that the passage of time has corroborated. Relations with the two different geographical areas of
this continent, Ibero-America and North America, obviously have
specific characteristics, but both are of interest to Spain.

Closely linked to the Ibero-American nations by shared traditions, culture and, especially, a common language, Spain is not
unaware of the interest this subcontinent arouses nowadays.
Indeed, taking advantage of the closeness that stems from these
historical ties, Spain is striving to strengthen the subcontinent’s
relations with Europe.

Page 66 Defence White Paper

CHAPTER III: SPANISH DEFENCE POLICY

As a natural bridge between the two sides of the Atlantic, our
country feels committed to the economic and social challenges
Ibero-America faces and makes a great effort in the field of cooperation. This is evidenced by the fact that Spain’s presence in this
continent, in the form of growing activity in the economic, technological and industrial fields, has become extremely important in
recent years, and this has given substance to its relations, which for
some time had been characterised chiefly by rhetoric.

Convinced that the model of integration that Europe is attempting to follow is the best formula for generating and maintaining
development, Spain is encouraging the Ibero-American countries
to continue along the path towards integration on which they have
already started out. In the bilateral sphere, Spain is open to each
and every one of the Ibero-American nations on the basis of loyal
co-operation and willingness to lend support. Complex problems,
such as combating natural disasters, drug trafficking, organised
crime and environmental deterioration, deserve Spain’s sympathies and a co-operative attitude as far as our possibilities allow. A
noteworthy effort is being made to step up political and economic
collaboration and there are well-grounded hopes of being able to
increase this in the future.

As regards security, given the importance it attaches to peaceful
relations with all peoples, Spain is particularly sensitive to any
process of building and maintaining peace in the Ibero-American
area. Our experience in incorporating new missions for the Armed
Forces, adding stability, peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance
tasks to the traditional ones of guaranteeing security and national
sovereignty, provides valuable lessons that Spain currently shares
with the Ibero-American countries.

The bilateral relations established between Spain and the United
States in 1953 marked the beginning of Spain’s opening up to the outside world. Since then, relations between Spain and the United States
in the fields of politics, trade, culture, defence and security have
become increasingly consolidated and normalised through different
political circumstances. These bilateral relations with the country that
is a world benchmark and plays a prominent role in all major international decisions are accorded the significance they deserve.

country as a support in international relations, it is nowadays focused on co-operation between two sovereign nations in defence
matters and is a singularly important instrument in bilateral relations between both countries.

###### National security interests

Protecting national security interests is an important responsibility of the Government. The policy decision to identify a national
security interest in a given situation and the assessment of its
importance in relation to other interests will gauge the effort that
needs to be made to safeguard it, and will form the basis of the
courses of action established for this purpose.

As explained in the following paragraphs, national security
interests can, roughly speaking, be grouped into two categories:
vital and strategic.

The Government’s freedom of action to decide on the most
appropriate strategic course of action to protect each of our security
interests makes it advisable not to classify them in advance into
either of the aforementioned categories beyond the obvious, as this
would be tantamount to trying to pre-establish the response.

**_Vital interests_**

Vital interests are those which Spain is prepared to protect and,
if necessary, defend in the face of any risk or threat, as they affect its

survival as a nation. Defending them is therefore an unavoidable
duty and requires any other interest to be subordinated thereto.

Vital interests are, in fact, the elements that make up the State
and, as such, must be preserved from any aggression: the mainland
and islands, with their air and sea ports, populations, constitutional order, sovereignty and independence.

**_Strategic interests_**

Strategic interests are those which provide security to our environment and whose protection contributes decisively to the
defence of vital interests. Those deriving from Spain’s geographical
location and condition of maritime nation are particularly important and, owing to their significance and permanence, special attention is paid to them in our Foreign Policy.

Since Spain’s territory includes extrapeninsular territories, the
exercise of sovereignty depends on ensuring the free use of the sea
and air links between the different parts of the territory.

Spain advocates the idea of achieving a more integrated and stable Europe. It shares this interest with its partners and allies and
extends it to the Euro-Atlantic sphere. For geographical reasons,
Spain has a special interest in nearby Northern Africa, which, with

up the broad Euro-Atlantic region of which Spain is part. The strategic
interests of the nations belonging to the western community, which
depend on trade, and particularly those of Spain, coincide in this point.


In this connection, a nation like Spain, formed as an advanced
democracy with an economy heavily dependent on other countries
for energy resources and commodities, has a set of interests which
largely go beyond defending its territory and sovereignty. Spain
needs to ensure its supply of basic resources to maintain the wellbeing of its people and foster their prosperity. Any act of force that
endangers this supply, with the risk of economic collapse, constitutes a threat that would have to be countered.

CHAPTER III: SPANISH DEFENCE POLICY

_Army pontooneers in Nicaragua after Hurricane Mitch._

**_Other national interests_**

Linked to national security interests, Spain has other different
kinds of interests that stem from its position in the international
community, its sense of solidarity, its contribution to the cause of
peace and freedom, and its relations with the nations of its historical and cultural community.

Although these interests are not a priority aim of the defence
effort as they are not closely related to Spain’s security, neither are
they unconnected, as they are present in the State’s external action
and can occasionally require the action of Armed Forces units or
military personnel. Humanitarian assistance missions and participation in certain peace missions in remote regions can be motivated by these interests.

In particular, as yet another manifestation of its IberoAmerican vocation in the spirit of co-operation that characterises
relations with these sister countries, Spain also promotes collaboration with the countries of the region in security and defence
matters.

###### Objectives and basic courses of action of Defence Policy

Spain’s Defence Policy springs from the definition of objectives
and the establishment of basic courses of action to achieve them.

Spain faces the challenges of the future with a Defence Policy,
which, according to the aforementioned Guidance on National
Defence 1/96, is designed to achieve three basic objectives:

- To consolidate Spain’s presence in international security and
defence organisations, fully assuming the responsibilities and
commitments deriving from its membership.

- To improve the effectiveness of the Spanish Armed Forces in
order to ensure they are fully capable of performing the missions entrusted to them by the Constitution; in order to contribute, as far as national possibilities allow, to collective security and defence with the allies; and so as to collaborate in the
maintenance of international peace and stability, particularly
in our geographical and cultural environment.

- To make Spanish society understand, support and take a
greater part in the task of maintaining a defence mechanism
that is tailored to our needs and responsibilities and to
Spain’s strategic interests.

**_Basic courses of action_**

The Guidance on National Defence also contains a set of guidelines
for developing Defence Policy by means of the following basic
courses of action:

_Regarding the consolidation of Spanish presence in international secu-_
_rity and defence organisations:_

-  To contribute to defining a common European Security and
Defence Policy within the European Union.

-  To contribute to collective defence through full membership
of the Atlantic Alliance and, within it, to support the European Security and Defence Identity on the principle of preventing the unnecessary duplication of effort.

-  To take part in the European multinational forces which are set
up to carry out Petersberg-type operations and are available to
NATO.

-  To foster dialogue and co-operation as the most appropriate
measures for guaranteeing international stability, with particular emphasis on the Mediterranean Dialogue.

-  To support and take part in initiatives aimed at maintaining
world peace and stability promoted by, and carried out under
the aegis of, the United Nations.

_A Harrier aircraft takes off from the deck of the Príncipe de Asturias._

-  To take an active part in the implementation of the confidence- and security-building measures promoted by the
Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.

-  To back disarmament initiatives, which are the cornerstones
of European security, and to support the prevention of the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means
to launch them.

-  To achieve harmonisation of our special relationship with the
United States, as laid down in the current agreement on
Defence co-operation, with our new situation in the Atlantic
Alliance.

-  To give impetus to bilateral and multilateral relations with
the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean region and the Ibero-American and other nations with
which we are bound by historic ties.

_Regarding the upgrading of the Armed Forces:_

-  To complete the professionalisation of servicemen by 31
December 2002.

-  To continue with the modernisation process, providing the
Armed Forces with the materiel they need to be fully efficient, in line with the trends dictated by the strategic environment.

CHAPTER III: SPANISH DEFENCE POLICY

-  To carry out a thorough revision of the current structures,
applying criteria of agility, flexibility, functionality and optimum use of the resources available.

_Regarding Spanish society:_

-  To convey to Spanish society the need to invest in Defence, as
there is no alternative to this public asset.

-  To arouse the public’s interest in defence issues, raising as far
as possible their level of information and always applying
criteria of maximum transparency.

-  To encourage Spanish society to identify with the effort being
made in defence, with the conviction that the work carried
out is heading in the right direction.

###### Present and future of Defence Policy

Over the course of the 6[th] parliamentary term, during which the
aforementioned Guidance on National Defence was enacted, we
have witnessed a series of specific decisions and events that are
milestones in achieving the objectives set out in the Guidance.

At the NATO summit held in Madrid in 1997, Spain announced
to the allies its decision to join the new military structure, which

CHAPTER III: SPANISH DEFENCE POLICY

became effective two years later. The opening of the Headquarters
of the Joint Sub-regional Command Southwest in Madrid and
Spain’s role at the Washington Summit as a member with full rights
and duties, show that the first goal of our current Defence Policy
has been achieved.

With respect to the professionalisation and modernisation
processes designed to boost the potential of our Armed Forces, the
related actions were set in motion after the initiatives were given
the appropriate parliamentary backing and the decisions adopted
announced to our allies. These actions will be described in detail in
the respective chapters. In short, professionalisation is progressing
at a steady pace and will be completed according to schedule,
while the necessary investments in technology to modernise arms
and materiel will enable the planned weapons systems to be
obtained within the timeframe.

The effort to foster a defence culture within Spanish society has
been outstanding. Although it is a goal that will only be achieved
in the long term, it should be stressed that significant headway has
been made in recent years as a result of the initiatives and work carried out in this field. Among others, mention should be made of the
sociological studies and research projects aimed at ascertaining the
parameters and motivation that determine society’s degree of interest in defence.

Co-operation relations have been fostered and a varied range of
activities have been carried out in connection with defence, peace
and security issues, and collaboration and activities with Spanish
universities and research centres have been stepped up.

While a lot has been achieved, just as much remains to be done.
In 1999 the Atlantic Alliance and the European Union began to
adapt their defence structures, including military capabilities, to
the new strategic environment. For our part, the Government is
shaping the Armed Forces of the 21[st] century with structures, doctrines, human and material resources that provide the essential military capabilities needed to carry out the missions that will foreseeably be required of them in this new period that is now dawning.

In short, our Defence Policy enables Spain to play an increasingly active role in maintaining peace and stability in the Euro

Atlantic region, in close collaboration with our partners and allies.
It guarantees, should the need arise, the safety of our national security interests, maintains a firm commitment of collective defence to
the Atlantic Alliance and backs the European Union’s Common
Foreign and Security Policy in order to achieve new goals on the
road mapped out in the Amsterdam Treaty and the 1999 Cologne
and Helsinki Summits.

Spain is furthermore bound by solid bilateral ties of cooperation with the United States, which complement both nations’
multilateral relations within the Atlantic Alliance.

Defence Policy, in addition to meeting national security interests, is therefore in keeping with the requirements of our membership of the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance, with our
responsibility in maintaining stability in the Euro-Atlantic region
and with our growing presence in the international arena.

##### CHAPTER IV

### ARMED FORCES FOR THE 21[ST] CENTURY

The Armed Forces are the specific instrument of defence and the
ultimate guarantee of our security. This is their true raison d’être
and requires them to adapt continually to the times and upgrade
their capabilities in order to be fully effective in preventing and
managing crises and, should the need arise, in any future conflicts
that could erupt. The determination to overhaul our forces is
therefore one of the primary objectives described in the previous
pages and constitutes a core element of defence policy. Armed
Forces for the 21[st] century. That is the goal.

When laying the foundations for future effectiveness, we
need to consider our Armed Forces within their frame of reference, that is, in a highly developed society, one of the consolidated and prosperous democracies that make up the core of
Euro-Atlantic security, as a member of NATO and the European
Union.

In order to perform their missions effectively, the Armed Forces

ational scenarios, including high-intensity combat, if required at
any time.

In such a scenario dominated by information technology and
communications, long-range and high-precision weapons and the
requirements of strategic mobility, joint action is essential. The Army,
the Navy and the Air Force will contribute forces with specific capabilities, irreplaceable as regards their respective operational possibilities, but conceived to contribute jointly to a single effort.

This chapter describes Spanish military strategy, which is
designed to channel the action of the armed services, their missions
and tasks, and the size, characteristics, operational capabilities,
level of training and availability they require.

###### Military strategy

Our military strategy is characterised by the idea of anticipating
conflicts through a combination of deterrence and prevention or, if
the conflict erupts, being able to muster a decisive and suitably proportioned response in order to achieve the strategic objectives,
keeping undesired effects to a minimum.

The purpose of deterrence is to ward off a possible attack on
national interests through the threat of inflicting unacceptable
damage on the potential aggressor. The power of deterrence is
based on credibility—which stems from the size, preparation and
availability of a country’s military force—and on the firm will to
use it if necessary. As a guarantee of Spain’s vital needs in any scenario, military strategy as a matter of principle maintains an appropriate conventional deterrent capability.

In the field of prevention, in the sense of an active contribution
to maintaining peace and stability, the Armed Forces are the specific instrument of defence diplomacy. This term covers different
co-operation measures designed to foster confidence between
nations, dialogue and mutual knowledge, the verification of arms
control measures and mutual transparency in military activities.

Crisis management, which is the right combination of
prevention and response, enables all measures relating to

deployment, presence and demonstration of force to be controlled
accurately, thereby ensuring a response that is totally in keeping
with the political intention, preventing escalation and leaving the
option open of reaching a compromise with the opponent.

The policy decision to make use of force triggers the military
response through the application of military capabilities, in
support of, or in conjunction with, other political, economic,
diplomatic measures or of whatever other kind is appropriate.

The Armed Forces act according to a broad concept of
manoeuvre based on obtaining, maintaining and exploiting
initiative. It is therefore necessary to have forces that are
permanently available and ready for action, as well as suitable
plans and resources to move them to the field of operations, deploy
them once there and engage them in combat to the extent required
in order to fulfil the mission.

As conflicts are foreseeable, a modern military operation cannot
be conceived without integrating the specific military capabilities
of the ground, naval and air forces from the early stages of
conception and planning. The Armed Forces nowadays are
frequently required to act within the framework of multinational
operations and in collaboration with other governmental and nongovernmental organisations.

country carries on its normal activities. The Armed Forces
focus their attention on training and serve as an instrument of
the State’s external action. The most important missions they
perform are deterrence and conflict prevention through
defence diplomacy tasks. Other characteristic peacetime
activities of the Armed Forces are ensuring an effective presence in the areas over which Spain has sovereignty and regular surveillance.

encompass a broad spectrum of activities ranging from
humanitarian assistance to peacemaking, constitute an

CHAPTER IV: ARMED FORCES FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

important scenario when it comes to identifying possible missions of the Armed Forces. Spain has played an active role in
many of the operations of this kind carried out in the past
decade. It is nevertheless important to stress that these missions, which have special characteristics, do not in themselves determine the capabilities of military forces.

-  Crisis management. A crisis situation emerges when dialogue
and co-operation between nations are unable to prevent the
rupture of international stability. Crisis management operations
are, by nature, varied and unpredictable. Evacuating civilians
caught unawares in a conflict zone, deploying forces as a result
of a particular policy decision or carrying out an embargo by
sea, air or land are just some of the situations that need to be
addressed in very different ways. The size and nature of these
operations therefore vary considerably and, should the need
arise, require force to be applied swiftly and flexibly. This
entails keeping in control of the situation, in order both to prevent the crisis from escalating into a conflict and to take the
appropriate de-escalation measures when the time comes.

-  Limited armed conflict. Spain could find itself in the situation of
having to defend its security interests by intervening in a limited conflict together with its partners and allies or, possibly, at
a purely national level. In view of the foregoing and the fact
that such a situation entails a commitment for our defence,
limited armed conflict is the scenario that should carry the
greatest weight when planning a realistic design of our Armed
Forces. NATO and the European Union are the main players
in the Euro-Atlantic region that includes the geostrategic environment of utmost interest to Spain, namely Europe, the Western Mediterranean and the East Atlantic. The size and quality
of the forces Spain makes available for conflicts of this kind
are a permanent indication of its determination to defend
national interests and contribute to the allied effort.

-  Widespread armed conflict. Defending NATO members from a
widespread attack is the most demanding commitment of
allied solidarity: to protect peace and guarantee the territorial integrity, political independence and security of the member States. While such a scenario is unlikely to arise, it cannot

be ruled out altogether, and the need for our Armed Forces to
contribute to the common effort must accordingly be envisaged. Therefore, bearing in mind that a situation of this kind
would probably arise with considerable warning and not by
surprise, there will be plans for mustering additional forces
and procuring extraordinary resources for defence.

The missions of the Armed Forces in the scenarios listed above
can thus be summed as follows: one, to prevent aggression of any
kind and, if necessary, respond to it; two, to participate fully with the
allies in collective security and defence, to the extent that national
possibilities allow; and three, to make a military contribution to the
maintenance of international peace and stability, particularly within
our geographic environment and in the Euro-Atlantic region.

In addition to performing these strictly military missions, the
Armed Forces also co-operate with civilian structures. This aspect is
highlighted in the Alliance’s New Strategic Concept. It is only natural that a military organisation capable of performing large-scale
missions should be able to take part effectively in emergency or disaster situations. Actions of this kind are performed habitually both
domestically and internationally, even in the context of peace operations, to address the problems arising from natural disasters.

In a broad conception of defence and security, the Civil Guard,

ment capability, is able to contribute significantly to defence, particularly in conflict-prevention and crisis-management missions
where the need to protect the population in the area of operations
is increasingly evident. Integrated into military units, it can perform the role of military police, controlling traffic, protecting and
ensuring the safety of people and premises and public order, or act
as judicial police, among other tasks.

In the same way, we cannot rule out the possibility that the
Armed Forces may be called on to collaborate in the fight against
international terrorism, drug trafficking, organised crime and clandestine immigration by carrying out surveillance or providing
technical support in keeping with their specific capabilities. However, it should be borne in mind that such tasks do not fall strictly
within the scope of defence. Should the Armed Forces be required
to perform them, they will thus do so by supporting the law
enforcement bodies, in accordance with the co-ordination criteria
established by law and in their regulations.

nature of conflicts is not easy to predict. Set courses of action in
response to a defined threat are no longer valid; flexible structures
and procedures are needed to enable the Armed Forces to react
appropriately to any risk situation. Finding the appropriate
response in each case entails, above all, an important change in
mentality in order to develop joint capabilities to project our military potential, so as to ensure the necessary coherence between the
means and the effective performance of the sort of operations that
are more likely to be required in future.

bility, on the other, is particularly relevant to our country owing to
the characteristics of Spain’s territory and geostrategic situation. This
point needs to be taken into account if we are to make the most of the
resources allocated to the Armed Forces over the next new years.

Indeed, the fact that Spain is basically a peninsula with archipelagos in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic and enclaves on the
other side of the Strait of Gibraltar requires a dispersed deployment
of forces and raises special needs of keeping watch on maritime and
air space, as well as requirements relating to the capability of projecting military potential. Furthermore, its eccentric location with
respect to Europe conditions its contribution to the allied effort on
the need to provide our forces with the necessary strategic mobility.

Transport capabilities for the projection of forces are measured
by the volume of resources that can be transported and by the
speed and ease of loading and unloading procedures at logistic terminals. The current means of sea and air transport will need to be
increased in order to deploy forces and sustain this effort. This is a
priority requirement and the means available will therefore be
increased by supplementing this joint service through contracts.

Spain’s international role requires us to make our Defence capabilities compatible with those of our allies. This involves a challenge and makes certain requirements on our Armed Forces:

-  Their size should be in keeping with the relative influence
our country wishes to exercise in the multinational sphere

-  Their quality, as regards training of personnel and equipment
and level of skill, should be comparable to that of our allies’
forces

-  Their structure and increased interoperability will enable
forces to be grouped into formations which can be integrated
into multinational forces as a contribution to the allied effort,
should the need arise

The Atlantic Alliance’s Defence Capabilities Initiative, approved
by the Heads of State and Government at the Washington Summit
in April 1999, is a frame of reference for member States of the
Alliance for developing the military capabilities needed to cover

CHAPTER IV: ARMED FORCES FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

the full range of missions laid down in the new Strategic Concept
and, in particular, to achieve a common operational approach.

This initiative is aimed at ensuring that the allied nations’ forces
are capable of deploying and engaging in combat in an armed conflict in any environment, particularly on lengthy missions in
remote places. Once they have acquired these capabilities, the
forces will also be in a position to act successfully in lower-risk situations such as peace operations.

To this end, five main areas are established in which specific
capabilities must be developed: strategic mobility, effective engagement, sustainability, survivability, and command and control and
intelligence. There is a focus on the need for interoperability, that is,
compatibility between the allied forces with respect to personnel,
technology, materiel and procedures.

Sustaining the activity of forces that are endowed with technically complex equipment which needs to be kept highly efficient
and reliable, operating far from their home bases in a campaign,
requires a huge logistic support effort. Supply, maintenance and
healthcare capabilities and other functions are critical and must be
procured in accordance with criteria of economy and rationalisation of resources, and be co-ordinated from a multinational point of
view in order to meet the needs of the forces as securely and flexibly as possible in any circumstances.

In view of the task the allied nations have set themselves to
ensure their forces meet the requirements of effectiveness demanded by international security in this new century, the size of their
effort will undeniably require the goals to be rigorously programmed, establishing relative priorities, and will need a financial
backing that is as committed as it is realistic.

The military capabilities of the Spanish Armed Forces are being
upgraded through two processes that are directly and intrinsically
linked and inseparable from each other: full professionalisation
and modernisation of equipment and weaponry, both of which will
be dealt with in greater detail later on.

As regards organisation, the Armed Forces are currently being
streamlined, concurrently with the two aforementioned processes.
This aspect is also addressed in a separate chapter.

###### Characteristics of the Armed Forces

The main characteristics that our Armed Forces must acquire,
and to which special attention will be devoted, are:

-  Quality of human resources, regarded as the most important
characteristic. Special attention needs to be paid to training
personnel, leadership, mentality, motivation and dedication.
Having fully professional Armed Forces will allow increasingly complex resources to be managed with maximum effectiveness.

-  Availability, which consists in ensuring the forces are ready for
call-up as a prior requisite for generating deterrence, coping
with a crisis or responding to an aggression. Expertise and
equipment will determine how available the units are. No
unit is more costly than one which is unable to engage effectively in combat when required to do so.

-  Flexibility, with respect both to procedures and to the organisation of the forces. This is a key factor in responding appropriately to the changing circumstances that characterise
today’s broad spectrum of conflicts. It requires adapting to
events, initiative and a modular type of organisation in the
structure of the forces.

CHAPTER IV: ARMED FORCES FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

-  Strategic mobility, which provides the ability to transport military means with the necessary combat and support capabilities to the areas of operations.

-  Warfighting capability or combat power, based on effective
manoeuvre and fire support capabilities.

-  Survivability or ability of the military units to protect themselves so as to operate in the characteristic environments of
modern-day conflicts, where speed of operations, precision
and firepower, the need to remain for long periods of time
and, on occasions, in environments with a nuclear, biological
or chemical risk, are key factors.

-  Sustained action capability, which enables forces to engage
effectively in operations for as long as necessary by subsequently relieving the units deployed and providing suitable
logistic support.

-  Mobilisation capability, both of personnel and of material
resources, in order to maintain and, if necessary, restore units’
combat power in the shortest possible time.

These characteristics of the Armed Forces are enhanced by factors like the following, which boost their effectiveness:

-  Superiority of information, in order to obtain, analyse, process
and disseminate the data needed to gain a better knowledge
of the situation within a suitable time. It facilitates the use of
other capabilities such as mobility, survivability, combat
power and sustainability.

-  Joint action, which, from when the operations are first
addressed, must enable efforts of military forces with specific or differentiated characteristics to be combined in a single
battle environment.

-  Interoperability, in order for the ground, naval and air forces to
engage in action with the forces of our allies. Establishing
standard equipment, doctrine and procedure facilitates the
implementation of operations and logistic support.

-  Advanced technology, which is a determining factor as it provides one of the most important advantages today in any sit

uation. Adopting such technology is of particular importance, both as a characteristic of the new Armed Forces model
and for the necessary interoperability with our allies.

###### Guidelines for the Armed Forces

**_Joint action_**

Military capabilities are developed through systems of forces
which are conceived harmoniously and developed through integration, with the necessary proportion of land, naval and air forces,
concentrating efforts on the essential tasks, pursuing efficiency and
complementarity, avoiding redundancy and idle resources, and
fostering mutual co-operation in joint action in the national sphere
and interoperability in the allied framework.

Although the possibility of having to perform operations in a
strictly national context is not the most likely prospect, adequate
means and procedures are required for this. In this connection, the
different systems of forces will, as a whole, constitute an effective
instrument for deterrence, prevention and response.

Joint action is an imperative given the nature of today’s operations, the range and precision of weaponry and the need to use the

CHAPTER IV: ARMED FORCES FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

full potential available with maximum efficiency. It is enhanced by
technological progress and the current means of information and
control.

The land, naval and air forces complement each other, as the
joint use of each gives rise to synergy, and modern technology is
capable of closely co-ordinating their respective actions, something
that was not possible in the past. This complementarity and synergy will produce the best results when each of the components is
assigned a suitable role within the whole, depending on the scenario in which the action is to be carried out.

The idea of the scenario where force action is required goes
beyond a geographical definition or the strictly ground, maritime
or aerial considerations on which military doctrine was
traditionally based. Concepts such as battlefield, maritime area
or airspace have evolved in the past years and have now merged
into a single battle area, which, in addition to the aforementioned
spheres, also encompasses electromagnetic space and the
modern notion of cyberspace, and even the broad field of social
communications.

Consequently, it does not usually make military sense to consider the exclusive use of ground, naval or air forces outside a purely tactical context when referring to certain specific actions. In
today’s world, in which the use of force refers basically to the projection of military potential to guarantee peace and the maintenance of stability, the emphasis must be on integrating efforts
through the concurrent use of ground, naval and air forces, bearing
in mind their complementary nature and the comparative advantage to be obtained from making use of one of them predominantly, depending on the situation, chosen from the broad variety of
options they offer as a whole.

In keeping with this idea, the Army, Navy and Air Force organise their forces in accordance with their own particular doctrines
and areas of action in order to serve as elements—all of which are
essential—of a joint strategy, each with its respective possibilities
and limitations. The circumstances will determine the predominant
use of the force that offers the best solution to the operational problem in question. This does not prevent the other forces from inter

vening; rather, they will complement and support the one that, in
each case, plays the leading role in the operations.

The efficiency of the whole depends on the value of each of the
elements that make it up. Regarding the force as a whole does not
mean that the ground, naval and air components lose their particular characteristics. Indeed, the opposite is true: these must be preserved if the forces are each to make the particular effort required
of them. Therefore, although the operations are performed with the
necessary combination of ground, naval and air forces under a single national or allied command, these forces will be formed, trained
and maintained at a suitable operational level within the administrative framework of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, to
which they respectively belong.

Forming a whole is, above all, a question of mentality. The
Army, the Navy and the Air Force are, and should regard themselves as, valuable
and irreplaceable
components of a
whole—the Armed
Forces—with the
mutual understanding that they constitute a chain whose
strength is measured
by the weakest of its
links.

CHAPTER IV: ARMED FORCES FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

This task, which may be performed in defence of national territory
or wherever it is required, greatly determines the structure and
resources of these forces.

Nonetheless, since a direct attack on any of the NATO members’
territory is currently highly unlikely, the ground forces will probably be used more as a basic instrument in crisis management and
peacekeeping or peacemaking, if necessary, as they are the only
ones capable of effectively gaining and retaining control of territorial objectives for the time required. In view of the remote and
unpredictable nature of possible aggressions and the foreseeable
use of ground forces in crisis situations outside national territory,
the emphasis needs to be placed on the characteristics of strategic
mobility, availability and sustainability.

The light forces, the main one being the Rapid Action Force,
afford capacity to react and have fewer transport requirements and
greater strategic mobility. As a result, they are given the appropriate degree of priority when allocating resources, in order to ensure
high readiness.

But there is no avoiding the fact that in a conflict, however
limited, a decisive effort may be needed, which entails the possibility of coming up against troops with considerable combat
power in terms of both number and of high-tech weaponry. In
this case, the core of the ground forces must be formed by
armoured and mechanised units with substantial firepower, tactical mobility and protection. Their use should, however, be compatible with the real possibilities of rapid deployment and with
the requirements of strategic mobility that enable the projection
of forces.

In accordance with the aforementioned criteria, the Army
Manoeuvre Force will have a balanced composition of four heavy
brigades and four light brigades. The former—one armoured, two
mechanised infantry and one armoured cavalry unit—are being
equipped with Leopard tanks and Pizarro combat vehicles.

At the same time, the airmobile forces will be supplied with
new attack helicopters equipped with long-range antitank missiles, and the number and features of their tactical transport heli

copters will be increased to improve the tactical mobility of the
light forces.

**_The naval forces_**

The naval forces, which are described in Appendix C, are a
means that is particularly suited to the rapid and gradual deployment of forces in any theatre of operations, however far from
national territory, owing to their essential characteristics of mobility, flexibility, ability to remain at sea and expeditionary capability.
At present there are no risks that badly affect sea links, and naval
operations are therefore focused on waters nearer the coast and
under greater influence of the ground-based aerial resources.

The projection of military potential from the sea has always
been a capability that is unique to naval formations on account of
their ability to move freely, be present and, if necessary, remain for
long periods off a shore, exercising their influence as required, by
using weapons or carrier-borne aviation, or by performing
amphibious operations of varying size. These characteristics make
them a uniquely valuable asset today, as they provide a rapid and
flexible response from the outset of crises for carrying out missions
from the sea such as evacuation, control of installations that enable

ground units to be landed or immediate participation in peace and
humanitarian assistance operations.

The new F-100 frigates, which are equipped with the Aegis
high-tech antiaircraft system, will improve the safety of the forces
considerably, particularly in areas close to a potentially hostile
coast, as well as providing a missile defence capability. The Fleet’s
naval air capabilities will be enhanced with the modernisation of
the Harrier aircraft for fighting and bombing.

As for the amphibious forces, their operational potential has
improved significantly thanks to the two new Galicia class landing
platform dock ships. Their assets will continue to be upgraded and
the weaponry, mobility and logistical support capabilities of the
Marine Brigade will likewise be improved.

**_The air forces_**

Controlling national airspace and, if necessary, providing air
defence of the territory, require a system with specific capabilities
to prevent any possibility of an air attack. The efficiency of this system is based mainly on the use of high-tech aerial resources, with
the co-operation of ground and, possibly, naval units, equipped
with antiaircraft missiles. Nevertheless, although we cannot rule

CHAPTER IV: ARMED FORCES FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

out the possibility that air defence may have to deal with a highrisk situation at some point in the future, in view of the risk of proliferation of weapons of massive destruction and their vectors, this
is not the most likely scenario for the coming years.

At the beginning of the 21[st] century, the air forces, referred to in
greater detail in Appendix D, must be suited to their most likely
use as an essential coercive instrument for peacemaking, and to the
requirement of ensuring the necessary air superiority to carry out
land and maritime operations. An air campaign is a persuasive element to be brought to bear on an adversary in a crisis in order to
reach a compromise, and is also a course of action that is likely to
reap favourable results with the lowest number of casualties.

The capabilities of the air forces are closely linked to the efficiency of attack aircraft as a platform for using a varied range of
weapons and systems that allow precise and selective effects to be
achieved on all kinds of air and surface targets. The fighter
squadrons will therefore be equipped with the future EF-2000 aircraft, which incorporate high technology, are fully interoperable
with our allies’ air forces and will gradually replace the Mirage F1s. Our squadrons will also continue to operate with the F-18s that
are currently in service. This fleet will be completed and modernised.

Air operations not only require the availability of combat units,
but also of the necessary means of transport to support an advance
deployment, and both capabilities must therefore be developed in
parallel. Furthermore, there is no ignoring the fact that air transport
is one of the cornerstones of the strategic mobility of the rapid reaction ground forces, and this capability must therefore be upgraded,
together with the air transport vectors. Air transport capabilities
will be given immediate attention through the progressive delivery
of the new CASA-295 aircraft and modernisation of the C-130 Hercules, which will continue to operate until the new heavy transport
aircraft are received.

##### CHAPTER V

### PROFESSIONALISATION

Citizens’ level of education and vocational training is one of the
values that underpin the progress of highly developed societies.
On the basis of this human potential, it is possible to find the people who are best suited to any task, provided they are chosen in
accordance with their skills and are properly motivated. They will
thus perform well when they apply themselves. Such a supply of
labour is, however, highly costly in a developed society in terms of
social structure and economic organisation. Today’s organisations
are therefore making a huge effort to hire the staff they really need
and, once they are on the payroll, manage them properly to ensure
they do the job as efficiently as possible.

These assumptions should be applied to human resources in the
sphere of Defence, including both the military and the civilian personnel who render their services at the Ministry of Defence. These
resources must be considered as a rare asset for two reasons: on the
one hand, their high cost and, on the other, the gradual fall in the
number young people as a percentage of the population, which
Spanish society has been witnessing for some years now.

_Marine armed with a Cetme LV rifle in firing position._

Today, as in the past, people are the Armed Forces’ greatest
asset. The latest technology would be of no use without sufficient,
well-trained and highly motivated personnel, and leaders at different levels of the organisation to ensure that the assigned tasks are
carried out. Human resources are therefore the most crucial factor
of our defence policy.

###### A requirement and a challenge

One of the main consequences of the strategic changes witnessed in recent years following the disappearance of the threat to
national borders is the reduction in numbers of troops. In order to
face up to the risks arising in an increasingly secure but less stable
environment, it is normally necessary to deploy forces outside
national territory, and this requires personnel who are suitably
trained for the task. Therefore, most of the nations in our part of the
world have shown a tendency to abolish conscription. From this
social aspiration stems the decision to discontinue military service,
which is very soon to be a reality in Spain.

This situation, in which new missions other than the traditional roles of self-defence have emerged and the convergence of

CHAPTER V: PROFESSIONALISATION

efforts raises the need to see eye-to-eye with our allies, gives rise
to specific requirements for the new professional servicemen, and
also for their commanding officers. The Defence Capabilities Initiative, approved by the Heads of State and Government at the
Washington Summit in April 1999, establishes the criterion—
which is generally applied by western Armed Forces in the 21[st]

century—of compensating for smaller numbers with greater effectiveness, which stems largely from the efficiency of professional
military personnel. At the same time, the technological revolution
has brought major changes in weaponry and military equipment,
the proper use and maintenance of which requires highly specialised personnel.

There is no doubt that these circumstances require much better qualified men and women and this calls for solutions that
enable the size of the forces to be combined with quality and
training. It is thus necessary to rise to a threefold challenge: to
provide the Armed Forces with a sufficient number of personnel
who are motivated and highly trained. In order to respond satisfactorily to this challenge, Spain has shifted from the “combined
model” of 1991 to the new “fully professional model”, according
to which all the members of the Armed Forces will be professionals.

CHAPTER V: PROFESSIONALISATION

In addition to the aforementioned strategic and technological reasons, Spanish society is calling for the abolishment of compulsory
military service. Society found it unacceptable, for example, that this
service should be performed by a only small percentage of the population, since women and a considerable number of men—for medical reasons or owing to other exemptions—were not performing a
compulsory service. These reasons led the Government to opt for a
model of professional Armed Forces instead of the combined model.

As well as a historic landmark, the professionalisation of the
Armed Forces is a challenge for Spain, whose security is going to
depend on whether the process that has been embarked on is successfully completed. But, first and foremost, professionalisation is a
modernising process that affects all areas of the military institution.
Indeed, the results of this effort do not depend solely and specifically on successful human resources management, but on shaping
the Armed Forces into a structure that is more effective yet smaller,
and enabling the requirements of the model adopted to be met with
the human resources society can contribute, without generating
excessive financial expenses.

Rising to this challenge is a task that particularly concerns officers and non-commissioned officers, to whom, as leaders of sol

CHAPTER V: PROFESSIONALISATION

diers, sailors and marines, the motivation, training and management of the latter is entrusted. Style of command must obviously be
adapted to the specific needs of the servicemen who possess
greater experience and remain in service for longer than in the past.
This circumstance, together with the fact that in future the only link
with armed service will be professional, means that the Administration should approach personnel management with criteria that
allow the professional and social aspects to be addressed suitably—
a very different approach from the previous combined model.

The professionalisation of the Armed Forces therefore goes
hand in hand with paying increasing attention to the occupational
aspects of the military personnel’s relationship with the military
institution. This necessary condition must not be fulfilled to the
detriment of the ties that bind servicemen to the institution through
their personal adherence to its characteristic values, one of the principle ones being to serve Spain within the framework defined by
the Constitution and laws.

Finally, it should be stressed that the success of this model largely depends on the relationship between society and the Armed
Forces, which will need to seek new avenues after military service
is abolished. Today, as in the past, the Armed Forces need citizens’
acceptance, backing and willingness to take part personally, either
permanently or temporarily, in their tasks, and to support their
costs financially through the budget.

###### Main characteristics of the model

The guiding principles of the new model of professional Armed
Forces are formulated in the aforementioned Report of the Joint
Congress-Senate Commission. They include the maximum number
of troops and the basic characteristics of commitment to the services
and the recruitment and training of professional servicemen. The
report also establishes an interim period for introducing the new
model so that the working of the Armed Forces is not disrupted.

The criteria laid down by the Joint Commission are being
applied to the set of rules that will eventually regulate the military
personnel of the Spanish Armed Forces at the beginning of the 21[st]

century. The cornerstone of this legal framework is Law 17/1999 of
18 May on Armed Forces Personnel. This important law establishes, among other basic aspects of the model, the personnel of the
Armed Forces, the tasks entrusted to the members of the different
Corps and categories and the rules governing their joining, training
and professional career. It also provides for the supplementary
engagement of reservists should the need arise.

As regards organisation, which is of crucial importance in
ensuring the practicability of the new model, the necessary tasks
have been undertaken to streamline and trim the current structures
and internal workings of the Ministry of Defence, in order to make
more effective use of the limited human resources available and
contain the related budgetary costs. On the subject of this overhaul,
special mention should be made of the progressive adoption of
modern personnel management processes, which are being introduced to address the new professional and social realities within
the Armed Forces.

**_Personnel_**

The law establishes a total of 48,000 officers and NCOs and
between 102,000 and 120,000 professional soldiers, sailors and
marines. This gives a maximum total of 168,000, within the ceiling
of 150,000 to 170,000 professional military personnel laid down in
the Report of the Joint Congress-Senate Commission.

Lowering these numbers requires a major effort, bearing in
mind that in 1984 the total personnel amounted to 373,000, of
whom 66,505 were commanding officers, and that the Armed
Forces 2000 model approved by Congress in 1991 established a
total of 180,000 personnel, of whom 49,720 were commanding officers and 130,280 soldiers, sailors and marines, including 50,000 professionals.

Current military defence planning estimates point to a maximum of 48,000 commanding officers and 110,500 professional soldiers, sailors and marines.

The overall figure of 48,000 commanding officers, officers and
NCOs entails a reduction in the number approved by Law 14/1993

The two basic mechanisms for progressively adapting the number of commanding officers are restricting the number of regular
officers and NCOs who join the Armed Forces to between 50% and
70% of the average retirements over the next ten years, and increasing the number of reservists until a suitable proportion is reached
with career soldiers.

As provided in the law, the Government has drawn up a
recruitment plan for professional servicemen for the interim period of adaptation to the new model. This takes into account budgetary factors as well as organisation, recruitment and training,
and is aimed at achieving an increase of no less than 17,500 persons/year from 1999. This rate will enable the interim period to be
completed on schedule, at the same time guaranteeing the operational capability of the Armed Forces during the transition to a
new model.

The adoption of
the new Armed

service of professional soldiers, sailors

the officers or NCOs

The most important features of professional soldiers,
to which training
should be geared, are
as follows:

-  A balanced combination of what are considered by modern
standards to be intrinsic human values, such as dignity, liberty, justice and solidarity, and military virtues like loyalty, valour and discipline, in order to render appropriate service to
the Armed Forces.

-  Integration into the cultural environment and a thorough
knowledge of the concerns and aspirations of the society,
which, as members of the military, they must serve through
the rational use of the singular force means that the State
places in their hands.

-  Professional capacity to make good use of, and administer, the
human and material resources available to them at any time:
initiative, discernment, intelligence and sufficient common
sense to cope efficiently with any circumstance that arises.

CHAPTER V: PROFESSIONALISATION

-  Physical and psychological abilities that are suited to the
aforementioned professional and human requirements.

-  The capacity to assimilate any new professional requirements
stemming from today’s continual progress in science and
technology, and from the different circumstances arising from
relationships in the currently changing international situation.

**_Principle of equality_**

A particularly significant aspect of the new Armed Forces
model is the career scheme for women within the military institution.

Previous legislation opened the doors of the Armed Forces to
women, though they were excluded from certain posts in the units.
Now that compulsory military service—
which only affected
men—has been abolished, the principle
of equality in the
Armed Forces is
being applied with
all its consequences,

difference between
the sexes must be
eliminated. Specific
regulations relating
to women in areas
such as uniform,
accommodation and

will, however, be
maintained in order
to achieve effective
equality. In this connection, differences

CHAPTER V: PROFESSIONALISATION

the physical conditions generally required from men and women
wishing to join the forces or remain in service.

**_Supplementary contribution of human resources_**

The abolishment of compulsory military service for Spaniards
does not affect the right and duty, set forth in the Constitution, to
provide this service in the event of a serious risk to national security that may require all citizens to participate in defence. Situations
may even arise in which the number of military personnel ordinarily authorised is insufficient, though the circumstances are not serious enough to justify widespread mobilisation. In order to ensure
that the Armed Forces may draw from supplementary human
resources when necessary, the figure of reservist has been established, with different categories and degrees of commitment: temporary, voluntary and compulsory.

Professional soldiers who cease to render their services to the
Armed Forces will be regarded as temporary reservists. As such, it
is their duty, for a period of between one and five years (depending
on their commitment), to return to service if called up. Spaniards
who apply and are selected for posts that are announced for this
purpose are voluntary reservists. Both the temporary and voluntary
reservists will be posted to existing units or make up special augmentation forces. The law provides for the possibility that temporary and voluntary reservists may take part in overseas missions.

Compulsory reservists will be citizens declared as such by the
Government, following authorisation from Congress, when
defence needs so require. It is established that compulsory
reservists who are called up have the right of conscientious objection, for which a simple statement from those in question is sufficient. They would then be assigned to general-interest organisations where the use of arms is not required.

###### Personnel management

In fully professional Armed Forces, personnel management, a
basic element of Defence Policy, must meet the needs of the Forces
and Force Support in terms of quantity, quality and motivation.

_Human resource management must be personalised in order to achieve_
_the best professional development._

This is achieved through appropriate systems, both for recruiting
and teaching and for their professional career as a whole.

In this new framework, personnel management must be: conducted jointly, flexible, personalised, and decentralised, and
encourage merit and capability.

-  Conducted jointly, so that the Armed Forces as a whole and their
missions and capabilities take priority over more specific aspects
and a new mentality is encouraged in which all the members of
the organisation share the task of promoting joint activities.

-  Flexible, and therefore capable of adapting quickly to the new
environment and to the requirements of the new professional Armed Forces.

-  Personalised, in order to achieve better professional development
of all members, boosting the human resources departments.

-  Decentralised, to enable a closer style of management that is
more attentive to immediate needs.

-  Encouraging merit and capability, defining criteria and furnishing procedures to ensure that the professional military
career of the future is a greater reflection of these principles
and criteria than simply of length of service.

CHAPTER V: PROFESSIONALISATION

_People are the Armed Forces’ greatest asset. Ski unit_
_of the Aragón I Mountain Brigade._

All these elements will shape a human resources policy which,
while respecting the particular characteristics of the military institution, will be comparable with the policies pursued by modern organisations geared to achieving their objectives more effectively and
developing their professionals’ careers. Of the particularities of the
military career, the geographical mobility for professional reasons of
the members of the Armed Forces, as a result of their permanent
availability, is of particular importance with respect to personnel policy. Therefore, Law 26/1999 of 9 July on measures to support geographical mobility establishes a new policy for supporting the housing needs arising from changes of postings and locality. This policy
basically establishes economic compensation. Only in special cases
laid down by the law itself will military housing be supplied.

**_Incentives to joining and remaining in the Armed Forces_**

In order to maintain the model of professional Armed Forces,
sufficient demand from young Spanish people is required in order
to cover the needs of professional servicemen as posts become
available. Personnel policy must therefore make the military profession a more attractive prospect by providing the necessary
career incentives.

CHAPTER V: PROFESSIONALISATION

Recruitment is going to be a major challenge over the next few
years. It requires adopting a full, flexible, progressive and practicable human resources programme and subsequently maintaining
the established numbers of professional troops.

The new model of fully professional Armed Forces marks a
decisive move to adopt an open system that reconciles the necessary permanence and the compulsory renewal of servicemen. It is
not a closed model; rather, it is rotational, and the flow of new personnel and retirements allows a balance to be achieved between
personnel who remain in their posts, replacements and new
recruits. It is necessary to have a certain number of permanent staff
for the military organisation to obtain an optimum performance
from its professionals and so that they, in turn, can develop a full
professional career in the military, if they wish.

Overall, the system will offer a wide range of opportunities. Servicemen who join the Armed Forces have open prospects for their
professional career: they can progress within their own speciality
as professional military men and gear their future towards remaining in the forces as soldiers, sailors or marines and possibly being
promoted to NCOs or officers; but they can also capitalise on the
training they have received and the professional experience they

CHAPTER V: PROFESSIONALISATION

have gained and switch to the labour market, in the public or private sector.

In order to achieve this objective, emphasis needs to be placed
on several aspects. It is necessary, first, to convey to the young generation of Spaniards a real image of the opportunities offered by the
military profession, and increase the presence of women. And second, to establish a continuous selection system to take in young
Spaniards to fill the vacancies that arise throughout the year in the
Armed Forces according to the rotation system.

Another important matter is that a large percentage of soldiers,
sailors and marines should remain in service by successively
increasing their commitments. In order for this to be possible,
career models are being designed with definite professional
prospects, such as, among other possibilities, specialising in technical functions suited to the age and experience of the most veteran
members, access, for a small proportion, to permanent engagement, or promotion to the rank of NCO, reserving all the related
posts which arise for this purpose.

**_Support for reintegration into the labour force_**

The above options do not necessarily have to be taken up by all
members of the forces, nor, indeed, is it generally possible to offer
an indefinite period of engagement. The model that has been adopted is based on the assumption that a large proportion of servicemen
will drop out voluntarily having fulfilled their first commitments, or
will have to do so if their service contracts cannot be renewed. In
such cases, however, professional expectations should be duly covered, and at least 50% of Civil Guard posts are therefore held open
for servicemen. In any event, they will receive support in returning
to the labour market once they no longer render their services to the
Armed Forces, in the form of suitable training. For this purpose, the
law calls on the Government to draw up an action plan to support
professional servicemen who return to the labour market.

As occurred previously, the new Armed Forces model conceives
military education as a system that is integrated into the general
educational system. The purpose is to enhance the quality of training as a main strength that attracts professional servicemen who

will only be rendering their services temporarily and therefore
have other job expectations for the future. With this aim in mind,
the educational model must be designed to facilitate their reintegration into the labour force once their commitments in the Armed
Forces have ended.

**_Military education system_**

Military education is an essential task for obtaining the professionals that the Armed Forces need. The system of military education is the chief means of imparting skills to the available human
resources and is characterised by three essential elements:

-  All-round training, because the Armed Forces are the depositories of the force assets that the State provides for its defence.
Professionals with the necessary technical training but also
solid human skills are required to put these assets to use.

-  Global approach, because attention is given both to initial training and subsequent development and on-the-job training in
order to keep personnel constantly up to date. They will
therefore form a unitary whole that guarantees the continuity
of the educational process, incorporating into the teaching
structure everything related to the education of servicemen.

CHAPTER V: PROFESSIONALISATION

-  Integration into the general education system, ensuring progressiveness and, as the case may be, complementarity between
the courses studied in different systems and enabling qualifications to be standardised and validated, thereby helping
improve CVs and raise the quality of teaching in subjects that
are not specifically military through the appropriate agreements with national and foreign universities and educational
establishments.

The process of professionalisation and modernisation that the
Armed Forces are currently undergoing requires military education to be adapted to these new perspectives with sufficient rapidity and flexibility. A new situation requires responses that are not
anchored on past approaches.

The main courses of action of military teaching in the medium
term are aimed at: revising the content of the study programmes to
adapt them to the new strategic conceptions; taking part in multinational structures; and the characteristics of current operations,
which require better technical training, a higher level of language
proficiency and greater initiative in performing professional tasks.

Studies are being finalised in collaboration with the Ministry of
Education and Culture to validate the qualifications provided by
the military education system and establish equivalents with the
official qualifications of the general educational system. This means
that, in addition to their technical skills and work experience, professional soldiers, sailors and marines will come away with a
recognised qualification that enables them to compete on an equal
footing for jobs in an increasingly competitive labour market.

**_Adaptation of civilian personnel_**

A complementary though no less important aspect of applying
the new professional model is making the most of the services rendered by civilians in the Ministry of Defence. The military personnel of the Armed Forces must be assigned to military tasks strictly
speaking, for which they are irreplaceable, though they can also
perform other tasks which could be carried out by civilians but
need to be performed in places or conditions that require the use of
military personnel.

CHAPTER V: PROFESSIONALISATION

In such cases, civilians are required to play a larger role in the
daily life of the Armed Forces. For this reason, the Report of the
Joint Congress-Senate Commission of 11 May 1998 points to the
need to adapt the civilians at the service of the military administration to the requirements of the model of fully professionalised
Armed Forces. This requires reconsidering both their number and
type of training and speciality.

These new needs require civil servants and civilian personnel to
take on new tasks in addition to those they currently perform. It is
therefore necessary to draw up a catalogue of posts for the civilian
personnel of the Ministry of Defence, in addition to a reorganisation programme and a training process that boost the availability of
these human resources and tailor their training to their new
responsibilities.

##### CHAPTER VI

### MODERNISATION

The recent conflicts have shown that military success largely
depends on having forces that are technologically superior to those
of the adversary. This superiority rests on two essential pillars: professionalisation and modernisation of resources. A significant budgetary effort with respect to human resources would be meaningless unless those professionals were equipped with the instruments
needed to perform their tasks. Indeed, these two factors cannot be
separated from each other. It is therefore important for improvements in personnel and equipment to be carried out at the same
pace, mutually enhancing the performance of the financial
resources allocated to each field.

The fast-occurring changes in technology that characterise this
age make research and development a necessary ongoing effort in
the process of modernising the Armed Forces. It is therefore not
only a question of obtaining modern equipment and systems for
the units, but also forecasting the needs that will arise in the medium and even long term to maintain the technological superiority
on which the effectiveness of our forces should be based. The financial costs stemming from this requirement would be difficult to

CHAPTER VI: MODERNISATION

bear in the current budgetary framework. This is a basic consideration which has spurred the European Union to make determined
progress towards integrating national armaments policies.

It is furthermore evident that the co-ordination of national armaments policies also stems from the need to ensure that the allied
forces can operate as a whole, in keeping with a conception of
defence and security that is based on multinationality. This is another major challenge for our Armed Forces at the beginning of the 21[st]

century—to ensure that their combat, combat support and logistic
support assets are on a technological par with those of the allies.

In order to ensure the overall efficiency of the budget effort with
respect to human and material resources, due attention needs to be
paid to streamlining the infrastructure, as this requires investment.
Despite the thorough transformation carried out in recent years,
the deployment of fixed installations on the ground is a legacy of
the past, which survives to this day. In order to free up resources for
the benefit of the force and improve support for personnel and
materiel, it is necessary to continue with the process of grouping
bases and barracks and modernising the facilities of the premises
that need to be maintained or built.

The modernisation of the Armed Forces personnel, materiel and
infrastructure is, all in all, a further reflection of our society’s development and can be expected to provide the added advantage of creating wealth and jobs. Defence policy must adopt this criterion as a
general policy and, consequently, consider the impact of its measures
on the environment, in keeping with the concept of sustainable
development that the Government promotes. Our Armed Forces
defend interests, values and principles that are none other than those
of the society which they serve. Respect for the environment is part
of these values and is therefore given special attention in the department’s policy, particularly in connection with infrastructure.

###### Armaments and materiel

Ensuring efficiency in the field of armaments and materiel
requires a significant ongoing effort, owing both to the natural
wear and tear of the systems from usage and to the technological

CHAPTER VI: MODERNISATION

and operational obsolescence that occurs over time. When carrying
out modernisation, it is necessary to bear very much in mind that
the need to incorporate cutting-edge technology to the new
weapons entails embarking on a lengthy process of development
and, consequently, investments that will not bear fruit until the systems come into service—years after the initial conceptual stage.
Modernisation is thus a medium- and long-term target, which
involves committing funds to multiyear programmes.

According to what could be called a strategy of means, an
ongoing decision-making process is established to determine the
best way to meet the need for costly materiel with financial
resources which, as in any economic process, will always turn out
to be limited. This requires us to prioritise these needs and ascertain the risks that need to be assumed as a result of the decisions
adopted.

The investments in materiel are not only aimed at obtaining
new systems, but also at research and development and sustaining the existing systems. Maintenance activities in the three
forces and, to a lesser extent, all aspects of technological development at military establishments and laboratories, require more
facilities and human resources than are currently available. It is
therefore becoming increasingly necessary to resort to external
sources outside the Ministry of Defence to cover these needs.
This process of allocating the available resources to the activities
in which they are most efficient is a widespread practice in the
modern economy.

The Army, the Navy and the Air Force each have their own
particular characteristics that stem from their specific scope of
action, but as a whole, they constitute the same, single defence
system. Their respective needs are therefore met by the defence
budget after considering them as a whole. They are subject to an
order of priorities established by the Ministry of Defence and
endorsed by the Government in accordance with a joint approach,
so that the programmes that are most necessary from the operational point of view are assigned higher priorities. The use of
common procedure in procuring and maintaining materiel that
can be of service to any of the forces is a valuable instrument in
terms of cost-effectiveness.

**_Plans for the procurement of armaments and equipment_**

The Force Goal, which specifically states the needs of the Armed
Forces, gives rise to an Indicative Plan for Armaments and
Materiel. This Plan serves to:

- Normalise and rationalise the planning and programming of
armaments and materiel.

- Facilitate the monitoring of, and follow-up to, the implementation of programmes.


-  Optimise the procurement and modernisation of armaments
and materiel, as well as the acquisition of technology and the
maintenance of the systems in service.

-  Provide the defence industry with the information it needs to
plan its activity.

The Indicative Plan for Armaments and Materiel is implemented through specific programmes for the different systems, which
govern the whole life-cycle of the materiel, including the phases of
feasibility, definition, development and production, as well as
maintenance and modernisation while it remains in operation.

Likewise, bearing in mind the importance of information technology and communications for the force’s operational capabilities,

Page 120 Defence White Paper

CHAPTER VI: MODERNISATION

it has been considered necessary to devise an Indicative Plan for
Information Systems to facilitate the attainment of defence objectives in the field of operations, logistics, administration and management. This Plan includes the Information Systems of the Central
Organs and Headquarters of the Army, Navy and Air Force.

Furthermore, in 1999 work was begun on drawing up the Annual Plan for Centralised Acquisitions, which will include consumables and goods that easily deteriorate through wear and tear and
are widely used by the forces or central organs, provided they are
not weapons systems, in addition to consultancy and technical
assistance services. The idea is that a centralised procedure will
mean a larger volume of purchases, leading to economies of scale.

The aim of the armaments and materiel policy is to meet our
Armed Forces’ needs by providing them with the best weapons systems and support equipment the available resources can buy, helping strengthen the industrial and technological base of defence. The
Government therefore encourages and promotes the active participation of the Spanish Defence Industry in the different programmes
for the Spanish Armed Forces’ armaments and materiel.

The defence industry is an important component of any developed country’s industrial fabric and has frequently been the dri

The armaments and materiel policy attaches great importance
to this sector with such great future potential, as reflected in the
budget allocated annually to upgrading trial and instrument facilities and to supporting and encouraging the exchange of technology between the defence sector and other areas of industry.

However, the growing complexity and the increasing costs of
developing and producing defence materiel make self-sufficiency
prohibitively expensive for most countries and have given rise to
the current trend, which is becoming increasingly widespread,
towards industrial co-operation in the international sphere. This
trend explains Spain’s participation in international industrial co

operation projects, either through agreements between governments or between the Spanish Government and a particular foreign
company. Industrial and technological returns and compensation
required from the suppliers are crucially important factors in this
option, which opens up new opportunities for the Spanish defence
industry.

Finally, there is the option of acquiring materiel by purchasing
systems which have already been developed. In any event, purchasing abroad will always entail negotiating industrial co-operation agreements to boost the technological fields of interest and
lead to maximum autonomy in industrial logistic support throughout the life of the system.

**_Joint programmes of the Defence Staff_**

A large proportion of military projects are joint programmes
conceived and managed by the Defence Staff. These are high-tech
projects designed to support the working of the Operational Command Structure of the Armed Forces through command, control,
communications and intelligence resources. Services which are not
the exclusive responsibility of any of the forces are unified for this
purpose, provided that their joint working improves effectiveness
and economises on resources.

The “Defence Operations Centre” programme constitutes the
apex of the Command and Control structure that supports the Minister of Defence and the Chief of the Defence Staff in exercising the
powers vested in them by current legislation, in situations of peace,
crisis or armed conflict. It includes the resources required both by
the Military Command and Control System and in the Area of
Political Consultation, Crisis Control and Civil Defence.

The “Information System of the Chief of the Defence Staff” programme is the top-level segment of the Armed Forces information
resources. It interconnects the Military Command and Control Centres of the Headquarters, helping the Chief of the Defence Staff and
the Main Operational Commands take decisions.

The “Joint Military Communications System” programme is
designed to establish a joint digital network at national level to

continuity of the
space capability of communications is being analysed to decide
whether it is appropriate to develop an exclusive system for defence.

In the field of electronic warfare, the “Joint System for the Procurement and Processing of Electronic Information (SANTIAGO)”
programme is designed to establish a system of sensors for collecting signals and specific resources for processing and distributing
the information they contain. This system will enable a higher level
of information to be obtained from electronic signals in areas of
interest to defence.

The growing need for a national intelligence system that can be
used by all three forces and by other defence agencies has given rise
to the programme entitled “Joint Intelligence System for Defence”,
which is part of the “Military Command and Control System”. The
aim of this programme is to provide adequate and timely intelligence, both in peacetime and in crisis or war, in order to support
strategic and operational leadership. The first stage of the Joint

Since 1988 Spain has been taking part, together with other European states, in the HELIOS I programme that came into service in
1995 and is designed to obtain satellite images of the Earth for
chiefly military purposes. By the end of 1999 the second HELIOS II
satellite had been launched and this will enable the system to operate until 2005, while the ground-based facilities and resources are
permanently adapted. These capabilities are currently being
analysed to decide whether we should take part in the HELIOS II
programme or establish our own system of small observation satellites for defence.

In 1978, the Atlantic Alliance embarked on an airborne early
warning and control programme aimed at achieving greater control and surveillance of air space. For this purpose, it has a fleet of
early warning aircraft with specific equipment, crews and infrastructure. Thirteen nations take part in this programme as a Multinational NATO Unit. A programme to modernise the airborne
equipment is currently being carried out. Spain, which has been a
fully-fledged member of the Alliance since 11 December 1998, takes
part in this programme, contributing financially together with the
other nations involved. The resources that Spain invests revert
wholly to its national industry.

CHAPTER VI: MODERNISATION

**_Programmes for the Army_**

When dealing with programmes involving materiel, the interdependence of elements in the Army should be taken particularly into
account. A unit, however well equipped as regards mobility and firepower, will be not be able to act effectively unless it has suitable communications and means of command and control. And even if it has
such means but cannot be sustained with fuel, ammunition and
spares, it will only be effective for a limited period while it has the local
autonomy provided by its minimum provisions. The same can be said
of the balance between the capabilities of the different manoeuvre and
support units used to make up a combined weapons system. Wellequipped armoured units will be of little use if they lack the support
of field artillery with suitable muzzles and ammunition or engineers
units to guarantee tactical mobility vis-à-vis any kinds of obstacles.

The chief priority for the Army is to ensure the three essentials
for combat—the combination of actions of tanks, combat vehicles
capable of accompanying tanks and attack helicopters.

Three major programmes have been designed to meet this need:
Leopard, Pizarro and Attack Helicopter. The 219 Leopard tanks and
the 16 Búfalo armoured recovery vehicles, expected to be delivered
between 2000 and 2005, will provide the heavy Brigades and the
Cavalry Regiment of the Mechanised Division with an armoured

Pizarro Programme
has been undertaken
to supply 366 personnel carriers and 97

comprises the manufacture of 123 combat vehicles and 32 command and control vehicles between 1996 and 2001 for one of the aforementioned brigades.
Subsequent contracts will be signed for the other units.

The Pizarro family will be completed with a series of vehicles
with special configurations: mortar carriers and missile carriers,
sapper vehicles and ambulances for the Mechanised Division,
which will make maintenance simpler and cheaper, as well as modernising the fleet of specialised vehicles.

The Attack Helicopter programme is pending decision, as the
Army has completed its assessment of the different helicopters of
this kind, which are to replace the Bolkow BO-105. The various
alternatives are being studied from the operational, economic and
technological-industrial points of view.

In addition to these three key elements, mention should also be
made of important programmes to modernise its manoeuvrability
(CENTAURO Armoured Cavalry Reconnaissance Vehicle) and
helicopter transport capability (Chinook, Cougar and Superpuma
helicopters).

CHAPTER VI: MODERNISATION

The CENTAURO is an armoured cavalry reconnaissance vehicle
for the Light Cavalry Regiment of the Spanish Rapid Reaction Division. It is wheeled, airportable and fitted with a 105mm cannon
which will provide the light forces that need to be deployed rapidly in overseas operations with the essential reconnaissance capability and firepower.

The Chinook heavy-lift helicopter is currently being modernised. From now until 2003, Cougar tactical transport helicopters
will progressively be delivered, which, together with the Superpuma currently available, will provide a light battalion with a helicopter transport capability and sustainability for a limited period.

Another main priority of the Army is to procure a modern command and control system that is interoperable with those of our
allies. A major effort is being made in this field, since the communications and information subsystems first need to be modernised.
Work is being carried out specifically on the following programmes:

-  The Basic Aerial Network, which, through communication
centres connected by multichannel radio links, will provide
the command at brigade, division and Manoeuvre Force levels with swift and reliable telecommunications and will enable
mobile users equipped with advanced technology radiophones to be integrated, offering security in communications.

-  The Army Command and Control System, which will provide the brigade and higher commands, in real time, with the
information needed to help them make decisions and direct
operations.

-  Intelligence Programmes related to the Surface Information
System and the Tactical Intelligence System.

With respect to fire support, the programme to modernise the
155mm self-propelled guns is due to be completed in 2001. This
equipment, which will be supplied to the artillery battalions of the
heavy brigades, will be useful until 2010. Thereafter it will have to
be replaced by a system that incorporates the latest technology in
order to ensure enhanced firepower and ability to respond. Also
nearing completion is the modernisation of the field artillery of the
light brigades of the Spanish Rapid Reaction Division, for which
105mm light cannon have been acquired.

action of the anti-air artillery semi-automatically and in real time,
programmes are under way to acquire operations centres for light
and medium-weight anti-air artillery.


The following programmes will contribute significantly to
enhancing the mobility of the units, particularly the brigades with
heavy resources: sapper vehicle and bridge layers, which will shortly
be supplied to the sapper units of the heavy brigades, and with fixed
supports, which will be delivered up to 2001. When there is a sufficient budgetary allocation, 150m of floating bridge will be replaced.

In addition to these substantial modernisation programmes,
there are other minor but no less necessary programmes, which

CHAPTER VI: MODERNISATION

overall amount to a significant sum. These programmes involve:
replacing the current CETME assault rifle with a new model; continuing with the acquisitions, already under way, of 40mm Automatic Grenade Launchers; improving the quality and quantity of
night-vision devices and acquiring simulators and training devices,
particularly for helicopters and missiles, among other features.

Lastly, it should be stressed that although the aforementioned
modernisation programmes are important, the main effort that needs
to be made involves keeping current materiel operative. Giving impetus to programmes for the maintenance of armaments and materiel is
a constant need, to which should be added the requirements stemming from the Cougar helicopters, Pizarro combat vehicles and
Leopard main battle tanks, which came into service in 1998 and 2000
respectively. All these systems are very expensive to maintain.

**_Navy programmes_**

The complexity of ships as platforms which integrate different
systems determines the Navy’s ability to achieve its force goals. A
lengthy and costly period of concept design, programming and
building elapses between the conception and entry into service
stages of a vessel. As a result, the Navy’s projects are particularly
vulnerable to modifications after the conceptual stage, since any
revision entails restarting a process which in itself is slow, with the
risk that the units to be replaced may have to remain in service
until they lose their operational capability.

The Navy is also conditioned by factors that are similar to the
characteristics of the Army and Air Force, since it has Marine units,
aircraft and helicopters. These afford the Navy’s force goals as a
whole a physiognomy of their own, as the sustainability of an
inventory made up of short series of a broad variety of specific systems needs to be assured.

Surface vessels are the most characteristic element of the Navy,
and also its basic means of securing and exercising control over the
sea. Therefore, of all the Navy programmes, special mention
should be made of the programme to build four F-100 frigates,
which are due to be delivered to the Navy between 2002 and 2005.
These vessels belong to a new generation developed as part of a

multinational programme. They will be equipped with a system
that will guarantee the Navy’s capacity to operate under a close
threat of an air attack, such as in the waters of the Mediterranean,
where there is not much room for manoeuvre and the proximity of
land is a definitive factor.

Amphibious capability has great importance as an essential part
of the modern naval concept of operations carried out from the sea,
according to which the strategic influence of sea power comes to the
fore when managing crises which can affect shared security. The programme to built new amphibious ships is designed to procure two
Galicia class landing platform dock ships equipped with a floodable
landing dock and a flight deck for helicopters, one of which has
already been delivered to the Navy and the second has enhanced
command and control characteristics. These vessels are the result of
a bilateral Spanish-Dutch project aimed at providing the Marine
forces with suitable platforms for amphibious operations.

There are several programmes to boost the effectiveness of the
Marine Force. The most noteworthy of these is the Programme for
Amphibious Vehicles currently under way, which is designed to
renew surface assault capability by means of mechanised forces.
Other projects, such as those to improve communications, light

As for air resources, now that the procurement of the carrierborne Harrier AV-8 B Plus has been completed, the Programme for
the Remanufacture of the AV-8B is intended to equip the remaining
aircraft with radar and new weapons system to enhance their airto-air and air-to-ground capabilities. As for helicopters, a programme is under way to complete the equipment of the Santa
María class frigates and the new F-100 frigates currently being
built, and to acquire multipurpose tactical transport helicopters to
replace those now in service.

In order to maintain the submarine capability established in the
Navy plans, the Programme for Series 80 Submarines, currently at
definition stage, is geared towards building an as yet undetermined number of conventional attack submarines equipped with
highly potent weapons and capable of operating at considerable
depths below the surface.

There are plans to build a second series of minehunters with the
same characteristics as the Segura class in order to make the most
of the infrastructure created when the first series was built.

CHAPTER VI: MODERNISATION

**_Air Force programmes_**

The Air Force resources should be based on the most modern
technology in order to maintain an appropriate level of effectiveness. This requirement chiefly applies to aircraft, including the sensors they incorporate, but also weapons systems and air control
systems. The high costs of technological development, combined
with the equally high costs of the products manufactured by the
aeronautical industry, make it particularly difficult to programme
force objectives in this case.

Therefore, the European countries are increasingly opting to
participate in consortia for the research, development and production related to the aeronautic and defence industry. It is very advisable to take part in these consortia, since they strengthen our
nation’s industrial policy, enable us to acquire technology, keep us
at the forefront of development, afford our products access to markets and create jobs for highly qualified professionals.

On account of its importance to the effectiveness of the Air Force
as a whole, special mention should be given to the Programme for an
Integrated Air Command and Control System designed to upgrade
and boost the Force’s detection capability with a series of domestically-produced radar and equipment, and, at the same time, to improve

communications within the system and with other Command and
Control systems, both national and allied. This programme is integrated into the NATO Air Command and Control System, a programme that is common to the whole of the organisation.

Another programme that is of paramount importance to the Air
Force and to national industry involves the production of EF-2000
combat aircraft, also known as Eurofighter. The aim is to acquire 87
of these aircraft, which have been developed as part of a co-operation programme between Germany, Spain, Italy and the United
Kingdom. These aircraft are due to be delivered between 2002 and
2014. This multinational programme has enabled the European aerospace industry to hold onto its lead in the competitive world market
and includes a major participation from Spanish industry, which
entails a significant advantage in the acquisition of technology.

Also of utmost operational importance is the programme to
modernise and overhaul the Mirage F-1 aircraft. This will ensure
they are operationally effective until after 2010, by improving their
electronic self-protection systems, precision systems for weapon
launch, interoperability and protection of communications—an
impressive performance bearing in mind that these aircraft began
to operate in the Air Force in 1975.

CHAPTER VI: MODERNISATION

With respect to one of the Air Force’s star weapons systems, the
F-18, there are three programmes under way. One is designed to
complete the fleet of available F-18s by acquiring 24 of these aircraft, all of which are due to be delivered by January 2000. A second programme, which will be started up in 2000, is intended to
improve the ability to locate long-distance ground targets by
means of infrared vision equipment and state-of-the art laser technology, in order to boost these aircraft’s combat potency. Finally,
the programme to upgrade and extend the average life of the rest
of the F-18 fleet will enhance the operational capacity of these aircraft, incorporating more modern systems and altering some others, thereby lengthening their useful life and operational effectiveness to beyond 2015.

The need for air transport has increased in the new strategic situation in which the ability to project forces rapidly and support
them tops the list of priorities of any military force. Several European countries have set in motion a co-operation programme to
develop an aircraft with a large cargo capacity and radius of action
which would meet Europe’s current need for this type of operational capability and would secure the military transport aircraft
industry a competitive foothold in the world marketplace. This
programme for the future transport aircraft initially involves

Until these new aircraft become available, heavy air transport
capability will continue to be based on the twelve C-130 Hercules,
which are currently being modernised by the national industry in
order to upgrade their systems to ensure their performance in the
operational environment of the first decade of the 21[st] century.

Also in the field of air transport, in view of the development of
the C-295 medium-weight transport aircraft manufactured by Construcciones Aeronáuticas S.A. and its considerable market potential
across the world, the Spanish Government has decided that the Air
Force will participate in launch of this project as a customer, in
order to boost the C-295’s sales potential, while setting up a C-295
squadron to meet its air transport requirement.

As for anti-air defence of the Air Force’s facilities and stations,
the Short-Range Air Defence Programme has been implemented.
This programme includes the acquisition of several integrated systems comprising air surveillance radar and illumination of aerial
targets, medium-range ASPIDE radar-guided missiles and shortrange MISTRAL infrared missiles. The latter system has now been
supplied to the Air Deployment Support Detachment, which
means that it may be installed at any base from which air forces are
deployed, though there are plans to equip other facilities and air
bases with similar systems.

**_European armaments policy_**

Developing a common European defence requires the backing
of a European armaments policy to harmonise military needs and
the planning and procurement of weapons systems. Spain considers that a strong, competitive and efficient defence industry is pivotal to the European security and identity, and central to supporting the development of the necessary scientific and technological
foundations. Therefore, together with several European nations, it
backs the initiative to discuss common interests in the area of
defence and the restructuring of the industry that underpins it.

As a result, it is deemed necessary to harmonise the requirements of the armed forces of the European countries, seek solutions

to procurement in co-operation, when possible, and prevent unnecessary duplication in the field of development and production. In
this connection, policies relating to logistic support, research and
technological development should be harmonised and a single
export procedure adopted. The participation of the different countries in European defence’s industrial base should be balanced and
reflect the principle of interdependence.

In order to achieve this, a separate policy is needed, aimed at
bolstering the industrial and technological base of defence by promoting the companies in the sector, seeking to achieve both a business dimension and a technological capability in keeping with our
industrial level and our contribution to common defence.

Spain will support the leading companies in this sector so that
they contribute with competitive criteria by supplying their products to the development of a common European defence. To this
end, it plans to make an effort in three main areas: research and
development, free competition and the use of commercial products.

-  Research and development funds will be earmarked to the
technological innovation effort, so that Spanish companies
may compete with the rest of the European and world industry in this sector.

CHAPTER VI: MODERNISATION

-  Free competition will be encouraged and the procedure for
acquiring military materiel will be improved.

-  Commercial technology and products will be used increasingly, provided they are compatible with requirements, moving towards greater use of civil regulations and standards.

These measures must go hand in hand with a strategy to foster
the foreign expansion of companies which, owing to their consolidated size and quality, could place their products on the foreign
market and take part in international co-operation problems. These
companies will be encouraged to join transnational industrial consortia. Furthermore, in a globalised and increasingly competitive
market, military demand will, in many cases, be insufficient to
achieve the necessary dimension.

In line with the foregoing, Spain is currently taking part in the
initiative aimed at restructuring the European defence industry.
This led it to sign the Letter of Intent with Germany, France, Italy,
the United Kingdom and Sweden on 16 July 1998 to establish a cooperative framework to facilitate this restructuring. The purpose
of this Letter is to pinpoint the areas in which the participant countries intend to find common solutions to the problems identified in
this industry, defining the principles, organisation and responsibilities, in order to then negotiate appropriate agreements and
pacts which, if necessary, could entail amending national regulations.

The necessary progress made towards the streamlining of the
defence structures, both in the participant countries and at the different European forums, largely depends on the development of a
strong, competitive and efficient European industry. However, it is
industry which should establish the necessary basis for achieving
restructuring, and in this connection the step taken by the European aerospace industries, and specifically that of Spain, is a clear
example of the common wish to reach agreements in this field.

In order to establish conditions that are conducive to the
achievement of these objectives, it is considered crucial to remove
the obstacles that hinder industrial restructuring, particularly in
the areas of protection of supplies, export procedure, financing

research and development and the protection of information and
intellectual property rights, while preserving defence interests.

###### Infrastructure

The aim of the Defence Infrastructure Policy is to provide the
Armed Forces with suitable fixed installations that meet their
deployment needs and the operational technical requirements
stemming from the Joint Strategy Plan. It should be pointed out,
first and foremost, that the Ministry of Defence does not own
immovable property in the strict sense of the word, and this property does not exist as such. These are state-owned assets assigned
to Defence and are therefore regarded as public property.

Infrastructure management should aim to adapt to a changing
situation, so that it is always in keeping with real needs. It may
seem that infrastructure could easily be altered or reduced, but this
is not the case. It is relatively simple to set up a modest facility with
limited needs, but it will soon start to grow and take root. These
roots become deeper and ramified and cling to the ground so that
within a short time it is very difficult to prevent the facility from
continuing to develop, and in the long run the effort required to
move or eliminate it becomes excessive.

Since infrastructure is a means at the service of the forces, the
principle of cost-effectiveness should be rigorously applied when
evaluating new elements, which should only be built when they
have a clear future usefulness. Until well into the eighties, the territorial model of the Armed Forces reflected a classical concept of
defence linked almost exclusively to the sovereign area, that is, it
was markedly territorial in nature. As a result, assets were progressively accumulated over time, irrespective of their real military use.

When the international strategic environment changed after the
Cold War ended, the properties assigned to defence were huge in
number, widely dispersed and, in many cases, particularly in urban
locations, of very little operational utility. The fact is that most of
the installations had been originally established on what was the
periphery of population centres. After a time they came to be located inside or even at the centre of the urban nuclei, and this posed

problems both for the activity of the military units and for urban
development.

The age and dispersion of many of these buildings entailed
hefty maintenance and upkeep costs which made less money available for investments. A forward-looking approach to defence called
for abandoning the concept of infrastructure assets, replacing it
with a new, predominately functional, sustainable model, based on
fewer assets in keeping with new needs.

Infrastructure policy gives maximum priority to investments in
military facilities that underpin the dual process of professionalisation and modernisation of the Armed Forces. This policy is based
on the principles of reducing and redeploying units and abandoning any unnecessary assets. To this end, the following actions are
carried out:

-  Maximum concentration of units, centres and organisations
at facilities with an appropriate location and infrastructure.

-  Closure of facilities which, owing to operational or functional needs, do not serve the purpose for which they were originally created.

-  Modernisation of available infrastructure in order to adapt it
to the requirements of fully professional Armed Forces.

CHAPTER VI: MODERNISATION

-  Declaration of the buildings and properties that are progressively vacated as a result of the organic adaptations required
by the redeployment process as “not necessary” for military
use.

-  Promotion of the necessary co-ordination and effective collaboration between the Army, Navy and Air Force for the
joint use of facilities, chiefly those relating to logistic support,
personnel support and transport logistics.

-  Make use of all the opportunities offered by NATO investment programmes to carry out infrastructure projects on
Spanish soil.

The ostensible reduction in the public assets assigned to
defence, now under way, is possible thanks to a very careful alienation policy which safeguards defence interests at all times.

The resources generated by the Defence Infrastructure and
Facilities Management, which is the agency responsible for the
aforementioned alienation process, have been used to carry out
necessary reforms. In this connection, 47.41% of total investments
in Defence infrastructure during the 1993-1999 period were charged
to the proceeds of alienating public assets assigned to Defence, once
they were detached from the department after being declared
unnecessary for military use.

The forecast for investments of funds obtained by the agency
between 2000 and 2005 amounts to Ptas52.6 billion, 41% of the total
investment in infrastructure (Ptas127.268 billion), while estimated
investments through the budget account for 59% of the total, or
Ptas74.668 billion. These percentages show the importance of the
agency’s action as an alternative source of funding and an instrument of infrastructure policy.

###### Environment

Protecting the environment has become a permanent challenge
for society. This has given rise to a collective awareness of the problem of environmental degradation and immoderate use of our
planet’s natural resources stemming from man’s direct action on

nature in his quest for progress through economic and technological development. The Ministry of Defence is not oblivious to these
concerns and has adopted different initiatives designed to reconcile
the tasks and training of the Armed Forces with protecting and
safeguarding the environment.

In this field, the Ministry of Defence’s action policy is directed
at conserving, protecting and, if necessary, restoring the environmental conditions at its facilities, firing ranges and areas assigned
to military use. For this purpose, a Defence Committee for Environmental Protection was set up in 1992 to propose and supervise
plans and advise on these issues, undertaking to play an active role
in this area.

For some time now the Armed Forces have been involved in a
variety of environmental actions, particularly reforestation at
bases, training camps and firing ranges, as well as fire prevention
and support in the extinguishing of fires.

The Department’s environmental policy is basically designed to
achieve the following objectives:

-  Raise the individual and collective awareness of the members
of the Armed Forces through training, information and other
documentary programmes.

CHAPTER VI: MODERNISATION

-  Implement projects for the improvement of energy use, use of
non-polluting energy and development of highly renewable
energy sources.

-  Maintain the ecosystems of military zones, reuse and recycle
waste and reduce waste generation.

-  Prevent and fight against pollution through actions designed
to avoid or lessen damage and spillage, limit noise and emanations and monitor all the consequences of military activities on the environment.

-  Collaborate with other national and international public
authorities responsible for environmental conservation.

In order to implement these policies, the Ministry of Defence
has passed regulations and established an Environmental Management System to make environmental conservation and improvement compatible with the activities of the Armed Forces. These
measures were applied for the first time at the Sierra de Retín training camp in Barbate (Cádiz) and at the El Palancar and Hoyo de
Manzanares firing ranges (Madrid) and at Getafe Air Base
(Madrid). It is planned to establish them at other facilities and
premises in the future, including the headquarters of the central
organs.

The importance the Ministry of Defence attaches to conserving
the environment can be gauged from the investments made in this
field, despite the restrictive budgets. In 1999 environmental spending amounted to over Ptas2 billion. These actions will continue to
be implemented in the future, evidencing our Armed Forces’ commitment to the conservation, protection and restoration of the environment.

##### CHAPTER VII

### RATIONALISING AND ADAPTING THE DEFENCE STRUCTURES

The aforementioned report of the Joint Congress-Senate Commission stated that the rationalisation and reduction of the current
organisational structures and the enhancement of all types of
administrative procedures is one of the general principles that
should underpin the new Armed Forces model, in order to achieve
more effective management and make the most of the available
human and financial resources.

Putting this principle into practice in fact entails a thorough
restructuring—which would be required in any case as a result of
the changes in the strategic environment and Spain’s bigger role in
international security and defence organisations. The aim is to
achieve an effective defence system on a par with those of our
allies, and to take full advantage of the resources available.

Rationalising structures and methods will affect the department
as a whole, that is, the Basic Administrative Structure of the central

staff, the Operational Command Structure and the Force Structure,
as well as the territorial or peripheral organisation. The decisions
stemming from the overhaul of these structures will be implemented progressively and, if necessary, will be preceded by the appropriate legislative reform.

###### Adapting basic defence criteria to the new strategic environment

The Organic Law on the basic criteria for national defence and
the military organisation, enacted in 1980 and subsequently
amended in 1984, is the basic legal framework for the current
defence structure. Since then, the strategic, political and social circumstances in which the Law was conceived have undergone deep
changes and it is therefore necessary to undertake a review process
to adapt the aforementioned criteria and military organisation to
the new reality. Although the most important factors in this evolution have been addressed in detail in previous chapters, it is interesting to cite them, albeit briefly:

Page 146 Defence White Paper

_Hummer Tow of the 3[rd]_ _Marine Battalion in Bosnia Herzegovina._

-  Emergence of a new European strategic landscape after the
end of the Cold War.

-  Consolidation of a broader concept of security which is closely related to foreign policy and goes beyond the traditional
scope of defence.

-  Spain’s integration into the new military structure of the
Atlantic Alliance, and active participation in European defence.

-  Professionalisation of the Spanish Armed Forces and abolishment of compulsory military service.

-  Gradually diminishing likelihood of having to adopt measures conceived for widespread war, particularly with respect
to a general mobilisation of resources.

**_Need to adapt organisation_**

The commitments undertaken at the Washington, Cologne and
Helsinki summits held in 1999 call for the adaptation of basic
defence criteria, since the Organic Law currently in force defines a
structure conceived for peacetime and, if necessary, for wartime,
without explicitly considering the possible use of force in crisis
management. As future potential armed conflicts will tend to
emerge as crisis situations, in which the political and diplomatic

CHAPTER VII: RATIONALISING AND ADAPTING THE DEFENCE STRUCTURES

mechanisms of international relations must continue to function,
co-ordination between foreign and defence policies is an essential
requirement for achieving, in such an event, the twofold aim of
safeguarding the interests at stake and preventing armed conflict.
Taking this idea even further, today we are not only concerned with
avoiding such conflict, by controlling the crises which could trigger
it, but also by countering its immediate effects. This will ensure the
maintenance of international stability, which has become a task that
on occasions requires the intervention of Armed Forces.

As a result, the administrative Defence structures need to be
adapted to the new strategic situation, facilitating the ongoing coordination between the senior Defence staff and that of the different government departments responsible for taking appropriate
action.

In the particular case of the Ministry of Defence, it is necessary
to specify in greater detail the powers and responsibilities of the
senior authorities, Chief of the Defence Staff, Secretary of State and
Under-Secretary for Defence, Army, Navy and Air Force Chiefs of
Staff, and the relations between them and with the Ministry of
Defence, in order to consolidate the Department’s organisational
structure in line with modern criteria of administration, management and use of force.

It also seems necessary to distinguish, within the general concept of crises, situations in which the chief role is one of protecting
civilians vis-à-vis natural disasters and similar emergencies from
others that require military means in order to be contained and settled. The functions of the Armed Forces in collaborating with the
civil authorities in cases of emergency will thus be separated from
other actions that relate to their essential tasks of defence or external action.

The current Organic Law on basic criteria mainly provides for a
wartime economy and the related needs of widespread mobilisation of resources. But this approach does not take into account current circumstances, in which there is more likely to be a need for
gradual use of available resources to prevent, manage or resolve
crises. In this regard, the current legislation on the extraordinary
allocation of resources to Defence should be revised, particularly in

relation to the provision of the materiel and supplies the forces
need, or the provision of essential services such as transport.

Similarly, according to the prevailing organisational criteria of
the military doctrine of the allied countries, there is a need to
update criteria on military organisation, which up to now has been
based on territory. This organisation must become increasingly
functional and be structured around the missions that need to be
performed by the forces and designed to achieve the objectives as
efficiently as possible, without overlap. Such an organisation will
be more flexible, readier to perform its missions and more suited to
operating with our partners and allies.

The current territorial organisation of the Armed Forces and the
peripheral organisation of the Ministry of Defence will therefore
need to be revised to simplify both structures as far as possible

###### Organisation of the Ministry of Defence

The Ministry of Defence, as a department of the administration
through which the Government develops and implements its
defence policy, is made up of the senior authorities that support the
ministry in exercising its responsibilities, the Army, the Navy and
the Air Force.

CHAPTER VII: RATIONALISING AND ADAPTING THE DEFENCE STRUCTURES

_Headquarters of the Ministry of Defence._

The organisation of the Ministry of Defence is aimed at providing a channel through which to develop the actions that make up
our Defence Policy, that is, those designed to support Spain’s
strategic conception, those which make the command and administration of the Armed Forces possible and those which serve to
maintain the necessary relationship between defence and society.

This organisation should be oriented towards a centralised,
smooth-running and co-ordinated management, joint action of the
Armed Forces, decentralised implementation of decisions and
more efficient use of the available resources.

The Ministry of Defence performs the activities aimed at administering, preparing and employing the Armed Forces. Its administrative structure should define accurately the tasks designed to
allow the administration of resources and operational function. Its
functions thus fall into different yet concurrent areas.

The overall revision the Ministry of Defence is to undertake will
be governed by three basic criteria, among others. First, the organisation is to be considered permanently as a whole that stems from
a global view of defence. Second, the structures are to be simplified
and reduced to make them run more smoothly and eliminate any
unnecessary elements. And lastly, the different processes that are
set in motion between the senior authorities to administer the

The technical and administrative complexity of these processes
at the Ministry of Defence requires centralised management and
decentralised implementation in order to achieve the best performance from the organisation as a whole and make the most of the
resources invested in it.

The Minister of Defence is responsible for the level of skills and
operational effectiveness of the Armed Forces and for the overall
administration of the resources allocated to them. He also exercises
the regulatory and disciplinary powers vested in him by law. In
exercising his powers, he has the support of the senior staff of the
department. The Chief of the Defence Staff is the main person

Defence White Paper Page 151

CHAPTER VII: RATIONALISING AND ADAPTING THE DEFENCE STRUCTURES

responsible for the level of preparation and the degree of joint and
combined operational effectiveness of the forces, supervising their
level of skills and operational effectiveness by delegation from the
Ministry of Defence and prioritising their needs. The Secretary of
State for Defence is responsible for budgetary policy, and the policies for armaments and materiel and infrastructure. For his part,
the Under-Secretary for Defence is in charge of personnel policy
and that of the organisation and general administration of the
department. The Army, Navy and Air Force Chiefs of Staff are each
responsible for the level of training and degree of operational effectiveness of their respective forces.

When revising the Department’s organisation, it should be borne
in mind that the raison d’être of the Ministry of Defence is the effectiveness of the Armed Forces. This effectiveness is, in turn, the best
gauge of how successful the organisation is, since the usefulness that
society perceives from the public services rendered by the Ministry of
Defence is precisely the availability and effectiveness of the Armed
Forces in any circumstance in which their action may be required.

In order to facilitate the application of these criteria, the difficulty sometimes posed by the dispersion of the Army, Navy and
Air Force headquarters and the Administrative Headquarters
should be overcome. A medium-term objective to ensure more
dynamic relations between them is to group together in a single
building the administrative arm of the Ministry and the Army,
Navy and Air Force headquarters.

**_Operational Command Structure of the Armed Forces_**

The purpose of the Operational Command of the Armed Forces
is Force employment. Although the President of the Government
can personally direct the action of the forces, in normal circumstances the Minister of Defence is legally delegated by the President
to order, co-ordinate and direct such action. The Armed Forces
therefore act under the authority of the President of the Government
and the Minister of Defence, through the military authorities which
make up the Operational Command Structure of the Armed Forces.

Spain’s membership of the Atlantic Alliance entails making provisions for defending national territory, should the need arise,
under the leadership of the Southern Allied Command Europe,

of the allied air defence system through the Air Operations Centre

As a result, the Operational Command Structure for force
employment must not only allow the Armed Forces to act jointly in
dealing with a localised conflict in the purely national sphere; it must
also be perfectly compatible with that of NATO, in order to ensure
interoperability and, if necessary, a rapid transfer of authority over

human, material and financial resources required by a command

-  Joint action, to facilitate the joint, integrated and effective use

Structure to the new needs will inevitably affect the current territorial command structures and will entail the gradual elimination of
those which are no longer necessary.

But the overhaul of the Operational Command Structure must
be more thorough. In view of the new international situation and

The Higher Centre for Defence Intelligence (CESID), whose
main task is to cater to the general information needs of the State,

is becoming increasingly important in security and defence owing
to globalisation, new risks and the appearance of new non-State
players on the strategic scene. These factors require it to collaborate
closely with the Ministry of Defence and, in particular, the Armed
Forces Intelligence Centre, so that information and intelligence contribute to coping with risks, preventing conflicts and, if possible,
avoiding crisis situations.

All this will furnish defence policy with a multidirectional prevention and anticipation capability for detecting problems while
they are still at an embryonic stage, preventing their possible mutation and, should the need arise, being in a position to propose and
execute the actions the Government deems appropriate.

**_Force Structure_**

A basic consideration, which should be a prevalent feature of
the Armed Forces’ permanent readiness for the action, is that the
Force Structure should be able to provide military resources with
the appropriate availability and combat capability so as to graduate their use from the outset of a crisis.

The criteria for the revision of the Force Structure stem from a
conception of the Armed Forces that places the emphasis on projecting military capabilities rather than exclusively defending terri

tory or controlling the geographical areas over which the country
has sovereignty.

The response to the need to project forces should be realistic and
centred on effectiveness, steering away from impracticable costs, and
endeavouring at all times to make full and co-ordinated use of the
capabilities available, in accordance with their specific possibilities.

The readiness of our forces is generally in line with the current
allied structure, which establishes the following categories according to availability: Reaction Forces, Main Defence Forces and Augmentation Units. This classification of the forces into the aforementioned categories mainly stems from allied planning for collective
defence missions and other less demanding tasks, such as crisis
management and peace operations.

This classification gives an idea of the order in which the forces
can be expected to be used in any situation requiring the use of the
military. Nonetheless, all the Armed Forces units, particularly those
which make up the main combat forces, must be sufficiently
endowed with personnel and materiel and properly trained. Another
matter is the degree of readiness, which indicates their capability to
react rapidly to a specific operational situation in a certain theatre,
and this depends, among other factors, on the logistic priorities
assigned to them when making provision for their possible use.


Defence White Paper Page 157

CHAPTER VII: RATIONALISING AND ADAPTING THE DEFENCE STRUCTURES

_Marine Brigade troops during exercises with the Italian Navy._

In addition to constituting joint forces in the strictly national
sphere, this structure, as mentioned earlier, allows units to be supplied to NATO for allied collective defence planning. It also enables
units to be committed to the Alliance’s Combined Joint Task Force,
missions led by the United Nations or, when the time comes, operations implemented under the leadership of the European Union.

In the current strategic environment, the Reaction Forces, owing
to their greater readiness and availability, are the most likely to provide the necessary instruments for peace and crisis control operations, as well as in the early stages of a possible larger-scale conflict.
The common characteristics of the reaction forces, apart from those
cited above, are high strategic mobility, flexibility and combat
power, as well as capacity for sustained action. All these characteristics are suited to the type of mission they are required to perform.
Their fast deployment depends on their readiness for action and
this, in turn, depends on a high and permanent level of training,
maintenance of the effectiveness of the materiel and the continual
availability of the necessary levels of supplies.

The Reaction Forces consist of a combination of ground, naval
and air units prepared for rapid deployment. Bearing in mind the
resources available, a reasonable size for the Reaction Force, with
respect to ground units, would be one that enables rapid deploy

ment in a single theatre of a brigade-sized force with fire, combat
and logistic support, or two tactical battle groups in two different
theatres. As for naval forces, a naval group with maritime air and
amphibious capabilities based respectively on a carrier-based air
unit and a Marine amphibious group and, with respect to the air
units, the projection of an air group consisting of two combat
squadrons, among other airforce resources.

Sustaining this effort requires reaction forces larger than those
deployed—approximately three times the size—to permit the units
to be relieved from the field of operations by means of an appropriate rotation system.

Should the development of the situation so require, the Armed
Forces must be in a position to undertake an additional effort,
which would consist of deploying a large force (no larger than division-size), in a single theatre, or two brigades in two different theatres, other naval combat units, including the Marine Brigade and
four Air Force combat squadrons. Ability to execute this additional
effort will depend on the capability to supply logistic support to
the deployed forces. This task will be more demanding the further
away the areas of operations. In order to keep up this effort indefinitely, additional resources to those normally allocated to defence
are likely to be needed.

CHAPTER VII: RATIONALISING AND ADAPTING THE DEFENCE STRUCTURES

In the event that a major conflict were to erupt, the Main Defence
Forces and, if necessary, the Augmentation Forces, would be required.

The adoption of a structure classifying the forces into categories
according to availability is perfectly compatible with the specific
organisational structures of the Army, Navy and Air Force, whose
specific characteristics with respect to grouping into units should
meet the Armed Forces’ administration and training criteria, and
not necessarily those of their operational use.

These and other very similar concepts will prevail in NATO’s
new force structure that will emerge from the revision undertaken
as a result of the criteria laid down in the new Strategic Concept
and the Defence Capabilities Initiative. This revision will place special emphasis on determining the essential operational capabilities
of the forces and their availability requirements, in order to
respond appropriately to missions arising in the foreseeable strategic environment of the next few years.

In peacetime, the base and support structure constitutes a link
between units and territory through the appropriate deployment of
the forces. This geographical deployment of the units will meet
national strategic needs and will be reviewed in accordance with
the principles of concentration and economy of resources. The general tendency will be to station units at bases where they have the
necessary logistic support and to limit their numbers, making the
most of existing infrastructure possibilities.

One of the rationalisation measures with furthest-ranging
social consequences—as it generally has considerable impact on
the areas in question—is adaptation of infrastructure. The reduction in the size of the forces makes it necessary to close down or
deactivate facilities that are no longer needed. This is because,
bearing in mind the ever-limited budget, it would not be logical to
cease to cater to priority operational needs and maintain infrastructures that are not consistent with sound criteria of military
effectiveness.

Without this effort to adapt the defence mechanism to the new
realities, in a verifiable manner and with specific plans to bring
about thorough changes, it would not be possible to face the challenges of the 21[st] century with guarantees of success.

###### Rationalisation of management

In order for the Armed Forces to act effectively in performing
their missions, the working processes and force support means
must also be reviewed, as well as the force structure, in order to
optimise the management of the resources earmarked for this purpose. The main areas to be analysed, in order to determine and
apply concrete rationalisation measures, are human resources,
armaments and materiel, health and information technology and
communications.

**_Human resources_**

To improve the effectiveness of personnel management, the
related management centres within the Ministry need to be organised as homogeneously as possible, without damaging the specific
characteristics that should be preserved. An analysis of the training
aspect of management personnel at the department has been
undertaken, as well as an analysis of issues relating to postings,
promotion and personal motivation, in order to standardise and
streamline the processes.

The particular field of education needs to be thoroughly adapted to cater to the demand for a profile of professional servicemen

that differs greatly in terms of both quantity and quality to the previous combined model. An analysis is specifically being conducted
of the current structure of schools and training centres run by the
Department to tailor these facilities to new needs.

One of the guiding principles of military training is to apply
joint criteria to education in fields that are similar enough to be unified, while pursuing complementarity between different Armed
Forces centres.

The necessary joint mentality must be acquired and promoted at
the different levels of personnel training. The establishment of the
Armed Forces College for Higher Studies, which awards General
Staff diplomas to Army, Navy and Air Force officers and imparts
other advanced military studies courses, is a milestone in this
regard and sets a standard that the Ministry of Defence will continue to apply in its revision of the management, training and educational aspects of the support structure.

**_Armaments and materiel_**

The effectiveness of the Armed Forces largely depends on their
having an integrated logistic support system that makes the right
materiel available in the right place. Current structures, resources
and working are therefore being analysed to ascertain how they
can be improved to achieve better support with the minimum cost
in resources.

Although logistic support is an activity which can only be carried out jointly to an extent, owing to the specific characteristics of
the ground, naval and air forces and their respective spheres of
action, modern management methods should be adopted to
achieve effective support with the minimum cost in resources.
Efforts will be focused, in principle, on two objectives: to standardise the procurement of common elements as far as possible to make
the most of the market possibilities; and to achieve the necessary
interoperability with our allies.

Military health activities are carried out in the logistic-operational and medical care fields. The restructuring of this area stems

mainly from the need to adapt it to the new reality arising from
operations in a multinational environment and in theatres far from
home. It is therefore essential to be able to rely on medical facilities
and equipment that can be moved to different scenes of action in a
short time and can operate with the forces for the full length of time
they are stationed in the area of operations.

This logistic-operational priority is shared by the European
countries and, specifically, by our partners and allies. Recent
reports on the trends witnessed in the reorganisation of military
healthcare in the European countries, chiefly the NATO and WEU
members, show a clear tendency to reduce the size of the hospital
network to cover the needs of the forces, both in normal and crisis
situations.

Adapting to this new environment requires a rationalisation
process leading to a single Military Health Network, in line with
the global approach to the Armed Forces and geared to providing
the necessary health-logistic support—the chief objective that
underpins and justifies its existence.

The integration of hospitals into the Military Health Network
will allow logistic-operational healthcare support to be co-ordinated. It will likewise ensure that the military health professionals

maintain an appropriate level of medical effectiveness and are thus
able to perform their operational tasks when necessary. It will furthermore boost the cost effectiveness of the health services provided to the members of the Armed Forces and their families.

**_Information technology and communications_**

Management structures and procedures will be reviewed from
the perspective of assigning information technology and communications the major role that they deserve in modern organisations.

The modernisation currently under way in the Spanish Armed
Forces is closely linked to the use of information technology and
communications as indispensable tools for multiplying operational
capabilities while optimising resources. It requires an Indicative
Plan for Information Systems to be drawn up for the Department.

The guiding principles of the Indicative Plan for Information
Systems are: to organise these technologies so as to achieve the necessary integration in all the existing systems, networks and applications used by the defence system itself; and to integrate the Spanish system into the command and force structures of the Atlantic
Alliance and other international defence organisations to which
Spain belongs. When drawing up this plan, care will be taken to
ensure that the management and operational fields, despite their
different purposes and treatment of the information they handle,
can use common lines, terminals and systems, as well as establishing the relevant security measures for the suitable protection of
classified information.

##### CHAPTER VIII

### ECONOMIC SUPPORT OF DEFENCE

During the first half of the nineties, the changes in the strategic
landscape led to an overall downward adjustment in the defence
budgets of the western countries, in pursuit of what has been called
the peace dividend. Spain was no exception to this trend, and Spanish defence budgets have been successively adjusted and trimmed,
making it difficult to modernise the Armed Forces and affecting the
activity of the defence industry.

In this regard, it is significant that the Preamble to Guidance on
National Defence 1/96 stated that “as part of its contribution to the
common task of defence, and aware of the current shortcomings
deriving from the insufficient budgetary allocations in recent years,
a sufficient amount of funds will be earmarked to bringing the
Armed Forces into line with Spain’s rightful role”. It establishes criteria on the budgetary resources for Defence, stating that they
should be based on “realistic foundations, in order to allow the
gradual professionalisation of servicemen, and to adapt armaments, materiel, equipment and infrastructure to the needs”.

CHAPTER VIII: ECONOMIC SUPPORT OF DEFENCE

###### A supportive and effective Defence effort

Kosovo powerfully revived the aim to enhance the European
Union’s role in the international arena, confirming the words of
Monet, who once said of Europe that it only accepts change in the
face of need, and only sees need in the face of crisis. Europe is keen
to shed its role of a stage on which things happen and become a
player. In order to do so, it must rise to this challenge by means of
a collective defence effort from all the countries of the Union who
commit themselves to this endeavour, the burden of which must be
proportional to the respective economic capabilities. To invest in
defence is also to build Europe, and this responsibility cannot be
delegated to others. Spain’s position must be one of solidarity with
its European partners in this sphere.

The effort will largely result in economic growth, owing to the
technological innovation it entails and its repercussion on global
demand. Aware of the foregoing, Spain doubled its research and
development expenditure during the four-year period from 1996 to
1999 and is demonstrating its commitment to maintaining and promoting a modern, efficient and competitive defence industry in the
framework of European security policy.

What is required now is to raise the budgetary effort to the level
demanded by national interest. There is a logical connection

between the prominent role Spain wishes to secure for itself in the
international sphere and responsible compliance with the commitments entered into in security and defence matters, if it wants to
achieve a significance in keeping with its history and interests.

###### Current situation

Having dealt with the basic criteria that should govern the economic support of Defence, it is appropriate to point out that in 1996
Spain’s Armed Forces included 30,000 professional servicemen and
some 150,000 conscripts.

The Defence budget underwent a long series of reductions from
1990, when the non-financial part amounted to Ptas869.992 billion,
until 1993, by which time it was down to Ptas757.232 billion. Thereafter it began to recover slightly, reaching Ptas865.972 billion in
1996, 4.02 billion less than 6 years earlier.

It should furthermore be stressed that substantial cuts were
made in the initial appropriations, as for several years the amounts
shown in the following chart were stated as “Not Available”. This
led to a veiled reduction in the funds allocated to Defence through
agreements of the Council of Ministers.

After 1997, when the decision was taken on professionalisation,
international integration and modernisation, larger amounts were
allocated to Defence. A 4% increase was consolidated in 2000, in
order to meet the objectives set by the Government.

But the budget is not the only procedure used to earmark funds
to Defence. Another funding mechanism has been used to boost the

modernisation of equipment—the co-operation of the ministry of
industry, which is pre-financing the development of the three main
armaments programmes: the EF-2000 aircraft, the F-100 frigates
and the Leopard tank. This involves contributing funds to industry,
in the form of repayable zero-interest loans, which amounted to
Ptas123.131 billion and 115.536 billion in 1998 and 1999, respectively. The forecast for 2000 stands at Ptas140.515 billion.

In addition, the different budget laws have made the appropriations to finance the participation of Spanish units in international
peace operations extendible. This has amounted to an average
annual increase of an extra Ptas20 billion for paying wages, living
and running expenses and investments for the forces deployed
overseas.

Neither should we forget the authorisations granted by the Law
on Fiscal, Administrative and Social Measures, which allow the
Management of Defence Infrastructure and Facilities to cater to the
operational needs of the Armed Forces and finance their modernisation indirectly with the proceeds of the alienation of the movable
and immovable assets assigned to them by the Ministry.

It should also be borne in mind that the economic surpluses generated by the sales of military dwellings can be used to finance the
modernisation and professionalisation of the Armed Forces, after
deducting expenses in respect of support for geographic mobility.

It is important to stress that the future Ministry of Defence budgets should be in keeping with the goal of overall economic stability established by the Government as a basic requisite for Spain’s
general progress, and which basically pursues the following objectives:

accelerating the process of real convergence with the most

CHAPTER VIII: ECONOMIC SUPPORT OF DEFENCE

_The financial expense of the EF 2000 translates into our economic and social wellbeing._

In the medium and long term, this will specify a set of commitments, within the general economic guidelines of the State, that
validate and provide appropriate backing for concrete and attainable goals, quantifying the financial requirements of the Ministry of
Defence, in order to cover them sufficiently in each year’s budget.

This commitment to establish the economic support of Defence
must be both quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative, because no
commitment can be assumed without injecting funds into the
Defence system in absolute terms. Qualitative, because the very
structure should aid funding through saving, as the result of the
improved management and through the streamlining of the organisation.

The qualitative or internal effort, apart from the saving it can
generate, will contribute decisively to improving the quality of the
forces, as once the objective of full professionalisation is attained,
the goal will be set of progressively reducing the percentage of personnel expenses and increasing funds earmarked to materiel.

The idea is that, by the end of the first decade of the century,
Spain will have attained convergence with respect to the breakdown of budgetary expenditure with those Alliance members who
aspire to achieve excellence for their Armed Forces. The actual

Defence structure is thus firmly committed—albeit not without
considerable effort—to supporting professionalisation in the fullest
sense of the word, that is, Armed Forces that are professional, but
with substantially improved means at their disposal.

The quantitative, or external, commitment to providing economic support for Defence will translate into a progressive
improvement in expenditure, so that once the professionalisation
process is completed, we converge in real terms with our Alliance
partners and the most significant indicators are brought into line
with the average for the European NATO countries.

In this respect, promoting a stable and realistic financial framework in order to prevent budgetary uncertainty and set the standards for providing proper support to the professionalisation and
modernisation processes is considered an important objective. This
will enable the Armed Forces to become fully professional on a
gradual basis, afford stability to the procurement of materiel,
increase international co-operation, gradually raise budgetary allocations and boost the Defence industry.

This scenario must be based on quantifying specific objectives,
for which suitable provision will be made when allocating appropriations, combining national interests with the requirements of a
common policy of containing public spending.

The effort is considerable; so are the challenges that lie before
Spain at the dawn of the new millennium. Coherent thinking in a
mature society like our own no doubt points to an encouraging
future for the goals set.

##### APPENDIX A

### ARMS CONTROL AND CONFIDENCE- AND SECURITY- BUILDING MEASURES


The Helsinki Final Act (1975) gave rise to
the existing arms control process in Europe
and to confidence- and security-building
measures between States. This process is currently based on two main instruments which
control conventional weapons: the Treaty on
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe
(known as the CFE Treaty) and the 1999 Vienna Document on Confidence- and SecurityBuilding Measures. Both spring from the
“Document on confidence-building measures
and certain aspects of security and disarmament” adopted at Helsinki.

In the Helsinki Final Act, the signatory
countries declared their intention to respect
the principle of sovereignty in their mutual
relations; to refrain from resorting to the
threat or use of force; to accept and regard
their frontiers as inviolable; to settle disputes
using peaceful means; not to interfere in the
internal affairs of other States parties; and to


respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and peoples’ right to self-determination.

The Final Act also established a short list
of measures to foster mutual confidence in
the military sphere in order to contribute to
increase stability and security in Europe. To
this end, the States undertook to put into
practice a series of measures such as prior
notification of major military manoeuvres,
invitations to observers to attend the
announced manoeuvres, prior notification of
significant military activities and other measures such as visits of military delegations.

The process begun at Helsinki continued
with the Vienna negotiations and the meeting
of the then Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), held in Madrid
in 1983, where it was agreed on a mandate to
call a conference on Confidence- and Securi

APPENDIX A: ARMS CONTROL AND CONFIDENCE- AND SECURITY-BUILDING MEASURES


ty-Building Measures and Disarmament in
Europe. The first stage of the conference
materialised in the “Stockholm Document”
(1986), which increased the confidence-building measures provided for in the Helsinki
Final Act and established the possibility of
carrying out on-site verification inspections
within a State without the latter refusing, and
made it compulsory to inform other States
party when carrying out exercises or
manoeuvres above a certain level.

Later, in 1989, the closing document of the
CSCE Follow-up Meeting held in Vienna
agreed to establish two negotiation tracks:
the first, between the 35 member States, to
develop and enlarge the “Stockholm Document”; and the second, between NATO and
Warsaw Pact countries, to conduct negotiations on conventional armed forces in Europe
in order to establish a stable and secure balance, at the lowest levels, of conventional
weapons and equipment.

The fall of the Berlin Wall ushered in a
new international order for security, based
mainly on the Charter of Paris for a New
Europe, established by the CSCE in 1990.
Indeed, the Paris Charter was another important milestone on the path to building security in Europe vis-à-vis the new challenges the
old continent faced. At this summit, the
Heads of State and Government of the participant states declared that confrontation and
division in Europe had ended and that relations would thenceforward be based on
respect and co-operation, undertaking to
banish the use of force and instead settle disputes by peaceful means.

At Paris it was considered that the best
way of fostering security was to reduce
threats so as to diminish the likelihood of an
aggression, and, if the worst came to the


worst and the aggression occurred, also
reduce the resulting damage. The two
avenues established for this purpose were, on
the one hand, confidence building, and, on
the other, disarmament. These two efforts are
closely related as they both contribute to
shaping an increasingly stable and secure
international environment.

Confidence-building measures constitute
an ongoing negotiation process, in which dialogue and the negotiations themselves are
almost as important as the results. The aim is
to generate channels for communication and
commitment that raise the level of military
confidence. The Vienna Document, with its
successive reviews, is pivotal to these measures.

For its part, disarmament seeks to establish a stable and secure equilibrium with the
lowest possible levels of forces and to eliminate the capacity to launch surprise attacks
and large-scale initiatives. The Treaty on
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE),
which is applied to the area stretching from
the Atlantic Ocean to the Urals, is the cornerstone of European security.

In keeping with today’s global approach,
only the international forums are capable of
channelling and co-ordinating efforts to
establish effective arms control and foster
security and mutual confidence-building
measures. Spain collaborates at these international forums, determined to make a contribution that is in consonance with its possibilities.

As for the United Nations, our country
collaborates closely in all the Organisation’s
initiatives aimed at disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation. In particular,
Spain takes part in the Disarmament Confer

ence, of which it has been a member since
1996, and lends firm support to initiatives
designed to control Weapons of Mass
Destruction (nuclear, biological, chemical). It
is also a party to the Inhumane Weapons
Convention, and attaches particular importance to the second Protocol on Anti-personnel Mines and De-mining Activities. It furthermore collaborates by sending the annual
information requested by the UN relating to
the Register of Arms Transfers and defence
budgets and expenditures.


The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as the CSCE
came to be called from 1 January 1995
onwards, has not only promoted generally
applied international agreements like the
CFE Treaty, but also plays an important role
in the regional stabilisation of the Balkans, as
established in the Dayton Accords. Spain has
joined the framework of negotiations on disarmament and arms control in the area, as it
considers these are essential elements to the
stability of the region in the medium term.

Many of the disarmament and confidencebuilding initiatives and measures are
designed to shape a more secure and stable
Europe. However, this aim would be considerably less substantial were the security of
the Mediterranean not regarded as being
closely linked to that of the old continent. In
order to contribute to the stability and security of the Mediterranean basin, Spain is firmly
committed to fostering the Mediterranean
Dialogue within the multilateral organisations to which it belongs.

The Barcelona Process, which was set in
motion at the Summit in November 1995
under the aegis of the European Union, is an
essential tool for achieving the much-desired
shared peace and prosperity in the area.


_Disabling a tank in compliance with arms_
_reduction measures._

Spain is actively engaged in furthering this
process, the results of which are the commitment made by the Alliance at the Washington
Summit to give impetus to the Mediterranean Dialogue and the fact that one of the
EU’s first Common Foreign and Security Policy strategies precisely addresses the
Mediterranean.

The international community has directed
its efforts towards developing different arms
control and security- and confidence-building measures for conventional forces and
arms and for weapons of mass destruction.
This distinction is used in the following paragraphs to analyse in greater detail the mechanisms commonly accepted as valid instruments for keeping threats in check.

In 1996 it was decided to adapt the CFE
Treaty to the new situation in Europe, owing
chiefly to the demise of the Warsaw Pact and
to the future incorporation of some of its former members into the Atlantic Alliance. At the
meeting of the Joint Consultative Group on 30
March 1999, the States party reached a substantial agreement on matters regarded as pivotal to the subsequent signature of the Treaty
at the Istanbul Summit in November that year.


At the meeting, the OSCE’s role as European security organisation was strengthened,
and its operational capabilities were likewise
enhanced. As a further step towards the
design of a more stable and secure Europe, it
was agreed to modify the Treaty, reducing

APPENDIX A: ARMS CONTROL AND CONFIDENCE- AND SECURITY-BUILDING MEASURES


These measures,
which were subsequently developed in
the successive versions
of the 1990, 1992, 1994
and 1999 Vienna Documents, have made considerable headway in
this process as they are
politically binding and
have military significance within the socalled ATTU Zone
(from the Atlantic to
the Urals) accompanied by verification measures.

The Vienna Document is the best reflection of the OSCE’s negotiating efforts in the
field of confidence- and security-building
measures. It envisages an additional set of
measures to support and complement the
verification system of the CFE Treaty as
well as measures relating to the reduction of
risks through consultation and co-operation
mechanisms in matters of non-regular
military activities, dangerous military incidents and visits to military activities in
progress.

The Document requires the prior notification of certain military activities when they
surpass the set limits for personnel or equipment and makes some activities compulsory,
lowering the thresholds established in the
Stockholm Document and consequently
increasing transparency between member
States.

It also envisages the exchange of annual
global information. This exchange includes
information on military forces and their
organisation, systems of essential weapons
and equipment and planned deployments, as
well as defence planning, military budgets

accede to the Treaty. All the measures arising
from this amendment are pending ratification.

**_The Vienna Document_**

The successful implementation of the CFE
Treaty provisions has been complemented
by the confidence- and security-building
measures established in the 1986 Stockholm
Document. These measures stem from
Helsinki and from the concluding document
of the 1983 follow-up meeting in Madrid in
1983, in which the so-called CDE process
was begun. The aim of this process was “to
undertake, in stages, new, effective and concrete actions designed to make progress in
strengthening confidence and security and
in achieving disarmament, so as to give
effect and expression to the duty of States to
refrain from the threat or use of force in their
mutual relations”.

Measures to foster mutual confidence
between States are designed to promote a climate of relations that, rather than merely limiting the effects of the possible use of
weapons in a conflict, actually avert such
conflict by preventing it from occurring.

APPENDIX A: ARMS CONTROL AND CONFIDENCE- AND SECURITY-BUILDING MEASURES

and volume of personnel.


The Document
enables random verification of this information to be made
through “study visits”
to the units in question,
inspections of military
activities of which notification is compulsory
and visits of observers,
whose role is to provide guarantees that
the aforementioned
measures are fulfilled.
Lastly, provisions are
established for arms
transfers and standards are set by means of a
Code of Conduct on the political and military
aspects of security, stability and conflict prevention.

Impetus was recently given to this confidence- and security-building process by the
1999 Vienna Document agreed at the OSCE
Summit in Istanbul in November. In it the
States party approved a series of markedly
technical modifications, including proposals
to lower the number of troops. These proposals relate to notification and to the setting up
of information exchange mechanisms and
place greater emphasis on the regional
approach to security.

**_Register of Conventional Arms_**

The importance of the United Nations
Register of Conventional Arms should also
be stressed, as it is proving to be a decisive
instrument for promoting confidence and
transparency between States. Every year, the
States send the United Nations data and

information on their imports and exports of
seven types of conventional weapons. They
also include data on domestic production
and stocks, as well as establishing a national
contact point for dealing with issues related
to the Register. The data are made available
to the Secretariat and delivered to the other
States, on request. The information which is
distributed is published in a leaflet in English, French and Spanish.

**_Treaty on Open Skies_**

The OSCE Conference, held in Helsinki on
24 March 1992, served as a forum for the signature of the Treaty on Open Skies, according
to which the signatory countries would voluntarily open their airspace to allow overflight by observation craft. The aim of this
Treaty was basically to achieve a better guarantee of transparency between countries in
their military activities and, accordingly, to
facilitate the monitoring of the arms-control
agreements and strengthen the OSCE’s conflict-prevention and crisis-management capa

bility over a vast area of land and sea, from
Vancouver to Vladivostok.

The Treaty, which has a system of verification measures that complement those of the
CFE Treaty and the Vienna Document, will
come into force once a minimum of 20
States—including the Russian Federation,
Belarus and Ukraine—have deposited the
relevant instruments of ratification. So far
only twenty-four countries have ratified the
Treaty. Spain is among them.

Our country firmly backs this Treaty by
contributing equipment (cameras for aerial
photography), facilities and aerial resources
in order to standardise the equipment and
procedure to be followed when the Treaty
enters into force.

The signatory countries are currently
engaging in activities ranging from datagathering and training flights to the holding
of seminars and workshops to analyse the
data obtained.

**_Ottawa Convention on the prohibition of_**
**_the use, stockpiling, production, and_**
**_transfer of anti-personnel mines and their_**
**_destruction_**

With respect to anti-personnel mines,
which, used irresponsibly in large areas of
the planet, are a threat to the population sectors who have the least to do with conflicts,
mention should be made of the 1997 Ottawa
Convention, which totally bans the use,
stockpiling, production and transfer of
weapons of this kind and only allows possession of a limited number of them for the
training and teaching of the forces responsible for de-mining.

Spain signed the Convention on 3 December 1997 and deposited the relevant instru

ment of ratification at the United Nations
headquarters on 19 January 1999. During that
time Law 33/1998 of 5 October Totally Banning Mines and Weapons with Similar Effects
was enacted. This Law set even stricter deadlines for destroying stocks than the related
international agreements, as it established a
three-year period from its entry into force for
the destruction of all stocks.

The estimated cost of the mass destruction
of existing antipersonnel mines amounts to
over Ptas500 million, since the process uses
safe measures which respect the environment. Spain plans to eliminate a total of
827,361 mines, of which more than 60% have
now been destroyed.

Our country has furthermore taken part in
all the UN initiatives to set up a world demining fund, making contributions both unilaterally and as a member of the European
Union. It has also taken part in activities to
aid de-mining in South America, providing
technical experts, training courses, technical
equipment and funds in co-operation with
the Organisation of American States. It has
offered this aid at other forums, both bilaterally and in the framework of the EU and
WEU.

**_Regional stability and the_**
**_Dayton Accords_**

Appendix 1-B of the Dayton Accords is in
fact an agreement on regional stability. It is
concerned with arms control in an area that is
not covered by the CFE Treaty and between
the states or entities which have emerged following the dismemberment of the former
Yugoslavia. Article II specifically refers to
confidence- and security-building measures
in Bosnia and Herzegovina (similar to those
established in the Vienna Document) and

**_Future control of Short_**
**_Arms/Light Arms_**

Attention is now focused on controlling
short and light arms in order to prevent
problems arising from the destabilising
build-up and proliferation of small arms. In
this connection, the EU adopted a Joint
Action in December 1998, which complements the programme to prevent and combat the Illicit Traffic in Conventional Arms
and the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports
adopted in June 1998.

Spain has not only joined these EU initiatives, but also those currently being applied
by other international organisations (such as

study the different political, technical, legal
and commercial aspects arising from lack of
control of these weapons in certain parts of
the world.

An International Conference on Short
Arms/Light Arms is planned to take place in
2001 to deal with all related aspects. Its main
purpose is to establish controls to prevent
illicit traffic in these weapons and stop them
falling into the hands of terrorist groups and
from increasing instability in certain geographical areas.

**Measures related to weapons of mass**

**_Reduction and limitation_**
**_of nuclear weapons_**

As a complement to the SALT treaties of the
seventies, the Treaty on the Reduction and
Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (START
I) was signed in 1991 by the United States and
the then Soviet Union, marking the start of a
sizeable reduction in strategic weapons.

That same year, 1991, as a result of the
application of the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), the last of these
weapons, whose deployment had triggered
the so-called Euro-missile crisis in the eighties, were eliminated from Europe. The Treaty
aimed to eliminate—and, indeed, had completely achieved this by 1991—all groundlaunched ballistic and cruise missiles with a
range between 500 and 3,500km. It is still in
force, thus preventing new arsenals of such
weapons from being built up. The Atlantic
Alliance, in turn, took the decision to withdraw the nuclear warheads of short-range
arms from Europe at its meetings at Taormina, Rome and Brussels.


Following the dissolution of the Soviet
Union and the transfer to Russia of Ukraine’s
and Belarus’s nuclear arsenals, the START II
Treaty was signed in 1993 and has been ratified by the Russian Federation, which cites
economic reasons and shows certain political
misgivings about the enlargement of the
Atlantic Alliance to take in former members
of the Warsaw Pact. It is hoped that Russia
can soon ratify the Treaty, thereby enabling
negotiations to start immediately for a possible START III Treaty, in order to achieve more
ambitious goals in the process of nuclear disarmament.

The ABM Treaty on the limitation of
antiballistic missiles, signed and ratified by
the then Soviet Union and the United States
in 1972, is today an essential and complementary element of the START Treaties, as it
maintains nuclear deterrence through the
concept of “mutual assured destruction”.

The idea of “mutual assured destruction”
is in fact a guarantee of stability between the
two powers, based on a balance of nuclear
capabilities. Each party is aware that the use
of nuclear weapons by either of them would
lead unavoidably to mutual destruction. This
balance would be upset if either of the parties, through a higher level of technology,
could make use of antiballistic missiles to
substantially cancel out the effects of the use
of the other’s nuclear weapons.

It is important to bear in mind the significance of the validity of the ABM Treaty for
Russia, now that the significance of its conventional forces has diminished and, accordingly, its deterrent capability. The Treaty is
currently at an initial review stage, with a
view to mitigating the effects of the possible
limited use of nuclear weapons by third
powers.

APPENDIX A: ARMS CONTROL AND CONFIDENCE- AND SECURITY-BUILDING MEASURES


**_Treaty on the Non-proliferation_**
**_of Nuclear Weapons_**

This Treaty, to which Spain has been party
since 1987, entered into force in 1970 with 25
years duration. At the 1995 Review and
Extension Conference it was extended indefinitely. By the end of December 1998, 187
States were party to the Treaty.

By means of this Treaty, the non-nuclear
States undertake not to manufacture atomic
weapons or other nuclear devices, and the
nuclear States undertake not to transfer
weapons or other devices of this kind to any
other State. The Treaty marks the tendency to
negotiate the end of the arms race and
achieve full disarmament.

The possibility of amending the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear
Material to incorporate the problem of illicit
traffic is currently being debated. There is
also speculation about a treaty banning the
production of fissionable material for the
manufacture of nuclear weapons and other
explosive nuclear devices.

**_Comprehensive Test-ban Treaty_**

This Treaty, signed by Spain in 1996 and
ratified in 1998, has not yet entered into
force. In order to take effect, the Treaty establishes that it must be ratified by 44 States
with the capacity to manufacture nuclear
weapons (such as Spain) and, of course, the
nuclear powers (of the latter, France and the
United Kingdom also ratified the Treaty in
1998).

The basic obligations stem from each signatory State’s promise not to conduct any
nuclear explosions and to ban and prevent all
such explosions on the territory under its


jurisdiction or control. The States party furthermore undertake not to cause or encourage the explosion of nuclear weapons or to
take part in them in any way.

The procedures for action are based on: a
verification system of surveillance and
inspection between States; confidence-building measures to be taken voluntarily in
respect of notification of any explosion in
which energy of 330 tonnes of TNT or more is
released; and sanctions ranging from deprival of the rights and privileges conferred by
the Treaty to the adoption of collective measures in accordance with international law.

**_Biological Weapons Convention_**

World awareness of the hazards triggered
by the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is evidenced by the inspection
and verification mechanisms laid down in
the 1993 Convention on the Prohibition of the
Development, Production, Stockpiling and
Use of Chemical Weapons and in the 1972
Biological Weapons Convention. In this connection, the Rio de Janeiro Declaration of 29
June 1999, signed during the European
Union-Ibero-American Summit, agreed to
strengthen the disarmament process, placing
special emphasis on the nuclear, chemical
and biological fields.

The European Union gives maximum priority to concluding negotiations on the Protocol on the Verification of Biological Weapons,
which will lend credibility and reliability to
the related 1972 Convention.

**_Chemical Weapons Convention_**

Spain attaches great importance to the
Chemical Weapons Convention, which has


Defence White Paper Page 183


-----

APPENDIX A: ARMS CONTROL AND CONFIDENCE- AND SECURITY-BUILDING MEASURES


been in force since April 1997 and is based in
The Hague. This Convention not only provides for the destruction of chemical
weapons, but also the monitoring of any
product which may contribute, whether
directly or indirectly, to the manufacture of
chemical weapons, such as products with a
dual use.

This Convention sprang from the 1925
Geneva Protocol and the 1972 Biological
Weapons Convention aimed at establishing a
special treatment for chemical weapons, substances, components and precursors and
their production and storage facilities. A
preparatory committee set up the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons, which is based in The Hague, and
its working structure: the Conference of
States Party, the Executive Council and the
Technical Secretariat. The Convention establishes a system of annual statements on the
production and storage of chemical substances and precursors and the related facilities, according to their classification and production volume. Inspections are carried out


as a result of denouncement of another State
party or declarations of the States party. Very
strict rules are laid down on the protection of
confidential information. So far some 600
inspections have been carried out, 60% in the
US.

The improvements noted so far in the
fields of conventional weapons/forces and
weapons of mass destruction would not be
complete without systems to monitor the
exports of products that may contribute
directly or indirectly to manufacturing these
weapons and their launch vectors. Spain is a
member of the Missile Technology Control
Regime, the Australia Group, the Nuclear
Suppliers Group, the Zängger Committee
and the Wassenaar Arrangement. The countries which belong to these groups are making a major effort to promote transparency, in
order to spread the message that their aim is
not to hinder the exchange of products and
technology between States, but rather to

##### APPENDIX B

### THE ARMY


The Army is the component of the Armed
Forces which is specifically designed to
secure and maintain military control of the
territory in an area of operations. The physical occupation of the land consolidates the
objectives achieved in conjunction with other
forces, whether national or multinational,
enabling a stable situation to be established
on the basis of the results obtained during
operations.

The structure of the Army comprises a
varied set of resources, organised and trained
to perform a broad range of military operations. In an effort to adapt to the requirements of the strategic environment, a reform
has been undertaken over the past decade.
This reform not only affects the Army’s structure and deployment, but also its very strategic foundations. Indeed, there has been a
shift from a conception oriented almost
exclusively to defence of national territory to


another which, without neglecting this essential task, envisages a broader scope of action
that includes other possible scenarios relating
to missions performed within the framework
of the international security organisations to
which Spain belongs.

Peace and humanitarian assistance operations, as well as crisis control, call for additional requirements to those needed for
conventional military operations. This adaptation to current needs is shaping the multifunctional nature of the Army, which should
not diminish its essential combat capability,
but rather, if anything, complement and even
enhance it.

The modernisation and lightening of the
units envisaged in the so-called “Plan Norte”
stem from criteria shared with our allies,
which are tending to make their forces more
flexible, interoperable and highly mobile. The

lar Operational Command structure under
which they are to perform their missions.
The ground, naval or
air forces needed to
carry out operations
may occasionally be
transferred to a NATO
Operational Command,
as explained in Chapter VII.

The Manoeuvre
Force is the Army’s
main and permanent
core element. Its personnel and equipment
are readily available and enable it to act
rapidly in response to crisis situations. Its
units reinforce the Area Defence Forces vis-àvis any risk to territorial integrity or the exercise of sovereignty and implement Spain’s
international commitments overseas. They
are also in a position to collaborate with the
civil authorities in the event of natural disasters or similar events.

In order to perform these missions both
nationally and in the framework of Spain’s
international commitments, the Manoeuvre
Force comprises a Mechanised Division, a
Spanish Rapid Reaction Division, a Mountain
Brigade, a Cavalry Brigade and a Support
Nucleus with the necessary fire support,
combat support and logistic means.

The Area Defence Forces are responsible
for the immediate defence of the insular
regions or enclaves where they are stationed,
within national territory, in accordance with
the relevant Operations Plans. They also collaborate in civilian protection actions within
their area of responsibility.


_M-60 tank platoon of the 12[th]_ _Armoured Brigade._

The Canary Islands Command and the
Command Headquarters of the Balearic
Islands and Ceuta and Melilla are part of
these Forces.

The Specific Forces for Joint Action are
those which, together with other elements of
the Armed Services, contribute to developing
joint capabilities such as military communications, and, as required, to the Air Defence
Plans and Plans for the Control of the Strait of
Gibraltar.

These forces are composed of: the Transmissions Command, which has a Strategic
Transmissions Regiment, an Electronic Warfare Regiment and a Special Services Battalion; the Antiaircraft Artillery Command,
with five regiment-sized units; and the
Coastal Artillery Command, which has two
regiments.

The Reconstitution Defence Forces help
defend Spain’s interests in conflicts requiring
larger numbers of troops than the Standing
Force has. Plans are drawn up for this pur

##### APPENDIX C

### THE NAVY


The basic characteristics of the naval
forces are determined by the maritime environment and its ways of action. The sea is an
open space which can be freely crossed, without affecting the sovereignty of any other
State, near the place where our interests lie.
Ships can remain at sea for long periods with
full autonomy, and this enables the forces
deployed in an area of operations to act when
ordered to, applying different capabilities
flexibly: surface, air, amphibious, submarine,
minesweeping and maritime surveillance.

The chief mission of the Navy is to ensure
the free use of the maritime routes, which are
a particularly significant interest in the case
of Spain, as it is a country with a vast coastline, archipelagos and enclaves, heavily
dependent on trade and on the exploitation
of marine resources. However, the strategic
environment does not pose great risks for
navigation. Therefore, the navies of the allied


countries—particularly that of Spain—currently gear their capabilities to exerting
influence from the sea over coastal areas of
operations far from national territory in
what is also a characteristic mission of the
Navy.

These capabilities constitute a type of
action that is particularly suited to crisis scenarios, even when the latter occur in very
remote theatres where our interests are affected, or where co-operation with the allies
should take place. When this situation is not
clearly defined and developments are difficult to predict, the strategic mobility and freedom of action of the naval forces make a
unique contribution to the joint effort.
Depending on how the crisis develops, they
provide time for the intervention of most of
the ground and air forces, co-operating in
their deployment and strengthening or supporting their action in the area of operations.

##### APPENDIX D

### THE AIR FORCE


The main characteristics of the Air Force
derive precisely from the environment in
which its operations are conducted, which is
not bound by geographical barriers and
extends uninterruptedly over land and sea.
Air superiority is a prior consideration in
planning and developing any military operation nowadays.

The Spanish Air Force comprises a set
of human and material resources whose
purpose is to project military potential at
any time with an extremely rapid response
and great precision, even to a long range.
It can thus exert a decisive influence on a
particular situation from the air and space,
at the time and place required to defend
national interests. It is a cost-effective and
suitable instrument for managing and controlling crises, and for supporting Spain’s
external action. It is also a necessary element for achieving the superiority


required prior to the action of ground and
naval forces.

The Air Force possesses a permanent
rapid reaction and projection capability. It
maintains a high degree of availability at all
times—there are always aircraft ready to take
off immediately on air defence missions. For
other operations, or in crisis situations, to
have aircraft ready and on the alert with a
substantial combat or transport capability is a
small supplementary effort to be made on top
of daily training operations, and enables
strategic decisions to be implemented shortly
after being taken.

This capability is based on the three characteristic tenets of air power. The first of these is
flexibility, which stems from its special advantage in handling time and space, high availability and ability to concentrate and disperse
substantial firepower with few resources.

APPENDIX D: THE AIR FORCE

The second key factor is precision, as the
close relationship between technology and
air power makes it possible to switch almost
immediately from delivering heavy attacks
to pinpointing targets
exactly, depending on
the most appropriate
course of action. Guided weapons and modern integrated navigation and firing systems

APPENDIX D: THE AIR FORCE


The Air Force that
Spain will have at the
beginning of the 21[st]

century has been
planned well in advance and is currently
taking shape through
different programmes
to acquire and modernise weapons, materiel and infrastructure and through the
training and preparation of its personnel.

The Air Force of the
new millennium is
being shaped to provide an appropriate response, in the new
geostrategic environment, to the different
risks and challenges which Spain must face in
the field of security and defence. It is increasingly important in future for the air forces to
be able to act as integrated elements of the different European and Euro-Atlantic multinational structures. The Spanish Air Force will
therefore have the capacity to operate in an
integrated fashion both in NATO and within
the European defence organisations.

It will furthermore have a greater capacity
to project forces within a multinational environment to areas where our presence is
required to help avert and manage crises, and
to back peace operations and government
decisions.

port, complement and aid the action of the
other units. They have several squadrons for
training air force pilots. There is also one
squadron which supports the military parachuting school, 2 squadrons for transporting
personnel (aircraft and helicopters), 1
squadron to combat forest fires and 1
squadron of specialised services (retraining
of pilots, towing targets, etc.).

All these units are deployed in airbases
and military aerodromes across Spain, which
are classified, according to their capability,
into principal operational, deployment and
reserve bases. The aeronautical facilities of
some of these bases are open to civilian air
traffic or are shared with other national aeronautical entities.

##### APPENDIX E

### THE SPANISH ARMED FORCES IN THE MULTINATIONAL SPHERE


Spain’s defence and security commitments extend particularly to the areas of the
Atlantic Alliance, the European Union and
the Western European Union, and are basically regulated by the mutual defence clause
of the Washington and amended Brussels
treaties. Like the rest of the allied countries,
Spain contributes most of its defence
resources to shared security and has made
the whole of its Army Manoeuvre Force and
Fleet available to NATO, as well as all its air
force combat, combat support and transport
squadrons. All these forces are also at the
disposal of the Western European Union.

The aforementioned commitments
include, among others, pledging forces to
the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC)
and the Allied Mobile Force (AMF). Spain
has also assigned a frigate to the NATO
Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT) and another to the NATO


Standing Naval Force Mediterranean
(STANAVFORMED), participates in the
Combined Amphibious Force Mediterranean
(CAFMED) and has recently committed a
minesweeper to the Mine Countermeasures
Force Mediterranean (MCMFORMED),
which became active in May 1999. It is also
part of the NATO Airborne Early Warning
Force (NAEW).

The new crisis management missions arising from the new strategic environment,
which are geared mainly to peacekeeping
and projecting stability, led to agreements
between some NATO and WEU members
over the 90s to establish multinational forces
which can be used more effectively in operations of this kind.

Spain, in response to this need, has
committed itself politically and militarily to
several of the most important initiatives. The

The idea of promoting the creation of an
on-call (as opposed to non-permanently constituted) European naval air force emerged at
the meeting of the Spanish, French and Italian defence ministers which took place in
Rome in September 1992.

After this idea was presented to the Group
of Defence Representatives of the WEU on
October 1 that same year, the May 1993
Council of Ministers in Rome set the Planning Cell the task of developing it, thus giving rise to Plan Combined Endeavour.

In October 1993, during the tripartite exercise known as “Ardente”, the defence ministers of the three countries agreed at Grosseto
to resume the initial project to develop the
force in a trilateral framework, adding a


The purpose of establishing these two
forces was none other than to provide a European response capability in line with the new
missions defined by the WEU in the Petersberg Declaration, such as humanitarian operations, peacekeeping and peacemaking, and
crisis management.

The performance of these missions should
not prevent its units taking part in common
defence operations as provided in the amended Brussels Treaty and the Washington Treaty.

The founding documents were signed by
the representatives of the three nations on 15
May 1995 in Lisbon, moments before the
WEU Council of Ministers began. Portugal
joined both forces on this same occasion.

EUROFOR has a maximum size of a light,
and easily deployable division. Its permanent
multinational headquarters are in Florence.
Spain contributes a brigade-sized military
capability to this force.

Since it became active in June 1998, EUROFOR has carried out all kinds of exercises as

##### APPENDIX F

### PEACE AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE OPERATIONS


**Peace Operations**

Peace operations may range from simple
humanitarian assistance to the complex task
of making peace between two adversaries.
They are based on the principles of legitimacy, multinationality and limited use of force.
They also require certain negotiating and
mediation skills, though their real effectiveness undoubtedly depends on the legitimate
effective power that backs their actions as a
whole. This legitimacy stems from the consensus of the international community,
through shared security organisations and,
in some cases, from the application of the
principle of intervention for humanitarian
reasons when there is serious human rights
violation.

Since 1945, over a hundred conflicts have
taken place in the world. The United Nations
intervened for the first time in Palestine in


1948, before Spain joined the UN, to supervise the truce that followed the first ArabIsraeli clash. Between then and 1988, thirteen
such operations were recorded.

Since the Cold War ended there has been
an increase in this type of activity. Thirty
eight peace support operations have been
organised, nineteen of which are led directly
by the United Nations, and the others have
been carried out by different regional organisations, such as the Organisation for Security
and Co-operation in Europe, the European
Union and NATO, in accordance with a Security Council resolution. Most of them were
conducted in the nineties. As a reference, the
UN has organised forty eight operations, of
which sixteen are still active. Seventy five
countries take part in these operations with
over fourteen thousand men, not to mention
the almost eighty thousand serving in the former Yugoslavia.


Defence White Paper Page 211

APPENDIX F: PEACE AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE OPERATIONS

The possibility of having to resort to use of
force to achieve peace in some cases makes
the military one of the most suitable instruments for carrying out operations to support
peace and humanitarian assistance. Although
they are obviously not designed for such missions, there is no doubt that they are the only
organisations truly capable of performing
them.

It should be borne in mind that operations
of this kind have certain special qualities. On
the one hand, they require military units previously to have undergone specific training
to familiarise them with tasks which are not
habitually required of them and appear
strange to them. But on the other, it is necessary to avoid the risk of specialising some
units almost exclusively in peace operations,
as this would distort the primary purpose for
which they were conceived, as military units.


We should therefore realise that military
units are suitable for peace operations precisely because they are prepared for combat,
and that is the key to their deterrent power
and effectiveness.

**_United Nations_**

Article 24 of the United Nations Charter
vests the Security Council with the primary
responsibility for maintaining international
peace and security, and Chapter VII empowers the organisation to adopt coercive measures when peace is endangered.

The United Nations is the international
organisation with the most experience in
planning, deploying and directing peacekeeping operations. Not in vain have fifty
years elapsed since it deployed its first mission of military observers to the Middle East
in June 1948, and over forty since the first


_Legion checkpoint in Kosovo._

A major difference between early and current peace operations lies in the type of conflicts. Whereas the first operations were
undertaken to mediate in conflicts between
states such as Palestine or Kashmir, nowadays they are usually a response to internal
disputes, as in the cases of Somalia, Rwanda
and Sudan.

Another distinctive characteristic of
the new peace operations is the intervention of large military contingents to enable
the international organisations to perform
their tasks and also allow the activity of
non-governmental organisations, which
in many cases provide the initial urgent response to humanitarian problems
while multinational intervention is decided on.

**Humanitarian assistance operations**

When human disasters occur—whether
owing to natural causes or as a result of war—
the international community, pressured by
public opinion, faces the need to come to the
urgent aid to the victims and, more often than
not, in hostile conditions. Armed Forces’
availability and deterrent capability once
again make them the most appropriate instruments for performing such tasks.

Humanitarian crises are characterised by
their unforeseeable nature and substantial


repercussions, not only where they occur but
also in the surrounding area.

Saturation of public services, infrastructure damage and price imbalances mean that
it is not enough for foreign aid merely to
save lives. It is necessary to transport and
distribute aid, and provide basic services
and medical care. These tasks can be carried
out by non-governmental organisations.
However, the lack of security in the environment calls for military presence to provide
protection.

The experience in peace missions can be
applied to humanitarian assistance operations, an example of which is the action of
our forces in the Kurdish region or Central
America.

order to permit Them to consult with regard to any situation which may constitute a threat to peace, in
whatever area this threat should arise, or a danger to economic stability.

or may be agreed. In the cases provided for in Protocols II, III and IV it will follow the various voting procedures, unanimity, two-thirds majority, simple majority, laid down therein. It will decide by simple majority questions submitted to it by the Agency for the Control of Armaments.

**Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia,**
**Turkey and Palestinian Authority**

**(Only the chapter on Political and Security partnership is included)**

The participants in the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Barcelona:

-  stressing the strategic importance of the Mediterranean and moved by the will to give their future
relations a new dimension, based on comprehensive cooperation and solidarity, in keeping with the
privileged nature of the links forged by neighbourhood and history;

-  aware that the new political, economic and social issues on both sides of the Mediterranean constitute common challenges calling for a coordinated overall response;

-  resolved to establish to that end a multilateral and lasting framework of relations based on a spirit
of partnership, with due regard for the characteristics, values and distinguishing features peculiar
to each of the participants;

-  regarding this multilateral framework as the counterpart to a strengthening of bilateral relations
which it is important to safeguard, while laying stress on their specific nature;

-  stressing that this Euro-Mediterranean initiative is not intended to replace the other activities and
initiatives undertaken in the interests of the peace, stability and development of the region, but that
it will contribute to their success. The participants support the realization of a just, comprehensive
and lasting peace settlement in the Middle East based on the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and principles mentioned in the letter of invitation to the Madrid Middle East Peace
Conference, including the principle land for peace, with all that this implies;

-  convinced that the general objective of turning the Mediterranean basin into an area of dialogue,
exchange and cooperation guaranteeing peace, stability and prosperity requires a strengthening of
democracy and respect for human rights, sustainable and balanced economic and social development, measures to combat poverty and promotion of greater understanding between cultures,
which are all essential aspects of partnership,

-  hereby agree to establish a comprehensive partnership among the participants - the Euro-Mediterranean partnership - through strengthened political dialogue on a regular basis, the development of
economic and financial cooperation and greater emphasis on the social, cultural and human dimension, these being the three aspects of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.

**_Political and Security Partnership: Establishing a Common Area of Peace and Stability_**

The participants express their conviction that the peace, stability and security of the Mediterranean
region are a common asset which they pledge to promote and strengthen by all means at their disposal. To
this end they agree to conduct a strengthened political dialogue at regular intervals, based on observance
of essential principles of international law, and reaffirm a number of common objectives in matters of internal and external stability.
In this spirit they undertake in the following declaration of principles to:

-  act in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
as well as other obligations under international law, in particular those arising out of regional and
international instruments to which they are party;

-  develop the rule of law and democracy in their political systems, while recognizing in this framework the right of each of them to choose and freely develop its own political, socio-cultural, economic and judicial system;

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

-  respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and guarantee the effective legitimate exercise of
such rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression, freedom of association for peaceful purposes and freedom of thought, conscience and religion, both individually and together with other
members of the same group, without any discrimination on grounds of race, nationality, language,
religion or sex;

-  give favourable consideration, through dialogue between the parties, to exchanges of information
on matters relating to human rights, fundamental freedoms, racism and xenophobia;

different groups in society and combat manifestations of intolerance, racism and xenophobia. The
participants stress the importance of proper education in the matter of human rights and fundamental freedoms;

-  respect their sovereign equality and all rights inherent in their sovereignty, and fulfil in good faith
the obligations they have assumed under international law;

-  respect the equal rights of peoples and their right to self-determination, acting at all times in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and with the relevant
norms of international law, including those relating to territorial integrity of States, as reflected in
agreements between relevant parties;

-  refrain, in accordance with the rules of international law, from any direct or indirect intervention in
the internal affairs of another partner; respect the territorial integrity and unity of each of the other
partners;

-  settle their disputes by peaceful means, call upon all participants to renounce recourse to the threat
or use of force against the territorial integrity of another participant, including the acquisition of territory by force, and reaffirm the right to fully exercise sovereignty by legitimate means in accordance
with the UN Charter and international law;

-  strengthen their cooperation in preventing and combating terrorism, in particular by ratifying and
applying the international instruments they have signed, by acceding to such instruments and by
taking any other appropriate measure;

-  fight together against the expansion and diversification of organized crime and combat the drugs
problem in all its aspects;

-  promote regional security by acting, inter alia, in favour of nuclear, chemical and biological non-proliferation through adherence to and compliance with a combination of international and regional
non-proliferation regimes, and arms control and disarmament agreements such as NPT, CWC,
BWC, CTBT and/or regional arrangements such as weapons free zones including their verification
regimes, as well as by fulfilling in good faith their commitments under arms control, disarmament
and non-proliferation conventions.

-  The parties shall pursue a mutually and effectively verifiable Middle East Zone free of weapons of
mass destruction, nuclear, chemical and biological, and their delivery systems.

-  Furthermore the parties will consider practical steps to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons as well as excessive accumulation of conventional arms.

-  Refrain from developing military capacity beyond their legitimate defence requirements, at the same
time reaffirming their resolve to achieve the same degree of security and mutual confidence with the
lowest possible levels of troops and weaponry and adherence to CWC.

-  Promote conditions likely to develop good-neighbourly relations among themselves and support
processes aimed at stability, security, prosperity and regional and subregional cooperation.

-  consider any confidence and security-building measures that could be taken between the parties
with a view to the creation of an “area of peace and stability in the Mediterranean”, including the
long term possibility of establishing a Euro-Mediterranean pact to that end.

###### CONSOLIDATED VERSION OF THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION

**Signed on 2 October 1997. Entered into force on 1 May 1999**

TITLE V

**PROVISIONS ON A COMMON FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY**

**_Article 11_**

1. The Union shall define and implement a common foreign and security policy covering all areas of
foreign and security policy, the objectives of which shall be:

-  to safeguard the common values, fundamental interests, independence and integrity of the Union in
conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter;

-  to strengthen the security of the Union in all ways;

-  to preserve peace and strengthen international security, in accordance with the principles of the
United Nations Charter, as well as the principles of the Helsinki Final Act and the objectives of the
Paris Charter, including those on external borders;

-  to promote international cooperation;

-  to develop and consolidate democracy and the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.

2. The Member States shall support the Union’s external and security policy actively and unreservedly in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity.
The Member States shall work together to enhance and develop their mutual political solidarity. They
shall refrain from any action which is contrary to the interests of the Union or likely to impair its effectiveness as a cohesive force in international relations.
The Council shall ensure that these principles are complied with.

**_Article 17_**

1. The common foreign and security policy shall include all questions relating to the security of the
Union, including the progressive framing of a common defence policy, in accordance with the second subparagraph, which might lead to a common defence, should the European Council so decide. It shall in that
case recommend to the Member States the adoption of such a decision in accordance with their respective
constitutional requirements.
The Western European Union (WEU) is an integral part of the development of the Union providing the
Union with access to an operational capability notably in the context of paragraph 2. It supports the Union
in framing the defence aspects of the common foreign and security policy as set out in this Article. The
Union shall accordingly foster closer institutional relations with the WEU with a view to the possibility of
the integration of the WEU into the Union, should the European Council so decide. It shall in that case recommend to the Member States the adoption of such a decision in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.
The policy of the Union in accordance with this Article shall not prejudice the specific character of the
security and defence policy of certain Member States and shall respect the obligations of certain Member
States, which see their common defence realised in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), under
the North Atlantic Treaty and be compatible with the common security and defence policy established
within that framework.
The progressive framing of a common defence policy will be supported, as Member States consider
appropriate, by cooperation between them in the field of armaments.

Defence White Paper Page 229

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

2. Questions referred to in this Article shall include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peace keeping
tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking.
3. The Union will avail itself of the WEU to elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the

###### REPORT OF THE JOINT, NON-PERMANENT CONGRESS-SENATE COMMISSION ESTABLISHING THE FORMULA AND TIMESCALE FOR THE FULL PROFESSIONALISATION OF THE ARMED FORCES

**Approved by the Congress of Deputies in full session on 28 May 1998 and by the Senate**
**in full session on 9 June the same year**

**1. General framework: Defence and security in the world**

**_1.1. The change in the international strategic environment_**

Throughout the last decade of the 20[th] century, Europe has experienced a period of deep changes in
international relations as a result of the demise of the former Soviet Union and the fact that the countries
which had fallen under its influence after the Second World War regained their sovereignty and independence. This has resulted in a totally different European security environment from the one which gave rise
to the creation of the former antagonistic blocs.
The decline in the Soviet military threat, which had widespread and immediate effects on the security
of the western allies, marked the end of the bipolar world and, generally speaking, enabled the European
political and strategic situation to change towards an age of greater stability which is gradually becoming
consolidated thanks to the transparency and confidence- and security-building measures implemented in
recent years. These measures have been conducive to the establishment of new relations based on dialogue
and co-operation between the former adversaries, have succeeded in averting the threat of a massive and
immediate attack and, consequently, have transformed the international strategic environment.
However, the disappearance of bipolarity, a characteristic of the Cold War, has led to an absence of conflicts, as envisaged in the 1990 Charter of Paris. On the contrary, it has been unable to prevent the emergence, in the centre and periphery of Europe, of a series of conflicts, which, though of limited size, have
had significant international repercussions.
Paradoxically, the disappearance of a major enemy has not resulted in the desired stability, because the
appearance of small conflicts has given rise to a more complex situation of uncertainty than the previous
single, monolithic threat. Now we must face what have come to be called multidirectional and multifaceted risks and challenges, which require new solutions.
This new strategic environment has caused the western concepts of security and defence to evolve. The
traditional concept of security was basically focused on military aspects with the changes that occurred;
the new concept is based on a more global view of security, which takes into account the concepts of stability and co-operation, including social, economic, ecological and other factors.
In the domestic sphere, stability has been achieved in the social structures, in addition to a level of social
wellbeing and maturity which, in itself, inspires security and protection. Externally, nations have built a sufficient degree of confidence with neighbouring countries through bilateral agreements or membership of the
supranational organisations in which dialogue takes priority over any other manner of settling differences.
As a result, national defence, though primarily the responsibility of each State, is tending not be
approached individually but from a supranational perspective, with the conviction that security concerns
everyone and that its problems are settled between everyone. A new concept of shared security is thus
emerging.
Therefore, without neglecting self-defence capability, nations are required to make an effort to respond
to the most likely risks and challenges and are called on to undertake new missions, which are generally
settled in the international sphere in response to mandates of supranational organisations.
In pursuit of the so-called “peace dividend”, all nations are showing a tendency to reduce the size of
their forces and increase their dependence on multinational organisations in defence and security aspects,
as they consider them to be better equipped to respond more effectively to the conditioning factors of the
new strategic situation.

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

**_1.2. The European and transatlantic framework of security and defence_**

It is thus a fact that one of the most important consequences of the strategic changes witnessed in the
past ten years is the strengthening of collective security and defence organisations. Autarkic approaches to
defence based on national self-sufficiency have been superseded and, while the conceptions of security
and defence based on nations’ own military capabilities are still valid, political and military co-operation
is sought between nations as a means of obtaining greater security at a lower cost.
This international co-operation in defence and security issues is generally promoted under the aegis of
institutions such as the United Nations (UN) and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe
(OSCE). This affords legitimacy, international backing and moral force to the military operations that are
carried out to enforce or maintain peace in the world. It is always the best way of meeting common security and defence interests, through multinational action, which is the raison d’être of organisations such as
the Atlantic Alliance (NATO) and the Western European Union (WEU). Third, it fosters mutual knowledge
between countries which share and respect the same principles and, finally, on an internal domestic plane,
it promotes a size and structure of Armed Forces that are compatible, interoperable and coherent with the
external environment in which they could be called upon to act, though they should in any event retain
their ability to respond to national defence needs.
Although it enshrines and legitimises global initiatives in security and disarmament matters, the United Nations Organisation lacks a military capability. This seriously constrains its possibility of intervening,
and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe has the same limitations as regards military,
budgetary and decision-making resources. Therefore, their action is always conditioned to the will of the
member nations to respond individually or collectively to these organisations’ requests to achieve the
maintenance of peace and security in the world.
This does not mean we should not recognise the role that both organisations have been playing in the
sphere of peacekeeping or peace imposition and conflict prevention, in which Spain, over the past decade,
has taken an active part in many international actions, in accordance with Chapter IV of the Charter of the
United Nations, which points out that forces under UN mandate can only be used with the consent of the
conflicting parties to maintain peace, help end hostilities and prevent them being resumed.
The Atlantic Alliance is the principal security organisation in Europe and the world. NATO furthermore contributes a transatlantic dimension to the framework of European security.
At the same time, the Alliance has successfully renewed itself by opening its doors to new countries
and shaping a military structure to adapt it to the new circumstances.
Although it is an organisation of sovereign nations and is based on the fundamental principle of consensus, NATO is characterised by a high degree of integration and responsibility in the commitments it has
undertaken. Although participation in military operations is not automatic—not even in the event of collective defence—the co-ordination of military planning and the sharing of burdens and responsibilities
ensure a collective surveillance, a sort of external audit, of the degree of fulfilment of the force goals and
collaboration previously established by mutual agreement. To the Alliance’s traditional concern of preventing an uneven distribution of collective burdens is thus added the determination that no member
should become a net recipient of security.
The Western European Union is a truly European security organisation whose links with the European
Union (EU) are becoming ever closer. The Amsterdam Treaty, like that of Maastricht before it, promotes the
possibility of convergence between the EU and WEU in security and defence issues. The Western European
Union also attaches great importance to the maintenance of a strong transatlantic link.
NATO’s flexibility has enabled the members States of the Western European Union (WEU) to develop
the so-called European Security and Defence Identity (ESDI) within the Alliance to address the humanitarian and rescue missions and peacekeeping operations, which are performed individually or in conjunction with other members or third States, in which all the allies do not wish to take part.
The definition of the new concept of Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) has been essential to the foregoing, as it also enables other countries to take part in missions.
Both organisations, NATO and the WEU, are committed to maintaining complementarity and transparency between them. Complementarity means not duplicating efforts, and the two organisations have
therefore established procedures to enable the WEU to perform operations using NATO assets.
However, we must aspire to strengthening the Western European Union’s operational capability. This

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

aim must give impetus to the organisation of the European armies from the logical complementarily
between them, making an effort to avoid duplication, co-ordinating the policy for the procurement of new
materiel, developing common R&D policies and establishing joint training programmes for officers and
non-commissioned officers.
In the specific case of stability and security in the Mediterranean, we must continue along the line
established at the November 1995 Barcelona conference. The objective of boosting the creation of a
conference for security and co-operation in the Mediterranean continues to be appropriate from this perspective.

**_1.3. The impact of new technologies on defence organisations and armies_**

A different strategic landscape characterised by a seemingly more complex environment, the emergence of new missions in addition to the traditional self-defence tasks and the convergence of efforts that
makes it necessary to see eye-to-eye with the Allies is, undoubtedly, all the more demanding as regards the
human factor. But seeking the solution to this requirement by increasing numbers of troops would amount
to trying to resolve the future using an approach of the past. The solution does not only lie in number but
in combining this factor with quality and training.
Crisis situations and use of force still basically stem from the traditional clash of wills. However,
although they are substantially the same, the technological revolution has introduced drastic changes in
the way of settling them. The possibility of taking decisions in real time and, should the need arise, the
ability to use smart weapons and choose targets with precision, avoiding collateral damage, make for a
type of operation characterised by quality, in which training is constantly put to the test.
To train armies that are able, at a given time, to handle sensibly and correctly the new resources that
technological innovation places at their disposal is a challenge that modern societies are facing with respect
to their own security and defence and in their contribution to shared security within international organisations.
Failure to accept this dynamics amounts to being left out of a reality and a modernisation process that
the societies in our part of the world are currently undergoing. To accept it marks the first step on the logical path that should lead to the type of Armed Forces that are going to be needed in the 21[st] century.
The Armed Forces that assimilate this technological revolution will be able to bring their superiority to
bear from the outset of a hypothetical conflict. Hence the need for all the member nations of a collective
defence organisation to maintain similar modernisation levels to avoid losing touch with technological
advances, which would seriously hinder their interoperability.
The European defence industry is very fragmented, unlike that of the United States, where there is a
single market. Maintaining a modern, effective and competitive European defence industry should be a
priority element of European security policy.
Furthermore, the technological innovation effort should also entail sustaining a suitable degree of
training and maintenance of materiel, because its ultimate usefulness does not depend on the physical
availability of armaments and equipment, but on its real degree of operational effectiveness.
This does not diminish the importance of the human factor. On the contrary, it points it even more in
the direction of quality rather than quantity. It is thus important not only to have the right number of men
and women needed to perform the missions of the Armed Forces, but also, and above all, to ensure their
training, dedication and professional ability to handle resources whose technical complexity is constantly
increasing.

**2. Spanish national framework**

The aforementioned conditioning factors call for a thorough review of the Armed Forces models,
which is now under way in practically all the western nations. Spain has also gone through a period of
analysis and reflection in order to decide on a new model of Armed Forces that are capable of performing
their missions effectively and constituting a suitable instrument of deterrence and foreign policy in the
new international strategic landscape of the 21[st] century, within the shared security framework that Spain
enjoys through its membership of multinational security organisations such as the United Nations, the

Defence White Paper Page 233

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Atlantic Alliance, whose integrated military
structure Spain recently joined, and the Western European Union.
We Spaniards are convinced of the need to equip ourselves with an effective defence in order to guarantee the security environment that is indispensable for continuing to build the system of freedoms and
the environment of economic wellbeing and social equality which is proclaimed a model from the first article of our Constitution.
At the same time, we are aware that defence has a price—the price of freedom—and entails a commitment to contribute, as far as our possibilities allow, to the maintenance of world peace and to the defence
of the system of values and freedoms which our Constitution represents.
When considering the impact of security and defence aspects on public opinion, two key facts must be
understood; first, our society is open to the international environment and wants Spain to play its rightful
role in consonance with its history and political weight as a nation, but, on the other hand, it does not want
conscripts to have to perform missions overseas.
These two facts explain why the majority of Spaniards are in favour of professional Armed Forces and
even state themselves to be willing to make the necessary budget effort.

**_2.1. Need to reform the current combined model of Armed Forces_**

In this regard, the design of the new Armed Forces model, as well as being based on operational and
functional reasons, must have the added value of constituting a valid response to a social demand. It is
therefore reasonable to expect that Spanish society will show the necessary understanding and support for
this model.
Public opinion thus has a clear perception of the aforementioned strategic environment and of its
requirements. It is also convinced that the world of international relations must be based primarily on dialogue and tolerance, and on the progressive correction of the economic imbalances that give rise to the
injustice that is the root of many of the conflicts which threaten or devastate mankind.
This conviction of the public opinion, which leads to the conclusion that we need to equip ourselves
with professional Armed Forces that are not only capable of defending our territory, independence and
sovereignty but also of taking part in peacekeeping and peacemaking or humanitarian assistance operations, is unequivocally reflected in the latest surveys conducted by the Centre for Sociological Research,
particularly the January-February 1997 study on national defence and professionalisation of the army, of
which this Comission has had knowledge of throughout its work.
Spain is equally aware that we live in a world of fast change in which success is increasingly based on
capability to adapt to these changes with the necessary flexibility and speed. This is also the case in the
field of defence, since, in this sphere, the future belongs to nations that are capable of thinking quicker,
more and better than the rest.
The Armed Forces 2000 model, the combined model currently in force, was approved by the Congress
of Deputies in full session on 27 June 1991 by a very wide majority and is at the final implementation stage,
which the Government has speeded up for 1998. This model was an important milestone in the huge modernisation and adjustment effort our Armed Forces have made over the past twenty years, under the guidance of the democratic governments .
Despite its youth and the fact it has met the proposed objectives satisfactorily—that is, Spain’s defence
needs of the last few years—it needs to be revised and superseded by a new model of fully professional
Armed Forces that will enable us to adapt to the strategic and political requirements summed up earlier,
which have been discussed at length by this Joint Commission.
In short, the reasons for change are as follows:

a The current strategic situation requires more operational, more flexible, more multifaceted Armed
Forces oriented towards joint action.
b The technological factor has brought a shift of emphasis from quantity to quality as regards the
human factor. That is, the Armed Forces are becoming progressively smaller but require increasingly better trained men and women who are fully dedicated to performing their tasks and fully available to act wherever they are required.
c This quest for a new model is furthermore backed and corroborated by similar decisions taken by

Page 234 Defence White Paper


-----

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

other countries in our environment, which on the whole have expressed their favourable opinion to
this Joint Commission of the result obtained from professional Armed Forces.

It is thus considered that the new model will provide a full response to a clear social aspiration of Spanish citizens, reflected in a general state of opinion which, while partly based on the rejection of the concept
of compulsory military services, stems essentially from the widespread perception in the western world
that the wars, conflicts and crises of the near future will be conducted in a technologically advanced environment, and that highly qualified and professional people are thus needed. In other words, society is calling for a new, up-to-date Armed Forces model that has evolved with society, since it considers that in this
age of specialisation, defence should also rest with professional specialists.
The professional model will furthermore be introduced in all the European Union countries. This will
facilitate co-operation between the respective armies, can help progress towards a common defence policy and, as a result, will boost the feasibility of Europe’s political integration, which will benefit European
citizens.
This integration into Europe makes it necessary to disseminate a set of values in the military sphere.
Rather than questioning each State’s essential patriotic and democratic values, these should be made compatible with an idea of international co-operation in pursuit of peace. In this respect, developing a concept
of Armed Forces at the service of the values of peace, solidarity, democracy and constitutional rights and
freedoms guarantees the commitment of the whole of society and, particularly, young people, towards
these Armed Forces.

**_2.2. General principles of the new Armed Forces model_**

The new Spanish Armed Forces will need to be mentally prepared, deployed and trained specifically
to act in theatres far from national or allied territory in emergency or crisis situations, in addition to guaranteeing the defence of Spain. These actions may be required to guarantee international stability, respect
for human rights or the defence of Spain’s legitimate interests, whether are not they are shared with the
rest of the allies, wherever they are affected by risks or threats. This calls for a capability for external projection which requires, among others, characteristics such as flexibility, high availability, rapid action, a
transport capability and sophisticated combat and support resources. They must also have the necessary
interoperability in order to carry out action in conjunction with the armies of other nations, particularly the
allies.
All this obviously calls for an all-round training that cannot be acquired over the short period of time
that military service lasts. Much greater time and dedication are needed than those required only a few
years ago, and this corroborates the need for fully professional Armed Forces.
The size, structure, equipment and degree of availability of the forces must be such that they are fit to
deter potential adversaries from any aggression against national sovereignty or interests and to contribute,
in keeping with our economic and political power, to collective defence within the alliances to which we
belong.
This entails reaching a compromise and balance between size of the force, the need to undertake
investments in modernisation and the degree of skill and operational capability needed, taking into
account the budget foreseeably available for the future. Only in this way will it be possible to achieve fully
operational Armed Forces that are willing to guarantee the fulfilment of the missions to which the
Government entrusts them, with the parliamentary control established in our Constitution.
The new model professional Armed Forces model, which is able to meet the aforementioned requirements and circumstances, must be underpinned by the following general principles, in order to satisfy
fully the reasons from which it stems:

a The fully voluntary and professional nature of its components, without gender discrimination, with
respect to commanding officers and servicemen.
b A size, to be determined by the Government within one year, that is consistent with the missions
assigned to the new Armed Forces, consisting of between 170,000 and 150,000 professionals.
Depending on how the process of modernising the forces and streamlining their organic structures
develops, the Government will make the relevant adjustments over five-year periods, and the Government will send the Personnel Bill to Parliament for approval.

Defence White Paper Page 235


-----

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

Each time the personnel numbers are established for a five-year period, the Government will inform
Parliament on the situation of the Armed Forces personnel and their foreseeable development in the
period in question.
c Adaptation of civilian personnel at the service of the military administration to the requirements of
the fully professional Armed Forces model. This involves reconsidering both their number and the
characteristics of their training and specialities.
d Personnel training in order to satisfy the needs of the military institution and allow for the personal aspirations of those in question, through a suitable system of internal promotion or reintegration
into civilian life. At the same time, society itself will benefit from having well-trained and experienced professionals.
e Appropriate materiel. In line with current trends, personnel and materiel expenditure should tend
towards a proportion of fifty percent each in the medium term and, subsequently, to forty and sixty
percent respectively.
f Stable and sufficient financial-budgetary backing so as to meet the expenses arising from the increase
in the number of professional soldiers, their training and permanent acquisition of skills and the programmes to modernise armaments and equipment, in the framework of the general state budgets.
g Criteria that are consistent with the doctrines of joint action and a joint operational structure so as to
guarantee the co-ordination and effectiveness of the Armed Forces in performing their tasks.
h Rationalisation and reduction of the current organisational structures and improvement in the
administrative procedures of all kind, in order to ensure more effective management and better use
of the human and financial resources allocated.
i A reserve and mobilisation system in order to be able to complete the army units either progressively
or selectively, or possibly to muster forces to meet security and defence needs. In this regard, the
Government will submit the relevant legislative proposals for organising a reserve and mobilisation
system that is consistent with the new professionalisation model within one year.
j Development of personnel management and command procedures, adapting them to the fully professional model.
k As uniformed citizens, professional soldiers enjoy the rights and freedoms established in the Constitution, with the essential restrictions or constraints of exercise provided in the Constitution and the
regulations developing the latter, in accordance with the requirements stemming from the basic characteristics of the working of the Armed Forces, which are summed up in the necessary discipline.
Ways should be sought of facilitating channels for submitting proposals, requests and complaints in
the military sphere, while continuing to deepen the objectives of structuring military justice around
ordinary justice, thereby applying the constitutional principle of jurisdictional unity, and speeding up
the administration of justice and clarifying and simplifying the mechanisms for its application.

It is appropriate to incorporate into our heritage a defence culture, which, like other objectives of peace,
justice, freedom, solidarity and prosperity, enables a stimulating project of coexistence to be built—a programme for the future which acts as a stimulus for all citizens.
In this regard, when defining the fully professional model in detail, it is necessary to promote the integration of military personnel into the society of which they are part, which they serve and from which they
should also receive the maximum stimulus and support. The system of military education, retributions,
support for mobility, healthcare and social action, and the exercise of the military profession as a whole
must undoubtedly be adapted to the special characteristics of military activity, at the same time preventing the social isolation of these professionals, who need to find their rightful place in the social and cultural environments in accordance with their professional training and the exercise of their profession.
Another way of improving the integration of the Armed Forces into society is through transparency of
their action, by properly informing and communicating with citizens and institutions. The necessary legislative reforms will have to be promoted to enable the Cortes Generales to take a greater part in giving
impetus to and controlling security and defence policy, particularly during the planning cycle and in drawing up the armaments programmes and related short-, medium- and long-term investments. In this connection, at the end of each year the Government will submit for a report for debate by the Defence Committee on the degree of accomplishment of the processes to professionalise and modernise the Armed
Forces and on the objectives set for the following year.

Page 236 Defence White Paper


-----

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

The personal and professional training of military personnel must expressly incorporate the values
and principles of the constitutional rules, bearing in mind the cultural plurality of the State.

**3. Basic features of the new model of professional servicemen**

**_3.1. Engagements with respect to duration_**

Two types of engagements should be established, one for short and one for long duration.
The option of short-duration engagement will be aimed at Spaniards who wish to join the Armed
Forces as professional servicemen for a period of approximately 12 to 18 months. It will provide an initial
contact with the Armed Forces and is a voluntary option that enables them to exercise their constitutional
right to defend Spain, in addition to providing them with a better insight into the military environment
and allowing them to take subsequent decisions with respect to continuity.
In addition to benefiting from the incentives described later on, those who assume this commitment
should be given preference when opting for the long-duration model of professional servicemen.
Long-duration engagement will initially be no longer than three years, but successive extensions will
be possible.
Careers should be designed for these professionals in order to provide them with concrete career
prospects and to enable them to progress within their area of professional specialisation and aim for a permanent career as soldiers, sailors and marines, for progression up the career ladder to posts of officers or
for placement in the civilian labour market, either public or private.
The career design for servicemen could culminate when they become permanent military personnel,
within each category.

**_3.2. Recruitment and training_**

The following considerations should be borne in mind with respect to recruitment and training:

a With a view to selecting aspirant professional servicemen who meet the requirements for achieving
the necessary quality, a number of places will be made available annually per Force and per speciality. The mechanisms should be studied for progressively establishing a continual selection system.
b Once the aspirants have been selected, they will go through a basic training stage. After completing
this stage, they will formalise their initial engagement and be appointed to their related posts.
Complementary training will subsequently be provided in areas of specialisation where it is
required, in order to furnish the recruits with the more thorough knowledge that is needed to exercise these specialities.
c The selection process must be governed by criteria of competence and effectiveness with a view to
recruiting for the Forces servicemen who are motivated and capable of performing their tasks, as in
any other professional activity in which parameters of efficiency are required. It is precisely this
proper selection and training which should ensure that the Armed Forces are made up of professionals who are fit for the job and also prepared to compete in the labour market. Professionals who
are motivated, properly paid and equipped with sufficient means. Appropriate remuneration is a
key element, as evidenced in the developments witnessed in the special volunteer scheme and in the
combined model; it is therefore essential to determine a system of decent retributions, in keeping
with the requirements of military duties.
d All kinds of incentives should be borne in mind, in addition to the purely vocational facet, in order
to ensure that the recruitment objectives are met.
e In accordance with the process of reorganising the commanding officers, the number of places available at the Academies will be determined in order to progressively adapt the number of personnel
to the staff numbers established by law.

The system should provide professional soldiers with a response to these young people’s logical expectations of a permanent job or career opportunity, both in the Armed Forces and outside this sphere, in the
public or private sector, after a given term of engagement.

Defence White Paper Page 237


-----

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

To this end, professional servicemen will have the possibility of continuing to serve in the Armed
Forces through internal promotion.
Having completed a term of engagement in the professional Armed Forces, bearing in mind the length
of service, abilities or professional skills and qualifications obtained during service, will be considered as
a merit in the systems for recruiting civil servants or other employees for the public administration.
Appropriate mechanisms will be established to allow and foster the integration into the private-sector
labour market of professional servicemen who have served a term of engagement in the Forces.

**4. Financial resources**

An economic study of the future professional Armed Forces should, logically, not only include the cost
of professionalisation as such, but also, inevitably, the costs of modernising armaments, materiel and
equipment.
Professionalisation and modernisation are indissociable concepts. According to data handled by this
Joint Commission, the current defence budget breaks down into 57% for personnel expenditure and 43%
for materiel expenditure.
Aware that, ideally, a ratio of 40 to 60 would be needed in order to achieve modern Armed Forces, the
budget estimates for the period in which the model is to be introduced envisage working towards a ratio
of 50 to 50.
All this requires the right funding to ensure the completion of processes of professionalising and modernising the Armed Forces, which must translate into a progressive increase in defence budgets until the
objectives of the aforementioned model are achieved in a period of five years. The Government will
include these forecasts in the macroeconomic scenario for the next few financial years and will complete
the planning of the professionalisation and modernisation processes of the Armed Forces within the aforesaid period, defining realistic multiyear programmes to provide substantial guarantees of their accomplishment.

**5. Transition period**

The adoption of a new model logically requires a transition period to enable it to be built on solid
foundations, ensuring that the Forces’ operational level does not diminish during this time.
The Commission considers that the Government must do its utmost to ensure that, in keeping with
both budgetary circumstances and those of the organisation, recruitment and training of professional personnel, this transition period is as short as possible. In any event, the process as a whole should be complete by 31 December 2002.
As occurs with any change, the transition from one system to another is a critical moment, because,
while the process is under way, the progressive delegitimisation of compulsory military service could take
place, which, unless suitable measures are taken, would jeopardise the proposed objective and, consequently, Spain’s defence. In order to manage the transition period correctly, the following measures should
be adopted:

a Establish mechanisms for balancing the overall numbers of professional soldiers and conscripts so
that the progressive increase in one group is offset by a similar decrease in the other. Specifically, the
Armed Forces will require a smaller number of conscripts, and formulas will therefore have to be
found to exempt increasing percentages of annual conscripts from military service, applying criteria
as objective as possible. For this purpose, the cases of exemption for medical or family reasons will
be reviewed, and the lot-drawing procedure will likewise be adapted to the development of the situation.
b Spaniards who would ordinarily be due to join from 1 January 2002 will cease to be eligible for compulsory military service, that is, all those born after 1 January 1983 will not be called upon to render
compulsory military service.
c Legislation regulating military service or alternative civilian service will continue to be applicable to
those born before 1 January 1983.

Page 238 Defence White Paper


-----

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

d Legislation regulating conscientious objection and alternative civilian service will be adapted in
accordance with the development of military service.
e Furthermore, the Armed Forces will foreseeably need a smaller number of conscripts as a result of
the professionalisation process. Formulas enabling a certain number of young men to be excluded
from this legal duty will logically have to be sought.

**6. Regulatory reforms needed in order to establish the new model**

The establishment of the new Armed Forces model will require legal and regulatory rules to be amended or repealed, and other new ones to be drawn up. The Commission urges the Government to submit to
the Houses of Parliament, at the earliest possible date, the relevant bills that will enable the model to
become effective.

###### THE ALLIANCE’S STRATEGIC CONCEPT

**Approved by the Heads of State and Government participating in the meeting of the North**
**Atlantic Council in Washington D.C. on 23rd and 24th April 1999**

**Introduction**

1. At their Summit meeting in Washington in April 1999, NATO Heads of State and Government
approved the Alliance’s new Strategic Concept.
2. NATO has successfully ensured the freedom of its members and prevented war in Europe during
the 40 years of the Cold War. By combining defence with dialogue, it played an indispensable role in bringing East-West confrontation to a peaceful end. The dramatic changes in the Euro-Atlantic strategic landscape brought by the end of the Cold War were reflected in the Alliance’s 1991 Strategic Concept. There
have, however, been further profound political and security developments since then.
3. The dangers of the Cold War have given way to more promising, but also challenging prospects, to
new opportunities and risks. A new Europe of greater integration is emerging, and a Euro-Atlantic security structure is evolving in which NATO plays a central part. The Alliance has been at the heart of efforts
to establish new patterns of cooperation and mutual understanding across the Euro-Atlantic region and
has committed itself to essential new activities in the interest of a wider stability. It has shown the depth
of that commitment in its efforts to put an end to the immense human suffering created by conflict in the
Balkans. The years since the end of the Cold War have also witnessed important developments in arms
control, a process to which the Alliance is fully committed. The Alliance’s role in these positive developments has been underpinned by the comprehensive adaptation of its approach to security and of its procedures and structures. The last ten years have also seen, however, the appearance of complex new risks
to Euro-Atlantic peace and stability, including oppression, ethnic conflict, economic distress, the collapse
of political order, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
4. The Alliance has an indispensable role to play in consolidating and preserving the positive changes
of the recent past, and in meeting current and future security challenges. It has, therefore, a demanding
agenda. It must safeguard common security interests in an environment of further, often unpredictable
change. It must maintain collective defence and reinforce the transatlantic link and ensure a balance that
allows the European Allies to assume greater responsibility. It must deepen its relations with its partners
and prepare for the accession of new members. It must, above all, maintain the political will and the military means required by the entire range of its missions.
5. This new Strategic Concept will guide the Alliance as it pursues this agenda. It expresses NATO’s
enduring purpose and nature and its fundamental security tasks, identifies the central features of the new
security environment, specifies the elements of the Alliance’s broad approach to security, and provides
guidelines for the further adaptation of its military forces.

**Part I - The Purpose and Tasks of the Alliance**

6. NATO’s essential and enduring purpose, set out in the Washington Treaty, is to safeguard the freedom and security of all its members by political and military means. Based on common values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, the Alliance has striven since its inception to secure a just and lasting peaceful order in Europe. It will continue to do so. The achievement of this aim can be put at risk by
crisis and conflict affecting the security of the Euro-Atlantic area. The Alliance therefore not only ensures
the defence of its members but contributes to peace and stability in this region.
7. The Alliance embodies the transatlantic link by which the security of North America is permanently tied to the security of Europe. It is the practical expression of effective collective effort among its members in support of their common interests.
8. The fundamental guiding principle by which the Alliance works is that of common commitment

Defence White Paper Page 241

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

and mutual co-operation among sovereign states in support of the indivisibility of security for all of its
members. Solidarity and cohesion within the Alliance, through daily cooperation in both the political and
military spheres, ensure that no single Ally is forced to rely upon its own national efforts alone in dealing
with basic security challenges. Without depriving member states of their right and duty to assume their
sovereign responsibilities in the field of defence, the Alliance enables them through collective effort to
realise their essential national security objectives.
9. The resulting sense of equal security among the members of the Alliance, regardless of differences
in their circumstances or in their national military capabilities, contributes to stability in the Euro-Atlantic
area. The Alliance does not seek these benefits for its members alone, but is committed to the creation of
conditions conducive to increased partnership, cooperation, and dialogue with others who share its broad
political objectives.
10. To achieve its essential purpose, as an Alliance of nations committed to the Washington Treaty and
the United Nations Charter, the Alliance performs the following fundamental security tasks:

-  Security: To provide one of the indispensable foundations for a stable Euro-Atlantic security environment, based on the growth of democratic institutions and commitment to the peaceful resolution
of disputes, in which no country would be able to intimidate or coerce any other through the threat
or use of force.

-  Consultation: To serve, as provided for in Article 4 of the Washington Treaty, as an essential transatlantic forum for Allied consultations on any issues that affect their vital interests, including possible
developments posing risks for members’ security, and for appropriate co-ordination of their efforts
in fields of common concern.

-  Deterrence and Defence: To deter and defend against any threat of aggression against any NATO
member state as provided for in Articles 5 and 6 of the Washington Treaty.

And in order to enhance the security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic area:

-  Crisis Management: To stand ready, case-by-case and by consensus, in conformity with Article 7 of
the Washington Treaty, to contribute to effective conflict prevention and to engage actively in crisis
management, including crisis response operations.

-  Partnership: To promote wide-ranging partnership, cooperation, and dialogue with other countries
in the Euro-Atlantic area, with the aim of increasing transparency, mutual confidence and the capacity for joint action with the Alliance.

11. In fulfilling its purpose and fundamental security tasks, the Alliance will continue to respect the
legitimate security interests of others, and seek the peaceful resolution of disputes as set out in the Charter of the United Nations. The Alliance will promote peaceful and friendly international relations and support democratic institutions. The Alliance does not consider itself to be any country’s adversary.

**Part II - Strategic Perspectives**

**_The Evolving Strategic Environment_**

12. The Alliance operates in an environment of continuing change. Developments in recent years have
been generally positive, but uncertainties and risks remain which can develop into acute crises. Within this
evolving context, NATO has played an essential part in strengthening Euro-Atlantic security since the end
of the Cold War. Its growing political role; its increased political and military partnership, cooperation and
dialogue with other states, including with Russia, Ukraine and Mediterranean Dialogue countries; its continuing openness to the accession of new members; its collaboration with other international organisations;
its commitment, exemplified in the Balkans, to conflict prevention and crisis management, including
through peace support operations: all reflect its determination to shape its security environment and
enhance the peace and stability of the Euro-Atlantic area.
13. In parallel, NATO has successfully adapted to enhance its ability to contribute to Euro-Atlantic
peace and stability. Internal reform has included a new command structure, including the Combined Joint
Task Force (CJTF) concept, the creation of arrangements to permit the rapid deployment of forces for the

Page 242 Defence White Paper

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

full range of the Alliance’s missions, and the building of the European Security and Defence Identity
(ESDI) within the Alliance.
14. The United Nations (UN), the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the
European Union (EU), and the Western European Union (WEU) have made distinctive contributions to
Euro-Atlantic security and stability. Mutually reinforcing organisations have become a central feature of
the security environment.
15. The United Nations Security Council has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and, as such, plays a crucial role in contributing to security and stability in the
Euro-Atlantic area.
16. The OSCE, as a regional arrangement, is the most inclusive security organisation in Europe, which
also includes Canada and the United States, and plays an essential role in promoting peace and stability,
enhancing cooperative security, and advancing democracy and human rights in Europe. The OSCE is particularly active in the fields of preventive diplomacy, conflict prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict rehabilitation. NATO and the OSCE have developed close practical cooperation, especially with
regard to the international effort to bring peace to the former Yugoslavia.
17. The European Union has taken important decisions and given a further impetus to its efforts to
strengthen its security and defence dimension. This process will have implications for the entire Alliance,
and all European Allies should be involved in it, building on arrangements developed by NATO and the
WEU. The development of a common foreign and security policy (CFSP) includes the progressive framing
of a common defence policy. Such a policy, as called for in the Amsterdam Treaty, would be compatible
with the common security and defence policy established within the framework of the Washington Treaty.
Important steps taken in this context include the incorporation of the WEU’s Petersberg tasks into the
Treaty on European Union and the development of closer institutional relations with the WEU.
18. As stated in the 1994 Summit declaration and reaffirmed in Berlin in 1996, the Alliance fully supports the development of the European Security and Defence Identity within the Alliance by making available its assets and capabilities for WEU-led operations. To this end, the Alliance and the WEU have developed a close relationship and put into place key elements of the ESDI as agreed in Berlin. In order to
enhance peace and stability in Europe and more widely, the European Allies are strengthening their capacity for action, including by increasing their military capabilities. The increase of the responsibilities and
capacities of the European Allies with respect to security and defence enhances the security environment
of the Alliance.
19. The stability, transparency, predictability, lower levels of armaments, and verification which can be
provided by arms control and non-proliferation agreements support NATO’s political and military efforts
to achieve its strategic objectives. The Allies have played a major part in the significant achievements in this
field. These include the enhanced stability produced by the CFE Treaty, the deep reductions in nuclear
weapons provided for in the START treaties; the signature of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the indefinite and unconditional extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the accession to it of Belarus,
Kazakhstan, and Ukraine as non-nuclear weapons states, and the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons
Convention. The Ottawa Convention to ban anti-personnel landmines and similar agreements make an
important contribution to alleviating human suffering. There are welcome prospects for further advances in
arms control in conventional weapons and with respect to nuclear, chemical, and biological (NBC) weapons.

**_Security challenges and risks_**

20. Notwithstanding positive developments in the strategic environment and the fact that large-scale
conventional aggression against the Alliance is highly unlikely, the possibility of such a threat emerging
over the longer term exists. The security of the Alliance remains subject to a wide variety of military and
non-military risks which are multi-directional and often difficult to predict. These risks include uncertainty and instability in and around the Euro-Atlantic area and the possibility of regional crises at the periphery of the Alliance, which could evolve rapidly. Some countries in and around the Euro-Atlantic area face
serious economic, social and political difficulties. Ethnic and religious rivalries, territorial disputes, inadequate or failed efforts at reform, the abuse of human rights, and the dissolution of states can lead to local
and even regional instability. The resulting tensions could lead to crises affecting Euro-Atlantic stability, to
human suffering, and to armed conflicts. Such conflicts could affect the security of the Alliance by spilling

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

over into neighbouring countries, including NATO countries, or in other ways, and could also affect the
security of other states.
21. The existence of powerful nuclear forces outside the Alliance also constitutes a significant factor
which the Alliance has to take into account if security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area are to be maintained.
22. The proliferation of NBC weapons and their means of delivery remains a matter of serious concern.
In spite of welcome progress in strengthening international non-proliferation regimes, major challenges
with respect to proliferation remain. The Alliance recognises that proliferation can occur despite efforts to
prevent it and can pose a direct military threat to the Allies’ populations, territory, and forces. Some states,
including on NATO’s periphery and in other regions, sell or acquire or try to acquire NBC weapons and
delivery means. Commodities and technology that could be used to build these weapons of mass destruction and their delivery means are becoming more common, while detection and prevention of illicit trade
in these materials and know-how continues to be difficult. Non-state actors have shown the potential to
create and use some of these weapons.
23. The global spread of technology that can be of use in the production of weapons may result in the
greater availability of sophisticated military capabilities, permitting adversaries to acquire highly capable
offensive and defensive air, land, and sea-borne systems, cruise missiles, and other advanced weaponry. In
addition, state and non-state adversaries may try to exploit the Alliance’s growing reliance on information
systems through information operations designed to disrupt such systems. They may attempt to use strategies of this kind to counter NATO’s superiority in traditional weaponry.
24. Any armed attack on the territory of the Allies, from whatever direction, would be covered by Articles 5 and 6 of the Washington Treaty. However, Alliance security must also take account of the global context. Alliance security interests can be affected by other risks of a wider nature, including acts of terrorism,
sabotage and organised crime, and by the disruption of the flow of vital resources. The uncontrolled movement of large numbers of people, particularly as a consequence of armed conflicts, can also pose problems
for security and stability affecting the Alliance. Arrangements exist within the Alliance for consultation
among the Allies under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty and, where appropriate, co-ordination of their
efforts including their responses to risks of this kind.

**Part III - The Approach to Security in the 21st Century**

25. The Alliance is committed to a broad approach to security, which recognises the importance of
political, economic, social and environmental factors in addition to the indispensable defence dimension.
This broad approach forms the basis for the Alliance to accomplish its fundamental security tasks effectively, and its increasing effort to develop effective cooperation with other European and Euro-Atlantic
organisations as well as the United Nations. Our collective aim is to build a European security architecture
in which the Alliance’s contribution to the security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic area and the contribution of these other international organisations are complementary and mutually reinforcing, both in
deepening relations among Euro-Atlantic countries and in managing crises. NATO remains the essential
forum for consultation among the Allies and the forum for agreement on policies bearing on the security
and defence commitments of its members under the Washington Treaty.
26. The Alliance seeks to preserve peace and to reinforce Euro-Atlantic security and stability by: the
preservation of the transatlantic link; the maintenance of effective military capabilities sufficient for deterrence and defence and to fulfil the full range of its missions; the development of the European Security and
Defence Identity within the Alliance; an overall capability to manage crises successfully; its continued
openness to new members; and the continued pursuit of partnership, cooperation, and dialogue with other
nations as part of its co-operative approach to Euro-Atlantic security, including in the field of arms control
and disarmament.

**_The Transatlantic Link_**

27. NATO is committed to a strong and dynamic partnership between Europe and North America in
support of the values and interests they share. The security of Europe and that of North America are indi
Page 244 Defence White Paper


-----

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

visible. Thus the Alliance’s commitment to the indispensable transatlantic link and the collective defence
of its members is fundamental to its credibility and to the security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic area.

**_The Maintenance Of Alliance Military Capabilities_**

28. The maintenance of an adequate military capability and clear preparedness to act collectively in
the common defence remain central to the Alliance’s security objectives. Such a capability, together with
political solidarity, remains at the core of the Alliance’s ability to prevent any attempt at coercion or intimidation, and to guarantee that military aggression directed against the Alliance can never be perceived as
an option with any prospect of success.
29. Military capabilities effective under the full range of foreseeable circumstances are also the basis of
the Alliance’s ability to contribute to conflict prevention and crisis management through non-Article 5 crisis response operations. These missions can be highly demanding and can place a premium on the same
political and military qualities, such as cohesion, multinational training, and extensive prior planning, that
would be essential in an Article 5 situation. Accordingly, while they may pose special requirements, they
will be handled through a common set of Alliance structures and procedures.

**_The European Security And Defence Identity_**

30. The Alliance, which is the foundation of the collective defence of its members and through which
common security objectives will be pursued wherever possible, remains committed to a balanced and
dynamic transatlantic partnership. The European Allies have taken decisions to enable them to assume
greater responsibilities in the security and defence field in order to enhance the peace and stability of the
Euro-Atlantic area and thus the security of all Allies. On the basis of decisions taken by the Alliance, in
Berlin in 1996 and subsequently, the European Security and Defence Identity will continue to be developed
within NATO. This process will require close cooperation between NATO, the WEU and, if and when
appropriate, the European Union. It will enable all European Allies to make a more coherent and effective
contribution to the missions and activities of the Alliance as an expression of our shared responsibilities; it
will reinforce the transatlantic partnership; and it will assist the European Allies to act by themselves as
required through the readiness of the Alliance, on a case-by-case basis and by consensus, to make its assets
and capabilities available for operations in which the Alliance is not engaged militarily under the political
control and strategic direction either of the WEU or as otherwise agreed, taking into account the full participation of all European Allies if they were so to choose.

**_Conflict Prevention And Crisis Management_**

31. In pursuit of its policy of preserving peace, preventing war, and enhancing security and stability
and as set out in the fundamental security tasks, NATO will seek, in cooperation with other organisations,
to prevent conflict, or, should a crisis arise, to contribute to its effective management, consistent with international law, including through the possibility of conducting non-Article 5 crisis response operations. The
Alliance’s preparedness to carry out such operations supports the broader objective of reinforcing and
extending stability and often involves the participation of NATO’s Partners. NATO recalls its offer, made
in Brussels in 1994, to support on a case-by-case basis in accordance with its own procedures, peacekeeping and other operations under the authority of the UN Security Council or the responsibility of the OSCE,
including by making available Alliance resources and expertise. In this context NATO recalls its subsequent decisions with respect to crisis response operations in the Balkans. Taking into account the necessity for Alliance solidarity and cohesion, participation in any such operation or mission will remain subject
to decisions of member states in accordance with national constitutions.
32. NATO will make full use of partnership, cooperation and dialogue and its links to other organisations to contribute to preventing crises and, should they arise, defusing them at an early stage. A coherent
approach to crisis management, as in any use of force by the Alliance, will require the Alliance’s political
authorities to choose and co-ordinate appropriate responses from a range of both political and military
measures and to exercise close political control at all stages.

Defence White Paper Page 245

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

**_Partnership, Cooperation, And Dialogue_**

33. Through its active pursuit of partnership, cooperation, and dialogue, the Alliance is a positive force
in promoting security and stability throughout the Euro-Atlantic area. Through outreach and openness,
the Alliance seeks to preserve peace, support and promote democracy, contribute to prosperity and
progress, and foster genuine partnership with and among all democratic Euro-Atlantic countries. This
aims at enhancing the security of all, excludes nobody, and helps to overcome divisions and disagreements
that could lead to instability and conflict.
34. The Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) will remain the overarching framework for all
aspects of NATO’s cooperation with its Partners. It offers an expanded political dimension for both consultation and cooperation. EAPC consultations build increased transparency and confidence among its
members on security issues, contribute to conflict prevention and crisis management, and develop practical cooperation activities, including in civil emergency planning, and scientific and environmental affairs.
35. The Partnership for Peace is the principal mechanism for forging practical security links between
the Alliance and its Partners and for enhancing interoperability between Partners and NATO. Through
detailed programmes that reflect individual Partners’ capacities and interests, Allies and Partners work
towards transparency in national defence planning and budgeting; democratic control of defence forces;
preparedness for civil disasters and other emergencies; and the development of the ability to work together, including in NATO-led PfP operations. The Alliance is committed to increasing the role the Partners
play in PfP decision-making and planning, and making PfP more operational. NATO has undertaken to
consult with any active participant in the Partnership if that Partner perceives a direct threat to its territorial integrity, political independence, or security.
36. Russia plays a unique role in Euro-Atlantic security. Within the framework of the NATO-Russia
Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security, NATO and Russia have committed themselves to developing their relations on the basis of common interest, reciprocity and transparency to
achieve a lasting and inclusive peace in the Euro-Atlantic area based on the principles of democracy and
co-operative security. NATO and Russia have agreed to give concrete substance to their shared commitment to build a stable, peaceful and undivided Europe. A strong, stable and enduring partnership between
NATO and Russia is essential to achieve lasting stability in the Euro-Atlantic area.
37. Ukraine occupies a special place in the Euro-Atlantic security environment and is an important
and valuable partner in promoting stability and common democratic values. NATO is committed to further strengthening its distinctive partnership with Ukraine on the basis of the NATO-Ukraine Charter,
including political consultations on issues of common concern and a broad range of practical cooperation
activities. The Alliance continues to support Ukrainian sovereignty and independence, territorial integrity, democratic development, economic prosperity and its status as a non-nuclear weapons state as key factors of stability and security in central and eastern Europe and in Europe as a whole.
38. The Mediterranean is an area of special interest to the Alliance. Security in Europe is closely linked
to security and stability in the Mediterranean. NATO’s Mediterranean Dialogue process is an integral part
of NATO’s co-operative approach to security. It provides a framework for confidence building, promotes
transparency and cooperation in the region, and reinforces and is reinforced by other international efforts.
The Alliance is committed to developing progressively the political, civil, and military aspects of the Dialogue with the aim of achieving closer cooperation with, and more active involvement by, countries that
are partners in this Dialogue.

**_Enlargement_**

39. The Alliance remains open to new members under Article 10 of the Washington Treaty. It expects
to extend further invitations in coming years to nations willing and able to assume the responsibilities and
obligations of membership, and as NATO determines that the inclusion of these nations would serve the
overall political and strategic interests of the Alliance, strengthen its effectiveness and cohesion, and
enhance overall European security and stability. To this end, NATO has established a programme of activities to assist aspiring countries in their preparations for possible future membership in the context of its
wider relationship with them. No European democratic country whose admission would fulfil the objectives of the Treaty will be excluded from consideration.

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

**_Arms Control, Disarmament, And Non-Proliferation_**

40. The Alliance’s policy of support for arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation will continue to play a major role in the achievement of the Alliance’s security objectives. The Allies seek to enhance
security and stability at the lowest possible level of forces consistent with the Alliance’s ability to provide
for collective defence and to fulfil the full range of its missions. The Alliance will continue to ensure that as an important part of its broad approach to security - defence and arms control, disarmament, and nonproliferation objectives remain in harmony. The Alliance will continue to actively contribute to the development of arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation agreements as well as to confidence and security building measures. The Allies take seriously their distinctive role in promoting a broader, more
comprehensive and more verifiable international arms control and disarmament process. The Alliance will
enhance its political efforts to reduce dangers arising from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. The principal non-proliferation goal of the Alliance and its members is to
prevent proliferation from occurring or, should it occur, to reverse it through diplomatic means. The
Alliance attaches great importance to the continuing validity and the full implementation by all parties of
the CFE Treaty as an essential element in ensuring the stability of the Euro-Atlantic area.

**Part IV - Guidelines for the Alliance’s Forces**

**_Principles Of Alliance Strategy_**

41. The Alliance will maintain the necessary military capabilities to accomplish the full range of
NATO’s missions. The principles of Allied solidarity and strategic unity remain paramount for all Alliance
missions. Alliance forces must safeguard NATO’s military effectiveness and freedom of action. The security of all Allies is indivisible: an attack on one is an attack on all. With respect to collective defence under
Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, the combined military forces of the Alliance must be capable of deterring any potential aggression against it, of stopping an aggressor’s advance as far forward as possible
should an attack nevertheless occur, and of ensuring the political independence and territorial integrity of
its member states. They must also be prepared to contribute to conflict prevention and to conduct nonArticle 5 crisis response operations. The Alliance’s forces have essential roles in fostering cooperation and
understanding with NATO’s Partners and other states, particularly in helping Partners to prepare for
potential participation in NATO-led PfP operations. Thus they contribute to the preservation of peace, to
the safeguarding of common security interests of Alliance members, and to the maintenance of the security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic area. By deterring the use of NBC weapons, they contribute to Alliance
efforts aimed at preventing the proliferation of these weapons and their delivery means.
42. The achievement of the Alliance’s aims depends critically on the equitable sharing of the roles,
risks and responsibilities, as well as the benefits, of common defence. The presence of United States conventional and nuclear forces in Europe remains vital to the security of Europe, which is inseparably linked
to that of North America. The North American Allies contribute to the Alliance through military forces
available for Alliance missions, through their broader contribution to international peace and security, and
through the provision of unique training facilities on the North American continent. The European Allies
also make wide-ranging and substantial contributions. As the process of developing the ESDI within the
Alliance progresses, the European Allies will further enhance their contribution to the common defence
and to international peace and stability including through multinational formations.
43. The principle of collective effort in Alliance defence is embodied in practical arrangements that
enable the Allies to enjoy the crucial political, military and resource advantages of collective defence, and
prevent the renationalisation of defence policies, without depriving the Allies of their sovereignty. These
arrangements also enable NATO’s forces to carry out non-Article 5 crisis response operations and constitute a prerequisite for a coherent Alliance response to all possible contingencies. They are based on procedures for consultation, an integrated military structure, and on co-operation agreements. Key features
include collective force planning; common funding; common operational planning; multinational formations, headquarters and command arrangements; an integrated air defence system; a balance of roles and
responsibilities among the Allies; the stationing and deployment of forces outside home territory when
required; arrangements, including planning, for crisis management and reinforcement; common standards

Defence White Paper Page 247


-----

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

and procedures for equipment, training and logistics; joint and combined doctrines and exercises when
appropriate; and infrastructure, armaments and logistics cooperation. The inclusion of NATO’s Partners in
such arrangements or the development of similar arrangements for them, in appropriate areas, is also
instrumental in enhancing cooperation and common efforts in Euro-Atlantic security matters.
44. Multinational funding, including through the Military Budget and the NATO Security Investment
Programme, will continue to play an important role in acquiring and maintaining necessary assets and
capabilities. The management of resources should be guided by the military requirements of the Alliance
as they evolve.
45. The Alliance supports the further development of the ESDI within the Alliance, including by being
prepared to make available assets and capabilities for operations under the political control and strategic
direction either of the WEU or as otherwise agreed.
46. To protect peace and to prevent war or any kind of coercion, the Alliance will maintain for the foreseeable future an appropriate mix of nuclear and conventional forces based in Europe and kept up to date
where necessary, although at a minimum sufficient level. Taking into account the diversity of risks with
which the Alliance could be faced, it must maintain the forces necessary to ensure credible deterrence and
to provide a wide range of conventional response options. But the Alliance’s conventional forces alone
cannot ensure credible deterrence. Nuclear weapons make a unique contribution in rendering the risks of
aggression against the Alliance incalculable and unacceptable. Thus, they remain essential to preserve
peace.

**_The Alliance’s Force Posture_**

**_The Missions of Alliance Military Forces_**

47. The primary role of Alliance military forces is to protect peace and to guarantee the territorial
integrity, political independence and security of member states. The Alliance’s forces must therefore be
able to deter and defend effectively, to maintain or restore the territorial integrity of Allied nations and - in
case of conflict - to terminate war rapidly by making an aggressor reconsider his decision, cease his attack
and withdraw. NATO forces must maintain the ability to provide for collective defence while conducting
effective non-Article 5 crisis response operations.
48. The maintenance of the security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic area is of key importance. An
important aim of the Alliance and its forces is to keep risks at a distance by dealing with potential crises at
an early stage. In the event of crises which jeopardise Euro-Atlantic stability and could affect the security
of Alliance members, the Alliance’s military forces may be called upon to conduct crisis response operations. They may also be called upon to contribute to the preservation of international peace and security
by conducting operations in support of other international organisations, complementing and reinforcing
political actions within a broad approach to security.
49. In contributing to the management of crises through military operations, the Alliance’s forces will
have to deal with a complex and diverse range of actors, risks, situations and demands, including humanitarian emergencies. Some non-Article 5 crisis response operations may be as demanding as some collective defence missions. Well-trained and well-equipped forces at adequate levels of readiness and in sufficient strength to meet the full range of contingencies as well as the appropriate support structures,
planning tools and command and control capabilities are essential in providing efficient military contributions. The Alliance should also be prepared to support, on the basis of separable but not separate capabilities, operations under the political control and strategic direction either of the WEU or as otherwise
agreed. The potential participation of Partners and other non-NATO nations in NATO-led operations as
well as possible operations with Russia would be further valuable elements of NATO’s contribution to
managing crises that affect Euro-Atlantic security.
50. Alliance military forces also contribute to promoting stability throughout the Euro-Atlantic area by
their participation in military-to-military contacts and in other cooperation activities and exercises under
the Partnership for Peace as well as those organised to deepen NATO’s relationships with Russia, Ukraine
and the Mediterranean Dialogue countries. They contribute to stability and understanding by participating in confidence-building activities, including those which enhance transparency and improve communication; as well as in verification of arms control agreements and in humanitarian de-mining. Key areas

Page 248 Defence White Paper

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

of consultation and cooperation could include inter alia: training and exercises, interoperability, civil-military relations, concept and doctrine development, defence planning, crisis management, proliferation
issues, armaments cooperation as well as participation in operational planning and operations.

**_Guidelines for the Alliance’s Force Posture_**

51. To implement the Alliance’s fundamental security tasks and the principles of its strategy, the forces
of the Alliance must continue to be adapted to meet the requirements of the full range of Alliance missions
effectively and to respond to future challenges. The posture of Allies’ forces, building on the strengths of
different national defence structures, will conform to the guidelines developed in the following paragraphs.
52. The size, readiness, availability and deployment of the Alliance’s military forces will reflect its
commitment to collective defence and to conduct crisis response operations, sometimes at short notice, distant from their home stations, including beyond the Allies’ territory. The characteristics of the Alliance’s
forces will also reflect the provisions of relevant arms control agreements. Alliance forces must be adequate
in strength and capabilities to deter and counter aggression against any Ally. They must be interoperable
and have appropriate doctrines and technologies. They must be held at the required readiness and deployability, and be capable of military success in a wide range of complex joint and combined operations, which
may also include Partners and other non-NATO nations.
53. This means in particular:

a that the overall size of the Allies’ forces will be kept at the lowest levels consistent with the requirements of collective defence and other Alliance missions; they will be held at appropriate and graduated readiness;
b that the peacetime geographical distribution of forces will ensure a sufficient military presence
throughout the territory of the Alliance, including the stationing and deployment of forces outside
home territory and waters and forward deployment of forces when and where necessary. Regional
and, in particular, geostrategic considerations within the Alliance will have to be taken into account,
as instabilities on NATO’s periphery could lead to crises or conflicts requiring an Alliance military
response, potentially with short warning times;
c that NATO’s command structure will be able to undertake command and control of the full range of
the Alliance’s military missions including through the use of deployable combined and joint HQs, in
particular CJTF headquarters, to command and control multinational and multiservice forces. It will
also be able to support operations under the political control and strategic direction either of the
WEU or as otherwise agreed, thereby contributing to the development of the ESDI within the
Alliance, and to conduct NATO-led non-Article 5 crisis response operations in which Partners and
other countries may participate;
d that overall, the Alliance will, in both the near and long term and for the full range of its missions,
require essential operational capabilities such as an effective engagement capability; deployability
and mobility; survivability of forces and infrastructure; and sustainability, incorporating logistics
and force rotation. To develop these capabilities to their full potential for multinational operations,
interoperability, including human factors, the use of appropriate advanced technology, the maintenance of information superiority in military operations, and highly qualified personnel with a broad
spectrum of skills will be important. Sufficient capabilities in the areas of command, control and
communications as well as intelligence and surveillance will serve as necessary force multipliers;
e that at any time a limited but militarily significant proportion of ground, air and sea forces will be
able to react as rapidly as necessary to a wide range of eventualities, including a short-notice attack
on any Ally. Greater numbers of force elements will be available at appropriate levels of readiness to
sustain prolonged operations, whether within or beyond Alliance territory, including through rotation of deployed forces. Taken together, these forces must also be of sufficient quality, quantity and
readiness to contribute to deterrence and to defend against limited attacks on the Alliance;
f that the Alliance must be able to build up larger forces, both in response to any fundamental changes
in the security environment and for limited requirements, by reinforcement, by mobilising reserves,
or by reconstituting forces when necessary. This ability must be in proportion to potential threats to

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

Alliance security, including potential long-term developments. It must take into account the possibility of substantial improvements in the readiness and capabilities of military forces on the periphery of the Alliance. Capabilities for timely reinforcement and resupply both within and from Europe
and North America will remain of critical importance, with a resulting need for a high degree of
deployability, mobility and flexibility;
g that appropriate force structures and procedures, including those that would provide an ability to
build up, deploy and draw down forces quickly and selectively, are necessary to permit measured,
flexible and timely responses in order to reduce and defuse tensions. These arrangements must be
exercised regularly in peacetime;
h that the Alliance’s defence posture must have the capability to address appropriately and effectively the risks associated with the proliferation of NBC weapons and their means of delivery, which
also pose a potential threat to the Allies’ populations, territory, and forces. A balanced mix of forces,
response capabilities and strengthened defences is needed;
i that the Alliance’s forces and infrastructure must be protected against terrorist attacks.

**_Characteristics of Conventional Forces_**

54. It is essential that the Allies’ military forces have a credible ability to fulfil the full range of Alliance
missions. This requirement has implications for force structures, force and equipment levels; readiness,
availability, and sustainability; training and exercises; deployment and employment options; and force
build-up and mobilisation capabilities. The aim should be to achieve an optimum balance between high
readiness forces capable of beginning rapidly, and immediately as necessary, collective defence or nonArticle 5 crisis response operations; forces at different levels of lower readiness to provide the bulk of those
required for collective defence, for rotation of forces to sustain crisis response operations, or for further
reinforcement of a particular region; and a longer-term build-up and augmentation capability for the worst
case — but very remote — scenario of large scale operations for collective defence. A substantial proportion of Alliance forces will be capable of performing more than one of these roles.
55. Alliance forces will be structured to reflect the multinational and joint nature of Alliance missions.
Essential tasks will include controlling, protecting, and defending territory; ensuring the unimpeded use
of sea, air, and land lines of communication; sea control and protecting the deployment of the Alliance’s
sea-based deterrent; conducting independent and combined air operations; ensuring a secure air environment and effective extended air defence; surveillance, intelligence, reconnaissance and electronic warfare;
strategic lift; and providing effective and flexible command and control facilities, including deployable
combined and joint headquarters.
56. The Alliance’s defence posture against the risks and potential threats of the proliferation of NBC
weapons and their means of delivery must continue to be improved, including through work on missile
defences. As NATO forces may be called upon to operate beyond NATO’s borders, capabilities for dealing
with proliferation risks must be flexible, mobile, rapidly deployable and sustainable. Doctrines, planning,
and training and exercise policies must also prepare the Alliance to deter and defend against the use of
NBC weapons. The aim in doing so will be to further reduce operational vulnerabilities of NATO military
forces while maintaining their flexibility and effectiveness despite the presence, threat or use of NBC
weapons.
57. Alliance strategy does not include a chemical or biological warfare capability. The Allies support
universal adherence to the relevant disarmament regimes. But, even if further progress with respect to banning chemical and biological weapons can be achieved, defensive precautions will remain essential.
58. Given reduced overall force levels and constrained resources, the ability to work closely together
will remain vital for achieving the Alliance’s missions. The Alliance’s collective defence arrangements in
which, for those concerned, the integrated military structure plays the key role, are essential in this regard.
The various strands of NATO’s defence planning need to be effectively coordinated at all levels in order to
ensure the preparedness of the forces and supporting structures to carry out the full spectrum of their roles.
Exchanges of information among the Allies about their force plans contribute to securing the availability
of the capabilities needed for the execution of these roles. Consultations in case of important changes in
national defence plans also remain of key importance. Cooperation in the development of new operational
concepts will be essential for responding to evolving security challenges. The detailed practical arrange
Page 250 Defence White Paper


-----

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

ments that have been developed as part of the ESDI within the Alliance contribute to close allied co-operation without unnecessary duplication of assets and capabilities.
59. To be able to respond flexibly to possible contingencies and to permit the effective conduct of
Alliance missions, the Alliance requires sufficient logistics capabilities, including transport capacities,
medical support and stocks to deploy and sustain all types of forces effectively. Standardisation will foster
cooperation and cost-effectiveness in providing logistic support to allied forces. Mounting and sustaining
operations outside the Allies’ territory, where there may be little or no host-nation support, will pose special logistical challenges. The ability to build-up larger, adequately equipped and trained forces, in a timely manner and to a level able to fulfil the full range of Alliance missions, will also make an essential contribution to crisis management and defence. This will include the ability to reinforce any area at risk and
to establish a multinational presence when and where this is needed. Forces of various kinds and at various levels of readiness will be capable of flexible employment in both intra-European and transatlantic
reinforcement. This will require control of lines of communication, and appropriate support and exercise
arrangements.
60. The interaction between Alliance forces and the civil environment (both governmental and nongovernmental) in which they operate is crucial to the success of operations. Civil-military cooperation is
interdependent: military means are increasingly requested to assist civil authorities; at the same time civil
support to military operations is important for logistics, communications, medical support, and public
affairs. Cooperation between the Alliance’s military and civil bodies will accordingly remain essential.
61. The Alliance’s ability to accomplish the full range of its missions will rely increasingly on multinational forces, complementing national commitments to NATO for the Allies concerned. Such forces, which
are applicable to the full range of Alliance missions, demonstrate the Alliance’s resolve to maintain a credible collective defence; enhance Alliance cohesion; and reinforce the transatlantic partnership and strengthen the ESDI within the Alliance. Multinational forces, particularly those capable of deploying rapidly for
collective defence or for non-Article 5 crisis response operations, reinforce solidarity. They can also provide
a way of deploying more capable formations than might be available purely nationally, thus helping to
make more efficient use of scarce defence resources. This may include a highly integrated, multinational
approach to specific tasks and functions, an approach which underlies the implementation of the CJTF concept. For peace support operations, effective multinational formations and other arrangements involving
Partners will be valuable. In order to exploit fully the potential offered by multinational formations,
improving interoperability, inter alia through sufficient training and exercises, is of the highest importance.

**_Characteristics of Nuclear Forces_**

62. The fundamental purpose of the nuclear forces of the Allies is political: to preserve peace and prevent coercion and any kind of war. They will continue to fulfil an essential role by ensuring uncertainty in
the mind of any aggressor about the nature of the Allies’ response to military aggression. They demonstrate that aggression of any kind is not a rational option. The supreme guarantee of the security of the
Allies is provided by the strategic nuclear forces of the Alliance, particularly those of the United States; the
independent nuclear forces of the United Kingdom and France, which have a deterrent role of their own,
contribute to the overall deterrence and security of the Allies.
63. A credible Alliance nuclear posture and the demonstration of Alliance solidarity and common
commitment to war prevention continue to require widespread participation by European Allies involved
in collective defence planning in nuclear roles, in peacetime basing of nuclear forces on their territory and
in command, control and consultation arrangements. Nuclear forces based in Europe and committed to
NATO provide an essential political and military link between the European and the North American
members of the Alliance. The Alliance will therefore maintain adequate nuclear forces in Europe. These
forces need to have the necessary characteristics and appropriate flexibility and survivability, to be perceived as a credible and effective element of the Allies’ strategy in preventing war. They will be maintained
at the minimum level sufficient to preserve peace and stability.
64. The Allies concerned consider that, with the radical changes in the security situation, including
reduced conventional force levels in Europe and increased reaction times, NATO’s ability to defuse a crisis through diplomatic and other means or, should it be necessary, to mount a successful conventional
defence has significantly improved. The circumstances in which any use of nuclear weapons might have

Defence White Paper Page 251


-----

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

to be contemplated by them are therefore extremely remote. Since 1991, therefore, the Allies have taken a
series of steps which reflect the post-Cold War security environment. These include a dramatic reduction
of the types and numbers of NATO’s sub-strategic forces including the elimination of all nuclear artillery
and ground-launched short-range nuclear missiles; a significant relaxation of the readiness criteria for
nuclear-roled forces; and the termination of standing peacetime nuclear contingency plans. NATO’s
nuclear forces no longer target any country. Nonetheless, NATO will maintain, at the minimum level consistent with the prevailing security environment, adequate sub-strategic forces based in Europe which will
provide an essential link with strategic nuclear forces, reinforcing the transatlantic link. These will consist
of dual capable aircraft and a small number of United Kingdom Trident warheads. Sub-strategic nuclear
weapons will, however, not be deployed in normal circumstances on surface vessels and attack submarines.

**Part V - Conclusion**

65. As the North Atlantic Alliance enters its sixth decade, it must be ready to meet the challenges and
opportunities of a new century. The Strategic Concept reaffirms the enduring purpose of the Alliance and
sets out its fundamental security tasks. It enables a transformed NATO to contribute to the evolving security environment, supporting security and stability with the strength of its shared commitment to democracy and the peaceful resolution of disputes. The Strategic Concept will govern the Alliance’s security and
defence policy, its operational concepts, its conventional and nuclear force posture and its collective
defence arrangements, and will be kept under review in the light of the evolving security environment. In
an uncertain world the need for effective defence remains, but in reaffirming this commitment the Alliance
will also continue making full use of every opportunity to help build an undivided continent by promoting and fostering the vision of a Europe whole and free.

###### DEFENCE CAPABILITIES INITIATIVE

**Launched at the NATO Summit held in Washington on 23 and 24 April 1999**

**Introduction**

1. At Washington, NATO Heads of State and Government launched a Defence Capabilities Initiative.
The objective of this initiative is to improve defence capabilities to ensure the effectiveness of future multinational operations across the full spectrum of Alliance missions in the present and foreseeable security
environment with a special focus on improving interoperability among Alliance forces, and where applicable also between Alliance and Partner forces.

**The Challenge: Adapting Capabilities for a New Security Environment**

2. In accordance with the Alliance’s new Strategic Concept, NATO must continue to maintain capabilities to deal with large-scale aggression against one or more of the members, although the probability of
this occurring in the foreseeable future is low. Warning times for the possible emergence of such a threat
are likely to remain long. Potential threats to Alliance security are more likely to result from regional conflicts, ethnic strife or other crises beyond Alliance territory, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and their means of delivery.
3. Future Alliance military operations, including non-Article 5 crisis response operations, are likely to
be smaller in scale than those which were the basis for Alliance planning during the Cold War. They may
also be longer in duration, extend multinational cooperation to lower levels and take place concurrently
with other Alliance operations. In many cases non-Article 5 operations will include force contributions
from Partners and possibly other non-Allied nations. Operations outside Alliance territory may need to be
undertaken with no, or only limited, access to existing NATO infrastructure. It may not be possible to
invoke existing national emergency legislation to provide civilian transport assets for deployments or to
mobilise reserves. These developments will make new demands on the capabilities required of Alliance
forces, in particular in the field of interoperability. It is important that all nations are able to make a fair
contribution to the full spectrum of Alliance missions regardless of differences in national defence structures.
4. Significant progress has been made in recent years in adapting Alliance forces to the requirements
of this new security environment. However, many Allies have only relatively limited capabilities for the
rapid deployment of significant forces outside national territory, or for extended sustainment of operations
and protection of forces far from home bases. Command and control and information systems need to be
better matched to the requirements of future Alliance military operations which will entail the exchange of
a much greater volume of information and extending to lower levels than in the past. Maintaining the
effectiveness of multinational operations will require particular attention to the challenges of interoperability. In this context, increased attention must be paid to human factors (such as common approaches to
doctrine, training and operational procedures) and standardisation, as well as to the challenges posed by
the accelerating pace of technological change and the different speeds at which Allies introduce advanced
capabilities. Improvements in interoperability and critical capabilities should also strengthen the European
pillar in NATO.

**The Way Ahead**

5. Against this background, the Alliance has examined areas where improvements in capabilities
would make a significant contribution towards meeting the challenges of the future. The aim has been to
develop a common assessment of requirements for the full range of Alliance missions. In identifying the

Defence White Paper Page 253


-----

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

most important areas for improvement, and with a special focus on interoperability, the work has concentrated on the deployability and mobility of Alliance forces, on their sustainability and logistics, their survivability and effective engagement capability, and on command and control and information systems. In
some cases it has been possible at this early stage to set out the steps to be taken to improve some capabilities. In others, further work is required to examine different options and make firm recommendations
about improvements to be made. The initiative emphasises the importance of the resource dimension of
this work as well as the requirement for better coordination between defence planning disciplines; takes
into consideration the ability of European Allies to undertake WEU-led operations; addresses ways to
improve capabilities of multinational formations; and considers issues such as training, doctrine, human
factors, concept development and experimentation, and standardisation.
6. As part of this Defence Capabilities Initiative, Heads of State and Government have established a
temporary High Level Steering Group (HLSG) to oversee the implementation of the DCI and to meet the
requirement of coordination and harmonisation among relevant planning disciplines including for Allies
concerned force planning, and with NATO standardisation, with the aim of achieving lasting effects on
improvements in capabilities and interoperability.

###### COLOGNE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DECLARATION ON STRENGTHENING THE COMMON EUROPEAN POLICY ON SECURITY AND DEFENCE

**Adopted on 10 June 1999**

1. We, the members of the European Council, are resolved that the European Union shall play its full
role on the international stage. To that end, we intend to give the European Union the necessary means and
capabilities to assume its responsibilities regarding a common European policy on security and defence.
The work undertaken on the initiative of the German Presidency and the entry into force of the Treaty of
Amsterdam permit us today to take a decisive step forward.
In pursuit of our Common Foreign and Security Policy objectives and the progressive framing of a
common defence policy, we are convinced that the Council should have the ability to take decisions on the
full range of conflict prevention and crisis management tasks defined in the Treaty on European Union, the
“Petersberg tasks”. To this end, the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed up by
credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and a readiness to do so, in order to respond to
international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO. The EU will thereby increase its ability to contribute to international peace and security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter.
2. We are convinced that to fully assume its tasks in the field of conflict prevention and crisis management the European Union must have at its disposal the appropriate capabilities and instruments. We
therefore commit ourselves to further develop more effective European military capabilities from the basis
of existing national, bi-national and multinational capabilities and to strengthen our own capabilities for
that purpose. This requires the maintenance of a sustained defence effort, the implementation of the necessary adaptations and notably the reinforcement of our capabilities in the field of intelligence, strategic
transport, command and control. This also requires efforts to adapt, exercise and bring together national
and multinational European forces.
We also recognise the need to undertake sustained efforts to strengthen the industrial and technological
defence base, which we want to be competitive and dynamic. We are determined to foster the restructuring of
the European defence industries amongst those States involved. With industry we will therefore work towards
closer and more efficient defence industry collaboration. We will seek further progress in the harmonisation of
military requirements and the planning and procurement of arms, as Member States consider appropriate.
3. We welcome the results of the NATO Washington summit as regards NATO support for the process
launched by the EU and its confirmation that a more effective role for the European Union in conflict prevention and crisis management will contribute to the vitality of a renewed Alliance. In implementing this
process launched by the EU, we shall ensure the development of effective mutual consultation, cooperation and transparency between the European Union and NATO.
We want to develop an effective EU-led crisis management in which NATO members, as well as neutral and non-allied members, of the EU can participate fully and on an equal footing in the EU operations.
We will put in place arrangements that allow non-EU European allies and partners to take part to the
fullest possible extent in this endeavour.
4. We therefore approve and adopt the report prepared by the German Presidency, which reflects the
consensus among the Member States.
5. We are now determined to launch a new step in the construction of the European Union. To this end
we task the General Affairs Council to prepare the conditions and the measures necessary to achieve these
objectives, including the definition of the modalities for the inclusion of those functions of the WEU which
will be necessary for the EU to fulfil its new responsibilities in the area of the Petersberg tasks. In this
regard, our aim is to take the necessary decisions by the end of the year 2000. In that event, the WEU as an
organisation would have completed its purpose. The different status of Member States with regard to collective defence guarantees will not be affected. The Alliance remains the foundation of the collective
defence of its Member States.
We therefore invite the Finnish Presidency to take the work forward within the General Affairs Council

Defence White Paper Page 255


-----

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

on the basis of this declaration and the report of the Presidency to the European Council meeting in Cologne.
We look forward to a progress report by the Finnish Presidency to the Helsinki European Council meeting.

**Presidency Report on Strengthening of the common European policy on security and**
**defence**

**_1. Introduction_**

The Treaty of Amsterdam which entered into force on 1 May provides for the enhancement of the
Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), including the progressive framing of a common defence policy as provided in Article 17 of the TEU. The Treaty also provides for the possibility of integrating the WEU
into the EU, should the European Council so decide.
The European Council in Vienna welcomed the new impetus given to the debate on a common European policy in security and defence. It considered that in order for the EU to be in a position to play its full
role on the international stage, the CFSP must be backed by credible operational capabilities. Furthermore,
it welcomed the Franco-British declaration made on 4 December 1998 in St. Malo. The European Council
invited the German Presidency to pursue this debate and agreed to examine the question again at the European Council in Cologne. To this end Foreign Ministers discussed the subject at their informal meeting in
Reinhartshausen on 13/14 March and at the General Affairs Council on 17 May.
The NATO Washington Summit welcomed the new impetus given to the strengthening of a common
European policy on security and defence by the Amsterdam Treaty and confirmed that a stronger European role will help contribute to the vitality of the Alliance for the 21st century. The NATO summit furthermore stressed that the development of a CFSP, as called for in the
Amsterdam Treaty, would be compatible with the common security and defence policy established
within the framework of the Washington Treaty. This process will lead to more complementarity, cooperation and synergy.
At the WEU Ministerial Council on 10 and 11 May this question was also discussed on the basis of the
informal reflection which was initiated at the Rome Ministerial Council. Member States will undertake
efforts in line with the conclusions of the ongoing WEU Audit of European defence capabilities.

**_2. Guiding Principles_**

The aim is to strengthen the CFSP by the development of a common European policy on security and
defence. This requires a capacity for autonomous action backed up by credible military capabilities and
appropriate decision making bodies. Decisions to act would be taken within the framework of the CFSP
according to appropriate procedures in order to reflect the specific nature of decisions in this field. The
Council of the European Union would thus be able to take decisions on the whole range of political, economic and military instruments at its disposal when responding to crisis situations. The European Union
is committed to preserve peace and strengthen international security in accordance with the principles of
the UN Charter as well as the principles of the Helsinki Final Act and the objectives of the Charter of Paris,
as provided for in Article 11 of the TEU.
The Amsterdam Treaty incorporates the Petersberg tasks (“humanitarian and rescue tasks, peace-keeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace-making”) into the Treaty.
The focus of our efforts therefore would be to assure that the European Union has at its disposal the
necessary capabilities (including military capabilities) and appropriate structures for effective EU decision
making in crisis management within the scope of the Petersberg tasks. This is the area where a European
capacity to act is required most urgently. The development of an EU military crisis management capacity
is to be seen as an activity within the framework of the CFSP (Title V of the TEU) and as a part of the progressive framing of a common defence policy in accordance with Article 17 of the TEU.
The Atlantic Alliance remains the foundation of the collective defence of its Members. The commitments under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty and Article V of the Brussels Treaty will in any event be
preserved for the Member States party to these Treaties. The policy of the Union shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States.

Page 256 Defence White Paper


-----

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

**_3. Decision Making_**

As regards EU decision making in the field of security and defence policy, necessary arrangements
must be made in order to ensure political control and strategic direction of EU-led Petersberg operations
so that the EU can decide and conduct such operations effectively.
Furthermore, the EU will need a capacity for analysis of situations, sources of intelligence, and a capability for relevant strategic planning.
This may require in particular:

-  regular (or ad hoc) meetings of the General Affairs Council, as appropriate including Defence Ministers;

-  a permanent body in Brussels (Political and Security Committee) consisting of representatives with
pol/mil expertise;

-  an EU Military Committee consisting of Military Representatives making recommendations to the
Political and Security Committee;

-  a EU Military Staff including a Situation Centre;

-  other resources such as a Satellite Centre, Institute for Security Studies.

Further institutional questions may need to be addressed.
Decisions relating to crisis management tasks, in particular decisions having military or defence implications will be taken in accordance with Article 23 of the Treaty on European Union. Member States will
retain in all circumstances the right to decide if and when their national forces are deployed.

**_4. Implementation_**

As regards military capabilities, Member States need to develop further forces (including headquarters) that are suited also to crisis management operations, without any unnecessary duplication. The main
characteristics include: deployability, sustainability, interoperability, flexibility and mobility.
For the effective implementation of EU-led operations the European Union will have to determine,
according to the requirements of the case, whether it will conduct:

-  EU-led operations using NATO assets and capabilities or

-  EU-led operations without recourse to NATO assets and capabilities.

For EU-led operations without recourse to NATO assets and capabilities, the EU could use national or
multinational European means pre-identified by Member States. This will require either the use of national command structures providing multinational representation in headquarters or drawing on existing
command structures within multinational forces. Further arrangements to enhance the capacity of European multinational and national forces to respond to crises situations will be needed.
For EU-led operations having recourse to NATO assets and capabilities, including European command
arrangements, the main focus should be on the following aspects:

-  Implementation of the arrangements based on the Berlin decisions of 1996 and the Washington
NATO summit decisions of April 1999.

-  The further arrangements set out by NATO at its summit meeting in Washington should address in
particular:

-  assured EU access to NATO planning capabilities able to contribute to military planing for EU-led
operations;

-  the presumption of availability to the EU of pre-identified NATO capabilities and common assets for
use in EU-led operations.

**_5. Modalities of participation and cooperation_**

The successful creation of a European policy on security and defence will require in particular:

-  the possibility of all EU Member States, including non-allied members, to participate fully and on
an equal footing in EU operations;

-  satisfactory arrangements for European NATO members who are not EU Member States to ensure

Defence White Paper Page 257


-----

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

their fullest possible involvement in EU-led operations, building on existing consultation arrangements within WEU;

-  arrangements to ensure that all participants in an EU-led operation will have equal rights in respect
of the conduct of that operation, without prejudice to the principle of the EU’s decision-making
autonomy, notably the right of the Council to discuss and decide matters of principle and policy;

-  the need to ensure the development of effective mutual consultation, cooperation and transparency
between NATO and the EU;

-  the consideration of ways to ensure the possibility for WEU Associate Partners to be involved.

###### CHARTER FOR EUROPEAN SECURITY

**Signed by the Heads of State or Government of the OSCE participating states at the Istanbul**
**meeting on 19 November 1999**

1. At the dawn of the twenty-first century we, the Heads of State or Government of the OSCE participating States, declare our firm commitment to a free, democratic and more integrated OSCE area where
participating States are at peace with each other, and individuals and communities live in freedom, prosperity and security. To implement this commitment, we have decided to take a number of new steps. We
have agreed to:

-  Adopt the Platform for Co-operative Security, in order to strengthen co-operation between the OSCE
and other international organizations and institutions, thereby making better use of the resources of
the international community;

-  Develop the OSCE’s role in peacekeeping, thereby better reflecting the Organization’s comprehensive approach to security;

-  Create Rapid Expert Assistance and Co-operation Teams (REACT), thereby enabling the OSCE to
respond quickly to demands for assistance and for large civilian field operations;

-  Expand our ability to carry out police-related activities in order to assist in maintaining the primacy of law;

-  Establish an Operation Centre, in order to plan and deploy OSCE field operations;

-  Strengthen the consultation process within the OSCE by establishing the Preparatory Committee
under the OSCE Permanent Council.

We are committed to preventing the outbreak of violent conflicts wherever possible. The steps we have
agreed to take in this Charter will strengthen the OSCE’s ability in this respect as well as its capacity to settle conflicts and to rehabilitate societies ravaged by war and destruction. The Charter will contribute to the
formation of a common and indivisible security space. It will advance the creation of an OSCE area free of
dividing lines and zones with different levels of security.

**_I. Our common challenges_**

2. The last decade of the twentieth century has brought great achievements in the OSCE area, co-operation has replaced previous confrontation, but the danger of conflicts between States has not been eliminated. We have put Europe’s old divisions behind us, but new risks and challenges have emerged. Since
we signed the Charter of Paris it has become more obvious that threats to our security can stem from conflicts within States as well as from conflicts between States. We have experienced conflicts which have
often resulted from flagrant violations of OSCE norms and principles. We have witnessed atrocities of a
kind we had thought were relegated to the past. In this decade it has become clear that all such conflicts
can represent a threat to the security of all OSCE participating States.
3. We are determined to learn from the dangers of confrontation and division between States as well
as from tragedies of the last decade. Security and peace must be enhanced through an approach which
combines two basic elements, we must build confidence among people within States and strengthen cooperation between States. Therefore, we will strengthen existing instruments and develop new ones to provide assistance and advice. We will reinforce our efforts to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the rights of persons belonging to national minorities. In parallel, we will
strengthen our capacity to enhance confidence and security between States. We are determined to develop
the means at our disposal to settle peacefully disputes between them.
4. International terrorism, violent extremism, organized crime and drug trafficking represent growing
challenges to security. Whatever its motives, terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is unacceptable.
We will enhance our efforts to prevent the preparation and financing of any act of terrorism on our terri
Defence White Paper Page 259

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

tories and deny terrorists safe havens. The excessive and destabilizing accumulation and uncontrolled
spread of small arms and light weapons represent a threat to peace and security. We are committed to
strengthening our protection against these new risks and challenges; strong democratic institutions and
the rule of law are the foundation for this protection. We are also determined to co-operate more actively
and closely with each other to meet these challenges.
5. Acute economic problems and environmental degradation may have serious implications for our
security. Co-operation in the fields of economy, science and technology and the environment will be of critical importance. We will strengthen our responses to such threats through continued economic and environmental reforms, by stable and transparent frameworks for economic activity and by promoting market
economies, while paying due attention to economic and social rights. We applaud the unprecedented
process of economic transformation taking place in many participating States. We encourage them to continue this reform process, which will contribute to security and prosperity in the entire OSCE area. We will
step up our efforts across all dimensions of the OSCE to combat corruption and to promote the rule of law.
6. We confirm that security in areas nearby, in particular in the Mediterranean area as well as areas in
direct proximity to participating States, such as those of Central Asia, is of increasing importance to the
OSCE. We recognize that instability in these areas creates challenges that directly affect the security and
prosperity of OSCE States.

**_II. Our common foundations_**

7. We reaffirm our full adherence to the Charter of the United Nations, and to the Helsinki Final Act,
the Charter of Paris and all other OSCE documents to which we have agreed. These documents represent
our common commitments and are the foundation for our work. They have helped us to bring about an
end to the old confrontation in Europe and to foster a new era of democracy, peace and solidarity throughout the OSCE area. They established clear standards for participating States’ treatment of each other and
of all individuals within their territories. All OSCE commitments, without exception, apply equally to each
participating State. Their implementation in good faith is essential for relations between States, between
governments and their peoples, as well as between the organizations of which they are members. Participating States are accountable to their citizens and responsible to each other for their implementation of
their OSCE commitments. We regard these commitments as our common achievement and therefore consider them to be matters of immediate and legitimate concern to all participating States.
We reaffirm the OSCE as a regional arrangement under Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United
Nations and as a primary organization for the peaceful settlement of disputes within its region and as a
key instrument for early warning, conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict rehabilitation.
The OSCE is the inclusive and comprehensive organization for consultation, decision-making and co-operation in its region.
8. Each participating State has an equal right to security. We reaffirm the inherent right of each and
every participating State to be free to choose or change its security arrangements, including treaties of
alliance, as they evolve. Each State also has the right to neutrality. Each participating State will respect the
rights of all others in these regards. They will not strengthen their security at the expense of the security
of other States. Within the OSCE no State, group of States or organization can have any pre-eminent
responsibility for maintaining peace and stability in the OSCE area or can consider any part of the OSCE
area as its sphere of influence.
9. We will build our relations in conformity with the concept of common and comprehensive security,
guided by equal partnership, solidarity and transparency. The security of each participating State is inseparably linked to that of all others. We will address the human, economic, political and military dimensions
of security as an integral whole.
10. We will continue to uphold consensus as the basis for OSCE decision-making. The OSCE’s flexibility and ability to respond quickly to a changing political environment should remain at the heart of the
OSCE’s co-operative and inclusive approach to common and indivisible security.
11. We recognize the primary responsibility of the United Nations Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security and its crucial role in contributing to security and stability in our
region. We reaffirm our rights and obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, including our commitment on the issue of the non-use of force or the threat of force. In this connection, we also reaffirm our

Page 260 Defence White Paper


-----

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

commitment to seek the peaceful resolution of disputes as set out in the Charter of the United Nations.
Based on these foundations we will strengthen our common response and improve our common
instruments in order to meet the challenges confronting us more efficiently.

**_III. Our common response_**

_Co-operation with other organizations: the platform for co-operative security_

12. The risks and challenges we face today cannot be met by a single State or organization. Over the
last decade, we have taken important steps to forge new co-operation between the OSCE and other international organizations. In order to make full use of the resources of the international community, we are
committed to even closer co-operation among international organizations.
We pledge ourselves, through the Platform for Co-operative Security, which is hereby adopted as an
essential element of this Charter, to further strengthen and develop co-operation with competent organizations on the basis of equality and in a spirit of partnership. The principles of the Platform for Co-operative Security, as set out in the operational document attached to this Charter, apply to any organization or
institution whose members individually and collectively decide to adhere to them. They apply across all
dimensions of security; politico-military, human and economic. Through this Platform we seek to develop
and maintain political and operational coherence, on the basis of shared values, among all the various bodies dealing with security, both in responding to specific crises and in formulating responses to new risks
and challenges. Recognizing the key integrating role that the OSCE can play, we offer the OSCE, when
appropriate, as a flexible co-ordinating framework to foster co-operation, through which various organizations can reinforce each other drawing on their particular strengths. We do not intend to create a hierarchy of organizations or a permanent division of labour among them.
We are ready in principle to deploy the resources of international organizations and institutions of
which we are members in support of the OSCE’s work, subject to the necessary policy decisions as cases
arise.
13. Subregional co-operation has become an important element in enhancing security across the OSCE
area. Processes such as the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, which has been placed under the auspices of the OSCE, help to promote our common values. They contribute to improved security not just in
the subregion in question but throughout the OSCE area. We offer the OSCE, in accordance with the Platform for Co-operative Security, as a forum for subregional co-operation. In this respect, and in accordance
with the modalities in the operational document, the OSCE will facilitate the exchange of information and
experience between subregional groups and may, if so requested, receive and keep their mutual accords
and agreements.

_Solidarity and partnership_

14. Peace and security in our region is best guaranteed by the willingness and ability of each participating State to uphold democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights. We individually confirm
our willingness to comply fully with our commitments. We also have a joint responsibility to uphold OSCE
principles. We are therefore determined to co-operate within the OSCE and with its institutions and representatives and stand ready to use OSCE instruments, tools and mechanisms. We will co-operate in a spirit of solidarity and partnership in a continuing review of implementation. Today we commit ourselves to
joint measures based on co-operation, both in the OSCE and through those organizations of which we are
members, in order to offer assistance to participating States to enhance their compliance with OSCE principles and commitments. We will strengthen existing co-operative instruments and develop new ones in
order to respond efficiently to requests for assistance from participating States. We will explore ways to
further increase the effectiveness of the Organization to deal with cases of clear, gross and continuing violations of those principles and commitments.
15. We are determined to consider ways of helping participating States requesting assistance in cases
of internal breakdown of law and order. We will jointly examine the nature of the situation and possible
ways and means of providing support to the State in question.
16. We reaffirm the validity of the Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security. We will

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

consult promptly, in conformity with our OSCE responsibilities, with a participating State seeking assistance in realizing its right to individual or collective self-defence in the event that its sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence are threatened. We will consider jointly the nature of the threat and
actions that may be required in defence of our common values.

_Our institutions_

17. The Parliamentary Assembly has developed into one of the most important OSCE institutions continuously providing new ideas and proposals. We welcome this increasing role, particularly in the field of
democratic development and election monitoring. We call on the Parliamentary Assembly to develop its
activities further as a key component in our efforts to promote democracy, prosperity and increased confidence within and between participating States.
18. The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), the High Commissioner on
National Minorities (HCNM) and the Representative on Freedom of the Media are essential instruments
in ensuring respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law. The OSCE Secretariat provides vital
assistance to the Chairman-in-Office and to the activities of our Organization, especially in the field. We
will also strengthen further the operational capacities of the OSCE Secretariat to enable it to face the expansion of our activities and to ensure that field operations function effectively and in accordance with the
mandates and guidance given to them.
We commit ourselves to giving the OSCE institutions our full support. We emphasize the importance
of close co-ordination among the OSCE institutions, as well as our field operations, in order to make optimal use of our common resources. We will take into account the need for geographic diversity and gender
balance when recruiting personnel to OSCE institutions and field operations.
We acknowledge the tremendous developments and diversification of OSCE activities. We recognize
that a large number of OSCE participating States have not been able to implement the 1993 decision of the
Rome Ministerial Council, and that difficulties can arise from the absence of a legal capacity of the Organization. We will seek to improve the situation.

_The human dimension_

19. We reaffirm that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of
law is at the core of the OSCE’s comprehensive concept of security. We commit ourselves to counter such
threats to security as violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of
thought, conscience, religion or belief and manifestations of intolerance, aggressive nationalism, racism,
chauvinism, xenophobia and anti-semitism.
The protection and promotion of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities are essential
factors for democracy, peace, justice and stability within, and between, participating States. In this respect
we reaffirm our commitments, in particular under the relevant provisions of the Copenhagen
1990 Human Dimension Document, and recall the Report of the Geneva 1991 Meeting of Experts on
National Minorities. Full respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to national
minorities, besides being an end in itself, may not undermine, but strengthen territorial integrity and sovereignty. Various concepts of autonomy as well as other approaches outlined in the above-mentioned documents, which are in line with OSCE principles, constitute ways to preserve and promote the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of national minorities within an existing State. We condemn
violence against any minority. We pledge to take measures to promote tolerance and to build pluralistic
societies where all, regardless of their ethnic origin, enjoy full equality of opportunity. We emphasize that
questions relating to national minorities can only be satisfactorily resolved in a democratic political
framework based on the rule of law.
We reaffirm our recognition that everyone has the right to a nationality and that no one should be
deprived of his or her nationality arbitrarily. We commit ourselves to continue our efforts to ensure that
everyone can exercise this right. We also commit ourselves to further the international protection of stateless persons.
20. We recognize the particular difficulties faced by Roma and Sinti and the need to undertake effective measures in order to achieve full equality of opportunity, consistent with OSCE commitments, for per
Page 262 Defence White Paper

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

sons belonging to Roma and Sinti. We will reinforce our efforts to ensure that Roma and Sinti are able to
play a full and equal part in our societies, and to eradicate discrimination against them.
21. We are committed to eradicating torture and cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment throughout the OSCE area. To this end, we will promote legislation to provide procedural and substantive safeguards and remedies to combat these practices. We will assist victims and co-operate with relevant international organizations and non-governmental organizations, as appropriate.
22. We reject any policy of ethnic cleansing or mass expulsion. We reaffirm our commitment to respect
the right to seek asylum and to ensure the international protection of refugees as set out in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, as well as to facilitate the voluntary return
of refugees and internally displaced persons in dignity and safety. We will pursue without discrimination
the reintegration of refugees and internally displaced persons in their places of origin.
In order to enhance the protection of civilians in times of conflict, we will seek ways of reinforcing the
application of international humanitarian law.
23. The full and equal exercise by women of their human rights is essential to achieve a more peaceful, prosperous and democratic OSCE area. We are committed to making equality between men and
women an integral part of our policies, both at the level of our States and within the Organization.
24. We will undertake measures to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women, and to end
violence against women and children as well as sexual exploitation and all forms of trafficking in human
beings. In order to prevent such crimes we will, among other means, promote the adoption or strengthening of legislation to hold accountable persons responsible for these acts and strengthen the protection of
victims. We will also develop and implement measures to promote the rights and interests of children in
armed conflict and post-conflict situations, including refugees and internally displaced children. We will
look at ways of preventing forced or compulsory recruitment for use in armed conflict of persons under
18 years of age.
25. We reaffirm our obligation to conduct free and fair elections in accordance with OSCE commitments, in particular the Copenhagen Document 1990. We recognize the assistance the ODIHR can provide to participating States in developing and implementing electoral legislation. In line with these commitments, we will invite observers to our elections from other participating States, the ODIHR, the
OSCE Parliamentary Assembly and appropriate institutions and organizations that wish to observe our
election proceedings. We agree to follow up promptly the ODIHR’s election assessment and recommendations.
26. We reaffirm the importance of independent media and the free flow of information as well as the
public’s access to information. We commit ourselves to take all necessary steps to ensure the basic conditions for free and independent media and unimpeded transborder and intra-State flow of information,
which we consider to be an essential component of any democratic, free and open society.
27. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can perform a vital role in the promotion of human
rights, democracy and the rule of law. They are an integral component of a strong civil society. We pledge
ourselves to enhance the ability of NGOs to make their full contribution to the further development of civil
society and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.

_The politico-military dimension_

28. The politico-military aspects of security remain vital to the interests of participating States. They
constitute a core element of the OSCE’s concept of comprehensive security. Disarmament, arms control and
confidence- and security-building measures (CSBMs) are important parts of the overall effort to enhance
security by fostering stability, transparency and predictability in the military field. Full implementation,
timely adaptation and, when required, further development of arms control agreements and CSBMs are
key contributions to our political and military stability.
29. The Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) must continue to serve as a cornerstone
of European security. It has dramatically reduced equipment levels. It provides a fundamental contribution to a more secure and integrated Europe. The States Parties to this Treaty are taking a critical step forward. The Treaty is being strengthened by adapting its provisions to ensure enhanced stability, predictability and transparency amidst changing circumstances. A number of States Parties will reduce further
their equipment levels. The adapted Treaty, upon its entry into force, will be open to voluntary accession

Defence White Paper Page 263

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

by other OSCE participating States in the area between the Atlantic Ocean and the Ural Mountains and
thereby will provide an important additional contribution to European stability and security.
30. The OSCE Vienna Document 1999, together with other documents adopted by the Forum for Security Co-operation (FSC) on politico-military aspects of security, provide valuable tools for all OSCE participating States in building greater mutual confidence and military transparency. We will continue to make
regular use of and fully implement all OSCE instruments in this field and seek their timely adaptation in
order to ensure adequate response to security needs in the OSCE area. We remain committed to the principles contained in the Code of Conduct on politico-military aspects of security. We are determined to
make further efforts within the FSC in order to jointly address common security concerns of participating
States and to pursue the OSCE’s concept of comprehensive and indivisible security so far as the politicomilitary dimension is concerned. We will continue a substantial security dialogue and task our representatives to conduct this dialogue in the framework of the FSC.

_The economic and environmental dimension_

31. The link between security, democracy and prosperity has become increasingly evident in the OSCE
area, as has the risk to security from environmental degradation and the depletion of natural resources.
Economic liberty, social justice and environmental responsibility are indispensable for prosperity. On the
basis of these linkages, we will ensure that the economic dimension receives appropriate attention, in particular as an element of our early warning and conflict prevention activities. We will do so, inter alia, with
a view to promoting the integration of economies in transition into the world economy and to ensure the
rule of law and the development of a transparent and stable legal system in the economic sphere.
32. The OSCE is characterized by its broad membership, its comprehensive approach to security, its
large number of field operations and its long history as a norm-setting organization. These qualities enable
it to identify threats and to act as a catalyst for co-operation between key international organizations and
institutions in the economic and environmental areas. The OSCE stands ready to play this role, where
appropriate. We will foster such co-ordination between the OSCE and relevant international organizations
in accordance with the Platform for Co-operative Security. We will enhance the OSCE’s ability to address
economic and environmental issues in ways that neither duplicate existing work nor replace efforts that
can be more efficiently undertaken by other organizations. We will focus on areas in which the OSCE has
particular competence. The OSCE’s efforts within the human dimension have significant economic effects
and vice versa, for example by mobilizing human resources and talents and by helping to build vibrant
civil societies. In the spirit of the 1998 Århus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in
Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, we will in particular seek to ensure
access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters.

_Rule of law and fight against corruption_

33. We reaffirm our commitment to the rule of law. We recognize that corruption poses a great threat
to the OSCE’s shared values. It generates instability and reaches into many aspects of the security, economic and human dimensions. Participating States pledge to strengthen their efforts to combat corruption
and the conditions that foster it, and to promote a positive framework for good government practices and
public integrity. They will make better use of existing international instruments and assist each other in
their fight against corruption. As part of its work to promote the rule of law, the OSCE will work with
NGOs that are committed to a strong public and business consensus against corrupt practices.

**_IV. Our common instruments_**

_Enhancing our dialogue_

34. We are determined to broaden and strengthen our dialogue concerning developments related to all
aspects of security in the OSCE area. We charge the Permanent Council and the FSC within their respective areas of competence to address in greater depth security concerns of the participating States and to
pursue the OSCE’s concept of comprehensive and indivisible security.

Page 264 Defence White Paper


-----

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

35. The Permanent Council, being the regular body for political consultations and decision-making,
will address the full range of conceptual issues as well as the day-to-day operational work of the Organization. To assist in its deliberations and decision-making and to strengthen the process of political consultations and transparency within the Organization, we will establish a Preparatory Committee under the
Permanent Council’s direction. This open-ended Committee will normally meet in informal format and
will be tasked by the Council, or its Chairman, to deliberate and to report back to the Council.
36. Reflecting our spirit of solidarity and partnership, we will also enhance our political dialogue in
order to offer assistance to participating States, thereby ensuring compliance with OSCE commitments. To
encourage this dialogue, we have decided, in accordance with established rules and practices, to make
increased use of OSCE instruments, including:

-  Dispatching delegations from the OSCE institutions, with the participation of other relevant international organizations, when appropriate, to provide advice and expertise for reform of legislation
and practices;

-  Dispatching Personal Representatives of the Chairman-in-Office, after consultations with the State
concerned, for fact-finding or advisory missions;

-  Bringing together representatives of the OSCE and States concerned in order to address questions
regarding compliance with OSCE commitments;

-  Organizing training programmes aimed at improving standards and practices, inter alia, within the
fields of human rights, democratization and the rule of law;

-  Addressing matters regarding compliance with OSCE commitments at OSCE review meetings and
conferences as well as in the Economic Forum;

-  Submitting such matters for consideration by the Permanent Council, inter alia, on the basis of recommendations by the OSCE institutions within their respective mandates or by Personal Representatives of the Chairman-in-Office;

-  Convening meetings of the Permanent Council in a special or reinforced format in order to discuss
matters of non-compliance with OSCE commitments and to decide on appropriate courses of action;

-  Establishing field operations with the consent of the State concerned.

_OSCE field operations_

37. The Permanent Council will establish field operations. It will decide on their mandates and budgets. On this basis, the Permanent Council and the Chairman-in-Office will provide guidance to such operations.
38. The development of OSCE field operations represents a major transformation of the Organization
that has enabled the OSCE to play a more prominent role in promoting peace, security and compliance
with OSCE commitments. Based on the experience we have acquired, we will develop and strengthen this
instrument further in order to carry out tasks according to their respective mandates, which may, inter alia,
include the following:

-  Providing assistance and advice or formulating recommendations in areas agreed by the OSCE and
the host country;

-  Observing compliance with OSCE commitments and providing advice or recommendations for
improved compliance;

-  Assisting in the organization and monitoring of elections;

-  Providing support for the primacy of law and democratic institutions and for the maintenance and
restoration of law and order;

-  Helping to create conditions for negotiation or other measures that could facilitate the peaceful settlement of conflicts;

-  Verifying and/or assisting in fulfilling agreements on the peaceful settlement of conflicts;

-  Providing support in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of various aspects of society.

39. Recruitment to field operations must ensure that qualified personnel are made available by participating States. The training of personnel is an important aspect of enhancing the effectiveness of the OSCE
and its field operations and will therefore be improved. Existing training facilities in OSCE participating

Defence White Paper Page 265


-----

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

States and training activities of the OSCE could play an active role in achieving this aim in co-operation,
where appropriate, with other organizations and institutions.
40. In accordance with the Platform for Co-operative Security, co-operation between OSCE and other
international organizations in performing field operations will be enhanced. This will be done, inter alia,
by carrying out common projects with other partners, in particular the Council of Europe, allowing the
OSCE to benefit from their expertise while respecting the identity and decision-making procedures of each
organization involved.
41. The host country of an OSCE field operation should, when appropriate, be assisted in building its
own capacity and expertise within the area of responsibility. This would facilitate an efficient transfer of
the tasks of the operation to the host country, and consequently the closure of the field operation.

_Rapid response (REACT)_

42. We recognize that the ability to deploy rapidly civilian and police expertise is essential to effective
conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict rehabilitation. We are committed to developing a
capability within the participating States and the OSCE to set up Rapid Expert Assistance and Co-operation Teams (REACT) that will be at the disposal of the OSCE. This will enable OSCE bodies and institutions, acting in accordance with their respective procedures, to offer experts quickly to OSCE participating
States to provide assistance, in compliance with OSCE norms, in conflict prevention, crisis management
and post-conflict rehabilitation. This rapidly deployable capability will cover a wide range of civilian
expertise. It will give us the ability to address problems before they become crises and to deploy quickly
the civilian component of a peacekeeping operation when needed. These Teams could also be used as
surge capacity to assist the OSCE with the rapid deployment of large-scale or specialized operations. We
expect REACT to develop and evolve, along with other OSCE capabilities, to meet the needs of the Organization.

_Operation Centre_

43. Rapid deployment is important for the OSCE’s effectiveness in contributing to our conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict rehabilitation efforts and depends on effective preparation
and planning. To facilitate this, we decide to set up an Operation Centre within the Conflict Prevention
Centre with a small core staff, having expertise relevant for all kinds of OSCE operations, which can be
expanded rapidly when required. Its role will be to plan and deploy field operations, including those
involving REACT resources. It will liaise with other international organizations and institutions as appropriate in accordance with the Platform for Co-operative Security. The Centre’s core staff will, to the extent
possible, be drawn from personnel with appropriate expertise seconded by participating States and from
existing Secretariat resources. This core will provide the basis for rapid expansion, to deal with new tasks
as they arise. The precise arrangements will be decided in accordance with existing procedures.

_Police-related activities_

44. We will work to enhance the OSCE’s role in civilian police-related activities as an integral part of
the Organization’s efforts in conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict rehabilitation. Such
activities may comprise:

-  Police monitoring, including with the aim of preventing police from carrying out such activities as
discrimination based on religious and ethnic identity;

-  Police training, which could, inter alia, include the following tasks:

-  Improving the operational and tactical capabilities of local police services and reforming paramilitary forces;

-  Providing new and modern policing skills, such as community policing, and anti-drug, anti-corruption and anti-terrorist capacities;

-  Creating a police service with a multi-ethnic and/or multi-religious composition that can enjoy the
confidence of the entire population;

-  Promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in general.

Page 266 Defence White Paper


-----

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

We will encourage the provision of modern equipment appropriate to police services that receive training in such new skills.
In addition, the OSCE will examine options and conditions for a role in law enforcement.
45. We shall also promote the development of independent judicial systems that play a key role in providing remedies for human rights violations as well as providing advice and assistance for prison system
reforms. The OSCE will also work with other international organizations in the creation of political and
legal frameworks within which the police can perform its tasks in accordance with democratic principles
and the rule of law.

_Peacekeeping_

46. We remain committed to reinforcing the OSCE’s key role in maintaining peace and stability
throughout our area. The OSCE’s most effective contributions to regional security have been in areas such
as field operations, post-conflict rehabilitation, democratization, and human rights and election monitoring. We have decided to explore options for a potentially greater and wider role for the OSCE in peacekeeping. Reaffirming our rights and obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, and on the basis
of our existing decisions, we confirm that the OSCE can, on a case-by-case basis and by consensus, decide
to play a role in peacekeeping, including a leading role when participating States judge it to be the most
effective and appropriate organization. In this regard, it could also decide to provide the mandate covering peacekeeping by others and seek the support of participating States as well as other organizations to
provide resources and expertise. In accordance with the Platform for Co-operative Security, it could also
provide a co-ordinating framework for such efforts.

_The Court Of Conciliation And Arbitration_

47. We reiterate that the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes is at the core of OSCE commitments. The Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, in this respect, remains a tool available to those, a
large number of participating States, which have become parties to the 1992 Convention of Stockholm. We
encourage them to use this instrument to resolve disputes between them, as well as with other participating States which voluntarily submit to the jurisdiction of the Court. We also encourage those participating
States which have not yet done so to consider joining the Convention.

**_V. Our partners for co-operation_**

48. We recognize the interdependence between the security of the OSCE area and that of Partners for
Co-operation, as well as our commitment to the relationship and the dialogue with them. We emphasize
in particular the long-standing relations with our Mediterranean partners, Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan,
Morocco and Tunisia. We recognize the increased involvement in and support for the work of the OSCE
by our Partners for Co-operation. Building on this interdependence, we are ready to develop this process
further. Implementing and building on the Helsinki Document 1992 and the Budapest Document 1994, we
will work more closely with the Partners for Co-operation to promote OSCE norms and principles. We welcome their wish to promote the realization of the Organization’s norms and principles, including the fundamental principle of resolving conflicts through peaceful means. To this end, we will invite the Partners
for Co-operation on a more regular basis to increased participation in the work of the OSCE as the dialogue
develops.
49. The potential of the Contact Group and the Mediterranean seminars must be fully explored and
exploited. Drawing on the Budapest mandate, the Permanent Council will examine the recommendations
emerging from the Contact Group and the Mediterranean seminars. We will encourage the Mediterranean
Partners for Co-operation to draw on our expertise in setting up structures and mechanisms in the
Mediterranean for early warning, preventive diplomacy and conflict prevention.
50. We welcome the increased participation in our work by Japan and the Republic of Korea. We welcome the contribution by Japan to OSCE field activities. We will seek to strengthen further our co-operation with our Asian partners in meeting challenges of common interest.

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

**_VI. Conclusion_**

51. This Charter will benefit the security of all participating States by enhancing and strengthening the
OSCE as we enter the twenty-first century. Today we have decided to develop its existing instruments and
to create new tools. We will use them fully to promote a free, democratic and secure OSCE area. The Charter will thus underpin the OSCE’s role as the only pan-European security organization entrusted with
ensuring peace and stability in its area. We appreciate the completion of the work of the Security Model
Committee.
52. The original of the present Charter, drawn up in English, French, German, Italian, Russian and
Spanish, will be transmitted to the Secretary General of the Organization, who will transmit a certified true
copy of this Charter to each of the participating States.
We, the undersigned High Representatives of the participating States, mindful of the high political significance that we attach to the present Charter and declaring our determination to act in accordance with
the provisions contained in the above text, have subscribed our signatures below.

###### CONCLUSIONS OF THE HELSINKI EUROPEAN COUNCIL ON THE COMMON EUROPEAN POLICY ON SECURITY AND DEFENCE

**Adopted by the European Council of the EU on 10 and 11 December 1999**

**II. Common european policy on security and defence**

25. The European Council adopts the two Presidency progress reports (see Annex IV) on developing
the Union’s military and non-military crisis management capability as part of a strengthened common
European policy on security and defence.
26. The Union will contribute to international peace and security in accordance with the principles of
the United Nations Charter. The Union recognises the primary responsibility of the United Nations Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security.
27. The European Council underlines its determination to develop an autonomous capacity to take
decisions and, where NATO as a whole is not engaged, to launch and conduct EU-led military operations
in response to international crises. This process will avoid unnecessary duplication and does not imply the
creation of a European army.
28. Building on the guidelines established at the Cologne European Council and on the basis of the
Presidency’s reports, the European Council has agreed in particular the following:

-  cooperating voluntarily in EU-led operations, Member States must be able, by 2003, to deploy within 60 days and sustain for at least 1 year military forces of up to 50,000-60,000 persons capable of the
full range of Petersberg tasks;

-  new political and military bodies and structures will be established within the Council to enable the
Union to ensure the necessary political guidance and strategic direction to such operations, while
respecting the single institutional framework;

-  modalities will be developed for full consultation, cooperation and transparency between the EU
and NATO, taking into account the needs of all EU Member States;

-  appropriate arrangements will be defined that would allow, while respecting the Union’s decisionmaking autonomy, non-EU European NATO members and other interested States to contribute to
EU military crisis management;

-  a non-military crisis management mechanism will be established to coordinate and make more
effective the various civilian means and resources, in parallel with the military ones, at the disposal
of the Union and the Member States.

29. The European Council asks the incoming Presidency, together with the Secretary-General/High
Representative, to carry work forward in the General Affairs Council on all aspects of the reports as a matter of priority, including conflict prevention and a committee for civilian crisis management. The incoming
Presidency is invited to draw up a first progress report to the Lisbon European Council and an overall
report to be presented to the Feira European Council containing appropriate recommendations and proposals, as well as an indication of whether or not Treaty amendment is judged necessary. The General
Affairs Council is invited to begin implementing these decisions by establishing as of March 2000 the
agreed interim bodies and arrangements within the Council, in accordance with the current Treaty provisions.

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

Annex IV

**Presidency reports to the Helsinki European Council On “Strengthening the Common**
**European Policy on Security and Defence” and on “non-military crisis management of the**
**European Union”**

The Presidency has responded as a matter of priority to the mandate given by the Cologne European
Council to strengthen the common European policy on security and defence by taking the work forward
in military and non-military aspects of crisis management. The work has been based on the provisions of
the Treaty on European Union and the guiding principles agreed at Cologne, which have been reaffirmed
by the Member States.
Work has yielded two separate progress reports to the European Council, which are intended to be
complementary. The reports propose concrete measures and provide guidance for further work to take the
necessary decisions by the end of the year 2000 towards the objectives set at Cologne. During the Portuguese Presidency, consideration will be given as to whether or not Treaty amendment is judged necessary.
To assume their responsibilities across the full range of conflict prevention and crisis management
tasks defined in the EU Treaty, the Petersberg tasks, the Member States have decided to develop more effective military capabilities and establish new political and military structures for these tasks. In this connection, the objective is for the Union to have an autonomous capacity to take decisions and, where NATO as
a whole is not engaged, to launch and then to conduct EU-led military operations in response to international crises.
Also in order to assume these responsibilities, the Union will improve and make more effective use of
resources in civilian crisis management in which the Union and the Members States already have considerable experience. Special attention will be given to a rapid reaction capability.
All these measures will be taken in support of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and they will
reinforce and extend the Union’s comprehensive external role. With the enhancement and concertation of
military and civilian crisis response tools, the Union will be able to resort to the whole range of instruments
from diplomatic activity, humanitarian assistance and economic measures to civilian policing and military
crisis management operations.
NATO remains the foundation of the collective defence of its members, and will continue to have an
important role in crisis management.
The development of the common European policy on security and defence will take place without prejudice to the commitments under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty and Article V of the Brussels Treaty,
which will be preserved for the Member States party to these Treaties. Nor shall the development of the
common European policy on security and defence prejudice the specific character of the security and
defence policy of certain Member States.
Further steps will be taken to ensure full mutual consultation, cooperation and transparency between
the EU and NATO.
The Union will contribute to international peace and security in accordance with the principles of the
United Nations Charter. The Union recognises the primary responsibility of the United Nations Security
Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. Following up the principles and objectives
of the OSCE Charter for European Security, the Union will cooperate with the UN, the OSCE, the Council
of Europe and other international organisations in a mutually reinforcing manner in stability promotion,
early warning, conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict reconstruction.

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

Annex 1 to Annex IV

**Presidency progress report to the Helsinki European Council on strengthening the**
**Common European Policy on Security and Defence**

**_Introduction_**

Recalling the guiding principles agreed at Cologne, the European Union should be able to assume its
responsibilities for the full range of conflict prevention and crisis management tasks defined in the EU
Treaty, the Petersberg tasks.
The European Union should have the autonomous capacity to take decisions and, where NATO as a
whole is not engaged, to launch and then to conduct EU-led military operations in response to international crises in support of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). The action by the Union will
be conducted in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter and the principles and objectives of the
OSCE Charter for European Security. The Union recognises the primary responsibility of the United
Nations Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security.
For this purpose, the following has been agreed:
A common European headline goal will be adopted for readily deployable military capabilities and
collective capability goals in the fields of command and control, intelligence and strategic transport will be
developed rapidly, to be achieved through voluntary co-ordinated national and multinational efforts, for
carrying out the full range of Petersberg tasks.
New political and military bodies will be established within the Council to enable the Union to take
decisions on EU-led Petersberg operations and to ensure, under the authority of the Council, the necessary
political control and strategic direction of such operations.
Principles for cooperation with non-EU European NATO members and other European partners in
EU-led military crisis management will be agreed, without prejudice to the Union’s decision-making
autonomy.
Determination to carry out Petersberg tasks will require Member States to improve national and
multinational military capabilities, which will at the same time, as appropriate, strengthen the capabilities of NATO and enhance the effectiveness of the Partnership for Peace (PfP) in promoting European
security.
In presenting this report, the Presidency has taken note of the fact that Denmark has recalled Protocol
nº 5 to the Amsterdam Treaty on the position of Denmark.

**_Military capabilities for Petersberg tasks_**

Member States recall their commitment made at Cologne and their determination to give the EU
appropriate capabilities, without unnecessary duplication, to be able to undertake the full range of Petersberg tasks in support of the CFSP. Such capabilities will enable them to conduct effective EU-led operations
as well as playing, for those involved, their full role in NATO and NATO-led operations. More effective
European military capabilities will be developed on the basis of the existing national, bi-national and
multinational capabilities, which will be assembled for EU-led crisis management operations carried out
with or without recourse to NATO assets and capabilities. Particular attention will be devoted to the capabilities necessary to ensure effective performance in crisis management: deployability, sustainability, interoperability, flexibility, mobility, survivability and command and control, taking account of the results of the
WEU audit of assets and capabilities and their implications for EU-led operations.
To develop European capabilities, Member States have set themselves the headline goal: by the year
2003, cooperating together voluntarily, they will be able to deploy rapidly and then sustain forces capable
of the full range of Petersberg tasks as set out in the Amsterdam Treaty, including the most demanding, in
operations up to corps level (up to 15 brigades or 50,000-60,000 persons). These forces should be militarily self-sustaining with the necessary command, control and intelligence capabilities, logistics, other combat support services and additionally, as appropriate, air and naval elements. Member States should be
able to deploy in full at this level within 60 days, and within this to provide smaller rapid response elements available and deployable at very high readiness. They must be able to sustain such a deployment

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

for at least one year. This will require an additional pool of deployable units (and supporting elements) at
lower readiness to provide replacements for the initial forces.
Member States have also decided to develop rapidly collective capability goals in the fields of command and control, intelligence and strategic transport, areas also identified by the WEU audit. They
welcome in this respect decisions already announced by certain Member States which go in that direction:

-  to develop and coordinate monitoring and early warning military means;

-  to open existing joint national headquarters to officers coming from other Member States;

-  to reinforce the rapid reaction capabilities of existing European multinational forces;

-  to prepare the establishment of a European air transport command;

-  to increase the number of readily deployable troops;

-  to enhance strategic sea lift capacity.

The General Affairs Council, with the participation of Defence Ministers, will elaborate the headline
and capability goals. It will develop a method of consultation through which these goals can be met and
maintained, and through which national contributions reflecting Member States’ political will and commitment towards these goals can be defined by each Member State, with a regular review of progress
made. In addition, Member States would use existing defence planning procedures, including, as appropriate, those available in NATO and the Planning and Review Process (PARP) of the PfP. These objectives
and those arising, for those countries concerned, from NATO’s Defence Capabilities Initiative (DCI) will
be mutually reinforcing.
The European NATO members who are not EU Member States, and other countries who are candidates for accession to the European Union will be invited to contribute to this improvement of European
military capabilities. This will enhance the effectiveness of EU-led military operations and will, for those
countries concerned, contribute directly to the effectiveness and vitality of the European pillar of the
NATO.
Member States welcome the recent progress made towards the restructuring of European defence
industries, which constitutes an important step forward. This contributes to strengthening the European
industrial and technological defence base. Such developments call for increased efforts to seek further
progress in the harmonisation of military requirements and the planning and procurement of arms, as
Member States consider appropriate.

**_Decision-making_**

The Council decides upon policy relevant to Union involvement in all phases and aspects of crisis management, including decisions to carry out Petersberg tasks in accordance with Article 23 of the EU Treaty.
Taken within the single institutional framework, decisions will respect European Community competences
and ensure inter-pillar coherence in conformity with Article 3 of the EU Treaty.
All Member States are entitled to participate fully and on an equal footing in all decisions and deliberations of the Council and Council bodies on EU-led operations. The commitment of national assets by
Member States to such operations will be based on their sovereign decision. Member States will participate
in the ad hoc committee of contributors in accordance with the conditions provided for by paragraph 24.
Defence Ministers will be involved in the common European security and defence policy (CESDP);
when the General Affairs Council discusses matters related to the CESDP, Defence Ministers as appropriate will participate to provide guidance on defence matters.
The following new permanent political and military bodies will be established within the Council:

a A standing Political and Security Committee (PSC) in Brussels will be composed of national representatives of senior/ambassadorial level. The PSC will deal with all aspects of the CFSP, including
the CESDP, in accordance with the provisions of the EU Treaty and without prejudice to Community competence. In the case of a military crisis management operation, the PSC will exercise, under
the authority of the Council, the political control and strategic direction of the operation. For that
purpose, appropriate procedures will be adopted in order to allow effective and urgent decision taking. The PSC will also forward guidelines to the Military Committee.

Page 272 Defence White Paper


-----

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

b The Military Committee (MC) will be composed of the Chiefs of Defence, represented by their military delegates. The MC will meet at the level of the Chiefs of Defence as and when necessary. This
committee will give military advice and make recommendations to the PSC, as well as provide military direction to the Military Staff. The Chairman of the MC will attend meetings of the Council
when decisions with defence implications are to be taken.
c The Military Staff (MS)within the Council structures will provide military expertise and support to
the CESDP, including the conduct of EU-led military crisis management operations. The Military
Staff will perform early warning, situation assessment and strategic planning for Petersberg tasks
including identification of European national and multinational forces.

As an interim measure, the following bodies will be set up within the Council as of March 2000:

a Fully respecting the Treaty provisions, the Council will establish a standing interim political and
security committee at senior/ambassadorial level tasked to take forward under the guidance of the
Political Committee the follow up of the Helsinki European Council by preparing recommendations
on the future functioning of the CESDP and to deal with CFSP affairs on a day-to-day basis in close
contacts with the SG/HR.
b An interim body of military representatives of Member States’ Chiefs of Defence is established to
give military advice as required to the interim political and security committee.
c The Council Secretariat will be strengthened by military experts seconded from Member States in
order to assist in the work on the CESDP and to form the nucleus of the future Military Staff.

The Secretary General/High Representative (SG/HR), in assisting the Council, has a key contribution
to make to the efficiency and consistency of the CFSP and the development of the common security and
defence policy. In conformity with the EU Treaty, the SG/HR will contribute to the formulation, preparation and implementation of policy decisions.
In the interim period, the SG/HR, Secretary General of the WEU, should make full use of WEU assets
for the purpose of advising the Council under Article 17 of the EU Treaty.

**_Consultation and cooperation with non-EU countries and with NATO_**

The Union will ensure the necessary dialogue, consultation and cooperation with NATO and its nonEU members, other countries who are candidates for accession to the EU as well as other prospective partners in EU-led crisis management, with full respect for the decision-making autonomy of the EU and the
single institutional framework of the Union.
With European NATO members who are not members of the EU and other countries who are candidates for accession to the EU, appropriate structures will be established for dialogue and information on
issues related to security and defence policy and crisis management. In the event of a crisis, these structures will serve for consultation in the period leading up to a decision of the Council.
Upon a decision by the Council to launch an operation, the non-EU European NATO members will participate if they so wish, in the event of an operation requiring recourse to NATO assets and capabilities. They will,
on a decision by the Council, be invited to take part in operations where the EU does not use NATO assets.
Other countries who are candidates for accession to the EU may also be invited by the Council to take
part in EU-led operations once the Council has decided to launch such an operation.
Russia, Ukraine and other European States engaged in political dialogue with the Union and other
interested States may be invited to take part in the EU-led operations.
All the States that have confirmed their participation in an EU-led operation by deploying significant
military forces will have the same rights and obligations as the EU participating Member States in the dayto-day conduct of such an operation.
In the case of an EU-led operation, an ad-hoc committee of contributors will be set up for the day-today conduct of the operation. All EU Member States are entitled to attend the ad-hoc committee, whether
or not they are participating in the operation, while only contributing States will take part in the day-today conduct of the operation.
The decision to end an operation will be taken by the Council after consultation between the participating states within the committee of contributors.

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

Modalities for full consultation, cooperation and transparency between the EU and NATO will be
developed. Initially, relations will be developed on an informal basis, through contacts between the
SG/HR for CFSP and the Secretary General of NATO.

**_Follow-up for the Portuguese Presidency_**

The Portuguese Presidency is invited, together with the Secretary General/High Representative, to
carry forward the work within the General Affairs Council on strengthening the common European security and defence policy. The Portuguese Presidency is also invited to report to the European Council in
Feira on the progress made, including:

a recommendations on the institutional development of the new permanent political and military bodies related to the CESDP within the EU, taking into account the paper on “Military bodies in the
European Union and the planning and conduct of EU-led operations” and other contributions made;
b proposals on appropriate arrangements to be concluded by the Council on modalities of consultation and/or participation that will allow the third States concerned to contribute to EU military crisis management;
c proposals on principles for consultation with NATO on military issues and recommendations on
developing modalities for EU/NATO relations, to permit co-operation on the appropriate military
response to a crisis, as set out in Washington and at Cologne;
d an indication of whether or not Treaty amendment is judged necessary.

Annex 2 to Annex IV

**Presidency report on non-military crisis management of the European Union**

The Presidency was mandated by the European Council in Cologne to continue the work on all
aspects of security including the enhancement and better coordination of the Union’s and the Member
States’ non-military crisis response tools. Developments inter alia in Kosovo have for their part underlined the importance of this task. To this end, a thorough discussion has been carried out within the Council instances.
Work listing all available resources of the Member States and the Union has been initiated and has led
to inventories of the tools available to the Union and to Member States, which are contained respectively
in doc. 11044/99 REV 1 for the Union and in doc. 12323/99 for the Member States.
The inventories which have been drawn up clearly show that Member States, the Union, or both have
accumulated considerable experience or have considerable resources in a number of areas such as civilian
police, humanitarian assistance, administrative and legal rehabilitation, search and rescue, electoral and
human rights monitoring, etc. This inventory should be pursued further. Regular updating will be necessary to better identify lacunae as well as strongpoints.
In order to be able to respond more rapidly and more effectively to emerging crisis situations, the
Union needs to strengthen the responsiveness and efficiency of its resources and tools, as well as their synergy.
It is therefore appropriate to draw up an Action Plan which would show the way ahead and indicate
the steps the Union has to undertake to develop a rapid reaction capability in the field of crisis management using non-military instruments.

**_Action Plan_**

a The Union should aim at:

-  strengthening the synergy and responsiveness of national, collective and NGO resources in order
to avoid duplication and improve performance, while maintaining the flexibility of each contributor to decide on the deployment of assets and capabilities in a particular crisis, or via a particular channel;

-  enhancing and facilitating the EU’s contributions to, and activities within, other organisations,

Page 274 Defence White Paper


-----

APPENDIX G: SECURITY AND DEFENCE DOCUMENTS

such as the UN and the OSCE whenever one of them is the lead organisation in a particular crisis, as well as EU autonomous actions;

-  ensuring inter-pillar coherence.

b To that end:

-  Member States and the Union should develop a rapid reaction capability by defining a framework
and modalities, as well as by pre-identifying personnel, material and financial resources that
could be used in response to a request of a lead agency like the UN or the OSCE, or, where appropriate, in autonomous EU actions.

-  An inventory of national and collective resources should be pursued to give an overview of
resources that could be marshalled within such a rapid reaction framework. In this process Member States and the EU institutions could, if they wish, highlight sectors in which they find that they
have acknowledged expertise.

-  A database should be set up to maintain and share information on the pre-identified assets, capabilities and expertise within all areas relevant to non-military crisis management. The availability
and quality of these assets would need to be clearly defined.

-  A study should be carried out, taking into account lessons learned, to define concrete targets for
EU Member States’ collective non-military response to international crises (e.g. the ability to
deploy at short notice and sustain for a defined period a set number of civilian police as a contribution to civpol missions; to deploy a combined search and rescue capability of up to 200 people
within twenty-four hours). This work should be taken forward by the Portuguese Presidency
together with the SG/HR.

-  The inventory, the database project and the study should help identify areas of relative strength
and weakness and could promote improved training standards, sharing of experience and best
practice, as well as bilateral or multilateral projects between Member States (e.g. ‘pairing’ one
Member State’s helicopter lift with a specialist medical team from another).

-  A coordinating mechanism, fully interacting with the Commission services, should be set up at
the Council Secretariat. It would run the database project and the different capabilities initiatives.
In particular crises, depending on the EU’s role, it may set up an ad hoc centre to coordinate the
effectiveness of EU Member States’ contributions. This should be a lean, efficient, non-bureaucratic structure permitting close interaction with the Commission (ECHO in particular).

-  In establishing a rapid reaction capability urgent consideration will be given to developing civil
police capabilities.

-  Rapid financing mechanisms such as the creation by the Commission of a Rapid Reaction Fund
should be set up to allow the acceleration of the provision of finance to support EU activities, to
contribute to operations run by other international organisations and to fund NGO activities, as
appropriate.

**_Decision-making and implementation_**

The Union should develop a comprehensive approach with a view to marshalling national and collective non-military instruments within the time limits called for by the situation on the ground.
For the coordination of civilian crisis management tools, the co-ordinating mechanism for a civilian crisis management will be established. This mechanism, which will be of inter-pillar nature, will provide
expert advice in support of the management of crises. Decision-making and implementation of non-military crisis management tools under the first pillar will remain subject to institutions and procedures of the
EC Treaty.
As an interim practice, this work to develop the co-ordinating mechanism for civilian crisis management may draw on experts from the Member States.
If appropriate, the Union will lay down general guidelines ensuring inter-pillar coherence and setting
out the means which should be made available. Arrangements for rapid financing mechanisms for a
prompt response to crisis situations could be devised in this context.
