###### Foreword by the Secretary of State for Defence
 the Right Honourable Geoff Hoon MP

In the Defence White Paper of last December I set out the need to defend against

the principal security challenges of the future: international terrorism, the proliferation
of Weapons of Mass Destruction, and weak and failing states. Our need in the future is
for flexible and adaptable armed forces properly supported to carry out the most likely
expeditionary operations. To create a more sustainable and affordable force structure
which better meets these operational requirements we have secured additional resources:
the 2004 Spending Review allocated £3.7 billion to defence across the Spending Review
period, which represents an average real terms increase of 1.4% a year. Additionally,
we shall also generate resources to strengthen the front line through our comprehensive
efficiency and rationalisation plans, the benefits of which will be ploughed back into the
defence budget. As indicated in the White Paper, we are pursuing radical change in the
future force structure, reducing force levels in some capabilities in order to invest more
in higher priority capabilities better able to achieve the effects we will require. We will
increase our capacity to undertake expeditionary operations alongside an equipment
programme that is delivering, and will continue to deliver, an advanced range of
capabilities. The result will ensure that the resources the Government commits to Defence
are deployed to optimum effect. The Chiefs of Staff support the radical change we are
pursuing and have been instrumental in its preparation.

###### Future Capabilities

# Chapter 1

###### Introduction


1.1 The Defence White Paper set

out our analysis of the future security
environment, the implications for
defence, our strategic priorities and
how we intend to adapt our planning
and force structures to meet potential
threats. This policy was an evolution
of the strategy contained in the 1998
Strategic Defence Review (SDR),
and built on the conclusions of the
2002 SDR New Chapter and recent
operational experience. Crucially, it
demonstrated the need to adapt to the
more pronounced threats presented
by international terrorism and the
proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction (WMD) and the challenges
posed to the international community by
weak and failing states.

1.2 The White Paper set out a revised

set of assumptions which underpin
future planning. These include:

- An expanded regional focus beyond

the core regions set out in the
Strategic Defence Review of Europe,
the Near East, North Africa and the
Gulf, to reflect the requirement to
operate further afield across subSaharan Africa and South Asia,
and to meet the wider threat from
international terrorism on a global
basis.

- The need to strike the right balance

of capabilities for expeditionary
operations to meet the demands of
our eight strategic effects - Prevent,
Stabilise, Contain, Deter, Coerce,
Disrupt, Defeat and Destroy.



- The need to optimise our force

structure to support three concurrent
small and medium scale[1] operations
(rather than two in the SDR) including
the capability to lead or be framework
nation for coalition operations where
the US is not involved.

- The retention of the flexibility to

reconfigure for less frequent large
scale operations, while concurrently
conducting a small scale operation.
The full spectrum of capabilities is not
required for large scale operations,
as the most demanding operations
could only conceivably be undertaken
alongside the US, either as a NATO
operation or a US led coalition,
where we have choices as to what to
contribute.

- The importance of the continued

transformation of our forces to
concentrate on the characteristics of
speed, precision, agility, deployability,
reach and sustainability. Key to this
is our ability to exploit the benefits of
Network Enabled Capability, precision
munitions and the development of
effects-based planning and operations.

- The importance of those capabilities

which can rapidly come together to
achieve specific military effect and then
rapidly adapt with other capabilities to
achieve what is required by the next
operation. By doing so decisive military
effect may be achieved through a
smaller number of more capable, linked
assets acting quickly and precisely to
achieve a desired outcome.



- The need to ensure that the

organisation of our Armed Forces
reflects the reasonable aspirations
of our people in the 21st Century
in terms, for example, of greater
geographic stability in their home
lives.

- Continued support to the Home Office

and other civil authorities charged
with the safety and security of the UK,
both through routine military tasks
and our preparedness to support
them in a time of crisis.

1.3 Based on this analysis the White

Paper set out a revised set of 18 Military
Tasks, both standing and contingent,
with the range of strategic effects
our armed forces need to be capable
of delivering. Extensive work has
been undertaken to identify the future
force structure and the development
of capability in the longer term. An
illustration of how we match capability
against military tasks is attached at
Annex. As new capabilities come into
service such calculations will change,
particularly with our increasing focus
on effects achieved by combinations of
flexible and adaptable forces.


_1  An example of a small scale operation was the UK’s deployment to Macedonia in_
_2001; Afghanistan (2001) was at medium scale; and Operation TELIC large scale._


-----

**Force Structure Changes - Key**
**Judgements**

1.4 In determining where we have

the most scope for change within the
force structure to allow necessary
rebalancing and continued investment
in transformational capabilities we have
focused on key policy judgements from
the White Paper, in particular:

- The need to rebalance and optimise

our Armed Forces to meet the
demands of the more likely multiple
concurrent and enduring small and
medium scale operations. This
requires the capability to form a third
line of communication including
deployable Headquarters, and
Command, Control, Communications,
Computers, Intelligence and
Surveillance and Reconnaissance
(C4ISR) assets and logistics. It also
demands that all deployable units
should be fully manned, minimising
the requirement for individual
reinforcements and backfilling.

- The requirement to enhance our

ability to lead or be the framework
nation for European (and other
coalition) operations where the US
is not engaged. To do so we must


continue to have the full spectrum
of military capabilities to achieve the
desired effects at medium scale. For
some of our assets such operations
have now become the principal driver
in determining the size of the force
needed.

- The assumption, based on the

experience of the last 10 years, that
on enduring operations, once the joint
force has been deployed and stability
established, lower force levels and
generally lighter forces are required.
This has particular implications for the
levels of maritime sea control, air and
heavier offensive land forces required
on an enduring basis.

- The assumption that the most

complex large scale operations will
only be conducted as part of a USled coalition. Our primary goal is
to maximise our ability to influence
at all levels the planning, execution
and management of the operation
and its aftermath, in support of our
wider security policy objectives. Our
force structure at large scale should
therefore focus on those capabilities
which add real weight to the
campaign and hence the UK’s ability
to influence its outcome. The most
important capabilities are those which
contribute to:

  - initial theatre entry and shaping

operations;

  - intelligence, surveillance and

reconnaissance;



  - precision attack of strategic targets;

  - joint land and air offensive

operations; and

  - post-conflict stabilisation.

- Our aim at large scale is therefore to

contribute:

 - Special Forces;

 - a range of C4ISR assets, forming

our own network and integrated
with the US network;

 - amphibious and carrier strike task

groups;

  - an air expeditionary task force

capable of both long range strike
and support to land operations; and

 - a land manoeuvre division capable

of conducting offensive operations.

###### Future Capabilities

 Improved Effect through Improved Improved Accuracy

**During the Vietnam War over**
800 sorties were flown against
the Thanh Hoa bridge before it
was destroyed by aircraft using
precision weapons. Today we
would aim to destroy a similar
target with a single formation of
6 Tornado aircraft with Enhanced
Precision guided bombs.

Improved accuracy on target translates into
a direct improvement on the desired kinetic
effect and therefore we can more accurately
and more efficiently achieve our military aim
with minimum risk of collateral damage.

**We therefore need fewer munitions,**
**sorties and aircraft per target to achieve**
**the desired effect.**

- Although the serious impact that

the presence of a hostile submarine
could have on maritime operations
requires us to retain the capability to
neutralise such a threat, the potential
threat from hostile submarines to
most future UK operations is likely
to be very low. We have therefore
judged it appropriate to reduce the
numbers of platforms optimised for
anti-submarine operations, while
continuing to enhance the quality of
those that remain and ensure that
they are able to contribute fully in
other capability areas.

and more efficiently achieve our military aim
with minimum risk of collateral damage.

**We therefore need fewer munitions,**
**sorties and aircraft per target to achieve**

- Similarly, the air threat to deployed

forces has greatly reduced and
the capability of our air superiority
aircraft and other air defence assets
is continuing to improve. So we need
fewer aircraft and fewer ground-based
air defence systems to meet the
threat.

- The effectiveness of modern precision

weapons and sensors, which can
be used in all weathers, day and
night, mean that highly accurate air
delivered offensive effects can be
achieved with fewer fast jets than
before (see diagram above).

- While recognising the need to

continue to provide appropriate levels
of support to the Police Service of
Northern Ireland, the more favourable
security situation in Northern Ireland
allows further reductions in the
forces permanently committed to the
Province, while retaining an ability to
reinforce at short notice.


A Tornado GR4 dropping a
precision guided munition, such
as Enhanced Paveway II, will be
around 10 times more accurate than
it would be with a “dumb” bomb.


**Methodology**

1.5 In addition to routine planning,

in January this year the Department
set up multi-disciplinary Service and
civilian teams to examine 16 thematic
workstrands, using the policy baseline
established by the Defence White Paper
and focusing on the key judgements
set out above. The aim was to identify
the optimum sustainable and affordable
force structure to deliver the revised
policy requirement, while releasing
resources to invest in our future
priorities. The workstrands involved a
rigorous examination of force structure,
specific equipment requirements and
supporting infrastructure, manpower
and organisational structure. Set out in
the following chapter, by capability area,
are the changes we have concluded
we should make to the current force
structure and our key capability
requirements for the future.


-----

# Chapter 2

###### Force Structure Changes


**Network Enabled Capability**

2.1 At the heart of this transformation

is Network Enabled Capability (NEC).
NEC is about the coherent integration of
sensors, decision-makers and weapon
systems along with support capabilities.
NEC will enable us to operate more
effectively in the future strategic
environment through the more efficient
sharing and exploitation of information
within the UK Armed Forces and with
our coalition partners. This will lead to
better situational awareness across the
board, facilitating improved decisionmaking, and bringing to bear the right
military capabilities at the right time to
achieve the desired military effect. This
enhanced capability is about more than
equipment; we will exploit the benefits
to be obtained from transformed
doctrine and training, and optimised
command and control structures. The
ability to respond more quickly and
precisely will act as a force multiplier
enabling our forces to achieve the
desired effect through a smaller number
of more capable linked assets. (An
illustrative scenario showing the benefits
NEC will bring to the delivery of military
effect is overleaf.)


2.2 We recognise that as technology

and our understanding of NEC change
over time, our military capability will
have to evolve. We have defined a clear
set of priorities to deliver NEC over
three interconnected phases, which will
improve the connectivity of currently
planned equipment, further integrate
organisations and systems, and then
synchronise all aspects of military effect.

2.3 Within the next five years there are

several major programmes which will
contribute to the high capacity network
required to support NEC: Skynet 5
delivers the next generation of military
satellite communications services to
support all UK operations; Cormorant
will link the strategic satellite based
communications with operationally
deployed headquarters, and Falcon will
provide a secure communication system
at the operational level; Bowman meets
tactical voice and data communications
needs. Building on these foundations,
the Defence Information Infrastructure
will provide the capability to exchange
and share electronic information across
Defence from foxhole to stores depot
and from sensor to shooter. Elsewhere
in the network, the MOD is continuing to


invest in developing stand-off sensors,
such as Watchkeeper, an Unmanned
Air Vehicle and improved electronic
warfare capabilities such as Soothsayer.
The recently trialled ASTOR airborne
surveillance system will meet the Army
and RAF requirement for surveillance,
reconnaissance and target acquisition
information, as well as providing the
UK’s contribution to NATO’s Alliance
Ground Surveillance project. Improved
stand-off sensors will not, however,
remove the requirement for timely and
accurate human intelligence (HUMINT),
particularly in the field at the operational
and tactical levels. We intend, therefore,
to provide additional deployable
HUMINT teams.

###### Future Capabilities


**NEC – A SCENARIO**

Autumn 2010, UK maritime, land and air forces are engaged in a focused intervention

somewhere in sub-Saharan Africa.

13.54 Two fast-moving light utility vehicles carrying heavily armed terrorists with shoulder
launched surface-to-air missiles and rocket-propelled grenades are detected by an army
reconnaissance squadron on patrol. They classify it as a possible target, and immediately
report it to their Unit HQ using their Bowman digitally encrypted radios. 1

2 13.57 This information is quickly relayed to Brigade HQ and supporting land forces

and then on to Joint Forces Land Component Command (JFLCC). Within minutes a
Watchkeeper UAV, operated remotely, has been diverted to find and positively identify the
target using its own sensors.

3 14.08 Meanwhile, the JFLCC has reassigned the on-station ASTOR battlefield surveillance

aircraft to track the moving target and briefs the Joint Task Force HQ (JTFHQ).

4 14.10 The JFLCC and in conjunction with the Joint Forces Air Component Command

(JFACC), develops a plan for engaging the target on the basis of an intelligence picture
updated in real-time from numerous sources, which include the reconnaissance team on the
ground, the UAV and ASTOR, even intelligence reports relayed from the UK by the Skynet 5
satellite system.

5 14.15 Authorisation for the strike may be required from JTFHQ or from the UK, depending

on the rules of engagement in force.

6 14.16 Using Tactical Information Exchange Capability (TIEC) and secure voice radio, the

JFACC directs an E3D Sentry to re-task two Harrier GR9 aircraft, from the nearby carrier
group, who have been on stand-by in a holding pattern.

7 14.24 The Harriers engage the terrorists with Maverick precision-guided munitions using

updated co-ordinates received over TIEC.

8 14.29 The Watchkeeper UAV provides a battle damage assessment, and confirm the

destruction of the target – a little over 30 minutes from when it was first observed.

**Special Forces**

2.4 We are increasing the strength

of our Special Forces and investing in
new equipment for them. These are
significant enhancements, but the
details of these changes must remain
classified.

**Maritime**

2.5 As set out in the White Paper,

the future Navy will provide a versatile
and expeditionary force with an
increased emphasis on delivering effect
onto land at a time and place of our
choosing. The future force structure
will be focused on the carrier strike and
amphibious capabilities, including the
Commando Brigade. In the short term,
the capability will be built around the
existing carriers and Joint Force Harrier
operating the upgraded Harrier GR9.
The new carriers deploying the Joint
Combat Aircraft (JCA) will transform
our capability to project power from
the sea. They will have greater reach,
sustainability and survivability than
the existing carriers and will be able to
deploy a much more powerful mix of
fast jets and helicopters. The stateof-the-art, multi-role JCA will provide
significantly increased performance,
improving strike and reconnaissance
capabilities, as well as incorporating
stealth technology. Similarly, a robust
and modern amphibious capability
based around two new ships, HMS
ALBION and BULWARK, supported by
the Bay Class landing ships will provide
a step change in our ability to launch
and support forces ashore.

2.6 Destroyers and frigates provide a

range of effects, both from within a task
group, protecting the carrier, amphibious
and strategic lift capability, and also
at smaller scales in their own right. In
future, these platforms, in particular
Type 45, will provide far greater
capability to counter modern threats


through improved and networked
sensors, command and control and
weapons, as well as greater versatility
when individually deployed on smaller
operations. A Co-operative Engagement
Capability to link sensors and weapons
systems of the Type 45 destroyers will
provide much more effective maritime
air defence, and on the Type 23 frigates
will improve their point defence and
situational awareness. In the light of
the reduced conventional threat, our
revised concurrency assumptions and
improved networked capability, we
assess that we need fewer of these
platforms. Consequently we have a
requirement for 8 Type 45 destroyers
and will need 25 destroyers and frigates
overall. This will be achieved by payingoff our oldest Type 42 destroyers HMS
CARDIFF, NEWCASTLE and GLASGOW,
and reducing the number of Type 23
frigates by paying-off HMS NORFOLK,
MARLBOROUGH and GRAFTON earlier
than currently planned by March 2006.
The numbers of ships remaining will
continue to be sufficient to carry out
our high priority standing tasks, and
will maintain the technological edge
to counter threats if and when they
arise, through continuing development,
including the introduction of the Type
2087 Low Frequency Active Sonar.

2.7 We judge in the light of the

reduced threat that an attack submarine
fleet of 8 SSNs will be sufficient to meet
the full range of tasks. This force size
will be achieved when HMS SUPERB
and TRAFALGAR pay-off as planned
by December 2008. For the future,
the introduction of the ASTUTE class
submarines will represent a significant
addition to the delivery of effects based
warfare. Their increased weapons
payload coupled with our investment in
the latest generation of Tomahawk land
attack missiles will give each submarine
even greater flexible precision firepower
for land attack.

2.8 The changes in the scale of the

anti-submarine capability will allow us
to reduce the current Nimrod MR2 fleet
from 21 to 16 and shift their primary role
towards wider surveillance in support
of joint military and security operations.
The MRA4 aircraft should offer greater
range and endurance to support
operations over a wider area coupled
with improved sensors providing greater
surveillance utility in the land, as well
as the maritime environment. Subject
to industry demonstrating satisfactory
performance at acceptable prices, the
requirement could in future be met by a


fleet of about 12 aircraft.

2.9 The reduced threat and changed

requirement for large scale operations
means we can meet our operational
and standing tasks with a reduced fleet
of 16 mine counter-measure vessels,
through paying-off HMS INVERNESS,
BRIDPORT and SANDOWN by April
2005. The improved security situation
in Northern Ireland makes it possible to
pay off the Hunt class patrol vessels,
HMS BRECON, DULVERTON and
COTTESMORE by April 2007. Our
continued investment in oceanographic
survey and environmental technology,
with the new ships HMS ECHO and
ENTERPRISE, has delivered a unique,
world-class capability providing direct
support to both our own forces and our
allies.

2.10 In summary, we are building
a versatile, expeditionary maritime
capability with far greater and
more flexible “punch” into the land
environment, delivered at range
from the UK and a time and place of
our choosing. This will comprise a
transformed strike capability based
around future carriers, with Joint
Combat Aircraft, and nuclear powered
submarines alongside a robust
amphibious capability including 3
Commando Brigade. We will also be
able to provide appropriate independent
forces to smaller scale operations
through more individually capable
frigates and destroyers, which will also
offer networked force protection to the
carrier and amphibious task groups.
In total, this means a maritime force
transformed in its ability to conduct
maritime operations and contribute to
the land environment in terms of strike,
amphibious capability and surveillance.

**Land**

2.11 As previously announced in the
White Paper, our priority is to rebalance
Land forces so that they are better
structured and equipped to conduct the
full range of military tasks on concurrent
small and medium scale operations.
This will involve a major restructuring of
the Army to better enable brigade level
operations. The plan is to ensure that
each deployable brigade is fully manned
and has its own integral enablers and
logistics to allow it, or battlegroups
drawn from it, to undertake the most
likely tasks. The balanced Land force
of the future will consist of two heavy
armoured brigades, three medium
weight brigades and a Light Brigade,


-----

###### Future Capabilities

in addition to the Air Assault and Royal
Marine Commando Brigades. The new
emphasis on Medium Weight Forces,
based around the Future Rapid Effects
System (FRES) family of vehicles,
means that we will re-role heavy
capabilities and establish additional
surveillance, target acquisition and
enabling capabilities, including manned
reconnaissance, and an additional
Unmanned Air Vehicle battery. FRES
will operate alongside a new generation
of command and liaison vehicles, which
will begin entering service in 2007.

2.12 The shift in emphasis to Light
and Medium Weight Forces means that
we will establish an additional three
light armoured squadrons; re-role a
Challenger 2 regiment as an armoured
reconnaissance regiment; re-role an
AS90 regiment into a light gun regiment;
and in the medium term, equip three
artillery regiments with the new Light
Mobile Artillery Weapon System when
it enters service. At the same time,
we will increase our ability to engage
land targets with precision and at
range with the introduction into service
of the Apache attack helicopter this
Autumn and future improvements to our
missile inventory, beginning with entry
into service of the new infantry antitank guided weapon (Javelin) in 2005.
Collectively these improvements will
allow a reduction of seven Challenger
2 armoured squadrons and six AS90
batteries by March 2007.

2.13 The need to fight at close quarters
will remain an enduring requirement.
Our forces have recently received


upgrades to personnel protection,
firepower and night vision equipment
and 3 Commando Brigade are currently
receiving a new protected vehicle,
the Viking. Our dismounted infantry
capability will be further enhanced
through the Future Integrated Soldier
Technology Programme.

2.14 Northern Ireland has been the
largest single operational demand on
the Army since the end of the Cold
War, but the security situation is now
significantly improved. This has already
made it possible to reduce the number
of infantry battalions committed to
operations there by two. The Chief
Constable of the Police Service of
Northern Ireland (PSNI) and the General
Officer Commanding (GOC) have now
conducted a further review of security
requirements and concluded that from
the Autumn the number of battalions
assigned to the GOC can be reduced by
a further two, while still providing in full
the support the PSNI requires. Neither
unit is routinely based in Northern
Ireland. Taken together, the 4 infantry
battalion tasks which will cease this
year required the commitment of a total
of 16 infantry battalions to maintain 24
month tour intervals. We judge that
cessation of these tasks will reduce our
future requirement for infantry battalions
from 40 to 36. This change in long
term operational demands will enable
the Army to enhance significantly the
balanced all-arms capability it needs for
future expeditionary operations.

2.15 A central element in the Army’s
restructuring will be a fundamental
change to the way it organises the
infantry. The practice of arms plotting
– moving infantry battalions and their
families en bloc between roles and
geographical locations every few
years – will be phased out. This will
enable individual Servicemen and their
families to plan on being based within
a particular geographical area. Not
only will this be a more efficient use of
infantry battalions, it will also enable
Service families to put down roots in the
community within which they are based.

2.16 The new infantry structure
will continue to be organised on a


divisional basis, but a critical change
will be made with the adoption of large
regiments of two or more battalions,
making it possible for individuals
to move between units within their
division, thus enhancing the advantages
of geographical association, while
preserving the opportunity at an
individual level to move between
different roles. Both regular and reserve
forces will be incorporated into the
new structure, enabling the Army to
improve the links between regular units
and the reserves who reinforce them.
The reduction in the number of regular
battalions from 40 to 36 will comprise
one battalion recruited in Scotland and
three recruited in England. Details of the
new organisation will be worked out by
the Army and announced by the end of
the year.

2.17 All of the manpower freed up by
the restructuring of the infantry will
be reinvested, enabling the Army to
achieve the robust formation and unit
establishments needed to meet current
and future requirements. Rebalancing
will give the Army:

- Stronger and more resilient infantry

battalions;

- Sufficient engineers to create an

additional Explosive Ordnance
Disposal squadron, and to improve
combat engineer support for mobility
and counter-mobility tasks, such
as bridge-building and obstacle
crossing, at brigade level;

- More signallers to enhance network

access in 16 Air Assault Brigade, to
bolster our logistic communications
capability, and to provide additional
strategic communications for the
Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC);

- Additional intelligence staff, to

enhance our deployable intelligence
and security units and to provide a


-----

fully operational human intelligence
gathering (man on the ground)
capability; and

- Extra logistics support, including

additional fuel sections within each
brigade and a greater port and
maritime capability.

2.18 As a result of the reduced air threat
to our forces on operations, we intend
reducing Rapier anti-aircraft missile
launchers from 48 to 24 fire units which
will mean disbanding four RAF Regiment
Ground Based Air Defence (GBAD)
Squadrons. Rapier will be operated by
the Army and GBAD will be commanded
by a new Joint Headquarters within
the RAF Command Structure. We
will also reduce the High Velocity
Missile capability from 156 to 84 fire
units, by reducing the size of Regular
batteries and deleting the roles of two
TA regiments.  These latter regiments
will be re-roled, although plans for rebalancing are still being finalised.

**Air**

2.19 The UK’s air capabilities have
been significantly enhanced since the
SDR. Advances in weapons, networking
and in the aircraft themselves will see
continuing substantial improvements in
the decade to come. Our future combat
air power will be built around multi-role
Typhoon and Joint Combat Aircraft
able to deliver the offensive air and air
defence capabilities currently delivered
by single role aircraft. As we make the
transition towards a force structure
based on these types, total numbers
of fast jet crews and aircraft will vary
year by year, but we have revised our
air component requirements to take
account of developing capabilities and
to establish a firm baseline for force


levels over the next decade.

2.20 Recent upgrades to the Tornado
GR4 and continuing development of
the Harrier GR9 force ensure a potent
current offensive air and tactical
reconnaissance capability. We are
assessing how best to enable these
platforms to connect to the wider
network through the Tactical Information
Exchange Capability programme. The
new Storm Shadow long range air-tosurface missile, Brimstone and Maverick
anti-armour weapons and new precision
guided bombs considerably enhance
our offensive ability to achieve precise
effects. We judge that, as a result of
these and other improvements, an air
expeditionary task group capable of
deploying up to 64 offensive fast jets will
enable the full range of small, medium
and large scale contingent operations
to be conducted. Under these revised
requirements the offensive force will
require around 170 front line crews,
rather than about 210 at present. This
will enable us to draw down the Jaguar
force two years earlier than planned,
closing 54(F) Squadron in April 2005 and
41(F) Squadron in April 2006, with the
final Jaguar squadron, 6 Squadron, to
be disbanded in 2007.

2.21 The Tornado F3 force has
substantially improved in capability
through the introduction of Advanced
Medium Range Air-Air Missile
(AMRAAM), the world-leading Advanced
Short Range Air-Air Missile (ASRAAM),
and the Joint Tactical Information
Distribution System. Typhoon, equipped
in due course with the Meteor beyond
visual range missile in addition to
ASRAAM, will represent a further step
change in capabilities. We judge that,
given these enhanced capabilities and
the reduced air threat to our forces on
deployed operations, we will need the
ability to deploy up to 16 air defence
fighters within the air expeditionary task
group. When standing quick reaction
alert tasks are taken into account this
translates into a front line force of 55
crews, compared to about 80 crews at
present. This will allow the disbandment
of XI(F) Tornado F3 squadron in October
2005.

2.22 The overall reduction in the
number of fast jet aircrew required will


reduce requirements for fast jet training
and the number of training aircraft. We
remain committed to the procurement of
the Hawk 128. Final numbers, beyond
the initial 20, will be determined over the
next year.

2.23 Helicopters provide a key
capability in the battlefield and maritime
environments, and their flexibility means
that they contribute to the majority
of the Military Tasks. The recent
report on battlefield helicopters by the
National Audit Office assessed that
the UK helicopter fleet was arguably
the most capable in Europe. Certainly,
it is one of the most experienced,
with recent operations spanning from
the towns and villages of Northern
Ireland to the Iraqi desert, from the
mountains of Afghanistan to the jungles
of Sierra Leone, and from the Gulf
to the Caribbean. Over the next ten
years, we plan to invest some £3bn
in helicopter platforms to replace and
enhance our existing capability. In light
of the improved security situation in
Northern Ireland we plan to make some
reductions in overall helicopter numbers.

2.24 This substantial investment within
a relatively condensed timeframe
offers an opportunity to maximise
efficiencies and coherence across
our future helicopter fleet in the key
capability areas of lift, reconnaissance
and attack, which will be central to
future expeditionary operations. We
have accordingly been working with
industry, to review thoroughly both our
capability requirements and our forward
plans. This work continues, and we aim
to report on progress in the next few
months.

**Strategic Enablers and Logistics**

2.25 Operational experience since the
SDR has shown the key role of logistics
and the importance of sustainability as
an enabler across all elements of military
capability. As with other capability
areas, logistics requires strengthening
in order to meet the demands of
concurrent operations. There will be
further significant investment in this
area. As part of the re-balancing of our
Army structure we are strengthening our
logistic capability at brigade level, and
improving deployable port and maritime
capabilities, which will help meet the
demands of expeditionary operations.
And drawing on our experience from
Operation TELIC, we are also applying
the latest technology to our logistic
visibility and asset tracking capability to
ensure the right materiel is in the right
place at the right time.

2.26 Fundamental to expeditionary
operations is having sea and air
transport, with the capacity to lift
oversized loads. The core of this
capability remains the fleet of C-130
aircraft, and, from 2011, the A400M.
We have already announced that
we are considering the options for
retention of a small force of C-17s
after A400M enters service, in order to
maintain a capability to lift the largest air
transportable items. We now intend to
buy the current fleet of four leased C-17
aircraft at the conclusion of the current
lease arrangement together with one
additional aircraft.

2.27 The value of our fleet of six
Roll-on/Roll-off vessels was amply
demonstrated in the period leading up
to operations in the Gulf and is crucial to
achieving the rapid build up for medium
scale operations. In addition the Bay
Class landing ships under construction


will each be capable of deploying twice
the quantity of vehicles and stores
than the older landing ships which they
replace.

**Reserves**

2.28 As set out in the Defence White
Paper, the Reserves will continue to
play a key role in current and future
operations. In the past 10 years there
has been a major change in the role
and structure of the UK’s Reserve
forces. We are continuing this process
of development and we shall remain
closely engaged with Reservists and
their employers (through SaBRE“Supporting Britain’s Reservists and
their Employers”) to ensure that the
support that we provide them and the
frequency of calls upon them take
account of their requirements as well
as our own. Our Reserve forces have
evolved from a large but little used
force to one that is ready and capable
of providing an integrated component
of Defence, structured to support more
frequent expeditionary operations either
as individual reinforcements in key
specialist areas, or as formed sub-units.
To date nearly 11,000 Reservists have
deployed on Operation TELIC, with
striking effect. They continue to play an
invaluable part in ongoing operations,
both in Iraq and across the globe.

###### Organisation and Efficiency


3.1 In the Budget, the Chancellor

of the Exchequer announced that the
Ministry of Defence, in common with other
Departments, was committed to a target
of efficiency improvements amounting
to at least 2.5% of the total Defence
budget for each of the three years of the
Spending Review – amounting to a target
of £2.8bn by 2007/08.

3.2 It is indeed vital that we spend

money wisely and make every pound
count towards our defence objectives.
We have constructed a robust efficiency
programme that meets this target, and we
are determined that the target will be met,
and if possible exceeded.

3.3 Following Spending Review 2002,

the key business change programmes
in the Department have been brought
together into a single, coherent and
prioritised Defence Change Programme
with strong central direction and
guidance. The Programme aims to
maximise investment in the front-line
by modernising business systems
and processes in all the areas that
come together to produce operational
capability. We are also developing an
MOD-wide Business Management
System to provide us with a framework
for delivering continuous improvement
in all Departmental business processes.
This will enable us to drive further gains
in efficiency and effectiveness, releasing
more resources to the front line.

3.4 The Defence Change Programme,

together with other savings identified
by the thematic workstrands, form the
Department’s response to the crossGovernment Efficiency Review. The
programmes within the Defence Change
Programme have been thoroughly
reviewed, and plans are now in place for
these programmes to deliver efficiency
benefits in excess of £1.4bn (compared
with 2004/05) by 2007/08. Major items
include:



- The Defence Logistics Transformation

Programme, which aims to improve
the operational effectiveness,
efficiency and flexibility of logistics
support by revolutionising the
delivery of support to all three
Services. It incorporates the
continuing work on the ‘end-toend’ review of Air and Land logistic
support, which examined how
best to streamline support across
organisational boundaries, from
industry to the frontline. A successful
demonstration phase validating
the recommendations in the review
was completed in April 2004. Work
continues to develop options for the
future support of military aircraft. We
are also taking a new approach to
the management of the Defence land
vehicle fleet by adopting industry best
practice, enabling a reduction of over
2,000 vehicles.

- The modernisation of military

and civilian human resources
management, which will deliver
an enhanced service at lower cost
through new systems and harmonised
and simplified personnel policies
and processes. These programmes
will deliver considerable financial
savings, chiefly through a leaner
administrative function, as well
as significant practical benefits,
including improved tracking of Service
personnel deployed on operations.
For example, the rollout of the Joint
Personnel Administration remains
on track, starting in 2006. This
will enable marked improvements,
replacing legacy human resources
systems and saving some 1,400
military and civilian posts.

- The Defence Information

Infrastructure (DII) programme,
which will provide a single modern
information infrastructure across the
Department, replacing over 300


separate information systems across

2,000 locations worldwide. This
programme is an essential enabler for
other modernisation programmes. It
is also a fundamental component of
Network Enabled Capability.

- Defence estate modernisation

through rationalisation, more effective
contractual arrangements to raise
its condition and through building
new accommodation for Service
personnel. Our aim is to rationalise
onto fewer, larger sites over the next
twenty years. As part of this we will
be examining our future requirements
for airfields, with a view to making
substantial reductions. All proposals
will be subject to the normal
consultation processes and the
details announced once the outcome
of the work is available.


-----

###### Future Capabilities

3.5 An important element of

the thematic workstrands was to
look at opportunities for achieving
efficiencies through the rationalisation
and relocation of headquarters and
supporting staffs. The Royal Navy will
merge the Fleet and Naval Personnel
headquarters in Portsmouth. The Army
is considering the scope for collocating
its Land and Adjutant General
headquarters. The RAF is planning
to collocate its Strike and Personnel
and Training Commands. Investment
appraisals of the various options will
be carried out in the near future to
determine the most suitable locations of
these collocated headquarters. We will
reduce the number of MOD buildings in
Central London to two; have already
reduced the numbers employed in
Central London to 4,900, and will
continue to seek further reductions. We
are considering the scope for moving
elements of the Defence Logistics
Organisation (DLO) to Bristol alongside
the Defence Procurement Agency. We
expect to reduce the number of DLO
maintenance locations and make greater
use of capacity freed up on operational
bases that need to be retained.
Changes in fast jet numbers will allow
us to close RAF Coltishall airfield by
December 2006 and the reduced
requirement for Air Defence squadrons
will permit Tornado operations at RAF
Leeming to cease from 2008.


**Manpower Implications**

3.6 Transforming and restructuring the

Armed Forces to meet the challenges
of the 21st Century will inevitably lead
to reductions in manpower. Royal
Navy manpower will reduce from
37,500 to around 36,000 by April 2008,
reflecting force level reductions and
efficiencies. Once full normalisation in
Northern Ireland is achieved, the bulk of
the manpower from the Northern Ireland
task will be available for contingent
operations, allowing effective rebalancing across the Army structure
and ensuring longer intervals between
tours. Under these circumstances, we
would expect to see an army of around
102,000, with significantly more capacity
to meet the challenges of concurrent
operations overseas than it has today.
RAF manpower will reduce from 48,500
to around 41,000 by April 2008. This
takes into account planned manpower
savings arising from the introduction
of new aircraft types. It also includes
savings from various existing efficiency
programmes such as End to End
Logistics, and from the implementation
of multi- and adaptive skilling, whereby
individuals will be trained to undertake
a variety of specialist tasks across
their career, increasing flexibility. It
recognises changed assumptions
relating to the requirement for RAF
personnel for contingent operations.


Civilian numbers will reduce by more
than 10,000 by April 2008, largely as a
consequence of changes introduced as
part of the Defence Change Programme.

3.7 The reductions will take place

over a number of years. For some of
our people the changes will mean retraining. Some will leave as a result
of the natural turnover of personnel
but unfortunately some will need to
be made redundant. We will do all we
can to minimise such measures while
preserving the effective age structure of
the Services. We do not underestimate
the impact that these changes could
cause at an individual level. We will
do everything possible to ease the
difficulties while investing in the skills
of our people at every level. It will take
some time to work these measures
through, but we will announce details as
soon as possible. All these changes will
be subject to consultation in the normal
way.

###### Conclusions


4.1 The Defence White Paper

explained how we should exploit the
opportunities presented by effects
based planning and operations
combined with highly networked and
adaptable forces across all three
Services. It also set out the complex
nature of future threats and challenges
to our security which would require
our forces continually to adapt and
modernise. The benchmark against
which modern systems will be measured
will be their ability to link up with others
and exploit real time intelligence to


achieve rapid and precise effects,
across the full range of threats and
environments. The 2003 Iraq Conflict
showed the dramatic advances our
forces have made in their ability to
launch expeditionary operations,
achieving rapid and precise military
effects in the combat phase before
moving seamlessly into stabilisation
and reconstruction phases. These
advances have been made possible
by the changes set in hand by the
Strategic Defence Review, the New
Chapter, and confirmed by the White


Paper of December 2003. The force
structure changes set out in this
document continue this process of
modernisation, investing our resources
in the capabilities and structures which
provide flexible and adaptable high
quality Armed Forces, equipped to deal
with the challenges and threats of the
future.

###### Determining the Force Structure


In Supporting Essay 2 to the Defence
White Paper “Delivering Security in
a Changing World”, we concluded
that a single Defence Aim and 18
Military Tasks, would help to clarify
the planning process. In order to
translate this policy framework into a
detailed basis for determining the force
structure required to deliver Britain’s
defence needs, we have used the
methodology developed during the
SDR.

**Military Tasks and Strategic Effects**

The first stage of this methodology
is “force summation”. This involves
assigning force elements to the full
set of Military Tasks, taking account
of the strategic effects that we plan to
be able to deliver. This includes both
those force elements committed to
standing tasks and those that are held
contingent for overseas operations.
We use an effects-based approach,
which enables us to be more flexible
in our long-term force planning,
recognising that the force structure
needed to deliver effects may change
over time, as threats, technology and
coalitions evolve. It encourages a
realistic, up to date assessment of
the capability required, rather than
the fixed force structure approach
of the past. Analysis is based on a
combination of military estimating
by operational staffs and operational
analysis by the Defence Science and
Technology Laboratory.

**Concurrency**

Having established what is needed
to undertake particular operational
scenarios, we map the conclusions
against the number of operations, of
a given scale of effort and duration,
that we should be able to conduct at
any time - what we call concurrency. In
Supporting Essay 2 we also set out our
concurrency assumptions as follows:



- That as a norm, and without creating

overstretch, we should be able to
mount:

 - an enduring Medium Scale

operation simultaneously with

 - an enduring Small Scale operation

and

 - a one-off Small Scale intervention

operation.

- That we should be able to

reconfigure our forces rapidly to
carry out:

 - the enduring Medium Scale

operation and

 - an enduring Small Scale operation

simultaneously with

 - a limited duration Medium Scale

intervention operation.

- That, given time to prepare, we

should be capable of undertaking:

 - a demanding one-off Large Scale

operation while still maintaining a
commitment to

 - a simple Small Scale peace

support operation.

- Additionally, we must take account

of the need to meet standing
commitments with permanently
committed forces, eg Quick Reaction
Alert aircraft for integrity of UK
Airspace.

**Planned Force Levels**

The force structure resulting from
the force summation process is set
out in the attached tables, showing
each of the three concurrency suites.
The total requirement for each force
element is determined by the largest
figure derived from these concurrency


permutations. The results are set out
on the final table, which shows the
planned force structure.

**Generation Factors**

A range of what are termed generation
factors are required to take account
of our experience of the numbers of
units or force elements required to be
held in the force structure to generate
the number to be deployed. The main
elements of these factors are:

- Generation.

 - For the Royal Navy this covers the

ships’ training and maintenance
requirement to make a ship
available for scheduling.

 - For the Army this allows for those

additional sub-units required to
support formation training within
readiness preparation times.

  - For the Royal Air Force the driving

factor for fast jets is the availability
of combat ready crews. This varies
depending on the scale of effort
and duration of commitment, and
is influenced by the rotation factor
described below. The number of
crews required to meet any of the
possible concurrency scenarios
assumed for planning purposes
is broadly similar, and equates to
those required to meet a large scale
commitment of all Fast Jet Force
Elements.

- Rotation. To meet enduring operations

whilst ensuring operational effectiveness
and without placing undue strain on
the personnel concerned, we must
retain a pool of forces to rotate through
the deployed force. Experience shows
that the optimum ratio for prolonged
commitments is in the region of 3 or 4
ships and 5 Army and RAF units or crew
for each one deployed.
