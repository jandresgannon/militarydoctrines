###### SECURITY ENVIRONMENT


-----

###### ndia’s strategic location and its growing global interactions require engagement on a range of issues that impact on national
#### I
###### security with a view to securing vital national interests.


1.1 India’s security environment
encompasses a complex matrix of regional
and global issues and challenges. India’s
strategic location and its growing global
interactions require engagement on a range
of issues that impact on national security with
a view to securing vital national interests.
The need to enhance preparedness to address
consequences of instability and volatility
in parts of the immediate and extended
neighbourhood remains a key priority. At the
same time, there are renewed and successful
efforts to build stronger defence partnerships
with a wide range of friendly foreign countries
to enhance international peace and stability.

1.2 The security situation in India’s
immediate South Asian neighbourhood
presents a mixed picture. While there
was an improvement in the security and
political situation in some countries, political
developments caused a worsening of the
internal security situation in others. Terrorism,
insurgency and sectarian conflict increasingly
threaten the stability of the region. Amidst
ongoing efforts to impart fresh dynamism to
strengthening relations with neighbours in a
comprehensive manner, cooperative security
approaches are of immediate relevance
to the region. India is committed to build
security co-operation with all partners in
the neighbourhood on the basis of equality,
mutual benefit and mutual respect.


1.3 The Indian Ocean Region (IOR) is
central to India’s growth and security. By
virtue of its geo-physical configuration
as well as its strategic and economic
imperatives, India looks to the seas and
Oceans surrounding it. India’s peninsular
projection into the Indian Ocean Region,
astride the vital sea-lanes of the world
stretching from the Suez Canal and the
Persian Gulf to the Malacca Straits, also links
India’s ability to engage freely in maritime
trade and commerce.

1.4 India is also impacted by developments
beyond its immediate neighbourhood and the
Indian Ocean region. Developments in West
Asia, Central Asia and the Asia Pacific have a
direct bearing on India’s interests. In all these
regions, we are witnessing major political and
economic shifts with strategic implications.
While many of these transitions are marked
by growing volatility and violence, at the
same time, inter-linkages of globalisation
and deepening economic interdependence
are also increasingly evident. Consequent
re-calibrations and dynamics in the global
balance of power, that are also driven by
the rise of emerging economies and multipolarity, have created further uncertainties
in the strategic outlook. These factors are
increasingly being manifested in competition
and contestation between states.


-----

1.5 The continuing economic slowdown
in the West, Japan and China, combined
with the rapid and sustained fall in energy
prices directly affecting major oil producing
countries such as Russia, have depressed the
global economic outlook. The economies
of other regions are also being adversely
affected, as manifested through currency
fluctuations, decline in exports and lower
direct investment flows.

1.6 Though the possibility of a fullscale conventional war between states has
comparatively receded as compared to the
20[th] Century, the rise of new threats and
drivers of conflict, including proxy wars
as part of continuing efforts by some states
to destabilise other states, have created a
regional and global security landscape that in
some ways is even more challenging. Rising
nationalism, increasing military spending,
spiralling migration and refugee flows due to
man-made and natural crises, easy availability
of weapons and intense competition for
natural resources provide added volatility to
existing fault lines.

1.7 Terrorism and the activities of
terrorist organizations are perhaps the most
serious threat to peace and security. The
use of terrorism as an instrument of policy
by a few states has exacerbated intra and
inter-State conflicts. Terrorist groups have
leveraged new technologies, particularly in
cyberspace, for trans-national mobilization
and ideological radicalization, especially
of the youth. They also continue to gain
logistical and financial support for their
activities from disparate sources, including
some states, and are increasingly able to
threaten regions well beyond their base areas.
Notwithstanding the rise of more malevolent


terrorist groups, the Af-Pak region in India’s
neighbourhood continues to be the epicentre
of international terrorism. There is continuing
concern over terrorist threats emanating from
India’s neighbourhood and the transnational
linkages through which such groups are being
sustained.

1.8 Peace and stability in various regions
of the world are marred by the proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction. In particular,
the threat of nuclear terrorism continues to
be a major international security concern,
notwithstanding international efforts to
strengthen nuclear security and to prevent
non-State actors from acquiring nuclear
materials.

1.9 Shifts in the global balance of power
as reflected in recent developments in the
Asia-Pacific region, have introduced new
dimensions in military and diplomatic
interactions among the major powers and
regional states. This has been manifested
in renewed maritime disputes, changes in
military posture and great power rivalry, all
of which have added to complexities of the
security situation in the region. In particular,
the on-going contestations over island
territories in the Asia Pacific have fuelled
regional tensions that could seriously strain
the cooperative structures that have enabled
a rapid growth of the Asia Pacific region as an
engine of global growth. With North Korea
conducting further nuclear and missile tests,
the situation on the Korean peninsula also
remains fraught.

1.10 India has major strategic interests as
well as economic and commercial stakes
in continued peace and stability in the
Asia Pacific region. India’s view is that all
countries must exercise restraint and resolve


-----

bilateral issues diplomatically and without
recourse to the use or threat of use of force.
India supports freedom of navigation in
international waters and the right of passage,
in accordance with international law. India
believes that the current regional security
landscape calls for a cooperative and inclusive
approach. On its part, under the ‘Act East’
policy which places renewed emphasis on
engagement with the Asia Pacific, India has
been an active participant in various bilateral
as well as multilateral fora with a focus on
security matters such as the East Asia Summit,
ADMM – Plus and ASEAN Regional Forum
(ARF). There is also a need to further improve
regional responses to challenges such as
transnational crime, terrorism, natural
disasters, pandemics, cyber security as well
as food and energy security.

1.11 Central Asia continues to be of strategic
interest, both due to its location and resources
as well as in view of recent developments in
Eurasia and West Asia. India has focussed on
developing its political, economic and security
partnerships with all Central Asian Republics.
There are indications that the region is being
targeted by radical terrorist groups that seek
to undermine the secular regimes in these
countries. India is also keen to expand its
energy basket by deeper engagement in
this sector with Central Asian countries
that are major energy producers. There is
also a mutuality of economic interest in
respective markets as a destination of exports
and investment, especially given efforts at
consolidating the Eurasian economic space.
The changes in Iran open up new avenues for
establishing regional connectivity between
Central Asia and India that would enable
access to a wide range of natural resources in
the region. Iran occupies a significant place


in the economic and security calculus of
the region. India has welcomed the nuclear
agreement between the E3+3 and Iran.

1.12 The West Asian region has
progressively become embroiled in
violence and instability in the wake of the
political transitions ushered in by the Arab
Spring which promised to bring about
fundamental political and socioeconomic
transformations in many countries in the
region. However, this has been accompanied
by the mushrooming of a number of violent
non-state actors, especially terrorist groups.
Major sectarian fault-lines have also been
thrown open, thereby fracturing the internal
cohesion of several countries. India has vital
stakes in the region, in terms of diaspora,
trade, energy, remittances, and security.
Continuing violence and instability in West
Asia and the Gulf, which is part of India’s
extended neighbourhood, could impact
India’s diverse interests in the region. The
situation in Syria has deteriorated into rivalry
and competition between great powers and
major regional actors. The scenario in Iraq
remains of growing concern, especially
the rise of non-state actors that threaten
not just regional stability but have shown
the capacity to radicalize individuals into
carrying out terrorist attacks in other parts of
the world. The fusing together of the Syrian
conflict and the crisis in Iraq could pose a
major challenge, with heightened extremist
and sectarian overtones. India has expressed
deep concern at the violence and loss of
human lives in Syria and has consistently
called for an inclusive and comprehensive
political solution that takes into account the
legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people.
India has also expressed firm support to Iraq
in its fight against international terrorism


-----

and in its efforts to preserve its unity and
territorial integrity. Tensions between Israel
and Palestine are also a matter of concern.
India supports a negotiated solution resulting
in a sovereign, independent, viable and
united State of Palestine, living within secure
and recognized borders, side by side at
peace with Israel as endorsed in the Quartet
Roadmap and relevant UNSC Resolutions.

1.13 Several parts of Africa continue to
be in turmoil, as violent insurgencies and
terrorist actions have progressively made
their presence felt in North, East and West
African countries. Of particular concern is the
growing influence of terrorist organizations.
While, the threat from piracy in the Western
Indian Ocean has diminished, the problem
has resurfaced in the Gulf of Guinea in
which a number of Indian seafarers have
been affected. The activities of terrorist
outfits in West Africa pose a growing threat
to the stability of states in the region. The
linkages between local groups and terrorist
organisations outside the region are a matter
of concern. India has historic ties with several
African nations and has sought to deepen its
bilateral ties with African countries through
the strategic initiative of the India-Africa
Forum Summit (IAFS) mechanism that seeks
to promote regional and continent-level
political and economic cooperation with
African countries.

###### Internal Security Situation

1.14 The challenges to internal security
in India can be categorized into four broad
threats viz. cross border terrorism in Jammu
& Kashmir, militancy in the North East, Left
Wing Extremism (LWE) in certain states and
terrorism in the hinterland. The Government


has been making systematic and unrelenting
efforts to counter these threats and, as a
result, the internal security situation in the
country is firmly under control. There is steep
decline in terror attacks in the hinterland and
the violence perpetrated by LWE. However,
developments in Jammu & Kashmir and
Punjab have been a cause of concern,
especially the cross-border terror attacks and
trafficking of arms & narcotics.

1.15 The overall security situation in J&K
remains stable in spite of the focused efforts
of separatists and terrorist tanzeems to disrupt
the prevailing peace. This was primarily due
to the protracted operations of the Security
Forces in the hinterland and effectiveness
of the counter infiltration grid on the Line
of Control/International Border. However
radicalization and fresh recruitment in South
Kashmir is a cause of concern. External
factors, including the changing situation in
Pakistan and Afghanistan, may also impact
the internal situation in Jammu & Kashmir.

1.16 The security situation in the North
Eastern States has been gradually improving
in terms of reduction in number of violent
incidents and lower civilian casualties. The
number of violent incidents has come down
from 1025 in 2012 to 574 in 2015 and the
number of civilians killed has come down
from 97 to 46 in the same period. The states
of Tripura, Mizoram and Sikkim are by and
large, peaceful. In Arunachal Pradesh, barring
a few incidents, there is general atmosphere
of peace. In Manipur and Nagaland there was
increase in violence against Security Forces
by the extremist groups in 2015 in the wake of
unilateral abrogation of ceasefire by NSCN/K.
In Meghalaya, security forces were able to
contain the violent activities of the militant


-----

groups. The signing of the Framework for
Peace between the Government of India and
the National Socialist Council for Nagalim
(Issac-Muviah) [NSCN (I-M] in August 2015
was a positive step towards ending the
country’s oldest insurgency. The extradition
of Anup Chetia, a prominent United
Liberation of Front of Asom (ULFA) leader,
by Bangladesh to India in November 2015
was an encouraging development that may
help in the success of peace talks between
the Government of India and ULFA (pro
talk) leaders. Successful counter insurgency
operations against the National Democratic
Front of Bodoland – Songjibit [NDFB (S)] and
the Garo National Liberation Army (GNLA) by


the security forces have dealt a severe blow
to the fighting capabilities of these insurgent
groups. Talks are continuing with NDFB (P)
and (RD) factions to resolve Bodo issues.

1.17 Left Wing Extremism (LWE) continues
to be an area of concern to the internal
security of the country. However, LWE
violence has been declining over the years
due to various efforts of the Government
such as greater presence of security forces
across the LWE affected States, loss of cadres/
leaders on account of arrests, surrender and
desertions, better monitoring of development
schemes and insurgency fatigue among
Maoist cadres.

###### INDIAN ARMY

_Combat Demonstration during Army Day Parade_


-----

###### he Indian Army (IA) is committed to the defence of the country from external and internal threats across the
# T
###### entire spectrum of warfare.


3.1 The changing global geo-political
dynamics presents the Nation with multiple
security challenges. While constantly
reviewing its operational preparedness/
postures to meet the perceived security
challenges, the Indian Army (IA) is committed
to the defence of the country from external
and internal threats across the entire spectrum
of warfare. Also, in times of disaster/ natural
calamities, the Indian Army is in the forefront,
providing aid and succour to the affected
people.

###### JAMMU AND KASHMIR

3.2 The security situation of J&K is at an
important cross road of transcending from
conflict stabilisation to conflict resolution
domain. The relentless efforts put in by
security forces helped the ‘Awaam’ gain
confidence which led to a high voter turnout
in the Parliamentary and Assembly elections.
People have entrusted faith in the Indian
democratic system, shunned violence and are
yearning for peace and stability.

3.3 **Ceasefire Violations (CFVs):** The
ceasefire along the Actual Ground Position
Line (AGPL), Line of Control (LC) and
International Border (IB) Sectors in Jammu and
Kashmir has generally held. In the year 2014,
there were 153 CFVs along the LC and the
year 2015 witnessed 152 CFVs. Appropriate


and effective retaliation, where required, was
carried out to the CFVs initiated by Pakistan.
The incidents of CFVs are taken up through
the established mechanisms of hotlines, Flag
Meetings and DGMO’s talks. Overall, Pakistan
continues to calibrate violence to keep the LC
alive and to showcase issue of unresolved/
unsettled borders in J&K.

3.4 **Infiltration: Pakistan, despite its recent**
peace overtures, has left no stone unturned to
internationalise the Kashmir issue. The terror
infrastructure remains intact across the border.
While infiltration bids, CFVs have been on a
decline in the last three months of 2015, this
may just be a temporary phase of tiding over
the internal security issues which are on a rise
within Pakistan.

(a) Infiltration Bids Eliminated: During
the year 2015, the Army eliminated 18
infiltration bids resulting in killing of 30
terrorists whereas in 2014, the Army had
eliminated 23 infiltration bids resulting in
killing of 36 terrorists.

(b) Successful Infiltration: As per assessment,
in 2015 till December 31, 2015, 33
terrorists infiltrated successfully out of
the 121 who attempted whereas in 2014,
65 terrorists were successful out of 222
who attempted to infiltrate.


-----

###### Situation in the Hinterland

3.5 **Counter** **Terrorist** **Operations:**
During the year 2015, relentless and surgical
people friendly operations based on a credible
intelligence network have resulted in the
elimination of 67 terrorists in the hinterland.
In 2014, the Army had killed 68 terrorists in
the hinterland of Jammu and Kashmir.

3.6 **Terrorists Initiated Incidents (TIIs):**
In 2015, there have been 48 terrorists initiated
incidents in the hinterland including suicide
attacks in Samba and Rajbagh. A number of
these terrorist incidents were initiated against
the mobile communications infrastructure,
surrendered terrorists and Hurriyat affiliates.
These incidents, in 2015, have led to the
martyrdom of 18 CAPF personnel and 16
civilian fatalities.

3.7 **Exploitation of Social Media, Local**
**Recruitment and Rise of Radicalisation:  Social**
media and its blatant use by terrorists groups
and Separatists alike to target impressionable
minds is emerging as a challenge from the
security point of view. The widespread
application of digital media has been able
to provide an impetus to local recruitment,
radicalisation and has been used extensively
by Separatists to mobilise masses for protest.

###### NORTH EAST
3.8 The overall security situation in
North East remained fluid and dynamic. There
was spurt in violent activities against Security
Forces (SF) post abrogation of ceasefire by
NSCN (K) in March 2015. To effectively
counter the development, Border Guarding &
Counter Insurgency Posture in Nagaland and
Manipur were strengthened. In 2015, 1504
terrorists have been neutralized (Killed - 103,


Apprehended -1359 and Surrendered - 42)
along with recovery of 1111 weapons.

3.9 **Assam:  The security situation in the**
State remained largely peaceful and under
control.  Relentless operations by Security
Forces did neutralize important commanders
of NDFB (Songbijit) thereby paralysing the
Chain of Command of the group. Resultantly,
the morale of NDFB (Songbijit) cadres was
adversely affected.

3.10 **Nagaland: The security situation**
in the State deteriorated post abrogation of
Ceasefire (CF) by NSCN (Khaplang) on March
27, 2015. As a result of renewed attacks
on SF by NSCN (K) insurgents in Nagaland,
Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh and the
outfit was declared ‘Unlawful Association’ on
September 28, 2015. Concerted and relentless
operation by SF along India - Myanmar border
has severely dented the outfit physically and
psychologically forcing the group to move
majority of its cadres to Myanmar.

3.11 Signing of “Framework Agreement
for Naga Peace Accord” between Government
of India and NSCN (IM) on August 3, 2015
was a very significant development and will
probably lead towards achievement of a
solution to the oldest insurgency in the region
having pan North East effect. There is also a
growing public disenchantment against NSCN
factions, increasing assertiveness of Against
Corruption and Unabated Taxation (ACAUT)
and consolidation of Nagas of Nagaland under
Naga Tribal Council (NTC) which are positive
developments.

3.12 **Manipur:  The State continued to be**
the most disturbed State in North East region.
Majority of the violence has been perpetrated
by Valley based groups as they accounted


-----

for approximately 61% of the violence in
Manipur. Politics of Blockades and Bandhs
continued to prevail and led to increasing
fissures amongst the three major communities
namely; Meiteis - Nagas - Kukis.

3.13 Inter-tribal rivalry and insider - outsider
divide was prominently visible throughout
2015 wherein demands of implementation of
Inner Line Permit and its opposition were the
main factors for protests.

3.14 **Arunachal** **Pradesh:** Longding,
Tirap and Changlang districts of the State are
affected by the presence of Naga insurgents
groups which continue their attempts to
establish their writ. The State is used as a
transit route for illegal movement of weapons,
ammunition, narcotics etc from Myanmar to
Assam and Nagaland. Synergised operations
by SF have reduced the operational space of
insurgents.

3.15 **Meghalaya:  The violence remained**
largely confined to Garo Hills perpetrated by
the Garo groups. Spillover of the activities of
these groups was also visible in neighbouring
districts of Goalpara and Dhubri in Assam.

###### Situation Along the Border

3.16 **Bilateral** **Relations** **with** **China:**
India desires peaceful and cordial relations
with all neighbors. To this end, a policy of
constructive engagement and maintaining
peace and tranquility along the Line of Actual
Control (LAC) is ensured along our Northern
Borders. Relations between the two nations
have improved over the past few years.
Constructive engagement at the political,
diplomatic and military level is continuing
with regular military exchanges from time to


time. Year 2015 has been declared as the Visit
India Year. The visit of Indian Prime Minister
to China in May 2015 has further strengthened
the bonds of friendship and enhanced bilateral
cooperation between both the countries.

3.17 **Situation along the Line of Actual**
**Control (LAC): The situation along India-**
China border continues to be peaceful.
There are few areas along the border where
India and China have differing perception
of the LAC. Both sides patrol upto their
respective perceptions of LAC and due to
this transgressions do occur. Specific cases
of transgression by Chinese patrols into such
areas across LAC are taken up with relevant
Chinese authorities through the established
mechanism of Hot Lines, Flag Meetings and
Border Personnel Meeting. However there has
been increase in assertiveness during routine
patrolling by PLA.

3.18 **Implementation of Border Defence**
**Cooperation Agreement (BDCA):  During**
this year both countries have had wide
ranging discussions on implementation of
BDCA. Towards this the scope of the Border
Personnel Meetings (BPM) has been increased
to include conduct of non contact games and
joint celebration of festivals. Recently two
new BPM sites have been made operational.

3.19 **Fifth Joint Training Exercise: The**
Fifth Joint Training Exercise was successfully
conducted in Kunming (China) in October
this year aimed at building and promoting
positive military relations, inter-operability
and undertaking joint operations in Counter
Terrorism (CT) environment. These exercises
provided valuable opportunity for greater
professional military interaction and enhanced
confidence in each other.

###### Defence Cooperation with Neighbouring and Other Selected Coutnries

3.20 **Nepal:** As part of bilateral cooperation some military hardware has been
provided to Nepal during the year 2015-16.
The 12[th] Nepal India Bilateral Consultative
Group on Security (NIBCGS) has been
delayed due to the ongoing political situation
in Nepal.

3.21 A Need Assessment Team visited
Nepal from January 27 to 30, 2015 to discuss
the natural disaster, vulnerability profile of
Nepal and deliberate upon modalities to
upgrade Disaster Management equipment
and procedures of Nepal Army.

3.22 A hotline between the DGMOs of
the two countries has been made functional
with effect from October 2015.

3.23 **Bhutan:** In keeping with the
traditional close ties with Bhutan, the Indian
Military Training Team has been actively
pursuing defence cooperation. 575 vacancies
were assigned to Royal Bhutan Army and
Royal Bhutan Guards personnel in our training
institutions in the year 2015-16.

###### Combined Exercise/ Activities with Friendly Foreign Countries (FFCs)

3.24 Combined Military Exercises with
FFCs are an important part of defence
cooperation. These involve sharing of
experience, understanding the changing
dynamics of military operations, developing
inter-operability and streamlining the
procedures for combined operations including
Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief.

###### MODERNISATION AND EQUIPMENT

3.26 The major Army acquisitions
focused on modernisation, building new
capabilities as well as making up deficiencies
in the inventory while giving due impetus
to indigenisation. During the year, the Army
focused on reducing procurement timelines.
Major strides were taken in streamlining the
evolution of Qualitative Requirements (QRs),
Request for Proposal (RFP) formulation and
evolution of novel methods of field evaluations.


-----

The changes made would result in making the
acquisition process more efficient.

3.27 **Mechanised Forces: Upgradation of**
in-service equipment by night enablement,
modern fire control systems and better
power packs has been the thrust area.
Concurrently, the indigenous development
of future combat vehicle platforms is also
being progressed. Indigenous solution for

systems are nearing fruition. The induction
of the indigenous artillery gun ‘Dhanush’
would also commence post successful trials.
Advanced munitions with improved precision
and enhanced destructive power are being
procured.


3.29 **Guns: Modernisation of Artillery**
has been on since 2012. Both global and
indigenous routes are being adopted to
hasten the progress of modernisation. Major
projects of 155 mm Towed Gun, Indigenously
developed 155 mm ‘Dhanush’ and 155
mm Tracked (SP) Gun are at final stages of
evaluation. Government has recently given
a go ahead for the procurement of 155 mm
Mounted Gun System. Upgunning of the
existing 130 mm Guns to 155 mm/ 45 Cal
Gun System is also currently under progress
as ‘Buy & Make Indian’.

has rendered invaluable assistance towards
the security as well as socio-economic
development of J & K. During the period
under review, Rashtriya Rifles has
successfully carried out relentless operations.
The continued presence of Rashtriya Rifles
has been a major factor in maintaining
peace and tranquility in the state of J&K. The
waning levels of terrorism are evident from
the number of terrorist initiated incidents
occurring in 2015.

###### INDIAN NAVY

_INS Sumitra during Anti-Piracy Patrol at Gulf of Aden_


-----

###### he Indian Navy (IN) has been playing a maritime leadership role in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) due
# T
###### to its multi-dimensional capabilities and active presence in the region.


4.1 India is a maritime nation and the
country sits astride a very large number of busy
International Shipping Lanes, that criss-cross
the Indian Ocean. More than 90% of our trade
by volume and 70% by value is transported
over the seas. For a rapidly growing economy
seeking new markets worldwide, these trade
figures will only spiral upwards in the future.

4.2 The last decade has witnessed India’s
dependence on his maritime environment
expanding substantially as his economic,
military and technological strength grew, his
global interactions widened and his national
security imperatives and political interests
stretched gradually. It can thus be assumed
that the 21[st ]century will be the ‘Century of the
Seas’ for India and that the seas will remain a
key enabler in his global resurgence.

4.3 The Indian Navy (IN) has been
playing a maritime leadership role in the
Indian Ocean Region (IOR) due to its multidimensional capabilities and active presence
in the region. The environment in India’s
maritime neighbourhood is dynamic, with
increased instabilities, deepening geopolitical
and ethnic faultlines, growing military
capabilities, and wide range of security
challenges. These pose a combination of
conventional and sub-conventional threats to
India, at and from the seas. These threats and


challenges require the Indian Navy to remain
effective across the full spectrum of combat
operations, and constantly reshape itself to
meet future challenges.

4.4 IN is the key enabler and guarantor
of the country’s maritime sovereignty and
myriad use-of-the-sea activities. This is
discharged by the Indian Navy through its
four roles – military, diplomatic, constabulary
and benign. The objective of the Navy’s
military role is deterrence/ dissuasion against
any intervention or act which is against our
National Interests, and the ability to inflict a
crushing defeat on the adversary in the event
of hostilities. A major objective of the Navy’s
Constabulary role is to ensure coastal and
offshore security and implement anti-piracy
measures.

4.5 The IN has been actively pursuing
activities towards capability building and
capacity enhancement of Navies of friendly
countries in the IOR. Towards this end, India
has been providing hardware and platforms,
which includes ships and aircraft for EEZ
surveillance. IN has also been instrumental in
maritime infrastructure development of friendly
nations. IN initiatives are also geared up for
contributing towards developing operational
and technical skills of maritime practitioners.
Material assistance in terms of providing spares,


-----

AIS equipment, Ship Handling Simulators,
ammunition, communication equipment,
coastal surveillance radars, boats, etc. to the
navies/ maritime forces in the region has gone
a long way in strengthening India’s stature and
bilateral ties.

4.6 One frontline Fleet ship has been
continuously deployed in the Gulf of Aden
region since October 2008 to prevent piratical
attacks and provide safe escort to merchant
ships of Indian and foreign nationalities.

4.7 Protection to offshore assets including
Offshore Development Areas (ODAs) has
been augmented with deployments by the
newly inducted Immediate Support Vessels
(ISVs). Regular exercises have been conducted
at ODAs to validate the safety and security
of ODA platforms which are vital to India’s
energy security.

###### OVERSEAS OPERATIONS

and UTs towards streamlining existing
mechanisms, improving inter-agency
coordination and strengthening maritime,
coastal and offshore security. IN is actively
engaging with multiple agencies involved
in coastal security by providing training
assistance, conducting trials of equipment
and by providing technical expertise. The IN
also continues to actively engage with the
fishermen and coastal communities through
community interaction programmes towards
integrating them into the security matrix. IN
is strengthening existing mechanisms and
increasing the complexity of such exercises,


with the involvement of all stakeholders. In
November 2015, for the first time, Coastal
Security Exercise Sagar Kavach off Gujarat was
conjoined with the major maritime exercise
‘Defence of Gujarat Exercise’ (DGX) 2015,
thereby providing substantial impetus to the
Coastal Security matrix. In addition, numerous
coastal security exercises were conducted on
both the Western and Eastern seaboards, as
well as in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands
throughout the year.

4.33 Towards strengthening coastal and
offshore security, Fast Interceptor Craft (FICs)
and Immediate Support Vessels (ISVs) are being
inducted into the IN. With the commissioning
of 13 ISVs in 2015, IN has inducted all 23
ISVs envisaged for offshore security and they
are being deployed regularly for security of
offshore installations. IN has inducted 67 out
of 95 FICs into the Sagar Prahari Bal, with
the balance being planned to be inducted

###### PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION

7.6 To achieve the goal of self-reliance
in the Defence sector, continuous efforts
are being made to increase indigenization,
wherever technologically feasible and
economically viable.

7.7 In May, 2001, the Defence Industry
sector, which was hitherto reserved for the
public sector, was opened up to 100% for
Indian private sector participation, with
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) up to 26%
both subject to licensing. However, recently
Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion,
Ministry of Commerce &Industry vide Press
Note No. 12(2015 Series) (Available at www.
dipp.nic.in under Acts and Rules followed
by Press Notes), has allowed FDI under
automatic route upto 49% and above 49%
on case to case basis wherever it is likely to
result in access to modern and ‘state of the art’
technology in the country.

7.8 The Department of Industrial Policy
& Promotion (DIPP), in consultation with
Ministry of Defence, has issued detailed
guidelines vide Press Note No. 2 (2002 Series)
dated January 4, 2002 for licensing production
of Arms and Ammunition in January 2002.


Consequently, the role of Private Sector has
shifted from that of supplier of raw material,
components, sub-systems to the one of
becoming partners in the manufacture of
complete advanced equipment/ systems.

7.9 A Standing Committee on private
sector participation in defence production
in the Department of Defence Production
considers applications received from
Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion
(DIPP) for grant of Industrial Licences and
FDI Proposals from FIPB Unit, Department
of Economic Affairs (DEA) respectively for
the manufacture of licensable defence items
and to communicate the recommendation
of the Ministry of Defence to the respective
Departments. The Joint Secretary (DIP) is
presently Chairman of Standing Committee
with members from diverse fields viz. Naval
HQrs, Air HQrs, Army HQrs, DGQA,
DGAQA, DoD, DG(Acq), OFB, DRDO and
BEL.

7.10 Department of Industrial Policy
and Promotion (DIPP) has so far issued
319 Industrial Licences (ILs) covering 190
companies till January, 2016 for manufacture
of a wide range of defence items to private
companies. 50 licensed companies covering
79 industrial licences have so far reported
commencement of production.

7.11 After opening up of the Defence
Industry Sector for Indian Private sector
Participation, so far 34 FDI proposals/ Joint
Ventures have been approved in defence
sector for manufacture of various defence
equipments, both in public and private sector.
FDI amounting to ` 24.84 crore (US$ 5.02
millions) has been received in the Defence


-----

Industry Sector from April 2000 to September
2015 (Source: FDI Statistics on htpp://www.
dipp.nic.in).

7.12 The Department of Defence
Production has finalized the Defence Products
List for licensing purpose under Industries
(Development & Regulation) Act, 1951.
DIPP, vide Press Note No. 3 (2014 Series),
has uploaded the Defence Products List on
their website. DIPP vide Press Note 10 of
2015 series has increased the initial validity
of industrial licences for a period of 15 years,
further extendable upto 18 years to be granted
by administrative ministry. Both Press Notes
are available on DIPP websitehtpp://www.
dipp.nic.in.

7.13 The Department has finalized a
Security Manual for private sector defence
industries. The Security Manual provides
for physical, documentation and IT security
for the companies. The Security Manual is
available on DDP’s website www.ddpmod.
gov.in under Publication/Reports. For the
purpose of compliance, the security manual
has been divided into three parts: Category A,
B & C. Depending on the products/ weapons/
equipments, the companies will be required to
comply with the security protocol. This is also
available on DDP’s website. Brief descriptions
of Categories are as follows:

Category-A: The products under this category
would be highly classified and sensitive from
the security angle and the manufacturing of
these items would require the highest level of
security.

Category-B: The products under this category
would include semi-finished products, subassemblies, sub-systems of main weapons/


equipments/platforms and some finished
products of lesser degree of sensitivity.

Category-C: The products under this category
would include products which do not involve
use of any classified/ secret information and
are very generic in nature. The products in this
category would normally be not specifically
designed or modified for military use and
therefore would require only a very minimal
level of security.

7.14 To promote the participation of
private sector, particularly SMEs for defence
manufacturing, Outsourcing and Vendor
Development Guidelines for DPSUs and OFB
have been formulated and circulated to them.
The guidelines mandate that each DPSU
and OFB to have a short-term and long-term
outsourcing and vendor development plan
to gradually increase the outsourcing from
private sector including SMEs. The guidelines
also include vendor development for import
substitution.

###### Export Profile of Indian Defence Industry

7.15 Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
for issue of NOC for export of Military Stores
by Public/ Private Defence Industry has been
revised and placed in the public domain in
August, 2015. Further, online system for
accepting applications for No Objection
Certificates (NOCs) which was introduced in
November, 2014 is working satisfactorily.

###### RDO has emerged as one of the premier scientific and technological organisations in the country and has
# D
###### played a major role behind the development of the state-of- the-art platforms, sensors and weapon systems.


###### BACKGROUND

8.1 DRDO has emerged as one of
the premier scientific and technological
organisations in the country and has played
a major role behind the development of the
state-of-the-art platforms, sensors and weapon
systems. At the core of its technological
strength is its expertise in system design,
system integration and testing & evaluation
built over the last five decades. Due to our
efforts, India is today, one of only five countries
in the world to have a multi-level strategic
deterrence capability and its own Ballistic
Missile Defence (BMD) program, one of only
six countries of the world to have developed a
nuclear powered submarine, one of only few
select countries to have developed its own
Main Battle Tank (MBT), fourth generation
combat aircraft, Electronic Warfare (EW) and
multi range radar program.

8.2 DRDO’s mission essentially covers
the following broad activities:

 Design, develop and lead to production
of state-of-the-art sensors, weapon
systems, platforms and allied equipment
for our Defence Services.

 Provide technological solutions to the
Services to optimise combat effectiveness
and to promote well-being of the troops.


 Develop infrastructure and committed
quality manpower and build strong
indigenous technology base.

###### ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE

8.3 DRDO was traditionally headed
by Director General (DG) DRDO who
additionally holds the post of Secretary,
Department of Defence R&D (DD R&D) and
Scientific Adviser to Raksha Mantri (SA to
RM). However, in June 2015, DRDO was
placed under Secretary DD R&D who is also
the administrative head as DG DRDO. A
separate post of SA to RM was created to offer
independent advice.

8.4 DRDO labs are grouped into seven
technology clusters namely, Armament
and Combat Engineering Systems (ACE),
Aeronautical Systems (AERO), Missiles and
Strategic Systems (MSS), Naval Systems
and Materials (NS&M), Electronics and
Communication Systems (ECS), Micro
Electronic Devices and Computational Systems
(MED & CoS) and Life Sciences (LS). Each of
these clusters function under cluster DGs. The
seven DG offices are located at Pune (ACE),
Bangalore (Aero and ECS), Hyderabad (MSS),
Vishakhapatnam (NS&M) and Delhi (MED &
CoS and LS). The labs under each cluster DG
which had minor re-alignment of a few labs in
2015 is given in Table No. 8.1.

Clearance (FOC). Establishment of production
facilities at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited
(HAL) for production rate of eight aircrafts
per annum is in progress. The first production
LCA aircraft (LCA-SP1) was handed over to
IAF on January 17, 2015 by Raksha Mantri.
The landmark achievement this year was the
cold weather/high altitude outstation trials at
Leh in January 2015. Hot weather trials for
Tejas trainer (PV6) aircraft were conducted in
Jaisalmer during June 2015 in which flutter
trials in drop tanks configuration at varying
altitudes were carried out. This cleared the
aircraft for low level high speed sorties. As on
December 2015, a total of 3031 flight tests on
13 Tejas aircrafts have been completed.

**LCA Navy:** LCA Navy is designed to
operate from the deck of aircraft carriers and
incorporates stronger landing gears to absorb
forces exerted during the ski jump ramp
during take-off. FSED Phase-I programme is
envisaged for fabrication of two prototypes
(NP1 and NP2). A number of flights have been
completed on the first LCA Navy prototype,
a two seat trainer (NP1) aircraft. The system
integration of second LCA Navy prototype,
a single seat fighter (NP2) aircraft has been
completed. Maiden flight of LCA Navy Aircraft

(NP2) was done successfully on February 7,
2015. NP2 aircraft also successfully completed
engine ground run with hot refueling drill on
March 24, 2015 (first Indian fighter aircraft to
_undertake this activity)._

**Airborne** **Early** **Warning** **and** **Control**
**(AEW&C) System: The role of Indian Airborne**
Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) system
is to detect, identify and classify threats in
the surveillance area and act as a command
and control centre to support air defence
operations and communicate with ground
segment and other fighters. All the three fully
modified Embraer EMB-145-I aircrafts have
been received in India. Two of these aircrafts
will be delivered to the IAF after completion
of user associated development trials and the
third system will be retained at CABS, DRDO
to enable future upgrades to the system. As
on date, 408 sorties have been flown on the
two deliverable aircrafts. Performance of
most indigenous mission systems has been
validated. The aircraft has been cleared and
certified for operation under icing conditions,
air-to-air refueling and high altitude operation.
The final phase of flight trials of the self

protection suite (SPS) is under progress. The
aircraft was demonstrated (both on static
and flight display) in the Aero India 2015
during February 2015. AEW&C participated
in Akraman exercises as observer and the
operators reported that, no loss of situational
awareness was observed.

**Medium Altitude Long Endurance UAV**
**‘Rustom’:** Rustom-1 is a surveillance and
recce UAV designed to operate up to 15,000
ft above mean sea level altitude (AMSL)

###### RESETTLEMENT

11.17 The main thrust of the Directorate

rehabilitation and welfare of ESM. Nearly
60,000 armed forces personnel retire or


-----

are released from active service every year.
Most of them are in comparatively younger
age bracket of 35 to 45 years and need a
second career to support their families. These
personnel constitute a valuable, disciplined,
well-trained, dedicated and talented pool
available for nation building. Resettlement is
sought to be achieved through the following:

 Upgrading their skills by imparting
necessary training to prepare them to take
on new assignment/ jobs and assisting
them in finding re-employment.

 Constant endeavor to provide employment
opportunities in government/ quasi
government/ public sector organizations.

 Pro-active action to facilitate reemployment of ESM in the Corporate
Sector.

 Providing jobs through schemes on self
employment.

 Assistance in entrepreneurial ventures.

###### TRAINING PROGRAMMES

responsibility of preparing retiring/ retired
service personnel for a second career. These

###### INSTITUTE FOR DEFENCE STUDIES AND ANALYSES (IDSA)

15.3 The Institute for Defence Studies and
Analyses (IDSA), established in November
1965, is a registered body under the
Registration of Societies Act III of 1860 (Punjab
Amendment Act 1957) as amended from
time to time. The Institute is a non-partisan,
autonomous body dedicated to objective
research and policy relevant studies on all
aspects of defence and security. Its mission is
to promote national and international security


through the generation and dissemination of
knowledge on defence and security-related
issues.

15.4 During the year, the IDSA continues
to focus on regional and global developments
having a bearing on India’s security and
foreign policy. As India’s engagement with
the rest of the world has deepened, IDSA’s
interaction with the strategic community
has also increased. IDSA has expanded its
research to cover emerging areas such as
climate change, energy, water security as
well as cyber and space security. The Institute
analysed in depth the emergence of new
challenges and India’s responses. Special
attention was paid to defence reforms, defence
diplomacy and numerous security dialogues
initiated by the Government. Developments
in the neighbourhood remained a priority area
for IDSA scholars. A large number of books,
monographs, papers were brought out during
the year.

15.5 IDSA’s outreach activity has
expanded considerably. A number of eminent
visitors and delegations from abroad were
hosted at the IDSA. Prominent think tanks
and universities were also engaged. IDSA’s
website has become a source of information
on a wide range of security and defence
issues for researchers, students and public
alike. Social media tools have been used


-----

extensively to enhance IDSA’s reach. All
IDSA publications are posted on the website
and visitors are given ‘Open Access’ to most
of the publications.

15.6 In order to give policy thrust to
IDSA’s research output, a conscious effort
was made to enhance interaction with policy
makers. A number of research projects were
undertaken on behalf of various government
departments.

15.7 IDSA has a large publications
programme. Its flagship journal, Strategic
Analysis, and the quarterly Journal of
Defence Studies emerged as major sources
of reference. IDSA was ranked as number
10[th ]amongst the top 45 think tanks in China,
India, Japan and Republic of Korea. 23[rd ]

amongst the best Government Affiliated Think
Tanks of the world, 30[th ] amongst best use
of Media (Print or Electronic), 54[th]amongst
top 100 think tanks, worldwide (Non-US),
102[nd]amongst top 150 think tanks worldwide
(US and Non-US) and 21[st] amongst the Think
Tanks to Watch out for - according to the
annual “Global Go-to Think Tank Report
and Policy Advice” study published by the
University of Pennsylvania. These rankings
may not accurately reflect the relative merit
of think tanks but as the only initiative of this
kind, it does provide a rough indication of
the Institute’s standing.

15.8 IDSA is funded by the Indian Ministry
of Defence and functions autonomously.
IDSA Scholars are drawn from academia,
the defence forces and the civil services. The
research faculty of 50 scholars including 06

_APPENDIX-III_

###### Summary of Important Audit Observations-Ministry of Defence

 Report No. 44 of 2015


###### Working of the Cantonment Boards

Cantonment Boards (CBs) with the status of
Municipalities, have to provide civic amenities
to the personnel residing in the cantonments.
During the period 2009-10 to 2013-14,
none of the test checked 17CBs, except for
one CB (Clement Town) had prepared and
implemented Town Planning schemes, plans
for economic development and social justice
in their respective areas. Further, none of
the CBs provided all the 24 types of services,
mandated as per the Cantonments Act, to
its residents and no Central Government
schemes for up-liftment of the poor applicable
in the CBs were implemented. The CBs were
unable to ensure adequate revenue generation
through taxes and non-taxes, leading to their
increased dependency on Grant-in-aid from
the Ministry of Defence. This was mainly
due to non-revision of taxes every five years,
recovery of property tax at a rate lower than
the stipulated rate and non-levy of Vehicle
entry Tax etc.
**(Para 2.1)**

###### Non-availability of Specialised Parachutes

Combat free Fall parachutes developed
by DRDO in 2006 could not be put to
production successfully even after incurring
an expenditure of ` 10.75 Crore. Parachutes


(Special Forces) Battalions of Indian Army are
therefore without these specialised parachutes
for over a decade.
**(Para 2.2)**

###### Functioning of Army Aviation Corps

Army Aviation Corps was created with the
main objective of contributing to battle field
success by providing guidance to the field
Commanders in applying decisive combat
powers. The Corps is, however, plagued with
32 per cent deficiency against its authorised
fleet strength. The helicopters held are old
and ageing, with 52 per cent of the fleet more
than 30 years old. Low level of serviceability
further reduces the effective availability of
helicopters for operations to 40 per cent of
the authorisation.

Despite these shortcomings, Army Aviation
could not replace its fleet of Cheetah/Chetak
helicopters being used for reconnaissance
and observation, which are due to deinduction since 10[th] Plan period (20022007) onwards. We observed that against 18
scehmes approved in 11[th] and 12[th] Service
Capital Acquisition Plan, contracts in respect
of only four schemes could be concluded in
nine years period, so far. Failure in meeting
the targets and objectives of the acquisitions
plans and tardiness in procurement action
were the main reasons denying the Corps to
acquire suitable replacement for the old and
ageing fleet.
**(Para 3.1)**


-----

###### Shortfall in availability of BMP vehicles 

Indian Army has a shortage of 47 percent in
holding of BMP vehicles. Audit found that
the main reason for shortfall was the delay
in supply of 389 BMPs by OFB which not
only adversely affected the operational
preparedness of Mechanised Forces/
Engineers but also entailed a minimum
extra liability of ` 270.97 Crore due to cost
escalation.
**(Para 3.2)**

###### Unwarranted procurement of Image intensifier sight for Commander of Tank T-55

Integrated Headquarters (IHQ) of Ministry
of Defence (MoD), Army procured Image
Intensifier Sights between February 2011
and June 2013 valuing ` 22.12 Crore for
Commander of Tank T-55 whereas the tank
was declared obsolescent in December
2011.
**(Para 3.3)**

###### Less deduction of Liquidated Damages

While the procedure for levy of Liquidated
Damages (LD) stated that LD at reduced
rates was to be levied only if there is no loss
caused to the State, yet the Army Purchase
Organization invoked the condition without
ascertaining the facts about the loss caused
and thereby extended undue benefit to the
defaulting contractors. In a test case, Audit
found that loss had actually occurred.
**(Para 3.5)**


###### Non-installation of Hydraulic Test Benches

Due to delay in installation/ commissioning
and in creation of requisite infrastructure in the
repair workshops, four out of five Hydraulic
Test Benches procured for MBT Arjun at a
cost of ` 2.23 Crore were lying idle since their
procurement in November, 2010.
**(Para 3.6)**

###### Avoidable expenditure in procurement of Hi-Lo Beds

Indecisiveness regarding inclusion of
Comprehensive Annual Maintenance Contract
(CAMC) in the contract for procurement of
Hi-Lo beds by the Director General Armed
Forces Medical Services (DGAFMS) led to
retendering, resulting in extra expenditure of
` 63 lakh in procurement of 1406 beds.
**(Para 3.7)**

###### Recoveries, savings and amendment of annual accounts at the instance of Audit

Based on our observations, the audited
entities had recovered overpaid pay and
allowances, sundry charges, electricity
charges and cancelled works and sanctions
and amendment annual accounts, having a
net effect of ` 11.70 Crore.
**(Para 3.8)**

###### Loss due to excess payment and short recover of electricity charges

Due to failure on the part of the Garrison
Engineers (GEs) in exercising the requisite
checks and in adhering to the approved
electricity tariff, an excess payment of


-----

` 24.54 Crore was made by the GEs
selected for audit. The GEs also failed to
effect recovery of electricity charges worth
` 23.66 Crore from the paying consumers,
including private parties, which was mainly
due to short recovery of energy and fixed
charges, delay in floating of bills, defective
meters, etc. These lapses of excess payment
and short recovery underscore the inadequacy
of internal controls in Military Engineer
Services.
**(Para 4.1)**

###### Inadequate monitoring of execution of a project

Inadequate monitoring of execution of
work by the Engineers for Indian Military
Academy (IMA). Dehradun resulted in noncompletion of main building work costing
` 22.75 Crore. The delay of five years had
not only deprived the Gentlemen cadets
of proper training with modern facilities
but also held up the other training project
valuing ` 2.50 Crore.
**(Para 4.2)**

###### Non-utilization of Assets

Missiles storage shed constructed in August
2008 at a cost of ` 2.29 Crore could not
be utilised for the purpose for want of Air
Conditioning System. CESZ failed to conclude
the contract for air conditioning, despite
the same being approved in the sanction
along with the building. Non availability
of the sheds affected the drawal plan of the
missiles, as the missiles were being held at
another location at a distance of 110 km,
thereby impacting the operational efficiency
of the users.
**(Para 4.3)**


###### Blockage of government money due to conclusion of contracts without availability of site

Chief Engineer, Jabalpur Zone, Jabalpur
concluded contracts without availability of
clear site for construction of Baffle Range.
This was not only in contravention of
the codal provisions but also resulted in
payment of ` 1.68 Crore to the contractor.
Case has now been initiated for closure of
the work.
**(Para 4.4)**

###### Infructuous expenditure due to procurement of substandard pipes

Procurement of defective pipes by Chief
Engineer, Jaipur Zone (CEJZ) led to execution
of substandard work. As a result fire fighting
infrastructure created at an Ammunition
Depot at a cost of ` 2.33 Crore had to be
abandoned rendering entire expenditure
infructuous.

**(Para 4.5)**

###### Avoidable expenditure due to acceptance of contract at higher rates

Director General Border Roads could not
accord approval to lowest tender due to delay
in concurrence by the Integrated Financial
Adviser (IFA) within the validity period. The
contract was concluded at a higher rate after
third call which resulted in extra expenditure
of ` 1.89 Crore.

**(Para 5.1)**


-----

###### Under Recovery of Service Tax from the Contractors

Service Tax was not recovered as per the
provisions of J&K State Government Act on
the gross value of works in five contracts
concluded by the Chief Engineer (Project)
Vijayak. This resulted in under recovery of
`1.06 Crore on account of service tax from
the contractor.
**(Para 5.2)**

###### Delay in procurement of Water Truck resulted in extra expenditure

The delay in decision making by Director
General Border Roads (DGBR) to select the
type of trucks to be procured, led to extra
expenditure of ` 81 lakh on account of
escalation of rates.
**(Para 5.3)**

###### Project Management in Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory Chandigarh

Out of 28 projects selected for audit, 24
projects including two staff and 22 R&D
projects were completed by TBRI. We
however observed that against the two
staff projects, parameters as per qualitative
requirements of Army were not completely
achieved. Out of the remaining 22 completed
R&D projects, success against the prescribed
objectives, in qualitative and quantitative
terms was achieved only in 10 projects.
These projects were however still to be
translated into deliverables. In the remaining
12 projects, the objectives were only partly
achieved. In spite of monitoring at various
levels through Executive Committee, Project


Monitoring Committee, 58 per cent projects
got delayed mainly due to non-materialisation
of supply order.
**(Para 6.1)**

###### Production of Weapon Manufacturing Factories

Audit covered the performance of six weapons
manufacturing Factories for 2011-12 to 201314, on 25 strategic weapon items that together
accounted for 79 per cent of total cost of
production of 68 weapon items in the product
line of these factories.

###### Meeting the requirements of Indenters

Army’s Roll-on-Plan projecting its
requirements for 2011-12 to 2015-16, was to
aid the Board short term planning. However,
indents received from the Army were not
matching with the Army’s Roll-on-Plan.
Ministry of Home Affairs, though projected a
Roll-on-plan in 2010, its requirements were
largely reduced in the annual target fixation
meetings.

The Board faced capacity constraints in
68 per cent of the items and hence, fixed
lower targets than the Army’s requirements
for most of the items. The Board provided
original target to the Factories in December/
November of the previous year, giving only
three months for advance planning by the
Factories against six months’ time required for
the procurement of input materials. Revision
of these targets mid-year also disrupted the
production. The Factories achieved the
targets by 80 per cent and above for eight
to 16 items during 2011-12 to 2013-14. But
for five to 10 items, the achievement was
less than 60 per cent. Total value of shortfall


-----

in issue of the selected weapons against the
revised targets stood at ` 1479 Crore during
2011-12 to 2013-14. Delays in receipt of
input stores are the predominant cause for
slippages across the Factories.

###### Marshalling resources for production

Delay in procurement of stores impacted the
factories in achieving the production targets.
Three out of the six factories placed 60 to 70
per cent of their supply orders in 2011-12 to
2013-14, within five months of identifying
the requirements of stores. The remaining
factories could meet the timelines in only 3 to
52 per cent of the supply orders. Compounding
the inefficiencies in procurement from trade
sources was the inability of sister factory
in meeting the requirements for forgings
for manufacture of barrels for high calibre
weapons at Field Gun Factory Kanpur. The
factories could not complete the quality
control of stores within prescribed 15 days
time in 40 to 63 per cent.

###### Quality Control and Quality Assurance

Quality problems besiege the factories with
impact on cost, achievement of targets and
above all, the reputation of the Board and
its products. The incidence of “ Return for
Rectification” and rejection declared by
senior Quality Assurance Establishment
(SQAE) were high on certain products like
5.56 mm rifle, 7.62 mm MAG, 30 mm cannon
and spare barrel T-90. The recurrence of
defects previously pointed out by the SQAE
in its Quality Inspection Notes indicates
inadequate attention to these Notes. Defects
such as variations in gauge dimensions
to be covered in the inspections by the
Factory Quality Control section, remained


undetected and were raised at subsequent
stages by SQAE. The users, the Army noted
the erosion of trust infield units because of
weapon defects.

###### Financial Management

The practice of fixing issue price for products
in the beginning of the year based on the trends
in the past three years could have worked in a
set-up in which cost control was effective and
fluctuations, especially in overheads were
controlled.  This was not, however, the case
in these factories, which operated on high
overheads, particularly, the fixed overheads.
The apportionment of the overheads over
products was irrational, overloading it on
some products, making them uneconomical.
Ordnance factories are generally focused on
meeting the demand placed on them without
due regard to cost control and cost reduction.
The availability of assured funds with the
Armed Forces helped them to accept the
products from the Board  regardless of the
high issue prices.

###### Planning for future

The Board prepared a perspective Plan 200712 to provide the armed forces with “timely
supply of state-of-the-art technology with
greater value for money”. The dreams of the
Perspective Plan could not be translated into
reality, with implementation marred by delays
in development of the new items.

Even as the Board did not prepare a plan for
the subsequent period, the environment has
changed substantially. The Army prepared the
Long Term Integrated Perspective Plan (LTIPP)
covering a period of 15 years, to which the
Board was yet to formulate a plan to position
itself as an important player.


-----

Small Arms Factories were facing multiple
challenges like declining demand from
indentors and quality problems; lacklustre
response from clients for its new products; and
delays in projects for new generation carbines.
The traditional weaponry in the high calibre
range 81 mm Mortar, 05 mm LFG is facing
a downturn. Beside, delayed indigenisation
and continued reliance on imports of certain
assemblies posed a challenge to the factories
in meeting the demand.
**(Para 7.2)**

###### Production of Chemical manufacturing factories

The Chemical Group of Factories is a subgroup under the operating group ‘Ammunition
& Explosives (A&E)’. This group accounted
for 35 per cent of the total cost of production
during 2011-12 to 2013-14. Four chemical
producing Factories, with an average annual
cost of production of ` 755 Crore, during
2011-12 to 2013-14 contributed to around
five per cent of the cost of the production of
the Ordnance Factory Board.

###### Meeting the requirement of indenters

Mid-year enhancement of targets by the Board
to Factories covering majority of products did
not, in most cases, result in target achievement
as the factories were unable to meet even the
original targets.

The Chemical Group of Factories is required
to meet the production targets by January
each year, a commitment the Factories were
unable to meet. This impacted the production
schedules of the ammunition filling factories.

The irregular practice of preparing advance
issue vouchers for claiming credit without


actual physical issue of products to the
indenters persisted at High Explosive Factory
Kirkee, Ordinance Factory Bhandara and
Ordnance Factory Itarsi.

The internal controls in the Board to monitor
production against targets were routing and
hence their effectiveness diminished.

###### Marshalling resources for production

The Factories could not achieve compliance
with the timeframe prescribed by the Board
on placing supply orders in one-third of
the procurements. Further, if the lead time
for delivery of stores were to be factored,
procurement would consume most of the
production year. Due to the delays in
procurement, the factories could not maintain
even flow of production, with productions
peaking in the fag end of the year. The labour
productivity reported by the Factories was high
and did not correlate with the performance
against targets.

###### Quality Control and Quality Assurance

There were rejections in quality control
and inordinate time was taken in proof
establishment, causing cascading effect on
achievement against targets.

Absence of dedicated proof range at Factories
caused delay in conduct of dynamic proof;
a project sanctioned in December 2008 was
abandoned and alternatives have not come to
fruition.

###### Financial Management

The Factories ran on high overheads that
inflated the cost of production. The practice of
fixing issue price for products in the beginning
of the year based on the trends in the past
three years could have worked in a set-up in


-----

which cost control was effective to closely
monitor abnormal fluctuations in cost. This
was not however the case in the factories with
the two controls: the shop Budget Committee
and the Quarterly Financial Review, being
inadequate interventions suffering from
structural deficiencies.

Ordnance Factories being sole production unit
for the armed forces are generally focused on
meeting the demand placed on them without
due regard for the considerations of cost
control and reduction.

###### Environmental Issues

Factories did not identify the specific
environmental risks or prepare a perspective
plan for progressive risk mitigation measures.
The investment of funds on environmental
measures was low in all the factories.

Large number of pending recommendations
in energy audit indicated the future potential
savings that will require investment of
funds.

The general trend of the accidents, especially
in Ordnance Factory, Itarsi indicated a gap in
safety training of the staff.
**(Para 7.3)**

###### Loss of ` 1.37 Crore due to non-fulfilment of contractual obligation against export orders.

Ordnance Factory Board delayed the delivery
of the Kavach system against an export order
due to slippages in development of the
Kavach system and non-supply of Fire Control
System (part of the Kavach) by an Indian firm.
Consequently, the foreign firm deducted
penalty of ` 1.37 Crore from the bills of the
Board.
**(Para 7.4)**


###### Non-utilization of feeder system

A new substation installed by Rifle Factory
Ishapore (RFI) at a cost of ` 4.09 Crore in June
2006 remained unproductive owing to RFI’s
failure to procure and install switchgears for
it. (April 2015).
**(Para 7.6)**

###### Procurement and Inventory Management – Bharat Earth Movers Ltd.

One of the many factors contributing to
decrease in profits was high inventory
levels impacting on the working capital.
Vendore negotiations resorted to by
the Company were in deviation to the
Purchase manual and CVC guidelines. The
amount of Bank Guarantees obtained for
advances paid was not in accordance with
the CVC guidelines. Documentation of all
the activities relating to procurement was
inadequate. Vendore management was not
fool proof due to non-availability of data
regarding all the tenders in the system.
Vendor list contained duplicates indicating
lack of sufficient controls in SAP. Advances
remained unadjusted and also could not be
monitored due to inclusion of payments
made against proforma invoices, ad-hoc
payments against pending POs, etc. under
advances. Stores manual was not updated
for last 23 years. Due to inadequate security
features, SRM system of the Company
lacked confidence of foreign vendors. No
integration of data between SAP and SRM
was provided.
**(Para 8.1)**


-----

###### Blocking of funds due to accumulation of Inventory-` 16.14 Crore

Continued procurement of raw materials
by M/s BEML Limited when the new
technology was yet to be proven and
production of dumper without matching
shovel resulted in blocking of inventory
valued ` 16.14 Crore.
**(Para 8.3)**

###### Report No. 51 of 2015

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

 1. Why did we do this performance audit

Government of India, Ministry of Defence
(MoD), in December, 2002 sanctioned a
health care scheme namely “Ex-servicemen
Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS)” to cater
for Medicare of all ex-servicemen (ESM) in
receipt of pension, including disability and
family pensioners, as also their dependents,
to include wife/husband, legitimate children
and wholly dependent parents.

The total strength of the ex-servicemen and
their dependents across the country as of
April 2015 was ` 47.24 lakh. The Scheme
aims to provide healthcare on cashless
basis to all beneficiaries as applicable in
Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS)
through a network of ECHS Polyclinics,
Service hospital and private empanelled/
Government hospitals spread across the
country. The scheme came into effect from
April 1, 2003.


###### 2. What does this performance audit cover

We took up the performance audit of the
Scheme for the period from 2012-13 to 201415 to obtain reasonable assurance that:

 The ECHS was able to fulfil its mandated
aims and objectives;

 The scheme was being run efficiently and
adequate manpower, infrastructure and
equipment were available with the ECHS
as per authorisation.

 The referral mechanism in place was
adequate to ensure that inflated bills/
unauthorised payments were not made
to empanelled hospitals;

 Provisioning and issue of medicines to
polyclinics are made as per requirement.

 The online bill processing by the Bill
Processing Agency was effective, efficient
and the integrity of the data of the Bill
processing system was ensured.

###### 3. Key findings

**Irregularity in agreement for smart cards**

In contravention of the laid down provisions
for the renewal/ repeat orders, Central
Organisation, ECHS renewed the agreement
for supply of smart cards for the ECHS
beneficiaries for a period of five years, with
the same firm with increased cost for which
no sanction of the CFA was produced to
Audit. No evidence was found with the
Central Organisation to corroborate that the
trend of Market price had been verified before
renewal of the agreement.
**(Para 2.1.1)**


-----

**Issue of ECHS Smart Cards to beneficiaries**
**on chargeable basis**

One-time contribution at the rates prescribed
for CGHS pensioners was to be recovered
from retiring service personnel to become
member. No other charges were specified
by the MoD to be recovered from retiring
service personnel under the Scheme. Against
spirit of this, the entire cost of smart cards was
charged from the beneficiaries in addition to
membership fees without the approval of the
MoD.
**(Para 2.1.2)**

**Multiple enrolments of beneficiaries under**
**ECHS**

Comparison of data maintained by ECHS
and M/S SITL, disclosure that 7,431 cards
were stated to be issued by ECHS in excess
of total cards produced by M/s SITL resulting
in extra payment of ` 6.69 lakh to the firm
by ECHS.
**(Para 2.1.3)**

**Short Supply of medicines to the polyclinics**

The percentage of medicines not issued (NA)
by the Armed Forces Medical Stores Depot
(AFMSD) Mumbai against the indents of
dependent polyclinics ranged from 63 to 76
per cent, whereas in case of AFMSD Delhi
Cantt., the percentage of NA medicines
ranged from 30 to 45 per cent. Thus, supply
of medicines by the two AFMSDs to their
dependent polyclinics was inadequate and
led to huge deficiency of medicines in the
polyclinics.
**(Para 2.3.4)**


**Non disposal of life expired medicines/**
**drugs**

As per guidelines issued by the Director
General Armed Forces Medical Services,
the vendor is liable to replace medicines
lying unconsumed, if informed three months
before date of expiry of shelf life of the
medicine. However, AFMSD Delhi Cantt,
and Polyclinic Lodhi road were holding
life expired medicines worth ` 73.44 lakh
without its replacement/ disposal, thus
defeating the very purpose of its procurement
and consequential loss to the State.

**(Para 2.3.5)**

**Diversion of ECHS Funds/ Medical Stores for**
**service personnel by Service Hospitals**

Government policy on allotment/ expenditure
of funds meant for ECHS provides that
medical stores procured for ECHS should be
accounted for separately and utilised for the
benefit of members of ECHS. However, we
noticed at Army Hospital Research & Referral
(AHRR) Delhi Cantt. that separate accounting
of medicine/ drugs for ECHS beneficiaries had
not been done and the funds/ stores meant
for the ECHS amounting to ` 40.78 Crore
diverted/ utilised for treatment of regular
services personnel.
**(Para 2.3.9)**

**Shortage/ Deployment of Manpower with**
**polyclinics**

Against authorisation of 6,800 contractual
manpower for polyclinics all over India,
only 5,353 persons were in position as on
December 31, 2014. Thus, there was a
deficiency of 21 per cent of the manpower
with the PCs, adversely affecting the proper


-----

Medicare of the beneficiaries. Despite this
the manpower employed and meant for PCs
was irregularly being posted and utilised at
Central Organisation and Regional Centres at
Delhi.
**(Para 2.4.2 & 2.4.3)**

**Deficiencies** **in** **raising** **of** **Emergency**
**Information Report (EIR) by empanelled**
**hospitals**

In emergencies and life threatening
conditions, the patients are permitted to be
admitted to nearest empanelled hospital. In
such circumstances the empanelled hospital/
facility is required to informed the nearest
polyclinic, within a period of 48 hours,
regarding the particulars of patient and the
nature of admission. We observed that
empanelled hospitals were not following
the above timeline in case of admission of
beneficiary in emergency; and the EIR was
delayed between three to 584 days which
rendered the provision of emergency referral
by nearest polyclinic redundant and led to
issue off take EIRs in some cases with a scope
to private hospitals to manipulate their bills.
**(Para 2.5.3)**

**Raising of claims by two empanelled hospitals**
**for the same patient during the overlapping**
**period**

Analysis of the claims data revealed that
claims had been preferred by an empanelled
hospital in respect of beneficiaries for the
period under which that beneficiary was
admitted for treatment in other empanelled
hospital as indoor patient. There were 64
such claims amounting ` 42.67 lakh which
had also been approved and paid. The raising


and payment of such claims in this manner
revealed the absence of validation checks
in the system for online bill processing by
BPA.
**(Para 2.5.4)**

**Non-invoking of penal clause of MoA against**
**defaulting hospitals**

Despite specific mention in the MoA to
provide cashless facility to the beneficiaries
and not to indulge in unethical practices,
the empanelled hospitals were violating the
provisions, such as, over-charging from the
ECHS beneficiaries, preferring claims for items
already included in the package rates, refusal
of cashless treatment, etc. However, no penal
action had been initiated against defaulting
hospitals.
**(Para 2.5.5)**

**Irregular payment towards unaccounted bills**
**of empanelled hospitals**

Unaccounted 4,986 manual bills of
empanelled hospitals amounting to ` 23.61
Crore were paid irregularly by SHQ (ECHS
Cell) Delhi Cantt. We observed the following
cases of double payments and also the absence
of control in accounting which substantiates
the audit finding:

22 bills (same number) amounting to ` 8.20
lakh, of empanelled hospitals, were admitted
and paid twice by SHQ Delhi Cantt., through
44 paid vouchers amounting to ` 16.40 lakh,
which resulted in double payment of ` 8.20
lakh.

Empanelled hospitals raised 123 duplicate
bills in respect of patients where the name,
referral number, nature of ailment, period


-----

of treatment, amount claimed etc., were the
same. The SHQ Delhi Cantt. Failed to detect
the duplicate bills and paid additional amount
of ` 23.18 lakh.

No bank reconciliation statements were
prepared and submitted to the PCDA, WC
Chanidgarh by Station HQ Delhi Cantt.
**(Para 2.6.1.1)**

**Overpayment due to non-adherence to MoA**

Test check revealed overpayment of
` 3.51 Crore to the empanelled hospitals
on account of inflated bills in excess of
authorized package rates (` 1.92 Crore);
non reduction of 10 per cent package rate
for treatment in General ward (` 11.96
lakh); charging of higher accommodation
rate from ECHS beneficiaries as compared
to non-ECHS patients (` 26.78 lakh) higher
procedure rates for Total Knee Replacements
(Bilateral) as compared to non ECHS patients
in one empanelled hospital alone (` 99.49
lakh) and non availing of 10 per cent rebate
on oncology medicines by ECHS (` 20.55
lakh).
**(Para 2.6.1.2)**

**Provision for discount on medicines in**
**MoA**

As per the terms of the MoA between the
ECHS and empanelled hospitals, the ECHS
had paid cost of medicines supplied to inpatient beneficiaries at MRP, which was
considerably higher than the local market
rate. It was proved form the facts that
polyclinics were procuring medicines at
discount on MRP which ranged upto 35 per
cent. Further, payment of cost of an injection
to empanelled hospitals under RC Jalandhar


at higher rates than the procurement cost of
the same injection during the same period by
MH Jalandhar resulted in extra expenditure
of ` 89.53 lakh.

Apparently, there is sufficient scope of
inclusion of provision in the MoA with
empanelled hospitals for obtaining discount
over MRP in medicines being issuing by
them to the ECHS beneficiaries, as cost
of medicines formed 32 per cent of the
medical treatment related payments made
to empanelled hospitals (` 540 Crore out of
` 1,702 Crores).
**(Para 2.6.1.3)**

**Non-adherence of the time limit for payment**
**of bills by BPA/ CFA resulting in non availing**
**of discount**

In MoD’s sanction for online bill processing
a provision was made for obtaining discount
of two per cent of amount payable to
empanelled hospital, if the payments were
made within 10 working days of receiving
hard copy of bill or settlement of all queries
by the hospital, whichever was later. We
observed that stipulated time limit was not
being adhered to in the bills processed by
BPA and CFA. Due to taking more than 10
working days in processing and payment of
bills individually as well as commonly by
BPA, CFA and paying Agency, the discount
of two per cent amount to ` 34.10 Crore
could not be availed.
**(Para 2.6.2.3)**

**Approval of payment to empanelled hospital**
**by CFA (ECHS) after rejection of the same**
**by BPA**

BPA had recommended 1,088 claims
amounting to ` 1.16 Crore for rejection.


-----

This was on account of claims being without
valid referral, claims without mandatory
documents, separate claims for items
forming part of package, claims without pre
and post procedure images, hospital not
being empanelled for treatment and claims
without necessary approval of SEMO.
However, CFA (ECHS) had passed such
claims against the BPA’s recommendation
without justification.

**(Para 2.6.2.4)**

**Incorrect room type entitlement in case of**
**indoor treatment for ECHS beneficiaries**

Payment of room charges at higher rates
that entitlement of ECHS beneficiaries to
the empanelled hospitals resulted in an over
payment of ` 90.43 lakh in 1,487 claims to
the empanelled hospitals.

**(Para 2.6.2.7)**

**Non-development of audit module for**
**post audit and inadequate post audit by**
**PCsDA**

CGDA, while concurring the case file of
online bill processing by BPA, stated that
BPA should agree for online concurrent
audit along with system audit. The online
bill processing commenced initially in five
RCs from April 2012 was extended to all
the 28 RCs from April 2015. However,
the online post audit module has been
implemented partially in only one PCDA.
Further, the PCsDA/ CsDA failed to carry
out the post audit of the bills as per the laid
down financial procedure.

**(Para 2.6.2.10 & 2.6.2.11)**


###### Report No. 19 of 2015 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Ready availability of ammunition plays a
critical role in overall preparedness of the
Army. Director General Ordnance Service
(DGOS) at Army Headquarters (AHQ) is
responsible for overall management of
ammunition in the Army and carries out
annual provisioning and procurement. Most
of the ammunition for the Army is procured
form Ordnance Factory Board (OFB). To meet
this requirement, ten factories of Ammunition
and Explosives group under OFB are engaed
in production of ammunition and explosive.
Balance requirement of ammunition is met
from trade and ex-import.

**Why did we do this Review?**

The review was undertaken to ascertain the
effectiveness of procedures and practices
and built-in controls relating to management
of the ammunition in the Army in terms
of operational preparedness and resource
utilization.

In order to review the existing systems,
which included implementation of existing
policies on ammunition management,
stocking policies, implication of short falls in
production/ procurement and import, storage
and distribution problems and disposal of
unserviceable/obsolete ammunition. Review
of related records at AHQ. Directorate
General of Quality Assurance (DGQA) and
OFB was carried out for the year 2008-2009
to 2012-13.

###### KEY FINDINGS

**1. Shortage of ammunition**

In disregard of the War Wastage Reserve
scale of 40(1) days, based on which Annual


-----

Provisioning of ammunition was carried
out by DGOS, indent for procurement of
ammunition by AHQ was placed on the basis
of ‘Bottom Line’or ‘Minimum Acceptable Risk
Level (MARL) requirements which averaged to
20(1) days. As a result, the policy for the size
of national stockpile was not implemented by
the agencies responsible, citing the reasons
of budgetary constraints, and inadequate
production capacity with OFB. Stocking of
ammunition even at MARL was not ensured,
as availability of ammunition as on March,
2013 was below the MARL in respect of
125 out of a total 170 types of ammunition
(74 per cent). We found that availability
has been dwindling over the years as types
of critical ammunition (available for less
than 10 days (1) had increased from 15 per
cent in March 2009 to 50 per cent in March
2013. The percentage of critical ammunition
in High calibre ranged up to 84 per cent
during the five years period of audit. The
critical shortage impacted the operational
preparedness and training regimen of the
Army.

**(Chapter-II)**

**2. Non fructification of procurement orders**
**place in OFB**

OFB is the main source for supply of
ammunition to the Indian Army. In order to
build up ammunition stock level up to MARL
and to provide enough lead time to OFB for
procurement of raw material and streamlining
the production, Ministry of Defence (Ministry)
placed a five year Roll on Indent on OFB in
January, 2010. Even though the ammunition
requirement covered under Roll on Indent
had been worked out in consultation with
OFB and the corresponding annual budgetary
requirements accepted, in principle, by the


Ministry at the time of approval of the Roll
on Indent, the projection of the requirement
of fund by OFB was much lesser vis-à-vis the
targets fixed. It was therefore, a foregone
conclusion that the OFB would fail to supply
the targeted quantity. Despite the acceptance
of targets for supply of ammunition covered
under the first Roll on Indent, the OFB failed
to supply the targeted quantity, with shortfalls
ranging up to 73 per cent of the total types of
ammunition.

**(Chapter-III & IV)**

**3. Delay in finalization of imports**

Army imports ammunition through capital
and revenue route. Import, as an alternate
source of procurement, provide to be
unreasonably slow as no procurement of
ammunition took place against the nine items
initiated for procurement through capital
route during the period 2008-2013 due to
single vendor situation, complexities in TOT,
delay in finalization of GSQR, etc. In case of
revenue procurements also, the success rate
of fructification of contracts was as low as 20
per cent. Thus, due to delay in finalization of
import contracts, the built-up of ammunition
has been badly hampered.

**(Chapter-III)**

**4. Deficiencies in Quality Control and**
**Quality Assurance systems**

During manufacturing process, the role
of DGQA is to carryout Final Acceptance
inspection for which limited tests on
sampling basis are carried out by SQAE. The
concerned Ordnance Factories are required
to carry out 100 per cent checks for the
quality of stores being manufactured by


-----

them, which include check of input material,
inter-stage and final product. Ineffective
quality controls by the Ordnance Factories
led to rejections of finished products at
Quality Assurance stage. QA was returning
cases for rectification (RFR) which was not in
its mandate. Even the products accepted by
QA were not found up to the mark and due
to persistent quality problems, ammunition
worth ` 1,618 Crore was lying as rejected in
depots. Ammunition worth ` 814 Crore was
declared unserviceable within shelf life by
the depots due to poor quality.

**(Chapter-V)**

**5.** **Inadequacies in supply chain management**
**and depot activities**

When any ammunition meets an accident,
Army impose ban on use of that particular
lot of ammunition. Such ammunition is kept
segregated till its further sentencing. We also
observed that ammunition worth ` 3,578
Crore were lying in segregated condition
awaiting sentencing and ammunition worth
` 2,109 Crore was lying in Repairable Major
condition awaiting repairs.

The movement of ammunition within various
echelons in army suffered from inadequacies
such as delays in issue of ammunition.
Non-accountable of ammunition by depots,
transportation of ammunition by other than
specified explosive vans etc. Further, the
depots were functioning with risk of fire
accident, as the fire fighting equipment were
not held as per requirement/ authorisation.

On line connectivity among AHQ, depots
and user units to enhance visibility of assets,
speedy issue and receipt and effective
overall ammunition management through


computerization have eluded the Army as
the computerization project was delayed by
more than 10 years.

**(Chapter-VI)**

**Summary of Important Audit Observation-**
**Report of the Comptroller and Auditor**
**General of India, Union Government,**
**Defence Services (Air Force) No.17 of 2015**
**laid in Parliament on May 8, 2015**

 ADA’s decision to advance building
of two prototypes from Full Scale
Engineering Development (FSED)
Phase-II to FSED Phase-I on the ground
of accelerating the development process
of LCA, failed to yield the desired results
as the FSED phase I was closed in March
2004 involving a delay of six years and
without completing all the activities
which were carried forward to FSED
Phase II. More Importantly, this decision
of ADA rendered the prototypes deficient
of critical on board systems (Multi-Mode
Radar, Self-Protection Jammer, Radar
Warning Receiver) and led to ADA
using the Limited Series Production
aircraft (meant for IAF) use) towards
flight testing/evaluation of these critical
on board systems, in contravention to
the commitment given to the GoI while
obtaining sanction(November 2001) for
building of these aircraft.

**(Para 2.1)**

 LCA Mark-I, which achieved Initial
Operational Clearance (December
2013) has significant shortfalls (53
permanent waivers/ concessions) in
meeting the ASR as a result of which,
it will have reduced operational


-----

capabilities and reduced survivability,
thereby limiting its operational
employability when inducted into IAF
squadrons. Shortcomings in LCA Mark
I (increased weight, reduced internal
fuel capacity, non-compliance of fuel
system protection, pilot protection from
front, reduced speed) were expected to
be overcome by development of LCA
Mark-II, an aircraft with lower weight
and a higher thrust engine which is
expected to meet the ASR, had been
taken up by ADA in November 2009
and is scheduled for completion by
December, 2018.
**(Para 2.3)**

 IAF would be constrained to induct
fighter LCA without availability of
trainer LCA, adversely impacting pilot
training. Production of trainer aircraft
at HAL was delayed as the trainer LCA
had not achieved IOC/ FOC. As regards
flight training simulator, IAF was using
an upgraded Full Mission Simulator
(FMS) at ADE for pilot training, pending
supply of a FMS by HAL at LCA operating
base.
**(Para 2.3.1)**

 Addition of new weapons by Air HQ for
operational edge of LCA (March 1997,
December 2009) necessitating design
changes on the aircraft, coupled with
delayed specifying (December 2009)
of integrating R-73 E missile with MultiMode Radar/ Helmet Mounted Display
and Sight and delayed identification
(December 2009) of Beyond Visual
Range Missiles also contributed to
the delays in achieving IOC/ FOC by
L.C.A.
**(Para 2.3.2, 2.3.3)**


 LCA Mark I is deficient in Electronic
Warfare capability as specified by IAF,
as the Self Protection Jammer could not
be fitted on the aircraft due to space
constraints and the Radar Warning
Receiver/Counter Measure Dispensing
System fitted on the aircraft are having
performance issues, which are yet to be
overcome (January 2015) .
**(Para 2.3.4)**

 LCA programme is being monitored
by General Body, Governing Body,
involving the representation of MoD,
Ministry of Finance at the highest level,
various committees at ADA/ HAL,
Empowered Committee chaired by
Chief of Air Staff. In spite of this, delays
in completion of work packages which
affected the LCA programme schedules,
indicates that coordination of efforts at
various levels and monitoring of the
programme by all the agencies involved,
has not been as envisaged.
**(Para 2.4)**

 Need for a Liaison Group between Air
HQ and ADA to ensure closer interaction
between the design team and the
user for better appreciation of mutual
perception, had been recommended
by the LCA PDP Review Committee as
early as in 1989. However, no such
liaison group was formed and active
user (Air HQ) participation in the LCA
Programme started only after November
2006, which also impacted the LCA
development.

**(Para 2.5)**

 Government of India had emphasized
(June 1993) on increasing the indigenous


-----

content of LCA while sanctioning FSED
in phased manner, but ADA did not
make any roadmap for indigenization
during LCA development. As a result,
indigenous content of LCA estimated by
ADA as 70 per cent actually worked out
to about 35 per cent (January 2015).
**(Para 3.1)**

 LCA systems such as Kaveri engine,
Multi-Mode Radar, Radome, Multi
Functional Display System and Flight
Control System Actuators taken up for
indigenous development could not
be developed successfully, resulting
in LCA’s continued dependency on
import of these systems. Development
of Jet Fuel Starter, though achieved
indigenously, had performance issues
which are yet to be resolved (January
2015).
**(Para 3.1.1)**

 Prototype version (PV) and Limited
Series Production (LSP) of LCA built
by HAL had low serviceability due to
delay in snags analysis, slow recovery
of aircraft from rectification, shortage
of critical LRUs at flight hangar, aircraft
being used as test rigs, large number
of unproductive sorties etc. which
impacted availability of aircraft for flight
testing and contributed to delays in
development of LCA.
**(Para 4.2.2)**

 The manufacturing facilities crated at
HAL presently cater for production of
only four aircraft per annum against the
envisaged requirement of eight aircraft
per annum due to delays in procuring
plant and machinery, tools and jigs


and also construction of production
hangars, which would further impact
production of LCA and induction into
IAF squadrons.
**(Para 4.3)**

 Repair and Overhaul (ROH) facility for
LCA, as specified in the ASR has not
been created fully at HAL. Out of the
344 Line Replaceable Units of LCA, 90
LRUs were considered non-repairable.
Of the remaining 254 LRUs while ROH
facilities in respect of 185 LRUs were
available, ROH facilities in respect of
185 LRUs were available, ROH facilities
were yet to be established for 69 LRUs
(January 2015).
**(Para 4.4)**

 Design, development and
productionisation of LCA through
concurrent engineering did not
compress the development time as
envisaged in the FSED Phase-II sanction
(November 2001) since LSP aircraft
were built in a phased manner with
specific capabilities for the purpose of
flight testing/ evaluation and even LSP-8
fell short of the ASR in terms of weight
and speed, for which permanent waivers
had to be granted by Air HQ when LCA
achieved IOC (December 2013).
**(Para 4.5.1)**

 Awarding of the 20 IOC contract
by MoD to HAL in 2006 when LCA
design was nowhere near finalization,
was premature, as only Technology
Demonstrators/ Prototypes were flying
and LSPs were yet to be built. This lead
to delay in productionisation of LCA
and formation of squadrons by IAF, as


-----

HAL is yet to supply any aircraft against
the contract (January 2015).
**(Para 4.6.1)**

 Awarding of contract (December, 2010)
for supply of 20 FOC configuration
aircraft by MoD to HAL even before
commencement of supply of IOC
configuration aircraft, freezing of
designs and achieving of FOC was
premature. Further, HAL had advances
of `1509.22 Crore since 2010 without
utilising it against the contract. (January
2015).
**(Para 4.6.2)**

 Due to delay in manufacture and supply
of LCA, IAF had to undertake alternate
temporary measures such as upgradation of existing aircraft at a cost of
` 20,037 Crore to overcome depleting
squadrons with obsolete aircraft and IAF
is looking forward for early induction
of LCA to overcome the drawdown of
squadrons.
**(Para 4.7)**

**Summary of Important Audit Observation-**
**Report of the Comptroller and Auditor**
**General of India, Union Government,**
**Defence Services (Air Force) No. 38 of 2015**
**laid in Parliament on December 18, 2015**

**I. Operation and Maintenance of ‘AA’**

The Ministry of Defence concluded a
contract (March 2004) for procurement of
three ‘AA’ and its sub-systems at accost of
1108 MUSD (` 5,042 Crore).

There was sub-optimal utilisation of
operational capabilities of ‘AA’ in terms
of flying task achieved mainly due to un

serviceability of ÁA’. Besides, scope for
increasing operational efficiency of ‘AA’
aircraft was restricted due to absence of
training to aircrew on air to air refuelling
(AAR) and non-acquisition of additional land
for extension of runway length at AF Station
‘S-3’.

There was delay in installation of Ground
Exploitation Station (GES) at intended location
(‘S-1’) due to lack of due diligence in planning
of work services. There was shortage of
aircrew which may impact the operations of
the ‘AA’ aircraft during hostilities.

No long term arrangements existed for repair
and maintenance of ‘AA’ which was being
managed with interim maintenance services
contract. Supply of defective Automatic Test
Equipment for Communication System, nonsupply of ‘I’ level facility for Identification
of Friend or Foe (IFF) system and short
provisioning of stores/ rotables had adversely
affected the serviceability of ‘AA’.

Certain infrastructure facilities were not
synchronised with the induction of ‘AA’
as there was delay in completion of work
services for modified hangars, independent
storage facility and separate training-cumaccommodation centre at AF station ‘S-3’,
which affected smooth functioning of ‘AA.

**(Para 2.1)**

**II. Operational works in IAF**

Operational works are undertaken to meet
the temporary requirement of operational
necessity and hence have significant role in
operational preparedness of IAF. ` 90.35
Crore was spent by IAF on operational
works during 2010-11 to 2013-14. Audit


-----

found inclusion of ineligible works in
Annual Operational Works. Plans (AOWPs)
and undefined timelines for all stages of
operational works viz. delays in declaring
operational works area, approval of AOWPs,
award of contracts and execution of
operational works.

**(Para 2.2)**

**III. Operation and maintenance of ‘C’**
**aircraft**

In order to maintain a credible level of
deterrence, Indian Air Force (IAF) procured
‘C’ aircraft from 1996 onwards. Shortfalls
in performance of aircraft and airborne
system as received from Original Equipment
Manufacturer (OEM)/ Bharat Electronics
Limited (BEL) were yet (August 2015) to
be resolved. Setting up of service support
centres were inordinately delayed for want of
required systems/equipment. Serviceability
of aircraft fleet was also low. Manpower
for ‘C’ aircraft squadron was not sanctioned
even after 19 years of its induction.

**(Para 2.3)**

**IV.** **Up-gradation and maintenance of ‘DD’**
**aircraft**

The up-gradation programme undertaken
by IAF was neither completely successfully
nor comprehensive. IAF selected unproven
‘BB’ radar for use in Air Defence and
ground attach role. Performance of radar
had not been satisfactory due to various
inadequacies in its air to ground range
mode and beyond visual range capability.
Due to unsuitability/ deficiency of critical
airborne electronic warfare (EW) systems
the aircraft fleet was vulnerable to EW
threats. There was low serviceability and


high percentage of Aircraft on Ground
(AOG) due to non-availability of spares
which resulted in shortfall in flying efforts.
There was overall shortage of operational
and technical manpower at operating units
which affected operation and maintenance
of aircraft. The ‘D ‘ level facility created
at HAL was limited to diagnostic and
repair and therefore, dependence on OEM
continued for major repair/ overhaul of
upgraded system involving long duration of
time which affected the fleet serviceability.

**(Para 2.4)**

**V. Inappropriate procurement of tent based**
**medical shelter**

Tent Based Medical Shelter (TBMS) which
were planned to be light weight and meant
for immediate and temporary deployment
for medical relief in disaster area could not
be utilized, as critical medical equipment
were deleted and housing package including
staff accommodation, flooring, hospital
furniture, etc., were added to initial scope,
which made it heavier. Resultantly user
Rapid Action Medical Team (RAMT) found it
difficult to transport and deploy. Thus, even
after spending ` 10 Crore on procurement
of TBMS for providing assistance during
disasters, the nation was deprived of its
intended benefits due to its heavy weight.

**(Para 2.5)**

**VI. Excess procurement of Speech Secrecy**
**equipment**

Excess procurement of 127 speech equipment
by IAF, resulted in avoidable expenditure of
` 4 Crore.

**(Para 2.6)**


-----

**VII. Procurement of Intelligence system**

Incorrect identification/ delayed evaluation
of the identified platform by IAF resulted
in delay in installation of state-of-the-art
intelligence system. Further, the system
acquired after twelve years of ‘in principle
approval’ and after incurring expenditure of `
88.70 Crore remained afflicted with software
issues, raising concerns on its performance
as envisaged. Annual Maintenance Contract
(AMC) for the system was yet (May 2015)
to be concluded post expiry of warranty
(December 2014).

**(Para 2.7)**

**VIII. Arbitrary planning in the resurfacing**
**of extended portion of runways**

Resurfacing of newly extended portion of
runways within three years of previous
resurfacing without identifying any defect/
deterioration was arbitrary which indicated
lack of due diligence in taking up the
work and therefore resulted in injudicious
expenditure of `1.48 Crore. It was also done
without getting the approval from Competent
Financial Authority i.e. MoD.

**(Para 2.8)**

**IX. Procurement of compressor working**
**fluid**

Failure on the part of Air HQ in not ordering
staggered supply of compressor working fluid
worth ` 2.52 Crore led to expiry of its shelf
life.

**(Para 2.9)**

**X. Inordinate Delay in Commissioning of**
**Low Level Transportable Radar**

The critical requirement of Air Defence
Surveillance envisaged (1998) to be met


by IAF through 37 Low Level Transportable
Radars (LLTR) was not met for past 17 years
due to inordinate delay in supply of 19
LLTRs despite incurring expenditure of `
454.48 Crore. None of the first LLTR has
been commissioned so far (June 2015),
thereby compromising the Air Defence
surveillance capability to detect hostile low
level ingress.

**(Para 2.10)**

**XI. Savings at the instance of Audit**

Air HQ/ Ministry reduced the requirements
at the instance of Audit which resulted in
corresponding reduction of one set of ordered
equipment / spares for the crashed ‘E’ aircraft
leading to savings of `11.45 Crore.

**(Para 2.11)**

**XII. Execution of Mission Mode projects and**
**delivery of system by DRDO**

Audit examination of 14 Mission Mode
project carried out by DRDO laboratories
revealed that all the project failed to achieve
their timelines and their probable date of
completion (PDC) were extended many
times. In five projects there were cost
overruns as well.

Further, although Operational Requirements/
Qualitative Requirements/ Broad Technical
Requirements of IAF existed in all project,
the requirements of IAF were met to their
satisfaction only in one completed project
viz., project ‘Rohini. In the same project the
technology was also transferred leading to its
productionisation by BEL and final induction
into IAF. The systems developed in other
closed projects were yet to be accepted by
IAF.


-----

The delays can be attributed to inadequate
monitoring by different committees as well
as to change of requirements by IAF (three
project). Lack of harmonisation (where
multiple agencies were involved) was also
notice in two project.

The projects were therefore not carried out
inspirit of Mission Mode which adversely
affected Air Defence plans of IAF

**(Para 3.1)**

**XIII** **Estate Management in Hindustan**
**Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Bengaluru**

Discrepancies were noticed in the extend
of holding of HAL as per the Compendium
of land holdings of HAL, Award Copies
and Record of Rights of Tenancy and Crops
Certificate (RTC).

HAL did not have the award copies for 402
acres and 3836 guntas (220 survey numbers)
of land in Bengaluru Complex with market
value of `1,499.53 Crore. There was no
indenture for 265 acres and 17 guntas (March
2015) of land at Nasik though the same was
in possession of HAL.

HAL had acquired 10 acres and 19 guntas
of land despite existence of slums in
Bangaluru and as HAL could not evict the
slums, land remained under encroachment.
In Karapur, out of ` 3,121.15 acres of land
held by the division, 50.21 acres were under
encroachment by local villagers for over 25
years.

HAL did not execute the lease deed in
respect of 552.41 acres of land leased to
other organisations and Sale Deed was not


executed in13 cases where the land was
sold.

HAL had not framed a comprehensive
land use policy covering long term
development plans both for functional and
non-functional needs vis-à-vis adequacy
of the existing facilities and suitability of
vacant land available with it in the context
of development of civilian infrastructure
surrounding it.

**(Para 4.1)**

**XIV.** **Investment** **in** **Joint** **Venture**
**Companies by HAL**

Against total investment of ` 225.14 Crore
in 11 JVCs, HAL has already made provision
for diminution in the value of investment
amounting to ` 49.90 Crore made in five
JVCs in its annual accounts for the year
2013-14.

BAeHAL, formed as an Export Oriented Unit,
made domestic sales upto 63 per cent of
total sales during the period from 2004-05 to
2013-14 in violation of Foreign Trade Policy
2004-09 and 2009-14.

HETL (i.e. a JVC) was formed with the
purpose of development and manufacture of
3 D technology based products for airborne
use, without assessing the relevance of the
technology, market demand, technical
and financial details of the JV partners as
stipulated in DPE guidelines. As such, the
JVC was not able to successfully execute the
orders placed units for crucial projects of
HAL.

HALBIT, formed for marketing, designing and
integrating airborne avionics products and


-----

systems, was entrusted with development
of hardware for a time bound programme
like DARIN-III though the JVC did not
have nay previous experience in the field.
Consequently, the DARIN-III programme
was delayed due to delay in supplies by the
JVC.

Investment of HATSOFF without obtaining
firm commitment from the Defence Services
resulted in non achievement of the intended
benefits by the JVC besides additional
expenditure of ` 10.93 Crore to HAL due
to not ascertaining the actual cost of aircraft
data licence.

IRAL, formed for undertaking supply of
aviation equipment, providing services for
repair and overhaul and ensuring technical
and engineering support for exploitation of
the aviation equipment and other related
activities in India and abroad except former
Republics of USSR, engaged only in trading
activities and HAL was the major customer.

**(Para 4.2)**

**XV. Acceptance of contract for DARIN-III**
**with fixed delivery schedule led to liquidated**
**damages.**

Acceptance of a fixed delivery schedule
without freezing of standard of preparation
(SOP) and not working through change
orders resulted in liability of ` 7.19 Crore
towards liquidated damages as on March
2014 and has potential to cause further losses
to HAL with the progress of the contract.
This decision of HAL was against its financial
interest.

**(Para 4.3)**


**Summary of important Audit Observation-**
**Report of the Comptroller and Auditor**
**General of India, Union Government,**
**Defence Services (Navy and Coast Guard)**
**No. 37 of 2015 tabled in Parliament on**
**December 8, 2015**

 The Medium Refit (MR) of an EKM
submarine was due for commencement
in2001, but was carried out from January
2006, by which time the material state
of the submarine witnessed extensive
deterioration. The MR scheduled to
be completed by January 2009 was
delivered by the shipyard to the Navy
only in June 2015 due to deficiency in
manpower deployment by the yard,
lack of protection to main line cables,
delayed supply of yard materials and
modernization of equipment. As a
result, the Navy is unable to operate
one of their lethal platforms since June,
2004.

**(Para 2.1)**

 Navy accepted the unsolicited bids of
M/s WISL, Mumbai for conversion of
Indian Naval Ship (INS) Sujata as cadet
Training Ship, on the assumption that it
was a merged entity of M/s ABG, Gujarat
to whom Request for proposal (RFP)
was issued. Further, Navy rejected the
bid of M/s WISL in spite of provisions
for consideration of unsolicited bids in
the Defence Procurement Manual and
re-issued the RFP leading to a delay of
18 months in conclusion of contract
and avoidable expenditure of ` 20.80
Crore.

**(Para 3.1)**


-----

 Failure of the Indian Navy to follow the
extant system driven Review Programme
to determine the procurement Quantities
of Roller Steel coupled with the fact
that there was reduction in the holding
of Sea Harrier aircraft, during the last
decade led to the over provisioning
and an avoidable expenditure of `
2.54 Crore. Further, due to imminent
scheduled decommissioning of aircraft
fleet in December 2015, the prospect
of utilisation of this over-provisional
quantity of Roller Steel lying in stocks is
unlikely.

**(Para 3.2)**

 Material Organisation, Mumbai
procured spare from a foreign firm on
Proprietary Article Certificate basis
even though the spares were available
indigenously at a much lesser cost
resulting in extra expenditure of
` 2.43 Crore.

**(Para 3.3)**

 Lack of due diligence by Navy in
consolidating the requirement before
issuing the Request for Proposal (RFP)
led to issue of two separate RFPs for
same type of equipment within eight
months. Further, it did not invoke the
provision of Tolerance clause included
in the RFP that gives the buyer the right
to increase or decrease the quantity of
goods upto 50 per cent at the same price,
before conclusion of the contracts. This
resulted in procurement of the same item
from the same firm at a much higher rate
thus incurring an extra expenditure of `
1.44 Crore.

**(Para 3.6)**


 In violation of the prescribed timeline
under the Arbitration Award, inordinate
delay by the Engineer-in-Chief Branch in
taking up the matter for seeking advice
of the Legal Adviser (Defence) resulted
in an avoidable payment of penal
interest of ` 1.15 Crore. Moreover, a
Project sanctioned in 2003 at a cost of
` 58.77 Crore is still languishing even after
a lapse of 12 years and an expenditure of
` 83.78 Crore.

**(Para 3.7)**

 Material Organisation, Mumbai [MO
(MB)] concluded a contract in May
2009 for purchase of 14 Tachometers at
a cost which was about 15 times higher
than the last Purchase Price of another
contract concluded just two months
before in March, 2009, for purchase
of 24 Tachometers resulting in extra
expenditure of ` 76.44 lakh. Further, in
gross violation of Defence Procurement
Manual, MO (MB) raised the indents for
procurement of Tachometers without
assessing the requirement which led
to 23 Tachometers worth ` 85.74 lakh
lying in stock for the last four years
without any demand.

**(Para 3.8)**

 Acquisition of Inshore Patrol Vessels
(IPVs) for Coast Guard on nomination
basis for timely replacement of
existing 13 IPVs did not fructify due to
procedural delays. Resultantly, eight
of the thirteen IPVs decommissioned
between December 2008 and July 2013
could be replaced after a delay of four
to sixty months, while replacement of
the remaining five IPVs had not been


-----

received, thereby resulting in restricted
operational effectiveness of the Coast
Guard.

**(Para 4.1)**

 Hindustan Shipyard Limited, despite
received funds from Ministry of Defence
(MoD), did not commence the work of


Repair and Refurbishment of Machinery
and Infrastructure due to absence of
orders from MoD. The funds received
were kept in fixed deposits and also
temporarily diverted to meet the working
capital requirements contrary to the
terms of sanction.

_APPENDIX-V_

###### Land Audit Reports for the year 2013-14 in 17 DEO circles


(i) 1,65,504 acres of defence land in 17
DEO Circles were yet to be mutated in
State Revenue Records. PDs DE/ DEOs
are advised to pursue the matter at
appropriate level in State Governments.
MoD/ DGDE should also take up the
matter with Chief Secretaries of the
States.

(ii) In respect of 68 cases of acquisition/
transfer of land, ACR proceedings under
Rule 10 of ACR Rules, 1944 were not
completed. Ministry may either suitably
modify the rules or issue clear directions
to Military authorities and MES to
complete the proceedings.

(iii) Suitable mechanism to ensure
compliance of submission of Annual
certificates regarding correctness of
plans and schedules of Class ‘A’ land
together with report on encroachments
and unauthorized constructions as
prescribed under Rule 13 of CLAR, 1937
or Rule 14 of ACR Rules, 1944 should
be devised.

(iv) After reconciliation of the recorded area
with the surveyed area within targeted
dates, missing boundary pillars should
be erected by submission of proposals
and the work should be execute through
MES.

(v) DEOs must expedite action for renewal
or determination of expired leases on
merit of each case and recover arrears
of revenue, if any, in 396 leases which
have expired.

(vi) The bulk of ex-State Force land in Jammu
Cantt has not been mutated by the State


Government in the name of Ministry
of Defence and a number of structures
have been created on such land. Matter
should be taken up by the Ministry with
the State Government to find a workable
solution.

(vii) In all title suits involving about 600 acres
of defence land, both DEOs and LMAs
should make all out efforts to obtain
documentary proof and establish title in
favour of Government of India.

(viii) As regard use of Defence Land by LMA
for commercial and other purposes,
MoD should issue suitable directions to
the Military Authorities to ensure that
defence land is used for only authorized
purposes and revenue earned is
deposited into Consolidated Fund of
India.

(ix) Proposals for construction of new
buildings for DEO offices cum residences
need to be sanctioned expeditiously,
considering the sensitivities of land
records.

(x) In regard to 7 Wasidari leases in Jammu
Cantt, the proposals should be processed
expeditiously for grant of leases in
Schedule VIII of CLAR, 1937.

(xi) Occupation of land by Army in Ladakh
region, of the State Government or
private land, needs to be regularized
expeditiously by way of acquisition/
requisitioning or hiring.

(xii) DGDE needs to monitor cases of expired/
determination of lease for renewal/
determination, as the case may be.
