### FOREWORD

DEAR READER,

You are holding the eighth edition of the Foreign Intelligence Service’s annual report,
the first I have the honour to present as Director General. At a time when Europe is
witnessing its biggest war since 1945, the thirst for intelligence services’ situation
reports and analyses has grown. We seek to fulfil our role to the best of our ability.

In last year’s report, we wrote that Russia would create the conditions and capabilities
necessary to launch a large-scale military offensive against Ukraine in the second
half of February 2022. Unfortunately, that is what happened.

Russia has so far failed in its war of aggression. It attacked Ukraine with a plan for
a quick coup based on absurd assumptions and a manipulated intelligence picture.
In the first months of the war, the Ukrainians destroyed a significant part of the best
units of the Russian army, which, as the war drags on, has led to Russia’s critical need
for mobilised troops, private military companies and arms from pariah states. The
war strangles the Russian economy and raises the temperature in otherwise apolitical
Russian society. The Russian elite is increasingly discussing whether “the First Person
has gone mad”, but most of them lack the courage to take real steps towards change.
Russia’s stubbornly imperialist stance towards its neighbours persists, and Russians’
fear of mobilisation surpasses their sense of responsibility for the genocide committed

2023. For now, there is still enough fuel to keep the war machine going – Russia will
not run out of cannon fodder, Soviet-era armaments or propaganda-induced imperialism any time soon. However, a quality leap in Russia’s war-fighting capability is very
unlikely. Putin is playing for time, believing that Ukraine and the West will wear out
before Russia. Putin thinks he can “bomb” Ukraine to the negotiating table.

Internally, Russia has become Soviet Union 2.0, drawing inspiration from Stalinist
repression, Khrushchevian sloganeering and Brezhnevian stagnation. Paradoxically,
in Russia today, Putin’s regime is simultaneously the strongest and the weakest it has
ever been. But there seems to be no new Gorbachev, not to mention Yeltsin, on the
horizon. The democratic world should not harbour illusions that post-Putin Russia
will embrace democratic values any time soon.

This year’s report also discusses the course change in Russian foreign policy. Russian
diplomats, led by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, were caught off guard by the war
in Ukraine. Realising that it lacks influence on strategic issues has led the Russian
foreign ministry’s morale to decline. Russia has given up on the West for the foreseeable future and is seeking new friends, mainly in Africa and Asia.

Once again, we will also look at China. Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, who
started his third term and secured absolute power, China is moving towards deepening authoritarianism and confrontation with the West. Russia plays an important role
in China’s global ambitions, and the two countries agree on many points. Therefore,
it would be a mistake to take Xi’s restrained support for Putin’s war in Ukraine as a
sign that China is distancing itself from Russia.

The Foreign Intelligence Service celebrated its 30th anniversary a few months ago.
With our domestic and international partners, we continue to work to ensure that the
Estonian leadership and our allies have the best information on the security situation
and sufficient advance warning. And to ensure that Ukraine wins.

Bravely onward and Sláva Ukrayíni!

Kaupo Rosin
Director General, Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**1.** The Ukrainians’ will to defend, the capabilities of their Armed Forces, and Western
unity in supporting Ukraine surprised the Kremlin. Despite this, Russia’s strategic goal
remains the same: subjugating Ukraine and changing the European security architecture.

**2.** Russia believes that time is on its side. To keep the war machine going, Russia is ready
raise the stakes. Russia seems to believe it can “bomb” Ukraine to the negotiating table.
_Read more in chapter 1.1_

**3.** Russia’s belligerence has significantly increased the security risks for Estonia, and
the large-scale exercise Zapad 23 may further strain the situation in the Baltic Sea
region. Russia still has enough strength to exert credible military pressure in our region.
_Read more in chapter 1.2_

**4.** Russia supports its military efforts in Ukraine by using cyber tools against Ukraine and
the countries that support it. Its activities in cyberspace have not yielded the results Russia
had hoped for, but we must remain vigilant. Read more in chapter 1.3

**5.** The Russian special services officers hide behind various “covers”. A tried-and-tested cover
organisation used abroad is the Russian Orthodox Church, which the Kremlin also operates
as an instrument of influence against Ukraine and the West. Read more in chapters 4, 5

**6.** Belarus has provided logistical and material support to Russia in the war against Ukraine,
but the Belarusian Armed Forces have not yet intervened in the military operations in
Ukraine and do not wish to do so in the future. Read more in chapter 1.4

**7.** Russia is moving towards a total dictatorship. The prospects for the current regime collapsing
and the country democratising are slim despite the problems caused by the war and Western
sanctions. On the contrary, an even more radical faction is rising to the fore in Russia’s
ruling elite. Read more in chapter 3.1

**8.** In foreign policy, Russia has its stakes on creating a geopolitical coalition of authoritarian
regimes opposed to the West who share a mistrust of Western policies and values. Diplomatic
resources are being diverted from the West to other regions. Read more in chapter 2.1

**9.** Russia’s military credibility in former Soviet territories has weakened because Russia has
failed to provide the security guarantees promised within the CSTO framework, and its
Armed Forces have been unsuccessful in Ukraine. In Africa, however, Russia sees its best
opportunities precisely in the field of security. Read more in chapters 2.2, 2.3

**10.** Under Xi Jinping, China is moving towards deepening authoritarianism and no longer
hides its ambition to become a global superpower. China’s efforts to build a community of
like-minded countries opposed to the West under the banner of the Global Security Initiative
– which would also include Russia – undermines Estonia’s security. Read more in chapter 6

#### CHAPTER 1
## RUSSIAN ARMED FORCES AND THE WAR 8 IN UKRAINE


-----

### RUSSIA’S WAR AGAINST UKRAINE

##### Subjugating Ukraine and reshaping European security architecture remains Russia’s strategic objective.

 Russia believes time is on its side in the war as Ukraine and its partners are less prepared to sustain a drawn-out conflict.

 Russia plans to mobilise additional resources to support its military action, continuing the war into 2023.


The invasion of Ukraine, which began in the early hours of 24 February 2022, is a
continuation of Russia’s almost nine-year-old aggression against Ukraine. Russia’s
strategic objective − to subjugate Ukraine and thereby decisively reshape European
security architecture − has not changed over time.

##### Russia is ready to As with the covert invasion of 2014, Russia’s plan to subjugate Ukraine continue raising the in early 2022 was based on false assumptions and biased intelligence: stakes in Ukraine through Ukrainians’ will to defend, the combat capabilities of the Armed further mobilisation or Forces and the widespread Western support for Kyiv were completely expanding terror tactics unexpected for Russia. A lack of alternative courses of action also against the civilian aggravated the situation for the Russian Armed Forces. This was population. probably due to unusually rigid operational security requirements,

which meant the headquarters of some of the units of the Russian
Armed Forces deployed close to the Ukrainian border were unaware of the imminent
invasion and did not prepare appropriate plans for combat support and combat service
support for the invasion. The Russian Armed Forces’ plan to occupy Kyiv, overthrow
the Ukrainian government and take control of the territory proved unfeasible, at least
within the expected timeframe and with the units available.

Since realising the impracticability of the initial course of action, Russia has decisively
adjusted its plans twice to avoid defeat and try to regain the initiative: first, in March
and April 2022, by withdrawing from northern Ukraine and focusing on invading
eastern and southern Ukraine, and second, in September, when Russia announced
mobilisation. Both actions exemplify Russia’s readiness to escalate and, if necessary,
change its plans. Russia is ready to continue raising the stakes in Ukraine through
further mobilisation or expanding terror tactics against the civilian population. Whilst
the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine is unlikely due to international opposition
and low military effectiveness, Russia continues to keep the “nuclear card” on the table
as an instrument of anti-Western leverage to instil fear of war and to dissuade Western

Russia was much more ambitious in
2013-14 than the Kremlin officially
admitted. According to EFIS’ information, Russia planned for the occupation
of 11 Ukrainian regions.

Russia probably plans to deploy its mobilised reserves at

the end of their training in the first half of 2023 in a new offensive.
Despite the losses suffered and problems in producing war materials and new weapon
systems, Russia intends to continue its military action against Ukraine in 2023. To
this end, the Kremlin plans to mobilise additional human and industrial resources to
support the military action, looking for opportunities to source arms and ammunition
from other countries, such as Iran, Belarus and North Korea.


Russia’s strategic objectives remain unchanged despite military defeats; the subjugation
of Ukraine, the erosion of Western unity and the transformation of European security
remain at the core of Russia’s geopolitical ambitions. The Russia-Ukraine war will
continue in 2023, given that Russia has so far lacked sincere interest in peace talks,
as these would not ensure the fulfilment of the Kremlin’s strategic objectives. While
Putin still seems to believe that time will play in Russia’s favour and he will be able to
“bomb” Ukraine to the negotiating table, reality will dawn on the Kremlin sooner or
later. The continued readiness of Western countries to support Ukraine is, therefore,

### RUSSIAN ARMED FORCES NEAR THE ESTONIAN BORDER

##### A military attack against Estonia is unlikely in 2023 because Russia’s military capabilities are engaged in Ukraine. However, in the mid-to- long term, Russia’s belligerence and foreign policy ambitions have significantly increased the security risks for Estonia.

 Mobilisation and large-scale exercises planned by Russia could further strain the security situation in the Baltic Sea region in 2023.


##### From the Baltic states’ perspective, Russia still has enough military capability to exert credible military pressure in our region. The capabilities of the Russian Armed Forces in the immediate vicinity of the Estonian border can be quantitatively reconstituted in up to four years.

The only existential threat to the security of our region, including Estonia’s sovereignty,
stems from Russia. A military attack against Estonia is unlikely in 2023, as the Russian
Armed Forces units based near the Estonian border are engaged in hostilities in Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia’s foreign policy ambitions driven by the Kremlin’s belligerence
and imperialism have significantly increased the security threat. If Russia were diplomatically or militarily successful in Ukraine, it would increase the risk of the Kremlin’s
political and military pressure on the Baltic states in the mid-2020s.

##### If Russia were diplo- From the first day of the war, the 76th Guards Air Assault Division matically or militarily and elements of the 6th Army of the Russian Armed Forces, which successful in Ukraine, it are responsible for covering the Estonian operational direction, have would increase the risk been involved in battles in Ukraine and suffered heavy losses.

and senior officers. The shortage of junior officers has been compensated for by accelerating the graduation process in military schools, which has a negative impact on the
officers’ qualifications. However, there are no quick fixes to make up for the shortage
of senior officers.

The Russian Armed Forces plan to carry out the Zapad 2023 manoeuvres this year.
The term “manoeuvre” is Russian military jargon typically used to describe a largescale strategic exercise, that takes place in more than one strategic direction. In Russia,
the Armed Forces’ annual training cycle culminates with a joint strategic exercise,
which rotates from year to year between the four military districts (e.g., Kavkaz 2020,
Zapad 2021, and Vostok 2022), but these do not always qualify as manoeuvres in terms
of scale. Zapad 2023 is not a regular part of the rotation of strategic exercises, which
should have seen Tsentr 2023 taking place instead. A departure from the expected
training cycle with a large-scale joint strategic exercise in the western strategic direction
at the same time as the military action in Ukraine can be seen as a deterrent and threat
to the West and as an incitement to patriotism among the Russian population.


##### From Estonia’s point of view, it is important to demonstrate NATO’s military readiness to dissuade Russia’s temptation to test the Alliance’s security guarantees.


Russia considers the Baltic states to be the most vulnerable part of
NATO, which would make them a focus of military pressure in the
event of a NATO-Russia conflict. Therefore, Russia is highly likely
to give priority to reconstituting its military capabilities, weakened in
the war in Ukraine, in the immediate vicinity of the Estonian border.
The quantitative reconstitution of these units’ capabilities will take
up to four years. From the Baltic states’ perspective, Russia still has
enough strength to exert credible military pressure in our region.


From Estonia’s point of view, it is important to demonstrate NATO’s
military readiness to dissuade Russia’s temptation to test the Alliance’s security
guarantees. The probability of a military conflict between NATO and Russia would
increase if Russia were to achieve its strategic objectives in Ukraine. Therefore,
Ukraine’s victory in the war against Russia would also improve regional security.

Russian Armed Forces destroy critical
infrastructure and use terror tactics
against the civilian population.

### RUSSIA CONTINUES TO LOOK FOR A WEAK LINK IN UKRAINIAN CYBERSPACE

##### Russia uses cyberattacks to support its general goals in Ukraine: to break Ukrainian resistance, undermine the government’s image and disrupt the functioning of the state. Cyber espionage is likely the biggest threat stemming from cyberspace.

 Russia underestimated the resilience of Ukraine’s cyberspace and the help it receives from Western countries and cybersecurity companies.

 Threats posted on social media and cyberattacks continue as part of the influence operations against countries that actively support Ukraine, including Estonia.


At least since the start of the Russo-Ukrainian war in 2014, Ukraine has been a constant
target of cyberattacks by Russian special services.[1] Attacks intensified immediately
before kinetic warfare began and continued throughout the active phase of the war. Russia
mainly organised cyberattacks as part of influence operations, such as denial-of-service
and defacement attacks and data leaks. One of the goals of these activities is to prevent
the Ukrainian government from sharing information with its citizens, to cause fear and
distrust in the state’s leadership, to weaken society’s resistance and to create information
noise that makes it difficult to distinguish reality from disinformation. After the most
active phase of kinetic warfare, Russia tried to keep the Ukrainian state weak and
organised cyberattacks to disrupt critical services.[2] Low-intensity cyberattacks, mainly
for intelligence purposes, were conducted until Russia again stepped up its aggressive
rhetoric towards Ukraine. In January and February 2022, Russia’s cyberattacks against
Ukraine seemed to be aimed at supporting its general goals: to break the resistance
of the Ukrainian population and create an impression of Russia’s vast superiority, the
hopelessness of the situation for Ukraine and the weakness of the Ukrainian state.

From 13 to 14 January 2022, cyberattackers broke into the websites of Ukrainian
state institutions and made these inaccessible to the public. During the same
period, cyberattackers spread the WhisperKill/WhisperGate malware in Ukrainian
computer networks.[3]

1 At least since 2014, the FSB’s 18th Centre has been directing cyberattacks against Ukraine, including stealing information, https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/sbu-vstanovyla-khakeriv-fsb-yaki-zdiisnyly-ponad-5-tys -kiberatak-na-derzhavni-orhany-ukrainy.
2 In December 2015 and 2016, the GRU carried out cyberattacks on Ukraine’s energy sector, which led to several-hour
power outages in Western Ukraine. In 2017, the GRU organised the NotPetya cyber operation to make Ukrainian government agencies’ data unusable. https://www.wired.com/story/sandworm-kremlin-most-dangerous-hackers

-----

From 15 to 16 February 2022, denial-of-service attacks took place against the
websites of Ukrainian state institutions and banks.[4]

A few hours before the reactivation of kinetic warfare, cyberattacks against Ukraine
suddenly increased even more.

On 23 February 2022, denial-of-service attacks took place against the websites
of Ukrainian state institutions and banks.

From 23 to 25 February 2022, cyberattackers installed several types of malware
in Ukrainian information systems, which can disrupt computer use or make data
on the computer inaccessible. For example, on 23 February, the GRU installed
the destructive HermeticWiper malware in the information systems of Ukrainian
government agencies, the IT sector, and the energy and financial sectors. On
24 February, it conducted a cyberattack on Viasat’s subsidiary KA-SAT by
installing the AcidRain malware in the latter’s information system.[5]

While the West distinguishes between cyberattacks and
influence operations, Russia interprets them as a single
concept – information confrontation (информационное
_противоборство). This Russian Armed Forces’ doctrine_
consists of three main components: exerting informational,
technological and psychological influence on another country,
and protecting Russia itself from such influences.

It is possible that specific cyberattacks against energy, water supply or other similar
critical infrastructure,[6] which would lead to long-term service interruptions, were not
organised early on because Russia expected to achieve its military objectives quicker
and wanted to maintain the support of the local population.

its cyberattacks against Ukraine. These were more frequent during certain periods. For
example, Ukrainian cyber defenders working with cybersecurity companies repeatedly
detected destructive malware over a period of about 30 days from the second half of
March. Cyberattacks started to gain momentum again in the autumn.[7] Cyberattacks
to obtain information have continued.[8] Cyber espionage is likely the biggest threat
stemming from cyberspace. Stolen information can effectively be used as input to
Russian special services’ operations and influence activities.

During the war, Russia has used several destructive malware repeatedly. On
11 October 2022, Microsoft detected the CaddyWiper malware in the critical
infrastructure of the Mykolaiv and Kyiv regions. The cybersecurity company
ESET detected this malware for the first time on 14 March 2022 in the information system of a Ukrainian bank.[9]

On 14 October 2022, Microsoft identified the Prestige ransomware in the information system of Ukrainian and Polish logistics and transport companies.

In 2022, cybersecurity researchers identified at least nine types of destructive malware in
Ukrainian cyberspace that have attempted to disrupt services (ENISA Threat Landscape
2022, p. 25; Recorded Future, 2022). Destructive malware makes a computer unusable by
corrupting programs or data. Ransomware that encrypts data without the possibility of
decrypting, such as Prestige, can be used to the same end. Such an amount of destructive
malware has never been observed anywhere in such a short period of time. This shows that
Russia is capable of quickly developing new malware.

Russian cyberattacks, like the actions of its armed forces, are likely aimed at wearing
down Ukraine’s cyber defenders and then finding the weakest link that would help achieve
Russia’s overall military goal – to wear down Ukraine, damage the international image and
credibility of the Ukrainian leadership, reduce aid from allies, and undermine the society’s
morale. Therefore, a cyberattack need not actually disrupt an information system, as with
each attack, investigators have to spend human and time resources to check whether and
how extensively the information system has been attacked, how to improve defence, etc.

Russia underestimated the resilience of Ukraine’s cyberspace and the help it receives
from Western countries and cybersecurity companies. Despite denial-of-service attacks
on the websites of state institutions to disrupt the flow of information, among other
things, the Ukrainian government has found alternative ways of communication, for
example, using social media. Using Starlink devices also plays an important role in
maintaining civilian and military communications. Cybersecurity companies have been
helping Ukraine defend its cyberspace since 2014. Aid intensified during the full-scale
Russian invasion and, with allied support, was likely instrumental in ensuring the
resilience of Ukraine’s cyberspace. Russia’s influence operations in cyberspace have
not had the expected effect. Ukrainian society remains united and trusts its government
despite threats posted on social media and data leaks.

threaten the cyberspace of countries that support Ukraine, including Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania and Poland. In the active phase of kinetic warfare, they have attempted to
intimidate societies with threats on social media, denial-of-service attacks and data
leaks. Their activities support Russian special services’ influence operations.

From 16 to 17 August 2022, denial-of-service attacks took place on the information
systems of Estonian companies and state institutions.[10] Pro-Russian hacktivists
took responsibility for these cyberattacks and claimed to have attacked 207 targets
in Estonia.[11] In fact, they just copied a list of services where the Smart-ID app can
be used, and actual attacks were not carried out against all these targets.

Russia uses cyberattacks to support its strategic objectives (e.g., causing fear and weakening society’s
resistance to the aggressor, disrupting the functioning of the state, and creating information noise to make
it difficult to distinguish reality from disinformation). The Russo-Ukrainian war confirms that cybersecurity
measures[12] make it possible to withstand cyber espionage, cyber sabotage and influence operations.

### BELARUS AS A FOOTHOLD IN THE UKRAINIAN CONFLICT

##### Contrary to Russia’s wishes, Belarus has not sent its army units to Ukraine.

 By supporting Russia morally, materially and logistically, including by allowing the free use of its territory for manoeuvres and strikes against Ukraine by Russian forces, Belarus hopes to reduce Russian pressure to intervene militarily in the war in Ukraine.

 The Belarusian Army’s direct involvement in the Ukrainian conflict would be a political gesture with no significant strategic impact on the course of the war.


In January and February of 2022, units of Russia’s Eastern Military District arrived on
the territory of Belarus as part of the Union Resolve exercise, which was an unexpected
and unusual step in the context of Russian-Belarusian military cooperation. The largescale Zapad exercise had ended in the autumn of 2021. While units of the Russian 1st
Guards Tank Army have previously been in Belarus as part of the Russian-Belarusian
combined Zapad and Union Shield exercises (they form the Regional Grouping of Forces
with the Belarusian army in times of crisis or war), units of the Eastern Military District
had no previous contact or cooperation experience with the Belarusian Armed Forces.
Also, no one had heard of the Union Resolve exercise.

##### Since the Kyiv operation, All this took place while Russia was massing strike units along the the Russian army has Ukrainian border amidst a general atmosphere of preparing for war. enjoyed complete free- Belarusian representatives promised the exercise posed no threat to dom of action and move- Ukraine and that all Russian units would leave Belarus after its end. ment on the territory of However, the exercise was just a smokescreen – in the early hours of Belarus. 24 February, Russian manoeuvre units entered Ukraine from Belarus

and launched an attack on Kyiv. This probably came as a surprise
even to the Belarusian leadership, as the Kremlin kept Alyaksandr
Lukashenka in the dark about its real plans until the very last moment. The attack on
Kyiv stalled and ended with the retreat of Russian units to Belarus and their relocation
to a new operational area in eastern Ukraine in April. After the Russian manoeuvre

movement on the territory of Belarus. The Gomel region of Belarus, bordering Ukraine,
essentially became a large Russian logistics and supply base during the operation. In
addition, Belarus provided extensive logistical support to Russia: it allowed the use
of its railways and airfields, repaired damaged equipment, treated the wounded, and
supplied fuel and food. At the same time, the export of ammunition from Belarusian
arsenals to Russia began in March and continues even now. In the autumn of 2022,
Belarus also began to supply Russia with T-72 tanks. According to our information,
Russia’s Defence Ministry also demanded that Belarusian experts be sent to Russia to
repair equipment damaged in the war in Ukraine.

Ukraine as of January 2023.

Alongside materiel and logistics, Belarus also supports Russia’s activities in Ukraine
in the public information space. This is an inexpensive way for Lukashenka to demonstrate his loyalty to Vladimir Putin. The Belarusian leader’s speeches contain aggressive anti-Western rhetoric and constantly draw attention to the country’s contribution to
protecting the border of the Union State of Russia and Belarus. The Belarusian media

soldiers is smaller than in the Russian Armed Forces; the training and equipment are
rather poor. Lukashenka cannot be sure that, if sent to Ukraine, his contract soldiers
would not desert or join the Belarusian volunteers fighting on the Ukrainian side.
Announcing a mobilisation in Belarus carries even greater risks for the regime’s
security – those called to arms may turn against Lukashenka.

Putin can put pressure on the Belarusian leadership up to a point, but the collapse
of Lukashenka’s regime would also threaten the Kremlin. Given Russia’s engagement
in Ukraine, Putin is probably not interested in creating political chaos in Belarus.
However, it is possible that Lukashenka will eventually be forced to send troops
into Ukraine if the pressure from the Kremlin becomes too strong to withstand.


##### Putin can put pressure on the Belarusian leader- ship up to a point, but the collapse of Lukashenka’s regime would also threaten the Kremlin.


In October 2022, Russian mobilised troops arrived in Belarus for
training. Lukashenka can present this to the Kremlin as another
contribution to the war effort while avoiding direct involvement.
At the time of compiling this report, the Russian mobilised units in
Belarus do not pose a direct threat to Kyiv; however, their presence
in Belarus forces Ukraine to deploy some of its units to the north,
pulling them away from other fronts.


The use of Russian mobilised units for a new attack on Ukraine from the north would
result in heavy losses for the Russian forces. Their progress would be hindered by the
mobilised troops’ low motivation and training, as well as the Ukrainians’ preparedness
for an attack from the north. The Belarusian army’s involvement in the Ukrainian
conflict would be a political gesture without significant strategic impact on the developments on the ground. However, it would still tie up some of Ukraine’s forces.

### RUSSIAN ADMINISTRATION  IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES OF UKRAINE

##### Russia’s annexation of the occupied territories in October 2022 indicates that it has no intention of voluntarily returning them to Ukraine in the future and is ready for a prolonged confrontation with Ukraine and the West.

 The fake referendums on joining Russia were passed off as the  will of the people remaining in the occupied territories, although the results were known well in advance.


##### The Russian-occupied areas are undergoing severe regression – they are being Russified and stripped of local resources. The new authorities take no interest in local life and people.

In the spring of 2022, Russia captured a large part of the Kherson Oblast and more
than half of the Zaporizhzhia Oblast. With this, Russia secured a land connection with
Crimea and moved closer to the goal of gaining control over the entire northern shore
of the Black Sea. The quickly appointed occupation authorities, either local or sent in
from Russia, began to establish what is known as the “Russian world” (Russkiy mir)
in the conquered territories, destroying everything representing Ukraine. Preparations
started for holding referendums on joining Russia, but this was not considered urgent
in the first half of September.


##### The Russian special services, especially the FSB, play an essential role in establishing and maintaining occupation regimes.


However, the Ukrainians’ successful counteroffensive in the Kharkiv
region in mid-September changed the calculus for the Russians. They
realised the need to quickly incorporate the territories in southern
Ukraine to avoid similar failures repeating. After fake referendums
staged in late September, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts and the
so-called Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics were incorporated
into Russia. Russia did not clearly define the borders of the annexed
regions, probably in a deliberate move to retain some leeway for

The Russian special services, especially the FSB, play an essential role in establishing
and maintaining occupation regimes. FSB officers placed in leadership positions in the
“military-civilian administrations” organise the occupied territories’ integration into
Russia according to Moscow’s instructions. They curate local collaborators and have
a significant say in personnel decisions. In the long term, the plan is to transfer power
to civilian authorities loyal to Moscow, but the problem is the scarcity of suitable and
reliable collaborators and the Kremlin’s distrust of them. Therefore, many positions are
filled with Russians or locals who are completely unknown to the residents.

Operative groups of Russian special services officers are also deployed in the occupied
territories, among other things, to hunt down Ukrainian patriots and agents and gather
intelligence. The same methods were used in the Ukrainian territories that came under
Russian control after 2014 when the Donbas authorities and security agencies were
managed through curators and special services operative groups appointed by Moscow.

The Russians are experiencing difficulties finding officials willing to work in occupied
territories amidst or near hostilities. Personal safety is likely the primary concern.

working in the area fear sanctions. Higher wages than usual are offered to attract people

### ‘REGROUPING’ OF RUSSIAN FOREIGN POLICY

##### The demands Russia presented to NATO and the US on 17 December 2021 indicated its long-term goal of changing the fundamentals of European security. Defeating Ukraine is an essential prerequisite for this.

 Putin is focusing on creating a geopolitical coalition of authoritarian regimes whose common ground is to oppose the West, democracy and the rule of law.

 The invasion of Ukraine ended the Russian foreign ministry’s hopes of playing a meaningful strategic role in the country’s foreign policy planning.


THE WAR IN UKRAINE AND THE EUROPEAN SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

Russia’s full-scale war of conquest in Ukraine, which started in the early morning of
24 February 2022, shook the status quo of European security and is part of Putin’s
broader goal of reshaping the European security architecture.

Putin revealed his real objectives on 17 December 2021 when Russia submitted a draft
security agreement to NATO and the US, listing demands to change the fundamentals
of European security, which also included Ukraine. The most important points were:

**1.** ending NATO’s “open door” policy
**2.** rolling NATO’s military deployment back to the 1997 line

On 24 February 2022, Putin began implementing his objectives with a full-scale military attack against Ukraine. Putin likely sees defeating Ukraine as a prerequisite for
achieving his broader goals. Russia expected to defeat Ukraine in a matter of days.
Things turned out differently because Russia had miscalculated. Russia’s systemic
weaknesses – constant lying and stealing within the state apparatus – painted a false
picture of the situation in Ukraine for the Russian leadership.

The demands presented to NATO and the US indicate Russia’s long-term goal of reshaping
the European security environment into one where NATO would not have a leading role.
With this in mind, the military pre-positioning of NATO allies in Eastern Europe, their
immediate combat readiness, logistics and supply continuity is of utmost importance.

By now, Putin has made it very complicated for Russia to exit the war – from a foreign
policy perspective, by illegally annexing regions of Ukraine, and in domestic policy
terms, by declaring mobilisation in the country. Ukraine’s political and military capit

of attrition, with possible periods of low-intensity military action. In our assessment,
Putin believes that Ukraine’s resilience and Western support will break before Russia
will. Still, in Putin’s opinion, Ukraine has not yet currently suffered enough to reach
breaking point. Part of Putin’s defeat strategy is to systematically damage Ukraine’s
energy infrastructure during winter, and the goal is to destroy it. Continued military
and economic aid from the West to Ukraine is therefore vital to avoid a humanitarian
disaster for the civilian population, prevent new crimes against humanity, and ensure
Ukraine’s survival as a democratic state. European security in the medium term directly
depends on the Ukrainians’ will to determine their own future and Western unity in
supporting Ukraine with all necessary means.


##### Ukraine’s political and military capitulation remains Putin’s objective, and he will go as far as he is allowed to achieve it.


According to our information, Russia is not ready to give up the territories it has occupied. It expects an exhausted Ukraine to sit at the
negotiating table eventually. Once there, Russia expects to be able
to present its conditions and, as a strong negotiator, come out of the
situation on the winning side.

According to our sources, Western unity in imposing sanctions has been an unpleasant
surprise to the Russian leadership. Those under sanctions seek to use their connections
in the West to get off the list, while those threatened with sanctions try to stay off the
list. Russia wants the sanctions to end. The sanctions imposed on Russia are not inconsequential but directly affect Russia’s ability to maintain its war machine and keep its
economy functioning.

REGROUPING OF RUSSIAN FOREIGN POLICY

Russia’s losses in the war with Ukraine and its course for a long-term confrontation with
the West will force Russia to accelerate a reorientation of its foreign policy. Putin is at war
not only with Ukraine but with the entire Western value system as he is convinced that
the future of international relations belongs to authoritarian regimes that divide global
spheres of influence between themselves, including by using military power. According
to the information available to EFIS, Russia is diverting its diplomatic resources from
the West to focus its activities on other parts of the world. Undermining Western unity,

The requirements for men are conservative – a dark blue or
grey suit, with combinations of different jackets and trousers
allowed, but only as long as the colours match. Pockets are purely
decorative and not to be used for hands. Perfume must be used
in moderation; hands and nails must be well groomed. No visible
tattoos or piercings are allowed.

The requirements for women are also conservative but more
detailed. A female employee must have a conservative hairstyle
appropriate for her age and position; longer than shoulder-length
hair must be neatly styled, and dyeing in unnatural shades is
prohibited. Daytime make-up must be understated, foundation must be
applied in moderation, and bright make-up at work is inappropriate.
Excessive mascara is prohibited, and skirt hems must be 5 cm above
or below the knee.

political declarations and economic cooperation to military cooperation. Moderate
success has been achieved – for example, cooperation between Russia and Iran for
the weapons used against Ukraine. Russia will probably succeed in bringing other
countries on board in 2023. Still, the expansion of Russian cooperation is hampered
by the economic ties of the rest of the world with Western countries and their wider
geopolitical and economic interests. Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of the Security
Council of Russia, plays a leading role in expanding Russia’s security political ties, and
he actively travels around Asia and the Middle East for this purpose. Russian officials
and politicians also work daily, both bilaterally and in international organisations, to
undermine the West, fight against Russia’s isolation and sanctions, and expand and
deepen global cooperation.

Putin’s plans to attack Ukraine. According to our information, they
found out about it on the morning of 24 February through the media.
Confusion and bewilderment ensued, with no one having prepared any talking points
in advance. Some decided to switch sides, but the vast majority succumbed to mental
resignation and then acceptance, which in some cases turned into angry outbursts of
patriotism. Russian diplomats’ role in the West is reduced to a monotonous repetition
of propaganda lies. Russian ambassadors, finding themselves in an information blackout, are regularly forced to improvise at international meetings. Since 24 February,
Russian diplomats’ new daily concerns include the anxiety of not knowing whether
they will receive their monthly salary in their bank account or, if not, which colleague
to borrow money from. Considering the shift of Russian foreign policy towards the
Global South, Russia’s diplomacy efforts may gain some new impetus in the near
future but are likely to end in disappointment. In our assessment, the South and East

### A PAPER TIGER IN THE CAUCASUS

##### Moscow and the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) ignored appeals for help from an official ally.

 The credibility of Russia’s military deterrence in former Soviet territory has weakened.

 The reason is the engagement and inefficiency of the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine.


In September 2022, intense fighting broke out in the South Caucasus between Armenia
and Azerbaijan. For almost two days, from 12 to 14 September, the Azerbaijani armed
forces launched indirect fire attacks on targets deep inside Armenian territory, including
towns and small settlements. Meanwhile, Azerbaijani units crossed Armenia’s internationally recognised border and moved several kilometres into the country’s
territory.

##### In the September 2022 Since the late spring of 2021, numerous armed clashes have occurred clashes, Azerbaijan between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But the conflict of September openly attacked Armenian 2022 differed from previous clashes in one important aspect: for the sovereign territory for the first time, Azerbaijan openly attacked Armenian sovereign territory. first time. Both during the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War (from September to

November 2020) and since, Azerbaijan has always denied attacking
targets in Armenia and claimed that its armed forces had not crossed the internationally
recognised state border.

The main reason for Azerbaijan’s caution was most probably Armenia’s strategic alliance with Russia and its CSTO membership. Formed in 2002, the CSTO, in its current
format, is a Russia-led organisation that has been touted for years by Moscow as one
of the main security guarantors on the territory of the former Soviet Union. As a kind
of “NATO of the East”, CSTO security guarantees are triggered if any of its member
states are attacked, which is when the other member states – primarily Russia, of course
– should come to the aid of the victim of the attack.[1]

During the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, Russia and the CSTO rejected Armenia’s
official appeals for help specifically on the grounds that Armenian sovereign territory
had not been attacked – the hostilities took place on Azerbaijan’s internationally recognised territory.

success in its aggression against Ukraine.

Second, the security guarantees offered by Russia bilaterally and within the framework
of the CSTO have proved to be merely declarative. Russia intervenes militarily to
defend its “allies” only when it is in its interest. But not when the alleged allies need
help or when a treaty would require to do so. However, the CSTO has turned out to be
a “paper tiger”: a chatroom, not a serious defence organisation.

These two conclusions have very likely been drawn not only among Armenian leaders

### RUSSIA’S AFRICAN POLICY

##### Increasingly affected by the sanctions imposed by Western countries, Russia has intensified its efforts in Africa to project itself as a geopolitically active great power.

 Russia hopes to achieve rapid diplomatic and economic success with the cheapest possible means; however, in reality, it lacks the capacity to fully implement its plans in Africa.


##### Russia sees itself as having the greatest potential as a provider of security services in Africa and focuses on politically unstable countries that provide Russia with opportunities to profit from local natural resources.

RUSSIA’S AFRICAN EFFORTS

Increasingly affected by the sanctions imposed by Western countries in response to
starting full-scale hostilities in Ukraine, Russia has intensified its efforts in Africa to
project itself as a geopolitically active great power. While Russia’s actions aim to sustain
that image, its increased efforts in Africa are also due to the matter of fact need to
avoid essentially being alone in United Nations votes on matters concerning Russia’s
aggression against Ukraine. In this latter goal, Russia has not succeeded. Nevertheless,
Russia continues to try to reduce Western influence and redefine the balance of power
in Africa. Russia is looking to Africa for a success story, for allies and for support for
its anti-Western activities and narratives. It hopes to achieve quick diplomatic success
in African countries with the cheapest possible means by providing security services
to them to gain control over them and make them dependent on Russia to profit from
the rising opportunities down the line.

##### Russia is looking to Africa Russia’s interest in Africa increased several years before the full- for a success story, for scale military attack on Ukraine. The first Russia-Africa summit in allies and for support for Sochi in 2019 falls into this context. The event received extensive its anti-Western activities media coverage as Russia promised to double its trade with African and narratives. countries in five years. However, since then, the volume of Russian

trade with African countries has decreased from 20 billion US dollars
in 2018 to 17.6 billion dollars in 2021. Russia overestimates its role
and influence and lacks the capacity to implement its plans in Africa fully. Although
Russia’s endeavours were probably somewhat hampered by the coronavirus pandemic
that started at the end of 2019, they are mainly set back due to intense competition.

for Russia and tries to expand its foreign policy levers by developing cooperation with
African countries in multilateral and bilateral formats. Russian representatives in Africa
are looking for opportunities to gain popularity by presenting themselves as a helpful
and reliable partner with friendly rhetoric. According to the information available to
us, Russia plans to expand its network of diplomatic missions in Africa, increase its
diplomatic staff, simplify currency transactions with African countries and diversify
payment methods. To implement these plans more efficiently, Russia plans to expand
its membership in organisations. For example, it has expressed interest in obtaining
observer status in the African Parliamentary Union.

IN ANTICIPATION OF THE NEXT RUSSIA-AFRICA SUMMIT

The next summit between Russia and Africa is planned to occur in Saint Petersburg in
the summer of 2023. Organising the summit has not been without problems, and the
event has been postponed several times. Originally scheduled to take place in 2022 in
Addis Ababa, then in Sochi, and even as a video conference, the summit will finally
take place in Russia, as sanctions make it difficult for the Russian delegation to travel
to Africa. Coordinated by the Russian foreign ministry, the preparations for the summit
were not particularly productive. The organising committee has been working under
the direct authority of President Vladimir Putin to avoid further setbacks, led by his
adviser Yuri Ushakov, since July 2022.

Since the beginning of the full-scale attack on Ukraine, Russia, which intends to treat
food security as a priority topic at the summit, has systematically spread and exploited
false claims about the critical situation of world food security and Western sanctions’
negative impact on it. With the help of this narrative, Russia amplifies the international
community’s fears and props up its proposals for at least a partial lifting of the sanctions.
Accusing the West of damaging Africa with sanctions, the Russian leadership, including
President Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, call on African countries to put
more pressure on Western countries to ease sanctions that inhibit trade (e.g., fertilisers)
and push them to spread rhetoric that suits Russian interests.

Shipments of fertiliser and grain are promised in return and, if necessary, credit to
pay for these. However, according to information available to us, the communication
between Russian representatives, who present themselves as a helpful partner, gives a
more vivid picture of their real attitude towards the representatives of African countries.
If negotiations do not proceed quickly enough, Russian representatives humiliate their
supposed partners, use racist language and complain that “your hair will turn grey or
you might die before you beat a contract out of them”.

RUSSIAN SECURITY COOPERATION FOCUSES ON THE SAHEL,
ESPECIALLY MALI

Competing with Western countries, Russia sees Africa’s greatest potential in the security
sector. Russia focuses on politically unstable countries that need help to guarantee their
security and simultaneously provide Russia with opportunities to profit from local natural
resources. The Sahel is one such region where the security situation is complicated and

forces at a wider regional level, also bringing in civilian staff. Despite
its limited capability, Russia will likely continue to take advantage of
opportunities opening up in Mali and elsewhere in Africa to discredit the activities of
Western countries on the continent. By amplifying the anti-Western narrative, Russia
further tenses up the situation, both in specific African countries and on the continent
as a whole, without offering real solutions or helping to improve the security situation.

WAGNER: AN INSTRUMENT OF RUSSIAN STATE POWER IN AFRICA

Russian private military companies are an increasingly important tool for Russia in
pursuing its geopolitical goals. Among them, Wagner has received the most public
attention. Associated with Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, Wagner has been active
in many different parts of the world, from Venezuela to Ukraine, where the group is
currently actively involved in military operations. Wagner has focused on Africa since
2015. Its presence has been observed in Libya, Madagascar, Mozambique, the Central
African Republic, Sudan and, since 2021, Mali – a country to whose security Estonia
has also directly contributed.

Wagner is a useful geopolitical tool for Russia in two ways. On the one hand, using private military companies allows the Kremlin to pursue its policies without demonstrating
too much official involvement. On the other hand, Wagner’s operations bring economic
opportunities for companies connected to various Russian oligarchs.

Despite the seemingly warm relations
between the foreign ministers, cooperation with Russia and Wagner has not
brought Mali the expected results.

Wagner generally uses the same modus operandi. As the first step, diplomatic and military
cooperation is strengthened between Russia and the target country. This is followed
by agreements on the export of military equipment and, finally, the hiring of Wagner.
Mercenaries often arrive in the country under the guise of military advisers or instructors.
At the same time, a suitable environment is prepared through information operations
discrediting previous security partners and glorifying Russia’s ability to ensure stability
in the country; potential funding sources are mapped, such as mineral deposits.

Wagner mercenaries arrived in Mali at the end of 2021. Wagner’s activities in Mali have
not improved the security situation in the country. On the contrary, terrorist attacks and
violence against civilians have increased, especially in central Mali, where Wagner and
the Malian armed forces have mainly conducted their operations. Wagner’s mercenaries
have been repeatedly accused of human rights violations and crimes against humanity.
In addition, Wagner members have tried to falsify evidence to suggest that French troops
have committed mass murder in Mali. French and other Western troops have left Mali.
This has left a security vacuum, which Wagner has not been able to fill and almost
certainly will fail to fill in the future. The fate of Mali is likely to be the same as the
other African countries where Wagner has arrived to ensure security: the promised
stability will not be achieved, and the situation will only worsen.

will very likely want to continue using private military companies

Ukraine has led Wagner to withdraw its fighters from Libya, the Central African

this way, Russia leaves others to resolve the problems and further deepens instability
in the entire region.

### RUSSIA’S DOMESTIC POLITICAL SITUATION

##### Putin’s regime is rapidly moving towards an open dictatorship. As the country is at war, the last vestiges of democratic government have been abandoned, and any dissent qualifies as a crime.

 In the coming years, the current regime led by Putin, or a slightly modified but equally undemocratic and coercive updated version, will most likely continue to hold power in Russia.

 Russia’s transformation into a stable democracy is unlikely in the coming years.

likely be short-lived, similar to previous such attempts in Russia. It
must be taken into account that the official ideology, which stokes
Soviet nostalgia and neo-imperialist ambitions, obstructing the objective treatment and
reassessment of Soviet history, has left a strong mark on Russian society. At the same
time, society’s expectations and attitudes are largely shaped by a lack of democratic
experience and the negative experience of the 1990s.

In the coming years, the current regime led by Putin, or a slightly modified but equally
undemocratic and coercive updated version, will most likely continue to hold power
in Russia. However, the continuation of a Putinist regime will not guarantee domestic
political stability – internal tensions will inevitably intensify, and the power struggle
among the Russian elite will deepen in the near future. Putin’s age is one factor driving

war against Ukraine. The prospect of losing the war prompts those in power to look
for scapegoats in their ranks to point fingers and save their own skin. A sudden power
transition in Russia is possible in case a military defeat in Ukraine becomes inevitable
– the likelihood of this scenario, however, is very low.

The economic situation, which is becoming more and more complicated due to sanctions, and the mobilisation, which has received a largely negative response among
the population, aggravate the situation on the home front. The country’s economic
resources are shrinking, and the struggle between different interest groups for funds
redistributed from the state budget is intensifying. Those who have proven themselves
to the Kremlin as efficient and loyal managers and are better at divining the leader’s
intentions have been more successful in this struggle.

ATTEMPTS TO CREATE A NEW

Putin’s regime is rapidly moving towards an open dictatorship.
As the country is at war, the last vestiges of democratic
government have been abandoned and any dissent qualifies
as a crime. At the same time, the Kremlin has realised
that the lies used to justify the war in Ukraine rest on
shaky foundations and it is very difficult to explain the
increasingly radical methods to the Russian public. Although
laws have been passed to ensure that “true” information
is issued from a single state-controlled source, it is
unrealistic to impose a complete information blockade on the
population in today’s world. The Kremlin launches propaganda
campaigns, clearly modelled on those used in the Soviet Union,
to justify the war and deepening dictatorship. Starting from
September 2022, a mandatory patriotic education programme,
known as “Conversations About What Is Important”, has been
launched at all levels of education in Russian schools. The
purpose, according to the brief, is “to develop students’
understanding of Russian history, traditional patriotic
values and their duties as citizens of a united, multi-ethnic
country”. But this is just the beginning. The Kremlin has
announced that in 2023 a new special ideological course,
“Foundations of Russian Statehood”, will be launched in
universities, curated by the Presidential Administration’s
domestic policy directorate. According to the Russian media,
the course materials are prepared by well-known anti-Western
and nationalist conservative researchers and lecturers who
are extremely loyal to Putin. The main goal is to explain
Russia’s special development path and historical mission in
establishing a new “multipolar world order”.

THE RISE OF RADICALS

Russia’s elite seems to be no stranger to the idea that the increasingly irremediable situation could be resolved by a “rebranding” of the regime, presenting a liberalised system
domestically and internationally after making certain changes. However, this could
only work at the price of replacing Putin, even if any other changes are insignificant.
Given the threat of such scenarios, it is crucial from a Western perspective to clearly

some previously more moderate members of the elite have started to stand out with
rather extreme statements. Their behaviour may be a sign of panic; they may have
realised that the war in Ukraine was a huge mistake that can no longer be corrected,
and the only way forward is to struggle on, using increasingly radical methods. It is
also possible that allowing the radicals to take centre stage is part of Putin’s tactics to
show that his disappearance would bring an even more extreme group to the helm.

##### Currently, an even more The fear of the regime’s image change scenario is a possible reason radical faction is rising to why Putin relies more and more on radicals like Yevgeny Prigozhin and the fore in Russia’s ruling Ramzan Kadyrov. The reputation of these people (unlike several other elite. members of the Russian ruling elite) would not allow them to be in a

leadership role in a regime projecting itself as more liberal. The same
kind of reasoning can motivate Putin to arrange for power figures with
a previously moderate image to completely discredit themselves with radical statements.

But even if the radicals’ rise to dominance in the ruling elite is part of Putin’s calculus,
it will still have consequences for the regime’s present and future. At some point, Putin
himself may have difficulty taming people increasingly emboldened by their growing
influence, especially if Putin has authorised them to settle scores with their opponents.
Prigozhin and Kadyrov are particularly dangerous in this context because each of them
essentially has their own private army, from which their usefulness to the Kremlin and
an important part of their influence derive.

RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA AND
KEY AUTHORITIES

Making political decisions in today’s Russia is more than ever concentrated in the
hands of one person and is, therefore, even more difficult to predict. Decisions made
by an ageing autocrat, only considering expert opinions based on personal whims and

continues to be centred in the Presidential Administration (PA), whose curating role is
even broader in reality than the legal framework stipulates. The PA’s top leadership has
remained unchanged for years. The chief of staff, Anton Vaino, has apparently proven
himself to Putin as a thoroughly loyal and highly efficient administrator. But Putin
probably also appreciates Vaino’s lack of charm and his ability to stay in the background,
so the master of the Kremlin has no reason to fear Vaino might make a play for his chair
should favourable circumstances arise. Sergey Kiriyenko, the first deputy chief of staff
of the PA responsible for domestic policy, who in 2022 was also entrusted with the civil
administration in the occupied territories of Ukraine, is another member of the leadership
who has retained the favour of the president. Remarkably, Kiriyenko, who first became
known in Russia as a liberal in the 1990s, has taken the regime’s increasingly rough
politics in stride and seemingly has no scruples about supporting it wholeheartedly..

On the other hand, the Security Council of the Russian Federation (SC) has lost some
of its previous influence. Although there are still people in the SC whose views have
weight in Putin’s eyes, their importance and position in the power hierarchy derive
primarily from personal ties with Putin (and the current status of such ties) rather than
SC membership. The SC’s devalued role was evident at a public session just before the
invasion of Ukraine, where Putin, probably quite intentionally, demonstrated that the SC
was no longer a serious venue for discussion and decision-making. Rather, the SC has
developed into an institution where important decisions previously made in a narrower
circle are only formalised, thereby shifting the responsibility for what is happening to
the entire political leadership.

### THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY

##### Oil exports and the high price of oil in 2022 have helped Russia withstand the pressure of sanctions. However, in 2023 the sanctions imposed on Russia’s oil exports will begin to have an effect. This will lead to a decrease in Russia’s oil revenue.

 The self-imposed sanctions by international businesses, such as leaving Russia, have hit the Russian economy faster than the sanctions imposed by national regulations.

 Russia is exploiting the issue of food security to promote the narrative of peace at any price in Ukraine.


From time to time, Western media reports on the state of the Russian economy, citing
a slight recession and rather modest inflation. These reports tend to rely uncritically
on the estimates of the Bank of Russia or Russia’s finance ministry. The sources of
these estimates are classified, which makes these forecasts essentially nothing more
than propaganda. Making economic assessments is complicated by the fact that due to
sanctions, Russia’s imports slowed down in the second quarter of 2022, while export
volumes were maintained for some time; the combined effect of these two factors has
led to a strengthening of the rouble’s exchange rate. A paradoxical process occurred
when artificial restrictions and measures were combined – the currency gained value
while the economy was in recession. Therefore, the macro indicators of the Russian
economy should be taken with a grain of salt.

SANCTIONS

Russia’s kinetic war in Ukraine, launched on 24 February 2022, has significantly
changed the sanctions against Russia. The previous principle of sanctioning specific


-----

y, p p y
by major banks (or what is known as “exclusion from SWIFT”), a restriction on the
purchase of petroleum products and the freezing of foreign reserves are a set of tools
with a very strong impact.

Countries that have imposed sanctions against Russia
constitute over 60% of the world’s economy.

As another important variable, the self-imposed sanctions by international businesses,
meaning the avoidance of business with Russia without express legal regulation, have
also begun to have an effect. Public opinion has been largely shaped by Ukraine’s interpretation of the events, which has been corroborated by the information disclosed by
Western intelligence services about Russian attack plans. By the time Russia attacked,
Western consumers had a well-developed understanding of who the victim and the
aggressor were, that what was happening was a war and not an “operation”, and that
Ukrainians were fighting for their freedom rather than undergoing an anti-fascist
clean-up. The influence of Western consumer sentiment and the realisation of the
decline of Russia’s business environment has forced businesses to leave, and the
consequences of their departure have hit the Russian economy faster than the sanctions
imposed by national regulations.

The countries that have imposed sanctions on Russia (EU member states, US, UK,
Canada, Australia, Norway, etc.) account for more than half of Russia’s current exports
and about 60% of the world economy, oil consumption and the global defence budget.

p g g, p y g
consists of many relatively small economies. Although Russian rhetoric strongly
addresses the subject of “new markets”, no plausible solutions exist for continuing
Russia’s foreign trade as it was before. The impact of international isolation is deepening, and even in relations with China and India, which are presented as a way out,
Russian businesses are being cynically exploited.

The scope of sanctions has changed, and the current modus operandi for avoiding
sanctions, which is essentially based on illicit trade, is no longer sufficient, as the
number and quantities of goods that need to be hidden have increased. An industrial
economy cannot be kept going with ad hoc supply chains and improvised solutions.

FOOD SECURITY AS PART OF AN
ANTI-SANCTIONS CAMPAIGN

The war closed the shipping routes out of Ukraine. Before the war, Ukraine was
a major grain exporter, supplying corn and wheat mainly to Mediterranean and
Middle East countries. Marine transport allows for the cheap and fast export of
large quantities of grain (up to 100,000 tonnes per vessel, compared with 60 tonnes
in a rail wagon). Ukrainian ports – Odesa, Chornomorsk and Mykolaiv – had the
modern infrastructure for receiving grain from rail wagons and quickly transferring
the cargo to ships.

Within a few months of the start of the war and the imposition of sanctions, alarming
opinions began to spread in the world media, stating that because grain was held up
in Ukrainian warehouses due to blocked shipping routes, African and Asian countries
would soon starve. Parallels were repeatedly drawn with the Arab Spring riots, which
were also allegedly sparked by high grain prices. It is true that the prices of grain, as
well as many other commodities, rose sharply after Russia invaded Ukraine, but the
world market prices of grain did not remain at the peak level reached at the beginning
of the war.

##### Russia attempted to take It should be noted that Russia attempted to take advantage of the advantage of the public public concern about food security and to maximise the spread of concern about food an exaggerated narrative about a food shortage. On the one hand, security and to spread Russia wanted to use this topic to influence the international com- an exaggerated narrative munity. This was probably done in the hope that the prospect of about a food shortage. the global socioeconomic effects of a drawn-out conflict would

push the West to support peace at any price in Ukraine, prioritising
a speedy ending of hostilities over achieving a just and sustainable peace from
Ukraine’s point of view.

On the other hand, Russia attempted to use food security-related fears to criticise
and undermine the sanctions policy. For example, according to the Russian narrative,
to compensate for the undelivered grain, EU sanctions on Russian food products
and fertilisers, which allegedly would have saved the lives of hundreds of millions
of people in developing countries, would have to be removed. Russian diplomats,
Western-oriented propaganda channels and several current and former politicians
with good connections in EU institutions worked to amplify this narrative. In doing

these goods to third countries without using EU ports. However, personal sanctions
are in place against several oligarchs involved in fertiliser production with close
ties to the Kremlin’s power circles, whose profits and lifestyle suffer significantly
from the sanctions. The dramatic interviews with them in Western media channels
confirm this.

In cynically exploiting the issue of food security, the Kremlin did not limit itself to
the above activities. Advancing its interests by exploiting a vital concern for many of
the world’s poorest countries and by inciting fear, Russia tried to present itself as an
advocate for these countries, which are the most vulnerable in the event of a global
food shortage.

### COVERS USED BY RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES

##### Russian intelligence services widely use covers to hide  the connections between intelligence operatives and their real  employer – the intelligence service.

 On Russian territory, intelligence services can use almost any institution, company, or organisation as cover.

 Anyone communicating with Russian federal or regional authorities, research institutions, or strategic companies should remember that their international relations, especially with Western countries, are largely controlled by Russian intelligence services.


COVERS IN INTELLIGENCE

A cover (Russian прикрытие) is used to obscure the true identity of a person or
organisation and hide their affiliation with an intelligence agency.

The most common type of cover used by officers of the Russian intelligence services
operating abroad is a diplomatic position in an official Russian mission: an embassy,
consulate, or trade mission. The Vienna Convention protects intelligence officers
operating under diplomatic cover. If caught, they are declared persona non grata in
the host country and sent back to their home country.

In addition to “diplomats,” operatives active abroad also include “illegals” who may pose
as citizens of Russia or another country and work under an assumed identity, for example,
in business, research, journalism, or the arts. “Illegals” are not protected by international
conventions and can be arrested and prosecuted in the host country if discovered.

In addition to diplomats and illegals working abroad, whose activities have been
reported quite often in the international media, all three Russian intelligence services
– the internal security service FSB, the foreign intelligence service SVR and the military intelligence service GRU – also use undercover intelligence officers on Russian
territory. This chapter is about these officers.

COVERS USED BY RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ON
RUSSIAN TERRITORY


##### The FSB, SVR, and GRU regularly use covers for intelligence activities carried out on Russian


As one of the pillars of the current regime, Russian intelligence services enjoy extensive support from the authorities and considerable
freedom of action. The FSB, SVR, and GRU can use almost any state
authority, company, or organisation as a cover when necessary. As a

g g g g p y
(governance, research, business, journalism, etc.) and has one or more positions staffed by
intelligence services officers. Most undercover officers work in such positions and, to avoid
exposure, must at least partly perform the tasks that would normally be prescribed for their job.

**2.** An entire organisation is established as a cover for an intelligence service. It does not
pursue the activities listed in its articles of association or only does so to a minimal extent
to avoid suspicion. Since such organisations are largely fictitious, the officers working
there can fully focus on intelligence activities.

The Russian intelligence services have a broad scope of activities – they collect intelligence information but also engage in counterintelligence and fight economic crimes,
terrorism, extremism, domestic democratic opposition, drug trafficking, etc. Thus, they
also use very different cover organisations and positions. The covers described here
have a common denominator – they can all be used to establish contact with foreigners.

Russian intelligence officers work undercover in Moscow and elsewhere in Russia;
their number depends on the region and how many foreigners visit it. For example, up
to half of the officers of the FSB intelligence units can work undercover at any given
time, spending a large part of their working time outside the FSB and visiting the agency
only episodically to report back and receive instructions. A cover can be permanent
or temporary. An officer working under temporary cover will pose as an employee of
an organisation for a short time to carry out a specific task, for example, attending an
international conference as a member of a think tank or research institution.

On paper, the identity of intelligence officers should be secret. Still, in many cases, the
other employees of the cover organisation can identify them because they just show up
with an unknown educational and professional background and have different work duties
than the rest of the staff. Intelligence officers are also often discovered when a cover
position within an organisation is used continuously, regularly rotating officers in and out.

EXAMPLES OF UNDERCOVER WORK

The covers described here are used by undercover intelligence officers who are responsible for recruiting foreigners.

The FSB often uses the Federal Migration Service (FMS) as a cover. This provides a legal opportunity and a plausible pretext to communicate with foreigners arriving and staying in Russia
and ask them questions about themselves, their families, and the purpose of their visit to Russia.

Intelligence officers also hold positions in federal institutions that coordinate cooperation
with so-called Russian compatriots living abroad. Russian compatriots are under heightened
scrutiny by the FSB’s main intelligence unit, the Department for Operational Information
(DOI) of the Fifth Service. This scrutiny is characterised, among other things, by the fact
that the government committee for Russian compatriots living abroad – the body that coordinates the handling of compatriot-related issues in the state institutions – has always included
a DOI senior officer, most recently General Dmitry Milyutin, the deputy head of the DOI.
What does the FSB have to do with Russian compatriots, and why should an intelligence
unit curate this field within the FSB? The answer is obvious: the FSB needs Russian com

glorifying Russia and discrediting their current homeland and other Western countries.[1]
Effectively, the DOI coordinates the preservation and renewal of a fifth column, especially
in countries bordering Russia with a large Russian-speaking community.


##### Russian intelligence services play an integral role in developing and implementing Russian foreign policy in the Baltics, including policies pertaining to so-called Russian compatriots.


The Federal Agency for the Commonwealth of Independent States Affairs,
Compatriots Living Abroad, and International Humanitarian Cooperation
(Rossotrudnichestvo) and its representatives abroad – Russian research
and cultural centres – are regularly used by the FSB and SVR as cover for
their officers. FSB officers “work” at the Moscow House of Compatriots
(Moskovskii Dom Sootechestvennikov) of the Government of Moscow. In
the Presidential Administration of Russia, the country’s most important
domestic and foreign policy body, Russia’s Baltic policy has long been
made under the supervision of SVR and FSB officers working undercover.


All three intelligence services use the international cooperation departments of Russia’s
central and regional authorities (incl. city and oblast governments) as cover for their intelligence officers. However, the intelligence services also use trustees working there to gather
information about the authorities’ foreign contacts and international cooperation projects.
We can say that the intelligence services largely control the international cooperation of
Russian federal and regional authorities.

Spot the spies! On 16-19 November
2022, the 10th forum for so-called
Russian compatriots living in the
Baltic states was held in Roshchino,
Leningrad Oblast. The forum participants included several individuals
with ties to the Russian intelligence
services; however, they all represented some other institution or
organisation.

Intelligence officers often work undercover at universities and research institutions, usually
in the institution’s management or international relations unit, in positions allowing them
to keep up with the institution’s international contacts, including being informed about
students and delegations arriving from abroad. They also recruit researchers travelling
abroad to carry out intelligence tasks, such as participating in conferences and research
projects to establish contacts with foreign researchers or gathering research and technology-related information, including stealing scientific discoveries. Officers of the Russian
intelligence services work undercover in the Russian Academy of Sciences and major
universities both in Moscow and elsewhere in Russia.

As “employees” of public and private think tanks and “research institutes,” intelligence
officers can participate in conferences and seminars attended by foreigners. In addition

spread views aligned with Russia’s political interests through the think
tank’s publications and personal communication with foreign guests. In
other words, they conduct influence operations.[2] Here are some examples:

The Institute of Diaspora and Integration (Institute of CIS Countries)[3],
founded in 1996 and headed by Konstantin Zatulin, a member of
the Russian State Duma, studies Russia’s “near abroad” (which also
includes the Baltic countries) and spreads views justifying Russia’s
aggressive foreign policy. The institute has long had close ties with the
FSB and especially the DOI, whose officers have regularly served as
aides or advisers to Zatulin. Among them is Valery Solokha, described
by the Dossier Center in October 2022 as the head of the DOI’s subunit for Moldova.4 Solokha was succeeded as Zatulin’s aide by DOI
officer Maxim Sapunov, who previously held posts in the Government
of Moscow and the Moscow House of Compatriots. Another aide

DOI officer has regularly staffed the position of vice president of the foundation.


The Russian Institute for Strategic Studies (RISI)[6] operated under the SVR until
2009 and was designated as Military Unit 61360. Although it has since been officially
subordinated to the Presidential Administration, RISI has always been led by former
high-ranking SVR officers, currently by former SVR director Mikhail Fradkov. Among
RISI employees, including the director’s team, are SVR officers participating in the
institute’s foreign communication and international cooperation projects. An example
is a conference on the relations between the Eurasian Economic Union and China’s Belt
and Road Initiative, held in Moscow in April 2021 with the participation of SVR officers.

In our public threat assessment in 2021, we described the organisations established
by the GRU for intelligence and influence activities, including the Russian Foreign
Institute and the Inforos information agency.

The FSB and SVR also use the organisations of Russian industrialists and entrepreneurs
as well as industrial and financial companies’ foreign relations departments as cover. This
provides Russian businessmen with international business contacts and allows them to
spread the message about the importance of good relations with Russia and the necessity
of “separating business and politics.” of “separating business and politics.”

2 In Soviet terminology, influence operations involved influencing key figures and ordinary citizens in other countries in the
interest of the Soviet Union. Similar to their Soviet predecessors, Russian intelligence agencies consider influence operations as equally important with intelligence gathering.

### THE RUSSIAN SPECIAL SERVICES’ SUPPORT TO PRESIDENT PUTIN

##### During the war in Ukraine, the Russian special services have deliberated and concocted messages to help explain Russia’s actions to its citizens and show the president in a favourable light.

 The messages justify Putin’s actions in Ukraine and create an image of him as an astute leader with foresight but, at the same time, lack objectivity and context and are often subject to public ridicule.


##### The prevailing view in the Russian special services is that by persistently lying and feeding conspiracy theories, sometimes hinting at the involvement of special services to add mystery, they can continue to speak to a certain segment of society.

The war in Ukraine has put the Russian special services in an unprecedented situation.
The problems they need to address now include the sentiment of Russian citizens. At the
same time, they also want to express their loyalty to the country’s leadership and President
Putin. There was a tense period at the beginning of the war as it became clear that a surprise
attack would not succeed. Tensions rose again when a partial mobilisation was announced
in September, just a few weeks before the president’s 70th birthday..


##### The intended effect was to convince the audi- ence of Russia’s contin- ued great military and economic capabilities and good intentions toward its own people and the Ukrainians.


In September 2022, the Russian special services were still busy
gathering ideas for updating the material used to celebrate President
Putin’s services to Russia. The material includes old talking points
praising Putin, previously used in the 2018 presidential election
campaign, which have become a laughingstock in the media as they
repeat the existing narrative based on questionable statements and
outright lies. The intended effect was to convince the audience of
Russia’s continued great military and economic capabilities and good
intentions toward its own people and the Ukrainians.


Here are a couple of examples of the outrageous and unoriginal statements that served
as the starting point for the special services’ brainstorming:

**1. During his rule, Putin has increased Russia’s GDP 12-fold.**

importance.

In 2022, the special services continued to feed the target group with primitive and
hackneyed tropes that frame the president’s unpopular decisions as a cunning tactic
against opposing countries. Let’s look at some of the new ideas added during the year:

**1.** Russia is the world’s largest supplier of titanium and palladium, thanks to which the
Russians can do without Western cars and planes.
**2.** Russia imposed a flight ban over its airspace in response to the West’s similar actions,
which is why Western countries must spend significantly more time and money to fly
to Asia.
**3.** Russia’s special operation is destroying laboratories in Ukraine where the United States,
Germany, and France developed biological weapons.
**4.** With the mutual closure of media channels, the West ruined its opportunities to influence
the Russian audience.
**5.** The Western countries’ continued solidarity and support for Ukraine are driven by the
desire to subjugate Ukraine to gain access to its grain, mineral resources, and cheap labour.

Russian special services’ eagerness to invent propaganda points and disseminate them
to the public often overstretches their capabilities.

#### CHAPTER 5
## RUSSIAN INFLUENCE 54


-----

### THE CANDLE OF THE ‘RUSSIAN WORLD’ IS BURNING OUT

##### The Kremlin uses the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) as an outpost of its struggle against Ukraine and the West.

 The Russian special services are trying at all costs to preserve  the structures of the ROC as a tried-and-tested cover in foreign countries.

 Russian terror in Ukraine irreversibly damages the position and international influence of the ROC.


In our 2019 public threat assessment, we said that in the event of Russian aggression, the Russian Orthodox Church, one of the Kremlin’s long-standing tools of
influence, would not show solidarity with the victim of the attack but would side
with the Kremlin. The support of the ROC leadership for Russia’s military activities
in Ukraine clearly demonstrates this in word and deed. In his increasingly crude
anti-Ukrainian and anti-Western appeals, Patriarch Kirill (secular name Vladimir
Gundyayev) expresses the church and state leaders’ understanding of the “symphony”
of the church and the state. In what follows, we will look at how the Kremlin and the
Russian special services continue to use the networks of the ROC, which seeks to
establish itself as the only orthodox church in the former territories of the Russian
Empire and the Soviet Union.

Since the 1990s, the Russian special services have been using the more radical
pro-Kremlin clergy and church members with links to Soviet and Russian special
services to undermine Ukraine’s statehood. In line with Russia’s divisive policy and
following in the footsteps of tsarist Russification policy, the Moscow Patriarchate,
which established itself in Ukraine in the 17th century (and in Estonia and Latvia
in the 18th century) in the wake of a Russian invasion, seeks to present itself as the
“mother church” of Ukrainians. It claims to have the exclusive right to unite Russians,


-----

, p g g
with other Russian propaganda channels, branches of the ROC spread anti-Ukraine
propaganda in both sermons and propaganda publications in 2022, right before Russia’s
full-scale invasion. For example, in January, when the Kremlin needed anti-Ukraine
hysteria to create a suitable backdrop for the upcoming military attack, the Estonian
Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (EOC-MP) published a special issue of
its magazine Pravoslavnyi Sobesednik that contained slander and false claims against
Ukraine and Estonia.

Clergy members recruited by or collaborating with the Russian special services have
been tasked with gathering information about the moods in Ukraine, key individuals,
and the location and composition of Ukrainian military units. For example, the Russian
special services were particularly interested in the information collected by the ROC
army chaplains, in violation of the seal of confession, about the health and morale of
Ukrainian soldiers. By now, Ukraine has blocked the access of the ROC clergy to the
Armed Forces of Ukraine.

ROC’s public support for the war in
Ukraine accelerates the disintegration
of its remaining network in Ukraine.

Russian special services and the trustees of Russian extremists in ROC congregations
provided logistical support to Russia. For example, they prepared accommodation and
weapons caches for Russian units and stored propaganda materials in congregation
houses and convents.

##### Clergy members have Simultaneously with the Russian attack, ROC representatives curated been tasked with gather- by the Russian special services were activated. They incited anti- ing information about the Ukrainian sentiments and supported the occupants near the frontline moods in Ukraine. and in Russian-controlled areas. In Ukrainian-controlled territory,

pro-Russian clergy often engaged in “silent resistance”, cautiously
justifying Russia’s motives among their congregations and ambiguously passing judgement on the “fratricidal war”.

ROC helped formalise the annexation of Ukrainian territory. While in 2014, Kirill,
then also the patriarch of the Ukrainians, preferred to keep a low profile during the
annexation of Crimea, fearing damage to the position of the Ukrainian branch of the
ROC (estimated at 50 per cent of ROC congregations) after the full-scale invasion in
2022, the ROC leadership helped prepare and even anticipated the formal annexation
of four regions of Ukraine by Russia. In June 2022, the Holy Synod of the Moscow
Patriarchate decided to separate the territories of Crimea, Donetsk and Horlivka from its
formally independent Ukrainian branch (without asking for these regions’ consent) and
subordinate them directly to the Moscow Patriarchate. ROC representatives participated
in the ceremony to declare the territories usurped from Ukraine as part of Russia in the
Kremlin on 30 September 2022. The ROC can apply a similar divide-and-rule policy
elsewhere if Russian aggression creates favourable conditions for this.

Russia’s large-scale terror in Ukraine, which also destroys the ROC’s Ukrainian
congregations and church buildings, accelerates the disintegration of the remaining ROC network in Ukraine. Disagreements between the Putin-worshipping ROC
establishment and its foreign branches have intensified. Russia’s war against Kyiv, the
cradle of Eastern Slavic Orthodoxy, with the help of Iranian drones and Kadyrovites
preaching “Russian Jihad”, is also causing increasing resentment among the ROC
congregations in Russia, where hundreds of courageous clergy have publicly expressed
their opposition on ethical grounds. All this puts the leaders of the ROC branches,
especially those in the West, in a difficult situation: they need to remain obedient to
their spiritual leader, the Kremlin puppet Patriarch Kirill, while also maintaining
normal relations with the host country, which disapproves of the Russian leadership.

The leadership of the Moscow Patriarchate and its curators in the Russian government
structures are aware of the ROC’s difficulties abroad, especially since the Kremlin
itself is undermining the position of the leaders of the ROC and its branches.
Maintaining the position of the ROC in foreign countries is crucial to the long-term
interests of the Russian special services, which is why the leaders of the ROC branches
have been given the liberty to pretend to be a loyal local religious organisation and,
if necessary, even criticise the positions of the Kremlin or ROC leadership, or simply
criticise the war without clearly pointing out who is responsible. In this way, Russia
seeks to create the impression that the local ROC branches are independent, diverting
attention away from the fact that they are curated by Russia, which has become a

The security threat posed by the symbiosis of the Russian special

services and the ROC has already called into question the future of
the ROC in Latvia, where the Orthodox Church is moving towards
independence, and in Lithuania.

However, Russia is trying to prevent the disintegration of the ROC’s international
network at all costs. In June 2022, Metropolitan Hilarion (Grigory Alfeyev), the head
of the Department for External Church Relations of the Moscow Patriarchate, or the
“foreign minister of the ROC”, was retired, accused of numerous failures, especially his
inability to prevent the independence and strengthening of the autocephalous Ukrainian
Orthodox Church. Metropolitan Anthony (Anton Sevryuk), a former private secretary
to Patriarch Kirill, who has experience in influence operations against the West, was
appointed as the new head of the department, which has a tradition of operating as a
cover for Soviet and Russian special services. Anthony’s task is to save what he can of
the ROC’s damaged reputation in the international arena, where he tries to continue to
promote the Russian regime of terror and the ROC as a bastion of “traditional values”.
However, it is increasingly difficult to find “useful idiots” in the West who would want
to cooperate with the ROC or line up to defend it. Like other instruments of Russia’s
influence operations, the ROC is on the brink of an inevitably deepening crisis.

#### CHAPTER 6
## CHINA 60


-----

### CHINA’S GLOBAL EMBRACE

##### The absolute power achieved by Xi Jinping at the Communist Party Congress set the tone for China’s development over the next 100 years.

 Chinese intelligence services plan to use the Global Security Initiative to disrupt the Western security architecture.

 Xi Jinping’s pledge to open China up to the world means an even more vigorous implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative.


In 2022, Xi Jinping’s confirmation for a third term as general secretary of the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) was a landmark event in China’s development, which Xi
said will usher in the next 100 years of development in China. Xi loyalists hold an
unprecedented majority in the new seven-member Standing Committee.

Health permitting, Xi Jinping is very likely to stay in office for a fourth term, continuing
to lead the party, the military and the country beyond 2027, as the 20th Congress’s
reshuffle of the CCP leadership does not clearly point to a successor for Xi Jinping.
Twenty years in power, however, would exacerbate tensions within the party and the
possibility of a replay of the events of the 1970s, when Mao Zedong’s autocracy completely paralysed the party and state leadership, the economy collapsed, and infighting
within the party was rife.

During Xi Jinping’s third term over the next five years, authoritarianism will likely
deepen, and relations with the West will likely continue to deteriorate. Although a
marginal part of the overall proceedings, the foreign policy section of the 20th Party
Congress was very telling. The wording and context of the congressional report make it
very clear that China’s goal for the coming years is to build a strong community of likeminded countries opposed to the West, in line with the Cold War bloc mentality. Based
on the report, China will focus particularly on developing countries and organisations
such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).

China’s rhetoric and worldview have clearly changed. Whereas China previously pre

hides its ambition of becoming a global superpower. At the same time, China has begun
to push a vision of universal rights for humanity, constructing what the CCP’s rhetoric
paints as a new, more just and practicable concept of human rights. In the past, China
was a firm denier of universal human rights, claiming the concept was merely a Western
instrument for interfering in other countries’ domestic affairs.

China’s goal is to undermine and
reshape the Western security architecture through the Global Security
initiative.

A major new cooperation initiative in 2022 was the Global Security Initiative (GSI),
unveiled by Xi Jinping in April 2022. Chinese intelligence believes that the accession of
a critical number of countries (with a focus on developing countries) to the GSI would
effectively disrupt the Western security architecture. Throughout 2021, China kept
talking at a very high level about the need to reshape the European security architecture
considering Russia’s interests. According to Chinese vice foreign minister Le Yucheng,
NATO should be consigned to the ash heap of history. Such systematic and calculated
efforts by China also undermine Estonia’s security.


##### China’s rhetoric and worldview have clearly changed. Previously China presented itself as a great power with regional ambitions – now China no longer hides its ambi- tion of becoming a global superpower.


In addition to a political dimension, China’s “global embrace” naturally also involves technological integration, trade and scientific
cooperation in building an autonomous microcosm with like-minded
states. At the CCP’s 20th Congress, Xi Jinping stressed China’s goal
of even greater openness and becoming a technological superpower
by 2035. While China’s message seemingly invites the world to
export its goods to China (as opposed to the protectionist US), in
CCP’s vocabulary, “opening up the country” means implementing
the Belt and Road Initiative even more effectively. This implies an
increasingly systematic construction of an autonomous Chinese
microcosm.


China’s foreign policy of the “new era” is increasingly confrontational with the West.
Still, it is also stepping up its efforts to find and engage with like-minded individuals,
associations and countries in the West. Chinese intelligence services do not necessarily
seek individuals with a similar worldview. They also target high-profile critics of China
who would be willing to continue their criticism while spreading the message that China
cannot be ignored. This is why not only ordinary citizens but also intelligence officers
are waiting for China’s Covid restrictions to be relaxed so they can resume organising

### CHINA’S CALCULATIONS ON ATTACKING TAIWAN

##### China’s changed rhetoric suggests a desire to constrict the existential space of Taiwan: Taiwan duli versus Taidu.

 It is not certain that Western sanctions will deter China, as China has strong countermeasures in place.

 China is very unlikely to attack Taiwan in 2023, but the likelihood will increase with time.


The Chinese Communist Party’s anti-Taiwan rhetoric has recently undergone a significant change. Whereas China previously used the term Taiwan duli to refer to Taiwanese
independence, the term used now is Taidu. Both mean Taiwanese independence in
Chinese, but the shorter version has a broader meaning, describing not only pro-independence forces but anyone who supports building a stronger Taiwanese identity and
civil society. This means that China has decidedly broadened its anti-Taiwan spectrum
in order to constrict the existential space of Taiwan. The term Taidu was included in
the revised party constitution presented at the 20th CCP Congress.

Central to the possible attack on Taiwan is Xi Jinping, who feels he personally has a
historic mission to unite China by conquering Taiwan. Objectively, China has a number
of factors that do not support an attack, but Xi’s personal vision is very likely to override
these. What factors play a role in China’s calculations?


##### Central to the possible attack on Taiwan is Xi Jinping, who feels he personally has a historic mission to unite China by conquering Taiwan.


First – sanctions. Normally, Western sanctions in the event of an
attack on Taiwan should deter China, but sanctions did not discourage
it in Hong Kong or Xinjiang. Neither was China deterred by Western
sanctions (some of which are still in place) during the 1989 Tiananmen
massacre. While it respects the sanctions imposed on Russia, China
considers them unlawful. In addition, China would impose countersanctions (e.g. on rare earth minerals and supply chains). Xi Jinping

Lithuania and China has deteriorated – the opening of the Taiwanese

was enough to anger China; using the

Another important factor is restricted access to Western markets. Given the negative
outlook for China’s real estate sector and the rapid increase in the debt burden, exports
will be crucial to generate growth in China. At the same time, China needs to consider
the potential of substitute markets. A number of Chinese initiatives with a global reach
clearly indicate that China is deliberately focusing on large markets outside the Western
countries to improve its ability to operate independently of the West. It is not a question
of calculating whether the new markets will be able to match Western markets in terms of
export volumes but whether Xi Jinping thinks they will be enough for China to survive.

The third and probably one of the most crucial factors is restricted access to Western
technology and know-how. In addition to the industriousness of the Chinese people,
China’s technological success largely relies on access to cutting-edge Western technology. The CCP has set itself the goal of becoming a technological superpower by 2035, but
it will not succeed without using Western technology and recruiting Western scientists.

The fourth factor is the unity and resilience of the West and like-minded countries against
China. Western unity regarding Ukraine surprised China, but it believes this unity will
crumble. Concerning Russia’s aggression, China asked its businesses to assess the prospects for the Russian economy over the course of at least 12 months, which shows that
China is prepared to bet on a longer time frame in anticipation of Western unity collapsing.

An attack on Taiwan would create major internal tensions in China from an economic
point of view. In this context, Xi Jinping’s emphatic message of unity at the 20th
CCP Congress and the change in his tone of voice when he emphasised the phrase
“dare to fight” (ganyu douzheng) – China must be ready for confrontation – while
reading out the report is particularly noteworthy. Xi Jinping probably has at least a
decade of political life left. China is very unlikely to attack Taiwan in 2023, but the

### CHINESE-RUSSIAN RELATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WAR IN UKRAINE

##### The war started by Russia in Ukraine has not radically changed the relations between China and Russia. But some pre-war trends have strengthened, likely increasing the inequality in their relationship.

 With China’s support, Russia hopes to reduce the impact of the restrictions imposed on it due to the war, which increases Russia’s economic and technological dependence on China and its preparedness to appease China on divisive issues.


##### Russia still plays a significant role in China’s global ambitions, so it is premature to see Xi Jinping’s restrained support for Putin’s war as a sign of distancing from Russia.

Confrontation with the West has brought China and Russia closer in recent years. On a
global scale, the war in Ukraine helps to gauge the degree of polarisation in the relations
between democracies and authoritarian regimes.

Russia’s claims that the West, led by the United States, initiated the aggression in
Ukraine and that Russia’s attack on Ukraine was forced self-defence are compatible with
China’s pragmatic goals arising from its increasing confrontation with the US. Since
the beginning of the war, the Chinese media has clearly sided with Russia, spreading
Russian narratives and calling the US the real culprit of the war while painting Ukraine
and the countries that support it, including the Baltic states, as puppets of the US. When
covering the war in Ukraine, the Chinese media often uses propaganda produced in
Russia – this also points to the fact that in terms of values, Russia is much closer to
China than one might expect based on their diplomatic cooperation.

Aspiring to become a world leader in counterbalancing Western democracy and

in China’s efforts to reach this goal, which should not be underestimated by anyone
wanting to see signs of deteriorating relations between the two states. From a political
point of view, Russia is almost the only partner for China with a considerable diplomatic position and the ability to exert significant influence on international relations
and the balance of power, including in international organisations.

Given China’s global ambitions, Russia is much more useful as a

goals as Russia. This may be the reason behind some inconsistencies in China’s official statements about the war in Ukraine. For
example, last September, Li Zhanshu, the then-chairman of the CCP
Politburo Standing Committee, expressed his full support for Russia’s military actions
in Ukraine when he visited Moscow. However, Xi Jinping, the party’s general secretary
and head of state, remained quite tongue-tied when he met with Vladimir Putin just a
few days later, expressing only China’s readiness to cooperate with Russia for world
peace and stability.

From an economic point of view, Russia is an energy supplier to China and, thanks
to a land connection, would retain this role even if sea routes from other countries
were blocked. Supplying energy to China reduces the impact of war-related sanctions
on Russia. However, China always puts its own interests first when carrying out its
plans, and although the outbreak of the war in Ukraine was probably not good news
for China, it tried to quickly adapt and benefit from it, sometimes at the expense of its
alleged partner, Russia.

China has a clear advantage in its relations with Russia. Although the two countries
agree and work together on many issues, the Russian leadership was concerned about
the growing asymmetry even before the start of the war. Russia is most concerned
about foreign policy, where China’s vigorous activity has begun to undermine Russia’s
position in international organisations and in regions that the latter considers part
of its sphere of influence.

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit held in Samarkand in
September 2022 vividly demonstrated that the balance of power in Central Asia has
begun to shift in China’s favour due to the impact of the Covid pandemic and the
war. Ceding positions to China in Central Asia, which Russia considers its traditional sphere of influence, is difficult for Russia, especially if it implies an increased
Chinese military presence in the region. While China knows Russia may not like the
strengthening of China’s relations with countries in Central Asia, its goal is neither
to please nor to challenge Russia but to promote its own interests.

China and Russia will continue to compete for influence in non-Western organisations
such as the SCO and BRICS. The two states are united by their desire to strengthen
anti-Western sentiments in the member states of these organisations and involve them
in the plan to reduce the dominance of the US dollar. At the same time, Russia is
anxiously watching China’s bilateral relations with the countries of these organisations

Technologically lagging behind the West, Russia hopes to improve cooperation with
China in the near future to help China achieve independence as a technology producer,
thereby reducing Russia’s own dependence on Western technology. In the long run,
this carries the risk of becoming dependent on Chinese technology.

China was surprised by Western unity and determination in imposing large-scale
sanctions against Russia. From the beginning, China has closely monitored the war
in Ukraine and its impact on the global balance of power. On the one hand, this helps
adapt to rapid changes and new challenges. On the other hand, learning from Russia’s
mistakes, China can make better choices and pick a more effective strategy if its confrontation with the West becomes significantly sharper and it finds itself in international
isolation similar to Russia – for example, should China begin military aggression
against Taiwan.

in relations with Russia; it will express support for Russia in its rhetoric and use Russian
war narratives to undermine transatlantic cooperation. At the same time, China will
likely refrain from endorsing the war, violating secondary sanctions or recognising
the occupied territories in Ukraine as part of Russia. It will also likely avoid providing
military assistance at the government level. However, this does not preclude the supply
of goods with dual and military purposes to Russia by private businesses.

China will very likely continue to use its leverage to force Russia to support its agenda.
The more Russia is prepared to give in to China to mitigate the impact of Western
sanctions, the less leeway it will have for independent decisions where China’s goals
differ from its own or are detrimental to them.
