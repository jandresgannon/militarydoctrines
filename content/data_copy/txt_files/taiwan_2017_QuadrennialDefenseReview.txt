# Minister'S Foreword

The Ministry of National Defense (MND), in compliance with Article 31 of the National Defense Act, releases the 2017 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the third edition after the first one in 2009. This edition is aimed at materializing the President's concept of national defense as strategies and policies, and systemically illustrating the directions and perspectives of defense policy implementation for the next four years. It does not only satisfy the people's right to know but also help the international community to understand our defense policy and military strategy. During the compiling process of the 2017 QDR, the strategic dynamic in the Asia-Pacific region may be shifting with the change of government and Asia-Pacific policy of the United States. Mainland China has been increasing its defense expenditures annually, speeding up its defense and military modernization, and dramatically strengthening its power projection capabilities. Its acts have raised concerns among neighboring countries. Especially, Mainland China's recent intimidating moves by sending flotilla with aircraft carrier Liaoning and military aircraft passing though the Taiwan Strait have posed a serious threat to our national security. Facing a complex regional strategic environment and multiple security challenges, the MND has stipulated five fundamentally defensive strategic goals and corresponding 

![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png) approaches to achieve them, to safeguard our national security. Furthermore, guided by the military strategy of "resolute defense, multi-domain deterrence" the MND is shaping a military force capable of delivering deterrence and defense to keep the enemy at bay. Additionally, the MND has adopted innovative thinking to simplify the process to acquire weapons and equipment that best meet the operational requirements. A new category of "specialists in defense affairs" in personnel system has been planned to extend the career tracks of service members. To realize the policy of "self-reliant defense," the MND is setting up a "defense technology development mechanism" to incorporate private sector capabilities into indigenous weapons development programs. Aerospace, shipbuilding, and information security are identified as the core of development to promote integration of our R&D in defense technologies and relevant industries, and to achieve the goal of "mutual support between defense industries and economic development." In the next four years, the MND will actively reconstruct military barracks, upgrade individual combat gears, redesign military uniform and badges, and improve living facilities and 5 welfare. In addition, the MND will enhance the efficiency of disaster prevention and relief operations, strengthen the efforts in fishery escort missions, and protect the safety and properties of our people. Based on our own capacities and experience, the MND will also make efforts to participate in foreign humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) missions to fulfill our international obligations as a global citizen. In closing, I wish to thank the members of the QDR consultation committee and the participating colleagues and staff for their full dedication and contribution, and look forward to the support and recommendations from the general public. The ROC Armed Forces always keep an open mind to different opinions, which can be good reference for future policy making and force buildup, and keep our military moving towards an elite and strong defense force.

# Introduction

The Ministry of National Defense (MND), in compliance with Article 31 of the National Defense Act, is required to submit a Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) within ten months after each presidential inauguration. In addition to this introduction, the 2017 QDR consists of seven chapters: Strategic Environment, Strategic Guidance, Force 

![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)

Buildup, National Defense Reform, Defense Industries, 

![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png) Civil Protection Operations, and Cooperation with partners, structured as the figure below. 

## Chapter 1 Strategic Environment

The United States and Mainland China continue to be the primary influences in the current Asia-Pacific strategic situation with a "co-opetition relationship" existing between the two powers. Unresolved territorial disputes over islands and waters in the East China Sea (ECS) and the South China Sea (SCS), instability on the Korean Peninsula, arms competition among East Asian countries, growing non-traditional security threats, and potential changes in U.S. Asia-Pacific policy are major factors shaping the strategic balance in the Asia-Pacific region, and present challenges to our national security. Mainland China continues to invest heavily in military modernization, vigorously undertaking military force transformation and reforming into theater commands, and is gradually acquiring force projection capability west of the Second Island Chain, adding uncertainties to the security environment in the region. In recent years, our country has faced constrains in defense financial resources and manpower, difficulty in acquiring advanced weapons 9 systems, increasing threats to cyber security, decreasing defense awareness in the public, and increasing incidents of complex emergencies, all of which require a serious and careful response.

## Chapter 2 Strategic Guidance

In order to counter the military threats and challenges to our national security, ensure our national survival and development, and safeguard our people's lives and properties, the Ministry of National Defense has developed five strategic goals: "Safeguard the Nation," "Cultivate a Professional Military," "Realize Defense Self-Reliance," "Protect People's Wellbeing," and "Strengthen Regional Stability," along with approaches to achieve those goals. MND has adopted military strategic concepts of "resolute defense, multi-domain deterrence" to lead our direction of force buildup and establish a credible defense force. Additionally, the Ministry has established a "development strategy for defense industries" to develop advanced technologies, establish capacities to research and produce weapons systems and equipment indigenously, and spur the development of national defense capabilities and economic growth. 

## Chapter 3 Force Buildup

With a focus on integrating joint operational capabilities, 

![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png) the ROC Armed Forces continues to improve its joint operational training, establish precise logistic capabilities, enact policy reforms for mobilizing reservists, and generate a warrior spirit in the force, in order to ensure successful accomplishment of defense missions for our nation. Moreover, the MND established force development priorities, and will achieve force development goals through effective integration, allocation, and employment of defense resources, and by revising weapons system acquisition processes. 

## Chapter 4 National Defense Reform

The MND is dedicated to all reform efforts, including perfecting its military recruitment system, optimizing personnel quality and enhancing the image of service members, caring for their wellbeing, refining the national defense legal system, and streamlining administrative functions, in order to enhance service members professionalism and organizational efficiency.

## Chapter 5 Defense Industries

Envisioning future trends and requirements for joint operations, the MND has been pooling interagency 11 resources to push for indigenous development and production of weapon systems in three core fields of aerospace, shipbuilding and information security in order to promote integration of our R&D in defense technologies and relevant industries, and to achieve the goal of 
"mutual support between national defense and economic development."

## Chapter 6 Civil Protection Operations

For improving efficiency of disaster relief operations and providing concerted assistance efforts, the MND has cooperated closely with the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) to protect our fishermen in our territorial waters. Furthermore, the MND will assign its naval and air assets to assist in emergency assistance and transport operations. 

## Chapter 7 Cooperation With Partners

Through military exchanges, international humanitarian assistance operations, and cooperation on anti-terrorism with our partners and friendly countries, the MND has taken part in bilateral and multilateral dialogue mechanisms for security and cooperation in order to contribute to peace and stability in the region.

# Chapter 1 Strategic Environment

The current global security environment is marked by complexities and uncertainties. Coupled with regional strategic security alliances and competitions among powers, regional situations have been facing increasing uncertainties. In particular, the Asia-Pacific strategy adopted by the new U.S. administration, foreign policies adopted by countries in the vicinity of the Taiwan Strait, political and economic arrangements of Mainland China and its rapid military development, and security issues we are facing - such as economic development, demographical structure, and composite disasters - all impact our national security and sustainable development.

## Section 1 Asia-Pacific Security Environment

The security environment of the Asia-Pacific Region is marked by the coexistence of competition and cooperation. The direction of U.S. Asia-Pacific strategy and force deployment remains to be seen while the rise of China has a tremendous impact on the surrounding regions. Meanwhile, facing traditional and non-traditional security threats, such as strategic competition among regional powers, disputes of maritime rights, and proliferation of terrorism, the majority of Southeast Asian countries have begun to acquire advanced weapons and expand their security alliances in response. Challenges to our national security have emerged from these relevant developments. 

## I. Regional Strategic Posture

The U.S. has been maintaining military cooperation with traditional allies, such as Japan and South Korea, and has established strategic security cooperation relationships with Southeast Asian countries. Mainland China, on the other hand, has been vigorously strengthening security relations with Russia and Central Asian countries, expanding the scale and scope of its joint exercises, and increasing its leverage on regional affairs by touting grand political and economic strategies, such as the "Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership" (RCEP) and "One Belt, One Road" (OBOR). In 

![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png) addition, the situation in the Korean Peninsula is precarious. North Korea has persisted in test-firing ballistic missiles and conducting nuclear weapon tests, raising serious concerns internationally. Its actions have been triggering shifts in relations among involved countries such as the U.S., Japan, Russia, Mainland China, and have indirectly influenced the security situation in the Taiwan Strait. In terms of regional cooperation, Asia-Pacific countries have been enhancing strategic dialogues through venues such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and East Asia Summit (EAS) to foster security and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific via these multilateral negotiations and cooperation.

## Ii. Maritime And Island Disputes

The Asia-Pacific region contains numerous islands surrounded by abundant maritime resources. Several of those islands are embroiled in sovereignty disputes and controversial demarcation of economic waters. Regional states have been investing ever more resources to secure their respective interests and benefits. I n t h e E a s t C h i n a S e a ( E C S ) , f o l l o w i n g J a p a n 's nationalization of the Diaoyutai Islands, Mainland China 15 announced an East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). It has since maintained regular naval and air patrols in the ECS. Mainland China has also conducted frequent training exercises in the West Pacific and beyond the First Island Chain. Japan has established a shore-based surveillance network on Yonaguni Island and increased troop levels on Ishigaki Island. The confrontational posture between Mainland China and Japan has heightened uncertainties in the security and stability in East Asia. In the South China Sea (SCS), the findings of the international arbitration tribunal in the case filed by the Philippines were not commonly accepted by the claimants. Mainland China continues its island construction and militarization of those artificial islands. The U.S. advocates for "freedom of navigation and overflight" in the region. Developments in the region could escalate sovereign disputes and strategic competition, and potentially lead to regional conflicts. 

## Iii. Non-Traditional Security Threats

Following rapid changes in globalization, technological advancement and information flow, non-traditional threats have become ever more complex. Their security implications and scope are increasing, as are their importance. Many challenges such as the proliferation of terrorist ideologies, incidence of complex emergencies, spread of contagious diseases, cyber attacks, threats to information security, 

![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png) competition for energy resources, and rise of food and water resource crises, are all transnational and regional issues that cannot be resolved by a single country alone. Only through international and regional security cooperation mechanisms can these issues be properly managed to ensure regional security and stability.

## Section 2 Military Situation In The Taiwan Strait

Dynamic military development, arms proliferation, and training exercises of regional countries impact the AsiaPacific regional situation and pose challenges to security in the Taiwan Strait. Among them, Mainland China's obvious improvement in military operational capabilities by expediting military organizational reform and maintaining R&D on advanced arms and their conversions is the major factor that affects security in the Taiwan Strait. 

## I. Military Environment In The Vicinity Of Taiwan

1. Rapid Growth of Mainland China's Force Projection Capabilities According to its military strategy of "active defense" and guidance of military preparation of "winning local wars under informatized conditions," Mainland China has been 17 increasingly developing its naval, air, and rocket forces, and vigorously refining their organizations, tactics, and operational methods, in order to enhance its joint operational capabilities. Moreover, its military strength has been growing rapidly in the Asia-Pacific region by extending its force projection and strategic strike capabilities through conducting cross-regional longdistance training, escort missions in the Gulf of Aden, and naval and air force exercises penetrating through the First Island Chain and in the SCS. 

## 2. The U.S. Reviews Its Force Deployment In The Asia-Pacific

To maintain its interests and ability to swiftly respond to potential contingencies in the Asia-Pacific, the U.S. sustained its forward military presence in the region. Additionally, the U.S. military continues to modernize, strengthen its key capabilities for future operations, enhance its equipment and training, and conduct routine combined exercises with allies aimed at improving its joint capabilities, in order to maintain strategic advantage in the Asia-Pacific. 

## 3. Japan Strengthens Its Military Forces And Lifts 

![18_Image_0.Png](18_Image_0.Png) Restrictions On Overseas Deployments

In line with its 2014 *National Security Strategy*, Japan lifted its ban on the "execution of collective defense." Japan also adopted legislation for peace and security, expanding the operational area of the Japan SelfDefense Forces. Furthermore, by adopting a new version of the "three principles on transfer of defense equipment and technology," Japan has been expediting R&D on advanced defense technologies and selling defense technology overseas. These changes profoundly influence the security situation in the Asia-Pacific and the Taiwan Strait.

## 4. Military Confrontation On The Korean Peninsula

North Korea has continued its strategy of brinkmanship, and has carried out nuclear tests and missile test launches in order to increase its international bargaining leverage. In response to the military threats from the north, the Republic of Korea has been enhancing its alliance with the U.S., deploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, improving intelligence and command and control systems, extending radar detection range, and enhancing its early warning and defense capabilities. But these activities have triggered 19 objections from Mainland China and Russia, created a more complicated military confrontational posture on the Korean Peninsula and increased uncertainties in the regional security environment. 

## 5. Arms Upgrades Among Southeast Asian Countries

Southeast Asian countries have been investing resources in accelerating their military modernization actively acquiring advanced weapons from the U.S., Europe, Russia, and Mainland China to improve their operational capabilities. The risk of military confrontations in the region has persisted. 

## Ii. Current Military Threats In The Taiwan Strait

Mainland China has never renounced its use of force against Taiwan, and preparing to conduct a military invasion of Taiwan is one of its primary goals. With a budget increasing year by year, the PLA has rapidly modernized its military equipment, pursuing military reform under the principle of "Central Military Committee (CMC) managing overall military affairs, theater commands focusing on warfighting, and services focusing on force-building." Relevant efforts have been made to reorganize its CMC general departments, restructure military regions (MR) into theater commands, create an army headquarters in the People's Liberation 

![20_image_0.png](20_image_0.png) Army (PLA), and establish a strategic support force and rocket force. In addition, the PLA in recent years has institutionalized all its military exercises. The PLA now possesses the capability to impose a blockade on Taiwan and conduct multi-dimensional operations to seize our offshore islands. The comprehensive operational capabilities it has developed pose threats to Taiwan including the following: 

## 1. Joint Intelligence, Surveillance And Reconnaissance Capabilities

The PLA has been developing capabilities of command, control, communications, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, navigation, targeting, and digital datalink capabilities, and can now cover areas west of the Second Island Chain. With a focus on improving surveillance and identification capabilities on targets in the Asia-Pacific in support a range of military operations in the region, posing a tremendous threat to our national security. 

## 2. Strike Capabilities Of The Pla Rocket Force

All medium (and short) range tactical ballistic and cruise missiles deployed by the PLA Rocket Force can reach the entire main island of Taiwan. With continuous 21 improvements on maneuverability, accuracy, and lethality, they can be used to conduct precision strikes on our political, military, and economic high-value targets (HVT). Moreover, it has accelerated R&D, production, and deployment of long-range anti-ship ballistic missiles to enhance its capabilities to invade Taiwan and deny the intervention of foreign forces. 

## 3. Integrated Air Operational Capabilities

The PLA Air Force has been accelerating R&D and conversion programs for its fighter fleet. Its main operational aircraft have undertaken aerial refueling drills, and multiple types of its aircraft have flown across the First Island Chain, demonstrating a significant improvement in its long range operational capabilities. Moreover, coupled with new unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAV) and advanced long-range precision munitions, it has acquired capabilities to achieve multi-layered firepower, joint air defense, anti-missile operations, and even achieve air supremacy west of the First Island Chain, while further threatening our efforts to obtain regional air superiority. 

## 4. Integrated Maritime Operational Capabilities

![22_Image_0.Png](22_Image_0.Png)

The PLA Navy has been developing its main combatant ships and accelerating deployment of auxiliary ships, such as new amphibious transport docks and fast combat support ships, to enhance its replenishment capabilities for maritime operations. In addition, its submarinelaunched intercontinental ballistic missiles onboard its nuclear submarine and shore-based supersonic antiship missiles under development and deployment have strengthened its strategic deterrence and counterattack capabilities. With the assistance of its indigenous aircraft carrier and capability to form a blue water carrier battle group, the PLA Navy has demonstrated that it has increased capability to conduct nuclear counterstrike, deny access of foreign forces, and blockade Taiwan and its surrounding waters. 

## 5. Integrated Ground Operational Capabilities

The PLA Ground Force has been developing in the direction of three-dimensional operations, rapid maneuverability, long-range power projection, precision strike, and special operations capabilities. The army aviation units are equipped with various types of indigenous helicopters, and have increased training 23 with special operations forces in order to improve its air-land battle, rapid assault, and air assault operations capabilities. Furthermore, it has deployed transport vessels along Mainland China's southeastern coast and conducted joint landing drills to fulfill its future operational requirements against Taiwan. It is believed Mainland China has acquired the capability to initiate triphibious landing operations to seize our offshore islands. 

## 6. Strategic Support Capabilities

The PLA Strategic Support Force was formed to integrate space, technical reconnaissance, cyber warfare, electronic countermeasures, and psychological operations units. Notably, the world's first Chinese-made quantum communications satellite, which can transmit classified military operational data, was successfully launched into orbit. Its electronic countermeasures force can simulate a realistic electronic operations environment in the Taiwan Strait, and construct electronic interfering and paralyzing capabilities. In addition, it has absorbed civilian resources and recruited information warfare talent to expand civilmilitary integration. Thus, it has established a cyberattack capability to collect our electro-magnetic parameters, and to monitor, cut off, and interfere with our surveillance, reconnaissance, command and control systems. 

![24_image_0.png](24_image_0.png)

## 7. Unconventional Logistical Support Capabilities

In order to overcome inadequate transport capabilities and ensure the prioritization of military operations, all transportation infrastructure such as roads, railroads, waterways, air routes, and civilian transportation means were constructed to meet the PLA's defense needs. In recent years, the PLA has requisitioned civil airliners and large ferries to join its exercises, and mobilized large units by train. All these reveal that its unconventional support capabilities have been dramatically enhanced. In an invasion of Taiwan, it can accelerate the movement of troops and reduce our preparation time for defensive operations. 

## Section 3 Defense And Security Challenges

In maintaining national security and conducting defense preparation, not only do the threats and challenges in our external strategic environment have to be evaluated and dealt with, but social, economic, demographic, resources, technological, and psychological factors in our domestic environment have to be given serious consideration. 

25

## I. Limited Growth Of Defense Financial Resources

In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, global economic growth has suffered greatly. The economic development of our country has also been affected by this recession, and our overall finances have been constrained-limiting the growth of our defense spending. The major issue at present is to make the best of limited defense resources to strengthen comprehensive military capabilities and ensure sustainable force buildup and operational readiness. We will seek to obtain a reasonable and adequate defense budget appropriate to national budget allocations and, allocate and manage these resources appropriately. 

## Ii. Constrained Manpower Resources

The impact of our social and economic environment, along with a low birth rate, has been to reduce available manpower, negatively impacting our troop replenishment and operational strength. We will to continue to revise our recruitment system, and concurrently review our operational concepts and corresponding force structure in order to maintain a small but elite military to meet our future defense needs. 

## Iii. Difficulty In Acquisition And R&D For Advanced Weapons

In the face of the military threats from Mainland China, the ROC Armed Forces need to acquire advanced weapons to meet our defense needs. Bounded by diplomatic and financial realities, our country faces difficulties in acquiring 

![26_image_0.png](26_image_0.png) advanced weapons which cannot be produced domestically. Although we are capable of developing some defense articles, we cannot fully build sophisticated weapons and equipment on our own. Some key components and parts must be purchased from foreign sources. To adapt to the future high-tech operational environment, we must map out a longterm, comprehensive technology development strategy and establish indigenous R&D and production capabilities.

## Iv. Serious Threats To Cyber Security

With the continuously expanding development and application of information technologies, risks to cyberspace and information security are growing relentlessly. Government agencies, corporate enterprises, and critical infrastructures are potential cyber attack targets. In particular, the PLA has drastically increased its information and electronic warfare, and cyber operations capabilities, threatening our military and civilian networks. The ROC Armed Forces have to enhance information security and protection mechanisms, strengthen information, communications, and electronic warfare (ICE) capabilities, and help construct a comprehensive national cyber and electronic-magnetic security protection mechanism. 

27

## V. Waning Defense Awareness

Due to ongoing economic, social, and cultural exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, many of our fellow citizens have gradually lost awareness that the two sides of the Strait remain military adversaries, and that the risk of war still exists. Some have ignored the widening gap of military capabilities and increasing menaces from Mainland China, undermining their support for defense affairs. The ROC Armed Forces have to systematically integrate all relevant resources to raise defense awareness among the general public as well as encourage public participation in and support for defense affairs in order to strengthen national security. 

## Vi. Increasing Threats From Complex Emergencies

Climate change has caused a rising number of complex emergencies with natural disaster conditions increasingly urgent and severe. Requiring coordinated interagency relief and recovery efforts. Our country is located within the western Pacific typhoon zone and Pacific Ring of Fire seismic zone, and is categorized as a highly hazardous area with frequent typhoons and earthquakes. In recent years, the ROC Armed Forces have effectively supported HA/DR operations. In the future, the Armed Forces will continue to cooperate with central and local governments to provide disaster relief assistance, and shoulder the responsibility of safeguarding people's lives and properties. 

# Chapter 2 Strategic Guidance

I
n response to hostile threats and challenges to our national security, as well as to fulfill the need to ensure the survival and development of the nation and protect the lives and property of our people, the MND has formulated a "national defense strategy, military strategy, and defense industrial development strategy" to guide our defense policy implementation and force development. Through the implementation of those strategies, MND can best combine both opportunities and advantages, apply limited defense resources to build a credible defense force, and achieve its strategic goals.

## Section 1 National Defense Strategy

In keeping with the President's national security concept and the Executive Yuan's defense policy guidance, the MND has evaluated the domestic and foreign strategic environment and trends, reviewed the status of threats and challenges to our national security, established defense strategic goals and laid out visionary approaches to achieve them. The strategic defense goals and approaches are driving the ROC Armed Forces to consolidate their defense preparations, develop future joint operational capabilities and enact relevant defense reforms to create a robust and strong defense force capable of enuring our national security. 

## I. Objectives Of The National Defense Strategy

In light of current and future strategic environment and security challenges, we must think innovatively, promote pragmatic reform and utilize resources effectively in order to formulate the optimal plan for force buildup and operational readiness. Our current national defense strategy is as follows:

## 1. Safeguard National Security

The first priority of our national defense is to deter and defend against any hostile military action. In the particular case of a military invasion, we will mobilize all defense assets to safeguard territorial integrity and sovereignty and protect the people and their property 

![30_image_0.png](30_image_0.png) from devastation. 

## 2. Cultivate A Professional Military

The employment of operational capabilities relies on highly professional personnel and efficient organizations. Facing dynamic changes in domestic and external environments, and the need to build a military force with high-tech and innovative capabilities, we must pragmatically carry out various refinement and reforms on the defense programs to improve overall personnel quality and organizational efficiency, and develop professional, smart, and strong Armed Forces to meet future challenges. 

## 3. Implement Defense Self-Reliance

The development of defense requires the full support of a nation's economy. We must use the national economy to develop defense, and use defense to spur the economy, thus laying a solid foundation for a defense self-reliance. The ROC Armed Forces must combine resources from relevant government agencies and industrial capacities from private sectors to strengthen the development and application of defense technologies, and conduct research and produce weapons and equipment domestically. 

31 Doing so achieves a win-win result, fulfilling the nation's defense needs while generating economic gains. 

## 4. Protecting The Well-Being Of The People

To contend with the non-traditional security threats that have emerged in recent years, the ROC Armed Forces must serve on the frontline in conducting disaster relief and promoting social stability. The nation's maritime rights are also our important interests vital to its people's well-being, and the ROC Armed Forces must continue to implement government policies to safeguard the nation's maritime rights. 

## 5. Strengthen Regional Stability

In the age of globalization, national security is intertwined with international politics and regional affairs, and cannot be managed unilaterally. Aside from building a robust defense force to meet self-defense goals, the ROC Armed Forces must be a "staunch peacekeeper" in the international community, dedicating themselves to strengthening peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and security in the Asia-Pacific.

## Ii. Approaches To Achieve The Objectives

MND will achieve its defense strategic goals through substantive policy planning and viable implementation efforts, and by seeking adequate budgeting. The approaches 

![32_image_0.png](32_image_0.png) to achieve objectives are as follows: 

## 1. Strengthen Force Buildup

In order to achieve the strategic goals of "safeguarding national security," the ROC Armed Forces must develop necessary capabilities to accomplish all their missions. The pragmatic actions are as follows:
(1) Carefully review defense needs and pragmatically plan force buildup in order to establish comprehensive force development objectives. 

(2) Build a defense force that deters military threats and denies invasions by consolidating joint capabilities, improving joint operations training, establishing precise logistics, refining the reserve system, and strengthening morale for all its personnel. 

(3) Fine-tune the weapons acquisition processes to accelerate the procurement of necessary weapons and equipment for defense.

(4) Pragmatically allocate and apply limited defense financial resources to support force planning and buildup, and create reasonable and appropriate plan for the defense budget to maximize the effectiveness of all resources. 

33

## 2. Promote Defense Reform

In order to reach the strategic objective of "cultivating a professional military," promote a series of defense affairs reforms. Practical measures are as follows:
(1) Design a comprehensive career package from recruitment to retirement to steadily achieve goals for a volunteer force. 

(2) Improve the professionalism of military and civil personnel and refine manpower management and deployment mechanisms to cultivate and retain talented personnel who will continue serving the nation. 

(3) Promote a culture of integrity and honesty to uphold military discipline, shape a highly esteemed image for service members, elevate their social status, and regain their honor and respect from the people. 

(4) Plan for the care and welfare of personnel to ensure they have no worries about their families and can focus on their missions. 

(5) Refine the national defense legal system to improve legal literacy for service members, and realize the goal of administration by law. A specific act for the rights of service members is being studied 

![34_image_0.png](34_image_0.png) and drafted to protect their legal rights and interests.

# Conclusion

In accordance with the President's vision and concept of national defense, the MND publishes the QDR to lay out a policy implementation blueprint for national defense to guide its commitment towards strengthening the military's capacities to defend the nation and maintain regional peace and stability. Due to Mainland China's refusal to renounce the use of force against Taiwan, the grave difficulties in the Taiwan Strait have persisted. The ROC government stands firm in Taiwan, and its robust defense capability remains the pillar of the people's self-esteem and national security. Mainland China's increasing military threats, as displayed by recent exercises in which PLA aircraft and vessels circled Taiwan, have once again revealed the paramount importance of the ROC Armed Forces' role in "holding the shields and arms to safeguard the nation." Facing the challenges of uncertain situations and elevated threat levels, the MND hopes to generate, through the 2017 QDR, discussions on strategic and policy issues, review the status of defense policy implementation and force buildup planning, and establish a linkage among all military strategic documents. Beginning with an analysis of our strategic environment, the 2017 QDR clearly maps out the 

![92_image_0.png](92_image_0.png) goals of our national defense strategy and in corresponding chapters elaborates approaches and means to achieve them. In addition, this edition has highlighted important goals in our defense affairs, such as strengthening ICE capabilities, improving weapons acquisition, enhancing the image of service members, and developing defense industries. The completion of the 2017 QDR marks the start of a series of efforts to refine our national defense reform. In the future, through our strategic guidance and integrated planning, continued defense investment, thorough defense preparations and force planning, and strict oversight, we will devote our utmost efforts to realize the goals presented in this edition The development of the ROC Armed Forces is closely intertwined with the freedom and prosperity of our nation, and the people's support is our motivation to continue forging ahead. The MND will spare no efforts, acting with determination and complete dedication to shape the ROC Armed Forces as an elite military force. MND will steadfastly reform in order to sustain a peaceful and secure environment for the sustainable development of our nation and the people's livelihood.
