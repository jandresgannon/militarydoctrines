### I. INTRODUCTION

“The Long Term Perspective for Defence 2030” represents the framework for fulfilling the political
and military ambitions of the Czech Republic. It serves as a guideline for defence planning,
particularly in developing five-year medium term plans. Based on an analysis of trends in the strategic
environment, it outlines the basic direction for military capabilities development and provides
guidance for the “Concept of the Czech Armed Forces Development 2025”, and other conceptual
documents. The Long Term Perspective stems from the legal system and the strategic policy
documents of the Czech Republic, and takes into account the principles of NATO and EU security
policies and military documents.

###### 4

### II. BACKGROUND

Defence comprises three pillars: (1) Responsible Approach by the State to the Defence of the Czech
Republic and Commitments to Allies. (2) Capable Armed Forces. (3) National Defence as a Civic Duty.
It is supported by Czech foreign policy, the economy and the willingness of the citizens to defend
their country.

The Government of the Czech Republic’s approach to safeguarding defence is stated in:
(a) The Defence Strategy, which is based on the Security Strategy of the Czech Republic;
(b) The Decisions of the Government of the Czech Republic proposed by the Minister of Defence
on the structure and personnel strength of the Czech Armed Forces (adopted in 2007 and 2012).

These documents define Czech political and military ambitions, and set out the political assignments
for the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic in order to ensure their development, obligations and
tasks:

n
In the event of an armed conflict of a scale that would threaten Czech sovereignty, its territorial
integrity and vital interests, all forces and assets of the Czech Armed Forces, including liability
to conscription, will be employed;

n For collective defence under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, if its territory is not directly
endangered, the Czech Republic will provide, if necessary, land and air forces assigned for this
purpose to NATO, whose core comprises a brigade task force on a mechanized brigade basis;

n For international operations intended to cope with threats and crises, the Czech Republic will,
depending on the situation, be able to concurrently or progressively assign: (a) a battalion task
force, (b) a land company task force (or air force equivalent), (c) forces up to battalion level
assigned for standby duty in the NATO Response Force or EU Battle Group, (d) small specialist
or expert groups, including special forces task teams;

n The Armed Forces of the Czech Republic can deploy in all climatic zones except the Arctic areas.

In relation to these duties, the Czech Armed Forces should have up to 27 thousand military
servicemen. Personnel strength was temporarily decreased to 22 thousand military servicemen
during the period 2013-15, while the tasks remained unchanged.

### III. FUTURE SECURITY AND OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT

Over the next 20 years, the Czech Republic, as well as NATO and the EU, will be facing serious
persistent threats. Changes will be dynamic and can be expected in all crucial aspects of security
with complex and interconnected trends.

###### PREDOMINANT TRENDS

n **The distribution of political power and economic and military potential around the world**
**will be more diversified. This will cause instability in the form of an increased number of conflicts**
and a direct military threat to the Allies. The warning time for major conventional conflicts, even
in the proximity of NATO and EU states, has decreased to weeks or months.

n **At the same time, globalization will continue. Deepening of differences between international**
players will have a negative impact. The misuse of information technologies and the media will
increasingly contribute to the sudden shift in the perception of events in terms of time and space
and, therefore, will also lead to the spread of instability. The intentional misuse of the media for
information warfare will grow significantly. Interconnected economies and financial systems will
also simplify and accelerate the “transfer” of the symptoms of crises to more distant countries.
Increasing mobility, together with a high population density in some areas, will also expedite
the spread of infectious diseases which can then lead to pandemic situations.

n **Defence expenditures will grow in non-European regions and in the Russian Federation.**
This will enable a more intensive use of modern military technologies. When military force are
used as a political tool, we can expect increased aggressive ambitions from regional superpowers.

n Besides conventional military threats, there will be an increase in enforcing these interests
**by a combination of military and non-military means, including the use of non-state players**
(hybrid warfare). Utilizing the service of militants without insignia and paramilitary militias will
become a more serious problem.

n
**There will be an increase in the influence and autonomy of non-state players in the inter­**
**national arena, such as, private security companies, the economic power of private economic**
and financial entities, terrorist groups, organized crime and paramilitary groups.

n **Weak and unstable governance, failed states, the spreading of extremism, the “foreign**
**fighter” phenomenon, and ethnic and religious conflicts will lead to regional crises with**
the potential of having a negative impact on global security and stability.

###### 6


-----

n **The demand for strategic resources, water and sources of energy, especially for fossil fuel,**
**will grow. An effort to get privileged assured access to these resources and to gain control**
over transport routes will increase. Europe will compete for resources from the Middle East,
the Russian Federation, Africa, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia including China. A major and
persistent decrease of supplies from the Russian Federation could be expected in the medium
term. A shortage of resources in the world market due to natural, technical, economic or political
reasons, and/or conflicts cannot be ruled out either.

n **Dynamic development of science and technologies will lead to higher availability**
**of advanced technologies. The availability of information, nanotechnology and biotechnology,**
coupled with easier production and automation, will contribute to enhancing the capabilities
of potential enemies. The importance of directed energy weapons, remote controlled and
autonomous weapon systems and so-called counter-intervention systems, e.g. missile and air
defence systems, ballistic missile defence systems etc., will grow. Proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction and missile technologies will continue. The number of countries possessing
these weapons and means of delivery will increase.

n **Society will become increasingly dependent on information technologies. Cyber-attacks**
could significantly threaten the functionality of states in all areas, including the armed forces.
A number of state and non-state entities are currently building offensive cyber capabilities
to target the electronic systems of state and non-state institutions, as well as the critical
information infrastructure.

n **We will be confronted with an unbalanced demographic growth. A boost of the world’s**
population will occur, especially in developing countries, and will be accompanied by rapid
urbanization. An increased proportion of young, unemployed and the disillusioned will pose
a threat to stability, and populations in developed countries will continue to age.

n **A threat will be posed by waves of migration due to various factors such as, conflicts,**
insufficient access to resources and food, population explosion, climate changes, etc.

n **Habitat destruction and environmental changes can potentially lead to a worsened security**
situation.

###### THE NATURE OF A FUTURE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT WILL REQUIRE: 
– Rapid force projection, including strategic distances;
– Ability to conduct major military operations on corps level;
– Flexibility, enhanced force readiness and mobility;
– International cooperation, particularly greater NATO and EU responsiveness;
– Comprehensive approach – the capability of all military branches and services to conduct joint
operations, as well as combined operations with the involvement of intelligence, military and
civilian elements, both in the traditional battlefield, and the cyberspace and media environment.

###### 7

### IV. ENGAGEMENT IN FUTURE OPERATIONS

The tasks of the Czech Armed Forces are set out in the Act no. 219/1999 Coll., on the Czech Armed
Forces. Furthermore, they stemmed from NATO and EU membership. The primary objective
of the Czech Armed Forces is to be prepared to defend Czech territory in the context of the collective
defence of NATO and the EU Common Security and Defence Policy, as well as supporting civilian
authorities on the territory of the Czech Republic. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure efficient
air defence as part of NATO’s Integrated Air and Missile Defence System (NATINAMDS), including the
national air defence system using their own supersonic capability.

The assignment of the Czech Armed Forces to NATO and EU rapid response forces will prove
a valuable method of implementing the Czech Republic’s international commitments, as well as
an efficient form of forces training. Furthermore, the Czech Armed Forces will contribute to NATO’s
collective defence capabilities with increased participation in air policing and exercises.

The Czech Armed Forces could also be engaged in international operations to protect security
interests and manage crises. They can participate in conflict prevention and assist other countries
in building their defence capabilities. In principle, these operations would be in the form of peace
enforcement, peace support or peacekeeping operations, and humanitarian and rescue missions.
As well as cooperating with and supporting education and training, these activities may also
include support for partners’ efforts in transforming and developing their defence sector. Units
and/or individuals can be deployed as part of an international effort, or on a bilateral basis. These
activities can take place both on the territory of the host nation, on the territory of third countries,
or on the territory of the Czech Republic.

The most likely and frequent example of the employment of the Czech Armed Forces in the next
twenty years will be their participation in international operations outside the Czech Republic.
The deployment of the Czech Armed Forces will be primarily based on task forces composed
of organic units complemented, according to mission requirements, by specific capability modules,
particularly by combat support and combat service support elements.

In most circumstances, the Czech Armed Forces will be deployed as part of a broader international
effort, particularly NATO, EU and the UN, and ad hoc coalitions in compliance with international
law principles. These operations could also be of a long-term nature. In accordance with the Czech
Constitution, the participation of the Czech Armed Forces in these operations should be bound
by an adequate international and national mandate. There might also be purely national (or as part
of ad hoc coalitions) operations aimed at evacuating and rescuing citizens, or evacuating Czech
diplomatic missions from a crisis area.

###### 8


-----

Article 5 and the crisis management operations in which the Czech Armed Forces could be deployed
will lead to increased requirements to guarantee air superiority and close air support capabilities, fire
superiority, maximum force protection, informational superiority, real-time battle space situational
awareness, force flexibility and mobility, the joint action of all services deployed, individual specialist
capabilities and the provision of logistic support over long distances.

### V. IMPLICATIONS OF MILITARY CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT

Based on the predictions of the security environment and the types of operations assumed,
it is apparent that the requirements for the military capabilities of the Czech Republic will continue
to grow in the future even if national political-military ambitions remains at the current level.

###### BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE CZECH ARMED FORCES DEVELOPMENT

The Czech Republic will continue to maintain the foundation of a balanced Czech Armed Forces
that will be capable of building up and reinforcing its capabilities in the event of a worsening
security environment. In a crisis situation, before attaining wartime force structure,
the peacetime structure must be able to strengthen its forces, as well as establishing conditions
for the creation of a division-level command. It will be necessary to permanently maintain
and increase the technological level of the Czech Armed Forces and to increase personnel
preparedness. Therefore, the defence education system of military personnel and citizens will
be enhanced. To provide flexibility in using Armed Forces personnel, a system of active reserve
will be implemented. If necessary, a mobilization scheme will be employed to augment the Czech
Armed Forces on the basis of liability to conscription. A material augmentation system will
be regularly revised depending on changes in the security environment.

The Czech Armed Forces must be ready to perform its tasks across the full spectrum of military
operations and intensity scale as part of the Allied efforts. Emphasis will be put on ensuring
the capability of a rapid and flexible response to unexpected events. To this end, the system
for providing materiel support and supply of directly accessible operational stocks will be adapted
accordingly. Priority will be given to the necessary level of stocks required in compliance with NATO
standards, including live and training ammunition. The principle of force modularity will be used
to enable the formation of task forces for specific operations on the basis of organic units (including
their rotations).

A single set of forces will continue to be used for conducting tasks on the territory of the Czech
Republic, as well as abroad for missions and operations led by NATO, the EU or other international
organizations the Czech Republic is a member of. The forces deployed outside the Czech territory
will routinely be part of a multinational formation. Forces will be trained for deployment on the basis
of the “jointness” principle.

The Czech Armed Forces must be able to perform their tasks without geographical restrictions,
except the Arctic areas and in unusual environments. They must be prepared to operate in extremely
varied cultural environments, including ethnicity, language and religion. They must be **mobile,**

###### 10


-----

**highly efficient and accurate, resilient, deployable, sustainable, flexible and interoperable,**
**be provided with relevant intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, reconnaissance**
**(ISTAR), and fire support. In the development of capabilities, an emphasis will be put on the real**
time coverage of the operational area and on the shortest possible reaction time of the Command,
Control, Communication and Computers, Intelligence, and Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR)
systems.

Priority will be given to the development of capabilities of the deployable forces assigned for
standby, both within NATO and the EU (NATO Response Force (NRF), NATINAMDS and EU Battle­
group), aimed at achieving the corresponding interoperability with allied forces. Staff affiliations
of units and individuals of international commands within NATO, the EU and multilateral
cooperation will be used effectively to that end. Enhancement of these capabilities will be supported
by the implementation of modernization projects aimed at meeting NATO and EU requirements.

In order to enhance operational effectiveness, deployed units and staffs will actively use the ex­
peri­ence gained from previous operations (Lessons Learned) and expert consultations through
the Reach Back[1] systems.

The Czech Armed Forces must be able to operate and sustain multiple **concurrent operations**
at a national or international level, including strategic distances.

The Czech Armed Forces, in cooperation with armed forces of other countries, and with commercial
organizations, will **sustain its deployed capabilities related to operations for a given period.**
The stocks of materiel and equipment will be tailored according to the units’ allocation and their
rotation needs, by using outsourcing (depending agreed limits).

In respect of military capabilities development, an emphasis will be placed on the preparedness
**for warfare in urban areas and their immediate vicinity. It requires the provision of adequate force**
protection, reconnaissance capabilities, precise engagement (lethal and non-lethal force in order
to avoid collateral damage), and relevant training.

The Czech Armed Forces will develop multipurpose military capabilities, with the objective of being
able of to re-focus rapidly between different operations. At the same time, they will further develop
**specializations (niche capabilities) important for deployment in operations, adding considerable**
value to the national commitments to NATO. This is particularly relevant in the protection against
weapons of mass destruction and passive surveillance systems in the ISTAR domain.

The capabilities for the support of civil authorities in a national crisis situation will be maintained
at the necessary level. Emphasis will be placed on supporting the Integrated Rescue System functions
during search-and-rescue activities and consequence management functions. The Czech Armed
Forces will be prepared to protect critical infrastructure, reinforce the Police of the Czech Republic
in its efforts to preserve internal order and security including border security. The Active Reserve
Force can also be called upon to perform these tasks.

**1** A Reach Back information support system is a capability which provides the commander and the staff of operationally deployed
units with timely and reliable expert information from external sources.

###### 11


-----

The Ministry of Defence will further coordinate the development of **the State Defence System,**
as part of the State Security System, with state administrations and municipal authorities. A close
link to the Alliance will be maintained by using the already established processes of defence and
operational planning, including the NATO Crisis Response System (NCRS). In order to sustain
the mobilization capability of the Czech Armed Forces, the following must be ensured: planning
and implementation measures concerning the operational preparation of the state territory;
mobilization preparations, including the defence education system, material security of mobilization
using the System of Economic Measures for Crisis Situations; mobilization supplies; material
resources and the transfer of military material from units undergoing modernization. An analysis
of trends in the security environment and their impacts on the Czech Republic’s defence status will
be conducted as part of annual review of the Czech National Defence.

###### KEY CAPABILITIES OF THE CZECH ARMED FORCES

The Czech Armed Forces will be developed within the framework of seven key capability areas:
Prepare, Project, Engage, Sustain, Consult, Command and Control, and Protect and Inform[2].
Interoperability as the common denominator of all key capabilities will grow in significance.

These capabilities are essential for the accomplishment of the most important tasks and com­
mit­ments to NATO, and they will continue to be the determining basis for the build-up of all
the components of the Czech Armed Forces.

##### BASIC TRENDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CZECH ARMED FORCES

###### MILITARY INTELLIGENCE

In order to ensure the early identification of strategic threats to the Czech Republic, the capabilities
of the **military intelligence will be developed in cooperation with other intelligence services**
in order to allow sufficient time for the reinforcement and further build-up of defence capacities.
At the same time, the strategic warning and risk and crisis response system will be developed
in connection with NATO and the EU[3]. An emphasis will be put on the development of source and
analytical capabilities and timely reporting to the authorized recipients. This will require investment
in technology in all intelligence-related fields.

**2** Key capabilities (former Essential Operational Capabilities) are defined under the title “main capability areas” in MC 400/3 art. 67
of MC Guidance on the military implementation of NATO’s Strategic Concept.
**3** NCRS, EU Early Warning System.

###### 12


-----

###### COMMAND STRUCTURE AND COMMAND AND CONTROL

**The command structure of the Czech Armed Forces will be developed according to its ambitions**
within the scope necessary to provide joint, enduring and reliable command and control in operations,
including multinational operations, with concurrent efficient fulfilment of ­day-to-day tasks within
the Czech Republic. Therefore, commanders and staff will be sent to operate in international
environments within the NATO Command Structure and the NATO Force Structure, primarily as part
of an affiliation effort. This allows for the acquirement of skills that cannot be gained within the national
system due to the absence of a command structure higher than brigade level.
Besides the peacetime system of command and control, the Czech Armed Forces will have
a **command and control system for operations with rapid build-up capability conducted**
inside/or outside the territory of the Czech Republic. The deployable system of command and control
will be built up to mechanized brigade level. As a matter of priority, a modern and flexible system
using state-of-the-art technology will be developed. The system will enable communication with other
players in the area of operations and coordination of joint activities. National logistic, administrative
**and operational processes of command and control will be compatible with those of NATO and the EU.**
The Network Enabled Capability (NEC) concept will be implemented into the Czech Armed Forces.

###### CYBER DEFENCE

Information security, intelligence and Command and Control (C2) systems will be ensured by
an intensive build-up of **cyber defence capabilities (as part of Cyber Defence and Information**
Assurance activities) in the form of passive, preventive and reactive measures in the areas
of technology and personnel. Military Intelligence and the Armed Forces will develop cyber warfare
capabilities while ensuring the principle of “jointness”. Investments are planned for personnel
recruitment and training, as well as technology.

###### LAND FORCES

**Land forces will primarily consist of mechanized brigades equipped with various types of combat**
vehicles (wheeled and tracked), including tanks to ensure the execution of the different combat
activities. The comprehensive “21st Century Soldier” program is the main tool for achieving
interoperability on a tactical level. Automated and remote controlled systems and devices without
direct human involvement will be used increasingly to protect lives during operations. Their
importance will continue to grow, and legislation will be adopted accordingly.
Priority will be given to comprehensive, real-time situational awareness capabilities in a current area
**of interest. Ground and air reconnaissance, and surveillance capabilities will be developed, and NATO**
projects focusing on the establishment of a complete structure supported up to strategic level.
**Military reconnaissance and electronic warfare will remain one of the crucial components**
of combat support for the successful planning and execution of combat activity. This development
will be centred on advanced systems of monitoring, evaluation and transfer of situational awareness
information, active engagement, use of robotic systems, autonomous/unmanned sensors (including
drones), and passive surveillance systems. The Czech Republic will continue its fully-fledged
participation in the NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) and NATO Airborne Early Warning and
Control System (NAEW&C) programmes.

###### 13


-----

**Artillery development will focus on enhancing fire support, including precision engagement,**
precise target acquisition and evaluation, and the capability of fire support over a range of 40 km
as required by NATO. To this end, the adequate parameters for equipment, fire control systems and
general operational support need to be achieved.
**Engineer corps capabilities will primarily focus on developing a wide range of operations by setting**
up engineer task forces consisting of specialized modules to support operations in difficult climatic
and terrain conditions as well as urban terrain operations.
A capability of adequate force protection against improvised explosive devices (C-IED) will be provided
in conjunction with Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) defence capabilities. Capabilities
for the support of the functions of the Integrated Rescue System will be maintained.
In CBRN defence, impetus will be given to the development of specific capabilities of CBRN units
in the field of detection and decontamination with the aim of maintaining a considerable contribution
to the allied capabilities within NRF, as well as to the development of a joint Czech-British CBRN defence
brigade command for Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC). Attention will be paid to the development
of capabilities necessary for the effective protection of civilians, critical infrastructure and consequence
management in humanitarian crisis and natural disasters. The build-up of the NATO CBRN Reach-Back
capability will continue at the Joint CBRN Defence Centre of Excellence (COE) in Vyškov. Emphasis
will be placed on the effective use of CBRN defence experts, both in Czech units and international
structures. Biological defence capabilities will be developed in cooperation with the Ministry of Health
at the Centre of Biological Protection in Těchonín.

###### AIR DEFENCE AND AIR FORCE

It will be necessary to maintain and further develop the structure of surveillance comprising radars,
including 3D models, passive surveillance systems, high-quality command and control system
technology and communications, active ground-to-air assets, subsonic and supersonic air capabilities.
The minimum standard will be to provide air defence within the framework of the NATINAMDS and
in the performance of national air defence system missions.
With respect to NATO’s needs and trends concerning military science and strategy, **a close air**
**support to land forces will be developed. The aim of the supersonic air force development will**
be the **ability to participate in a wide range of operations, as well as full interoperability**
within NATO. Besides air-policing missions, the capability of sending at least two aircraft
to operations outside the Czech Republic will be required. In order to improve the development
**of the supersonic air force capabilities the L-159 aircraft will be used for pilot training.**
When developing training programmes further emphasis will be placed on the strengthening
of international cooperation.
**Air force transport systems will maintain passenger and cargo aircraft ranging from light to medium**
aircraft capable of transporting personnel and some combat equipment up to strategic distances.
Priority will be given to the acquisition of at least two medium sized transport aircraft after 2020.
Strategic air transport involvement will be guaranteed when participating in multinational programmes
(e.g. the Strategic Airlift Interim Solution program (SALIS) or others).
**Helicopter air force will remain an indispensable part of the Czech Armed Forces, and it will be**
key contributing factor to carrying out foreign missions. Helicopter forces will be further developed
in order to fulfil a wide range of operational missions, including tasks in support of the Special Forces
and the Integrated Rescue System. The biggest share will be medium sized transport helicopters and

###### 14


-----

multipurpose helicopters. Training, maintenance and modernization capability will be developed
to meet the needs of the Czech Armed Forces and of the Alliance. Priority will be given to operations
training at the Multinational Aviation Training Centre (MATC) focusing on standardization and
the efficient training of helicopter crew and ground technical specialist.

###### SPECIAL FORCES

**Special Forces will be developed according to the principle of maintaining strategic relevance.**
They must be capable of carrying out joint operations with allied forces and other components
of the Czech Armed Forces. Emphasis will be placed on flexibility in performing various types
of operations, on acquiring strategic information in complex environments and the support
of security units and components in an authorised area of operation. The priority is to maintain
the high standard of Special Forces personnel, and to equip them with state-of-the-art weapons
and other high level technological materiel.

###### LOGISTICS

An effort will be made to focus on supporting the function of stationary logistics and its effective
link with mobile logistics. In order to achieve this objective, it will be necessary to provide personnel
training, progressively modernize logistic infrastructure, and intensively use various functions
of the logistics information system. To coordinate multinational logistics in operational deployment
conditions, the activities of the Multinational Logistics Coordination Centre (MLCC) will continue.
Within the framework of collective defence, Host Nation Support (HNS) guidelines and regulations
will be further developed. The Ministry of Defence will play a coordination role at national level.

###### MILITARY HEALTHCARE

**Military healthcare will concentrate on the development of field hospitals, services of garrisons and**
military healthcare facilities, medical material storage and the corresponding healthcare personnel
training, focusing on possible deployment in a wide range of operations. The activities of military
healthcare in the protection of public health will continue.

###### MILITARY POLICE

**Military Police will have the capability of police force protection in areas of their operational**
deployment, as well as the capability of stabilization and post-conflict operations. Within the Czech
Republic, it will maintain the ability to provide police protection of personnel, units and defence
department facilities. The Military Police will strengthen its capability of assigning its units
to the different components of NATO, EU, and UN police forces, while non-lethal capabilities and
biometrics will be further developed and implemented into the Czech Armed Forces. Military Police
will be prepared to reinforce the Police of the Czech Republic.

### VI. PREREQUISITES FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF MILITARY CAPABILITIES

###### THE SUCCESS OF THE CZECH NATIONAL POLITICAL AND MILITARY AMBITIONS IS RELIANT ON:
– The Medium-term financial perspective of the resource framework for the defence budget and
an adequate annual budget;
– A stable environment for the Czech Armed Forces personnel development;
– Support to the Czech defence industry and utilization of the research, development and
innovation outcome, which in turn will help the Czech Armed Forces to achieve its required
capabilities;
– An amendment of legislation with respect to the Act on Public Procurement.

###### DEFENCE BUDGET AND BUDGET OUTLOOK

The basic prerequisite for ensuring an efficient state of defence will be the establishment
of the ­mid-term perspective of the resource framework for the MoD. Only if this condition is met,
can the implementation of the most important military capabilities be assured in an efficient,
conceptual and timely way. This approach is also essential for respecting the principles of fair
burden sharing within NATO and the EU.

Besides the mid-term budgetary perspective, the size of the annual defence budget is important
in achieving political-military ambitions. Based on factual and financial analyses, and on the mid-term
MoD planning, the minimum defence budget for initiating military capability development is 50 billion
CZK (at 2014 figures).

Should key modernization projects be implemented, the required stocks of military materiel created,
the expenses for completing military personnel covered and the other measures taken, the defence
budget will have to have progressively reached, by the mid-term perspective (year 2020), the amount
of 55 to 60 billion CZK (at 2014 figures), which represents approximately 1.4% of GDP. The key prerequisite
is to secure predictable long-term funding which allows for the efficient long-term planning and capability
development of the Czech Armed Forces. The optimum amount for defence expenditure needed
to achieve the political and military ambitions and commitments of the Czech Republic is, however,
2 % of GDP level, the amount which has also been set out in NATO’s Political Guidance and reaffirmed
at the Wales Summit in 2014 by NATO heads of state and governments, including the Czech Republic.

###### 16


-----

The third basis for ensuring military capabilities development is to allocate 20% of total defence expenditure
to the acquisition or modernization of major weapon systems, including related research. At the same time,
it is necessary to respect the premise that personnel expenditure does not exceed 50 % of the defence
budget.

###### PERSONNEL DEVELOPMENT

A key factor in achieving the capabilities of the armed forces is personnel, and implementation
of adequate legislative measures. Recruitment, education and training of highly qualified military
servicemen and civilian personnel and welfare are a priority. From the available demographical
analyses, it is evident that in the next ten years the number of citizens of the ideal recruitment age,
18 to 25 years, will decrease. It is therefore important that the MoD is perceived as a responsible,
reliable and attractive employer able to compete in the labour market.

The University of Defence will play a key role in the education system of the Czech Armed Forces.
Other national educational institutions and training institutions, as well as the key regional partners,
and NATO will play an important role in education.

In a period when the Czech Republic is not facing a direct threat to its security, the Czech Armed
Forces will continue to function with peacetime military capabilities and personnel strength.
The crucial role for augmenting personnel to the required manning levels will be played by an active
reserve of up to five thousand people. The MoD will also educate Czech citizens for state defence and
provide training for civil servants of state administrations, municipalities, and citizens in the event
of the mobilization of the Czech Armed Forces.

###### DEFENCE INDUSTRY AND RESEARCH

A significant area for the development and maintenance of national defence capabilities is the do­
mes­tic defence and security industry. The MoD, in cooperation with defence industries, must
strive to preserve key industry capacities whose role is to safeguard the essential security interests
of the Czech Republic. For this reason, the MoD entered into an agreement with the Defence and
Security Industry Association of the Czech Republic in 2010.

###### THIS ONGOING POLICY FOR THE MOD’S COOPERATION WITH INDUSTRY IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING PRESUMPTIONS:
– The domestic market is crucial for the Czech Defence Industry in order to be able to provide
the necessary support with respect to basic national security interests;
– Priority is given to joint acquisition of products that meet the interoperability requirements
of other international partners, especially NATO and EU allies;
– For economic sustainability, business potential and competitiveness, it is essential that
the defence industries are also competitive in foreign markets;

###### 17


-----

– In order to sustain multinational cooperation development regionally and in a wider context,
it is vital to seek out opportunities where the Czech Defence Industry can participate in the supply
chain of multinational projects Central Europe is currently one of the Czech Republic core
interests in this respect;
– In order to meet the specific requirement of the Czech Armed Forces, it is essential to further
develop state enterprises that have been established by the Ministry of Defence.

This document sets out the framework for defence capabilities that the MoD and the Czech Armed
Forces will build-up in the coming decades according to the approved level of ambition and
operational requirements.

The MoD will support the development of research and industrial capabilities based on the needs
of the Czech Armed Forces and the Czech Defence Industry to support competition, not only
in the Czech market but also in the European and global markets, in order to maintain and develop
its competitiveness in the medium term.

Dialogue is an important tool in enhancing the development of capabilities and competitiveness
in the domestic defence industry, and an intrinsic area of such dialogue will be the annual national
armament conference which focuses on the mid and long term acquisition plans of the MoD.

Cooperation with the relevant NATO and EU agencies, such as the NATO Support and Procurement
Agency (NSPA) and the European Defence Agency (EDA) will remain an indispensable part
of the process to achieving the necessary military capabilities.

### VII. CONCLUSIONS

The Long Term Perspective was developed to represent the period up to 2030. A review may
be carried out after four years. Should the Defence Strategy of the Czech Republic and political and
military ambitions change, or should qualitative changes occur in the security environment which
would then have a significant impact on the Czech Republic’s defence position then the Long Term
Perspective will be reviewed earlier.

A follow-up document to the Long Term Perspective titled the Concept of the Czech Armed Forces
Development 2025 will be issued in the future which will translate the contents of the Long Term
Perspective into specific military solutions and procedures in order to achieve these ambitions.

###### The Long Term Perspective for Defence 2030 was approved by the Governmental Resolution of 15 June 2015, Nr. 466 19
