## Preface

_The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared the_
_second summary Report on the Foreign Policy of_
_the Czech Republic, this time for the year 2000._
_It submits to the reader a detailed review of the_
_activities of the state in the sphere of foreign_
_policy. It enables the reader to assess the way the_
_Government has been applying its policy_
_statement of August 1998 and its Concept of the_
_Foreign Policy of the Czech Republic, which it_
_approved in February 1999 and which was endorsed by the Chamber of_
_Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic in June 1999._

_Foreign policy plays a major role in the policy of each state, the Czech_
_Republic notwithstanding. Demands placed on Czech foreign policy were_
_particularly great in 2000 since that was the time the basic political and_
_security outline was created alongside the conditions for the favourable_
_progress of the Czech Republic in the 21st century._

_The foreign policy of the Czech Republic was oriented towards factors and_
_forces which support peace, stability, security, order, and those that can be_
_foreseen and ensure continuity. In this respect it has scored a number of_
_positive results. “The Report on the Foreign Policy of the Czech Republic_
_for the year 2000” provides concrete testimony to this effect._

_Jan Kavan_
_Deputy Prime Minister of the Government_
_and Minister of Foreign Affairs_
_of the Czech Republic_

## Introduction

In 2000, the Czech Republic continued to apply the foreign policy objectives
formulated in the Government s policy statement of August 1998 and in the Concept
of the Foreign Policy of the Czech Republic, approved by the Government of the
Czech Republic in February 1999 and noted by the Chamber of Deputies of the
Parliament of the Czech Republic in June 1999. Within the limits of its possibilities,
it pursued an active foreign policy, did its utmost to consolidate its position in
international organizations, devoted attention to promoting bilateral relations at
a regional and global level and expanded its foreign policy activities also at other
levels, on an economic, cultural and public, as well as non-governmental scale. As of
2000, the Czech Republic was a member of 56 international organizations, it
maintained diplomatic relations with 176 states and had 114 embassies worldwide.
New embassies have been opened in Tallinn (Estonia) and in Tbilisi (Georgia); it was
also decided to establish an embassy in Luxembourg.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic focused its activities
primarily on the strategic priorities of Czech foreign policy integration in the
European Union, membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, promoting
relations with neighbouring states and multilateral regional cooperation. Emphasis
was placed on economic diplomacy and strengthening external economic relations.
Accession to the European Union is the primary foreign policy priority of the
Czech Republic. It sees in European integration as the best way of safeguarding its
fundamental interests. The exceptional importance of the European Union confirms
the scope of mutual economic exchanges. The EU is the Czech Republic s main
economic partner and accounts for almost two-thirds of the overall turnover of the
country s foreign trade. During the first ten months of the year 2000, there was
a 23.1% increase in Czech exports to the EU, and a 25.6% increase in imports from
the EU.
In the frame of negotiations on the accession to the EU launched in 1998, the
Czech Republic had submitted position documents on 29 negotiation chapters on EU
by the end of 1999. By the end of the first half of 2000, when Portugal was holding
the rotating presidency of the EU, negotiations commenced on all 29 chapters. In
2000, 13 chapters had been preliminarily completed. The opening of all 29 chapters
during the first half of the year created the conditions for a transition to a qualitatively
higher stage of negotiations the stage of identifying concrete problems, eliminating


-----

those that could be removed by further mutual clarification of positions, and the
prerequisites for gradual negotiations on the most problematic spheres.
The French rotating presidency in the second half of the year placed the main
emphasis on the successful completion of the Inter-Governmental Conference on the
reform of the EU institutions. The Inter-Governmental Conference was, indeed,
completed at the Nice Summit of the EU in December 2000. The Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic J. Kavan expressed his
satisfaction at the overall outcome of the Summit with a reservation on the distribution
of mandates in the European Parliament, according to which the Czech Republic and
Hungary were allocated only 20 mandates in the European Parliament, while the
present EU Member States with the same population have 22 mandates.
The preparation for negotiations on the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU
required complex institutional and organizational arrangements, directly interlinked
with an internal domestic process of preparing for EU membership. All sectors of the
state administration became involved. The Government Committee on the European
Integration is the body controlling the process, while the Prime Minister acts as its
head. The coordinating role has been entrusted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of
the Czech Republic.
Deadlines for adopting legal norms relating to EU laws were reduced as much as
possible and were made more effective by amending the rules of procedure of the
Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic. This was done based
on a broad political consensus on the importance of preparations for accession to the
EU and on the basis of an agreement between the Government and the Parliament.
The Government approved an updated version of the National Programme of
preparations for the EU membership, which contained short-term and medium-term
tasks in those spheres, where full preparedness has not yet been achieved. Increased
attention was devoted to educating members of the civil service in European affairs
and in the communication strategy vis-a‘-vis the public. The Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of the Czech Republic was made responsible for implementing these tasks on
the basis of documents approved by the Government.
The predominantly favourable assessment of the Czech Republic in the Annual
Report of the European Commission was a great encouragement to the country in its
preparations for the accession to the EU, even though criticism prevails in certain
spheres. The European Commission shifted the emphasis in assessing the progress of
preparations from the harmonization of legislation to progress in the application of
legal provisions already harmonized. As a follow-up to its regular report, the
European Commission has issued a document entitled Strategy for Enlargement,
which stipulates that negotiations with the candidate countries who fulfilled the
criteria for membership are to be completed in the course of 2002. This would mean
that new members could be admitted as of the end of 2002.


-----

The Czech Republic has gradually harmonized its foreign policy with the Common
Foreign and Security Policy of the EU, to the extent that this is made possible by its status
as an associate member. It has also endeavoured to be involved to a maximum degree in
formulating the Common European Security and Defence Policy, while stressing the
most effective arrangement of institutional relations between the EU and NATO.
In its preparations for the accession to the EU, the Czech Republic has jointly
consulted on matters concerning the European integration within the framework of
candidate countries of the so-called Luxembourg Group and as part of cooperation
between the countries of the Visegrad Group, where Prime Ministers of these
countries regularly meet EU partner countries.
By joining NATO in 1999, the Czech Republic solved the basic problem of its
security. The strategic position of the state changed fundamentally. The Czech Republic
became a full participant in the consultation mechanism on all security matters in the
Euro-Atlantic area. In 2000, one year after becoming a member of NATO, the Czech
Republic took an active part in the activities of all political and military branches of the
Alliance. The Czech Republic has a long-term strategic interest in continuing the
process of enlarging NATO. It hopes that the upcoming Prague Summit of the Alliance
will invite other countries willing and capable of accepting the responsibilities and
obligations of membership. It is aware of the interconnection between further
enlargement and the capacity of new members to live up to their commitments. The
decision of the December meeting of the Alliance foreign ministers to hold the next
NATO summit in 2002 in Prague was a success for the Czech Republic.
In 2000, the Czech Republic concluded the process of adapting its internal national
security legislation. It adhered to all multilateral NATO treaties and agreements and
began professional cooperation at various specialist levels on the basis of applicable
relevance. It continued to adapt its armed forces in accordance with the NATO
Strategic Concept and to ensure the complete integration of the Czech Army in the
military bodies and the NATO integrated structure. Work continued in the course of
the year on the new Security Strategy of the Czech Republic, which the Government
approved in January 2001. This document replaced the Security Strategy of the Czech
Republic of 1999 and is based on the position of the Czech Republic as a NATO
member state. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic took a significant
part in its preparation. The Ministry collaborated with the Ministry of Defence in
drawing up conceptual documents for the structure of the armed forces. It participated
in the institutionalisation of crisis planning, alongside other ministries.
The Czech Republic, together with other Alliance member states, took part in
discussions on international security. The Alliance devoted its main attention to the
security and stabilization of the situation in South-Eastern Europe, to relations with
the EU, with the Russian Federation, and with Ukraine, and to the further enlargement
of the Alliance.


-----

The Czech Republic took an active part in NATO missions in Bosnia and
Herzegovina and in Kosovo with the objective to implement the policy of the
Alliance in South-Eastern Europe, aimed at integrating the region in the EuroAtlantic community. The Government of the Czech Republic decided to extend the
Czech participation in both missions in 2001 at the same size as in 2000, i.e. one
mechanized battalion in Bosnia and Herzegovina (approx. 600 persons) and one
reinforced company in Kosovo (approx. 200 persons). Apart from military
participation, the Czech Republic prepared internal conditions for sending nonmilitary experts to foreign missions.
In 2000, the Embassy of the Czech Republic in Lithuania in Vilnius became the
NATO contact embassy for Lithuania. The Czech Republic thus became involved in the
programme of NATO contact embassies in partner countries. This programme helps to
present the policy, the activities and the objectives of NATO and ensures a two-way
communication between the partner country and the NATO Headquarters. The Czech
Republic also offered the candidate countries, mainly Slovakia and Latvia, help in their
preparation for membership. The activities of the Western European Union (WEU)
have been reduced as the Common European Security and Defence Policy expanded.
Responsibility for the application of the so-called Petersberg missions has been
transferred to the EU. The Czech Republic, as an associate member of the WEU, took
part in practically all the WEU activities. The Czech Republic wanted its position as an
associate member of the WEU to be replaced by a mechanism of intensive cooperation
of the six European states which are members of NATO but not members of the EU (the
so-called NEEA). A meeting of the West European Armament Group (WEAG) took
place simultaneously with the session of the WEU in Marseilles in November 2000,
where it was decided to reduce the activities of the WEU. It was at this session that six
new members, including the Czech Republic, were accepted into WEAG. For the Czech
Republic this was the culmination of long efforts to achieve full membership in this
organization, which opens new opportunities for the Czech defence industry.
Good relations with neighbouring states are a major priority of the Czech foreign
policy.
The strengthening of relations with Slovakia have confirmed that they are of
a special nature. With the problems concerning the division of the property of the
former Czechoslovak Federal Republic settled in 1999, contacts in all spheres and at all
levels were intensified in 2000. The contractual base in those areas, which offer specific
benefit to the citizens of both countries such as culture, education, and health care, has
been expanded. Expanding cross-border cooperation also helped to strengthen mutual
relations. Regional cooperation, above all within the Visegrad Group, but also within
the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) and the Central European
Initiative (CEI), also developed successfully. The Czech Republic supported efforts by
Slovakia to become a member of NATO and of the European Union.


-----

Relations with the Federal Republic of Germany have attained the best level since
the establishment of the Czech Republic. After its accession to NATO, Germany has
become an ally of the Czech Republic for the first time in modern history. Germany
is among the staunchest champions of the enlargement of the EU. The Governments
of the two countries have taken a number of steps towards settling problems of the
past and stressed that their relations must concentrate on the future. In 2000, an
agreement was reached with Germany on compensation to be paid to citizens of the
Czech Republic who were forced to slave labour during the Second World War. In
July 2000, the _Bundestag passed a law on the establishment of a Foundation_
Remembrance, Responsibility, and Future . Economic and regional cooperation
intensified. Germany was the biggest trade partner of the Czech Republic in 2000,
Czech-German trade amounted to 36% of the overall foreign trade turnover of the
Czech Republic. Germany was the biggest foreign investor in the Czech Republic.
Relations between the Czech Republic and Poland saw another positive
development in 2000 and have been especially good. They are founded on common
historical experiences, common interests, and from 1999 also on the alliance of
the two countries in NATO. Both countries cooperate in preparing for the European
Union membership. Relations have also centred on regional cooperation and in the
Central European area have been a significant stabilizing factor. Emphasis was placed
also on economic relations mutual trade has grown.
Economic relations between the Czech Republic and Austria have also increased.
The Czech-Austrian trade has developed most dynamically. Austria has continued to
be the third biggest trade partner of the Czech Republic and the third biggest investor.
However, certain problems arose in 2000 in the Czech-Austrian relations in the
political sphere. The Czech Republic participated in the measures taken by 14 EU
member states in response to the fact that the programme of the new Austrian
Government contained certain elements, which were problematic for the Czech
Republic. Mutual relations were also marked by a different approach to the
completion of the Temelin nuclear power plant. A meeting of the Prime Ministers of
the two countries in Melk in December 2000 laid a basis for a gradual improvement
of relations at the political level. Cultural cooperation continued and contacts in
border regions were strengthened. The agreement reached on compensation to Czech
citizens who during the Second World War were forced to slave labour in Austria had
a positive effect on bilateral relations.
Hungary is a significant partner of the Czech Republic in Central Europe. In 2000,
relations were characterized by a dynamic and all-encompassing development of
cooperation on a bilateral and multilateral scale and, above all, as partners in NATO.
The renewed regional cooperation between the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland,
and Slovakia was further strengthened within the Visegrad Group (V4). Apart from
contacts between the Presidents and Prime Ministers of these countries, contacts also


-----

continued on a parliamentary and expert level and there were many negotiations
between the ministries. The establishment of the one million euro Visegrad Fund to
support the scientific, educational, and cultural cooperation was a significant success.
Another priority of the restored Visegrad Cooperation which has been accomplished
was the support of Slovakia in its effort to become a member of NATO and the EU.
The Visegrad Group has become a respected regional association. Frequent meetings
of the Prime Ministers of the V4 countries with top representatives of the European
Union Member States testify to this.
On a regional level, the Czech Republic participated in cooperation within CEFTA
by promoting the economic progress of the participating countries, strengthening
trade exchanges, and integration in the EU. In 2000, all the CEFTA member states
were negotiating their accession to the EU.
In 2000, the Czech Republic paid great attention to the CEI, which includes
17 countries of Eastern and South-Eastern Europe. Hungary held the presidency of
the CEI in 2000. The Czech Republic, as the presiding country the previous year, was
active within the so-called troika . The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was
accepted to the CEI at the summit in Budapest. The Czech Republic supported the
membership the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
The Czech Republic participated actively in the implementation of the Stability
Pact for South-Eastern Europe, while aiming to acquire the status of a full participant
and member. It concentrated on developing a political dialogue between the member
countries on current problems pertaining to the development of the region, the
preparation of high-quality projects of the CEI and the Stability Pact for SouthEastern Europe, with emphasis on creating democratic institutions and a constitutional
state, the defence of human rights, the achievement of European standards, and the
restoration of trade and economic ties in the region with the participation of Czech
firms. A Czech-Greek Council was set up in the context of the Stability Pact for
South-Eastern Europe. It was inaugurated by the Foreign Minister of the Czech
Republic Jan Kavan on the basis of a Memorandum on Cooperation in the Economic
Restoration of South-Eastern Europe.
Bilateral relations between the Czech Republic and the member states of NATO and
the EU were further strengthened in 2000 as part of the ties of alliance within NATO
and preparations for the accession to the European Union. Relations between the
Czech Republic and its Trans-Atlantic partners, the US and Canada, were further
intensified. The alliance within NATO and the accession partnership with the EU were
favourably reflected in the bilateral relations of the Czech Republic with the most
influential West European countries Great Britain and France. The Czech Republic
strengthened its relations also with other states in the common Euro-Atlantic area.
The Czech Republic placed great emphasis on reinforcing its relations with the EU
and NATO candidate countries. In line with the policy of the European Union, it


-----

participated in the political and economic stabilization of South-Eastern Europe. It
expected that the promising democratisation changes in the region, particularly in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, in 2000, would be reflected in the political and
economic stabilization of the region.
In its relations with the Russian Federation, the Czech Republic did its best to
restore standard contacts with emphasis on widening and deepening economic
cooperation. The Czech Republic devoted attention to relations with Ukraine. With
the aim of harmonizing its visa policy with that of the EU, the Czech Republic
introduced visas in 2000 with the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, and other
states of the former Soviet Union.
The Czech Republic stepped up its efforts to increase its relations with the
countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. The essence of these relations was in the
economic sphere. In 2000, the contractual basis was extended mainly in the sphere of
visas and trade.
The activities of the Czech Republic in international organizations fully reflected
the growing significance of multilateral diplomacy in international relations. This
applies both to world and to regional organizations. The Czech Republic was
increasingly involved in their activities.
The main event in the United Nations (UN) in 2000 was the Millennium Summit.
In the Millennium Declaration adopted at the Summit, the international community
expressed its support for the irreplaceable role of the UN, for the use of its potential
in solving global problems and making its work more effective. By submitting its own
proposals, by co-sponsoring a number of resolutions, and by adopting its independent
positions, the Czech Republic took an active part in the Millennium Summit and in
the subequent fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the UN, special followup meetings, meetings of commissions and bodies of the Economic and Social
Council of the UN, and in the UN programmes and international specialized
organizations. In the UN Human Rights Commission, it tabled, for the second time,
alongside Poland, a resolution on the state of human rights in Cuba. The resolution
was passed by a majority of votes by the Commission. The Czech Republic,
furthermore, submitted a draft resolution on so-called thematic procedures, which
was also adopted. It supported measures to make the activities of the UN
peacekeeping forces more effective. In 2000, as in the previous period, the Czech
Republic was involved in UN peacekeeping operations in various parts of the world.
It decided to send a large number of police officers to the UN operations in Kosovo
and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Czech Republic traditionally devoted great attention to the activities of the
United Nations in the sphere of the non-proliferation of arms, arms control and
disarmament. It welcomed the successful conclusion of the Sixth Review Conference
of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and joined the efforts of


-----

the international community to prevent the illegal trade in small arms and light
weapons. The Czech Republic took part in dealing with the problem of the poorest
developing countries, in finding new ways of financing development aid and social
affairs. It supported a policy of full employment, the application of recommendations
of the International Labour Organization and took an active part in Conference of the
Parties to the Climate Change Convention.
In 2000, the Czech Republic was also active in the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). It cooperated within its political, security and human
rights dimension. The activities of the OSCE during this period concentrated mainly
on South-East European problems, on the preparation of the OSCE Document on
Small Arms and Light Weapons, on the implementation of the results of the Istanbul
Summit of November 1999 and on the preparation of the session of the OSCE
Ministerial Council. The Czech Republic continued its efforts to strengthen the
operative activities of the OSCE. The Czech diplomacy was striving to increase the
participation of Czech representatives in the structures of the organization. The
participation of the Czech Republic in OSCE missions was highly appreciated. Close
cooperation with the partners and allies in NATO, the EU and the Visegrad Group was
a characteristic feature of the activities of the Czech Republic in the OSCE.
As a member of the preparatory group, the Czech Republic took part in 2000 in
preparations for the Community of Democracies Conference. It was held in Warsaw
in June 2000, was attended by 107 countries and it ended by the signing of the
Warsaw declaration. In line with its Concept of Foreign Policy, the Czech Republic
regarded the conference as an opportunity for deepening cooperation between
democratic countries in their endeavour to build and consolidate a community of
peace, security, cooperation, democracy and prosperity. The Czech Republic will
remain a member of the preparatory group for the Community of Democracies
Conference, in which there are two representatives for Europe, Africa, America and
Asia.
In 2000, the Czech Republic devoted great attention to the activities of the
Council of Europe. The Chairman of the Parliamentary Assembly Lord RussellJohnson visited the Czech Republic in June 2000. In September 2000, Prague
hosted the meeting of the Political Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the
Council of Europe. The Czech Republic continued to advocate the so-called Czech
initiatives on the establishment of a General Court of Justice in the Council of
Europe, which would ensure a uniform interpretation and application of all Council
of Europe treaties.
The year 2000 was marked by intensive efforts by the Czech Republic to be
included in the contractual mechanism of the Council of Europe. As of 31 December,
2000, the Czech Republic is the contractual party of 73 and signatory of 23 treaties;
this has placed it in the first place among those states which became members of the


-----

Council of Europe after 1990. In 2000, the Czech Republic deposited 14 ratification
documents or papers on adherence and signed 16 treaties. Of the total number of
59 treaties of the Council of Europe, which are important for the accession to the EU,
the Czech Republic is a contractual party to 41 and signatory of 11 treaties. Among
the most noteworthy steps taken by the Czech Republic towards its incorporation in
the contractual base of the Council of Europe in 2000 was its signing of the Revised
Social Charter and 12 protocols of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
and Fundamental Freedoms stipulating a general ban on discrimination.
The defence and promotion of human rights is one of the priorities of Czech
foreign policy. The Czech Republic pays attention especially to specific aspects of
human rights but neither does it ignore relations with certain countries or regions.
Czech foreign policy gives pride of place in the field of human rights to the rights of
ethnic minorities (especially in relation to the issue of the Roma community), the
rights of women and children, as well as the issue of refugees. Emphasis was placed
on the European dimension of the Roma problem. Possible solutions to the Roma
problem were explored within international organizations, especially the UN, the
OSCE and the Council of Europe.
The visit of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata in the Czech
Republic in February 2000, in connection with upgrading the UNHCR Liaison
Bureau to a branch of the UNHCR in the Czech Republic, was a significant event.
The high commissioner expressed her satisfaction at the situation in the Czech
Republic in the field under her jurisdiction, she expressed appreciation for the new
asylum law, as well as for the progress which the Czech Republic had made over ten
years in its approach to refugees; she also praised the attitude and role of the state in
the integration of foreign nationals in society.
Development and humanitarian aid are part of the foreign policy of the Czech
Republic. It offers development aid mainly to countries which are on the path of
establishing or consolidating democracy and human rights or a market economy or
with which the Czech Republic has traditionally close relations. Foreign development
aid was offered mainly to Asia (33%), the Middle East (21%), Latin America (15%),
the East European countries (12%), the Balkans (12%) and Africa (7%).
In 2000, as in previous years, the Czech Republic also offered direct humanitarian
aid to countries hit by natural catastrophes or disasters, as part of the solidarity of the
international community. The state budget earmarked 30 million CZK for
humanitarian aid. This aid was provided either directly to the affected states or
through the intermediary of international governmental and non-governmental
organizations. It was directed to almost 30 countries.
The economic dimension of foreign policy continued to be strengthened in 2000 in
accordance with the Government Policy Statement and the Concept of Foreign
Policy. The agreement between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of


-----

Industry and Trade of 8 October, 1998, on reinforcing the trade and economic sections
of embassies has been updated. Representatives of the business community declared
that the material, personnel and methodical reinforcement of trade and economic
sectors had helped to improve the effectiveness of Czech economic diplomacy.
In 2000, the Czech Republic took an active part in the work of international
economic organizations, especially CEFTA, WTO, OECD, and the IMF. The
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, in collaboration with other
ministries, contributed to the elaboration of documents for the top meetings of these
organizations. Appointments to the presidency of the Committee on Environment
Policy, to several posts of deputy-chairman in this field and the inclusion of the Czech
Republic representative in the working group for the preparation of a proposed review
of prospects and a strategy of the environment for the first ten years of the 21[st] century
can be regarded as a token of significant recognition of the work of the Czech
Republic in the OECD and as a success of economic diplomacy.
In 2000, the Czech Republic was given the task of organizing the Annual Meeting
of Boards of Governors of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. It
thus took its place among the group of twenty countries which have organized this
exceptionally demanding event during more than half a century of the existence of
these two most important financial institutions. The meeting was held in Prague on
26 28 September and was attended by some 20,000 persons from 182 countries all
over the world. All officials highly appreciated the efforts of the Czech Republic,
including the good organization of the Annual Meeting under most complicated
conditions.
The Czech Republic took part in the EXPO 2000 world fair in Hannover in 2000.
It had a unique opportunity to give a comprehensive overview of Czech culture
visitors at the fair. The Czech participation at EXPO 2000 was relatively successful
and met with a good response among visitors and the media.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic continued its efforts to raise
the quality of the foreign service. The application of the provisions of a Career Code,
which came into force on 1 January, 1999, and the introduction of a system of regular
training and assessment of each staff member allowed for the early implementation
of the principles of the law on the civil service. The Diplomatic Academy of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs introduced a system of educational and training papers in
order to provide for professional training in priority areas such as the European Union
and security policy.
Attention was devoted to creating a new information system and improving the
quality of organizational and administrative work. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs
website (www.mzv.cz) has been operational since 31 December, 1999, under the
terms of the law on free access to information. A department of public information
has been established to deal with queries from the public.

## I. MULTILATERAL COOPERATION

**1. Summary information on multilateral cooperation**

In 2000, the Czech Republic directed again its main attention to preparing
for incorporation in the European Union (EU). As part of negotiations on accession
to the European Union, the Czech Republic opened all 29 chapters; 13 of them have
been completed to date. An Inter-Governmental Conference on the Reform of
Institutions was completed at the December session of the European Council in Nice.
The reforms adopted, together with the approved document of the European
Commission, the Strategy of Enlargement, create the conditions for the enlargement
of the European Union by candidate countries, and its effective functioning.
Following the admission to NATO in 1999, the Czech Republic took part in all the
NATO activities during the year 2000, concentrating primarily on the situation in
South-Eastern Europe, relations between NATO and the EU, relations with the
Russian Federation and further enlargement of NATO. In accordance with NATO
requirements, the Czech Republic continued to reform its armed forces and
completed essential adaptations of its internal security legislation. The experience of
NATO so far and the active approach of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland
notwithstanding certain marginal shortcomings confirm that the decision to enlarge
the Alliance has been justified. A great success of the Czech diplomacy was the
decision of the December meeting of NATO foreign ministers to hold the next summit
of the Alliance in 2002 in Prague.
As in the previous period, the Czech Republic took an active part in the work of
the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). It devoted
appropriate attention to the political, security, economic and human rights dimensions
of the OSCE. A characteristic feature of the activities of the Czech Republic in the
OSCE was cooperation with its partners and allies in NATO, the EU and the Visegrad
Group. Efforts by the Czech Republic to intensify the OSCE operational activities also
continued in 2000. This was to be achieved through greater activity by representatives
of the Czech Republic in the work of the OSCE and their involvement in long-term
missions, as well as by a more representative participation of the Czech Republic in
the organisation s structures.
The Czech Republic participated in promoting a political dialogue with the
countries of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, and made a significant


-----

financial and material contribution to the establishment of democratic institutions,
projects for establishing democratic bodies, the defence of human rights, and
economic restoration of the region, both on a multilateral and bilateral scale. The
Czech Republic has begun to be regarded as a donor country.
The Czech Republic enjoyed high international appreciation for the way it
organised the Annual Meeting of Boards of Governors of the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank, which was held in Prague on 26 28 September, 2000. The
Government of the Czech Republic supported the procedure for Slovakia s accession
to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which was
successfully completed. After a five-year membership in the OECD, the Czech
Republic is gradually assuming a higher degree of responsibility. The fact that it took
over the chairmanship of the Committee on Environment Policy and took part in
preparing the environment strategy for the first decade of the new millennium
represented a major recognition for its work in the OECD. The experience gathered
in the OECD became a significant component of the preparation of the Czech
Republic for admission to the EU.
The interest of the international community in increasing the role of the United
Nations (UN) and making the work of this organisation more effective in dealing with
the pressing global problems facing mankind in the new millennium was reflected in
the adoption of the Millennium Declaration at the Millennium Summit. The Czech
Republic demonstrated its traditional positive approach towards the activities of the
United Nations in the course of the deliberations of the Millennium Summit, as well
as during the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, at two
special sessions of the General Assembly of the United Nations, in the commissions
and the bodies of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. In 2000,
the Czech Republic was involved in United Nations peacekeeping operations in
various parts of the world. The participation of Czech civilian police officers in
operations in Kosovo and Bosnia and Hercegovina was increased. The Czech
Republic, furthermore, expressed its unequivocal support for proposed measures to
make the UN peacekeeping operations more effective.
In the sphere of non-proliferation, arms control and disarmament, the Czech
Republic welcomed the successful conclusion of the Sixth Review Conference of the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and devoted great attention to
the hard work done by the international community to discontinue the illegal trade in
small arms and light weapons.
The Czech Republic took an active part in preparations for the United Nations
Third Conference on Least Developed Countries and in the search for new ways of
financing development cooperation as part of preparations for the International
Conference on Financing for Development. At the twenty-fourth special session of
the General Assembly of the United Nations on social development, the Czech


-----

Republic supported the so-called full-employment policy and the implementation of
accords of the International Labour Organization. The Czech delegation was active in
The Hague at the deliberations of the Sixth Conference of the Parties to the
Framework Convention on Climate Changes, and supported efforts towards
completing the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. The activities of Czech multilateral
diplomacy fully reflected the rising significance of multilateral diplomacy on
a worldwide scale.

_Information on the progress of negotiations on an agreement_
_on the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU_

The bilateral Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) on the accession of the Czech
Republic to the EU opened at ministerial level on 31 March, 1998.
The updating of screening (comparing legislation) took place in the first half of the
year 2000; it focused on the newly adopted acquis for 1999 and covered all twelve
candidate countries. The screening took place in writing when the Czech Republic
drew up reports on the appropriate chapters on the ability to take over the acquis for


-----

the period 1998 1999. The reports contained information on whether or not problems
are likely to arise during the period under discussion, as well as on when and how the
appropriate EU legislation would be adopted and implemented.
All the candidate countries also prepared reports on the progress achieved by
1 January, 2000, in the chapters which had been opened or preliminarily concluded
during negotiations with the EU (i.e. for 23 chapters). By the end of February 2000,
the Czech Republic had handed over reports on the progress made with regard to ten
chapters completed by this date, and by 19 April, 2000, reports on the remaining
chapters.
The European Commission used these reports in drawing up technical monitoring
tables, as well as for the so-called Annual Monitoring Report on Accession
Negotiations with the common objective to give the EU Member States a picture of
the state of preparation of a specific candidate country with regard to individual
chapters (at the moment only of the Luxembourg Group).
By the beginning of December 1999, the Czech Republic had submitted to the EU
Position Documents on all present 29 chapters. The documents on the chapters
Institution and Miscellaneous will be submitted to the EU in the final phase of the
accession negotiations in accordance with the agreement. On the basis of a request by
the EU, on 9 May, 2000, the Czech Republic submitted to the European Commission
supplements to all Position Documents. They contained the position of the Czech
Republic on the acceptance of the new acquis, adopted in 1998 1999. The Czech
Republic did not identify any problems connected with the acceptance of the new
acquis and will not request a transition period in this connection in any of the
chapters.
In the course of the accession negotiations at the level of representatives, new
chapters, Regional Policy and the Coordination of Structural Instruments and Finance
Control, were opened on 6 April, 2000. It was proposed to conclude in anticipation
of the chapter on Common Foreign and Security Policy. A further meeting at the
level of representatives was held on 26 May, 2000, where the chapters Freedom of
Movement of Persons, Co-operation in the Fields of Justice and Home Affairs,
Schengen and Financial and Budgetary Provisions were opened. At a ministerial
meeting on 14 June, 2000, the last chapter to be opened was Agriculture. The chapters
Common Foreign and Security Policy, Customs Union and, once a compromise has
been found, the chapter External Relations, were concluded. The number of the total
chapters concluded on a preliminary basis had thus reached 13.
The opening of all 29 chapters by the end of the presidency of Portugal created the
conditions for a transition to a qualitatively higher phase of negotiations to a phase
of substantive negotiations. It is in this phase that there will be an identification of
concrete problems, the elimination of those problems, which could be removed by
a further mutual clarification of positions and gradual negotiations on the most


-----

problematic spheres. A certain qualitative shift in the pre-accession negotiations was
evident already during the rotating French presidency when the EU accepted certain
requests on transitional periods of a technical nature.
During the French rotating presidency as well as during the previous presidency
the Inter-Governmental Conference met twice at the level of representatives
(5 October and 1 December) and once at the ministerial level (5 December). The
agenda once again included the chapters the Company Law, Transport Policy, Social
Policy and Employment, Regional Policy and Co-ordination of Structural
Instruments, and the Environment, but no major progress has been made in these
negotiations.
The original date of the second Inter-Governmental Conference at the level of
representatives was 16 November, 2000. The agenda was intended to include the
chapter Energy, possibly the Environment. In view of the fact that the Member States
failed to adopt a common position on either of the mentioned chapters, the Conference
was postponed. Following a number of negotiations between the Czech Republic and
Austria at various levels, a compromise version of the common position of the EU
was finally found, at least for the chapter Environment. That was discussed at an
alternative session at the level of representatives, held on 1 December, 2000. The
discussion of the chapter Energy was again postponed to the first half of 2001.
During the French rotating presidency, the Czech Republic did not succeed in
concluding any of the chapters ahead of time. The number of concluded preliminary
chapters remained at 13 (Cyprus concluded 17 preliminary chapters, Estonia 15 and
Hungary 14).
The main priority of the French rotating presidency was the successful conclusion
of the Inter-Governmental Conference on the reform of European Union institutions.

_Institutional and organizational arrangements of the internal preparation_
_for membership of the EU_

All departments of the state administrations were involved in preparing
negotiations on the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU.
In view of the consensus of political parties on the significance of preparations for
the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU, it has been possible to amend the
existing Standing Orders of the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic
Parliament. This amendment has made it possible to cut the process of passing laws,
which are linked with European law, including the possibility of adopting a legislative
proposal already during the first reading. On the basis of an agreement between the
Government and the Parliament of the Czech Republic, the legislative proposal was
submitted to the Committee for European Integration of the Chamber of Deputies of
the Parliament of the Czech Republic already during the interdepartmental proposals


-----

phase. The members of the Committee were thus able to become acquainted with the
proposal and possibly submit amendments before the Government approves it.
The Committee for European Integration was the major governmental body coordinating the preparation for the EU accession. Prime Minister acts as its head and
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs as executive deputy-chairman.
On the basis of experience accumulated and with the aim of improving the quality of
the work of the Committee, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs
prepared a draft amending the status and standing orders of the Committee for
European Integration.
The Working Committee for Czech Republic s Integration into European Union
was ensuring the coordination and implementation of tasks connected with
preparations for membership. Its members were representatives of all ministries and
other central state administration institutions.
In preparing for accession to the EU, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech
Republic collaborated with the Council of Economic and Social Accords and with
representatives of employers as part of the Work Team for Integration in the EU.

_National Programme for the Preparation of the Czech Republic_
_for Membership in the European Union 2001_

The Government of the Czech Republic approved the updated version of the
National Programme for Preparation for Membership in the European Union
(National Programme 2000) on 31 May, 2000. The document was based on the
National Programme 1999. It contained short-term, as well as medium-term tasks of
the Czech Republic in areas where full preparation for membership had not yet been
achieved. The chapter Financial Needs in the National Programme 2000 for the first
time stipulated the finance requirements of short-term and long-term priorities in
close connection with the state budget for 2000 and the draft budget framework for
2001 and 2002. The way in which the National Programme 2000 had been drafted
was praised in the Regular Report of the European Commission on the Czech
Republic s Progress towards accession for 2000.

_Regular report of the European Commission on progress_
_made by the Czech Republic in the process of accession_
_and material of the European Commission_
_Document of enlargement strategy_

On 8 November, 2000, the European Commission published its third Regular
Report of the European Commission on the Czech Republic s Progress towards
accession (hereafter Report). The Report assessed the progress achieved since the
publication of the Regular Report for 1999 on 30 September, 2000.


-----

In drawing up the Report, the European Commission made far-reaching changes in
its structures and methodology. In its third part, the Report was put together according
to individual chapters of community legislation, it dealt with the capacity of candidate
countries to carry out the duties placed upon them by their EU membership, and
which are directly connected with their negotiations on accession. In each chapter, the
European Commission assessed the ability of the state administration to implement
harmonized legislation.
The report makes it clear that the European Commission is shifting the focus in
assessing the progress made in the harmonization of the Czech legislation with
community legislation (even though this sphere remains the centre of its attention)
into the sphere of assessing the ability and capacity of the state administration to
implement harmonized legislation, and, if the need arises, to enforce it. It placed
emphasis on the determination and necessity to complete and implement structural
reforms.
The report was predominantly favourable for the Czech Republic. This applies to
the entire report in general, as well as to most of its sections. On the other hand, some
of its significant and sensitive chapters were the object of repeated criticism by the
European Commission, in brief, there are still problems there. Apart from the
capacity of the state administration, corruption, and the judiciary, this applied to
agriculture, culture and audio-vision, and to some extent also the environment.
As in 1999, the Government adopted a series of measures aimed at speeding up
legislative work and improving the implementation of existing legislation in spheres,
which had been criticized in the European Commission s report.
Apart from the regular reports for individual candidate countries, the European
Commission prepared a Document on the Strategy of Enlargement. It deals mainly
with a general assessment of the preparation of candidate countries for the accession
to the European Union and with evaluating the accession strategy. It proposed
a timetable, (a so-called road map ) for future accession negotiations. The
Document also contained a proposal that negotiations with those candidate countries,
which fulfil the criteria of membership, should be completed in the course of 2002,
which would allow the European Union to welcome new member states as of the end
of 2002.

_The Europe Agreement_

The basic contractual document, which in 2000 determined relations between the
Czech Republic and the European Union, was the Europe Agreement, establishing an
association between the Czech Republic and the European Community and its
Member States (Europe Agreement). The Europe Agreement came into force on
1 February, 1995.


-----

The Accession Council has been given the task of monitoring the implementation
and interpretation of individual provisions of the document; it meets regularly at the
level of foreign ministers of the Czech Republic and Member States and also with
a member of the European Commission. The Accession Committee, made up of
senior civil servants of the Czech Republic and the European Commission, or the
Committee for European Integration of the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of
the Czech Republic, monitors the implementation of the Europe Agreement; the
Committee consists of representatives of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of
the Parliament of the Czech Republic and of representatives of the European
Parliament.
On the basis of the provisions of the Europe Agreement, negotiations on the further
liberalization of trade in agriculture and fisheries continued in 2000. On 1 July, 2000,
Government Resolution No. 180, stipulating priority customs tariffs for imports of
certain agricultural products and foodstuffs originating in the EU, entered into force.
It was agreed that new trade policy conditions, liberalizing trade in processed
agricultural products will come into force on a reciprocal basis on 1 July, 2001, in the
light of a decision by the Accession Council.

_Protocol to the Europe Agreement on assessing the conformity_
_and acceptance of industrial commodities_

The Protocol to the Europe Agreement on assessing the conformity and
acceptability of industrial commodities which is planned to be signed in 2001 enables
the gradual integration of the Czech Republic in the single market of the EU as
regards agreed production spheres; in this way it goes beyond the classic form of


-----

agreements on mutual recognition. The removal of technical obstacles in trade with
the Member States is, thanks to the recognition of the system of assessing conformity
in the Czech Republic, eliminating duplicity, the timing and financially demanding
verification of commodities exported to/from the European Union, a further
contribution. In the field of mutual recognition the Czech Republic, alongside
Hungary, has made the greatest progress of all candidate countries.

_Mutual economic relations_

The volume of mutual trade has confirmed the exceptional importance of the
European Union for the Czech Republic. The EU has been its major economic partner
and had a 65.1% share in the total turnover of foreign trade in 2000. Bilateral trade
reached the sum of 1,540.9 billion CZK during the period under discussion. Czech
exports to the EU amounted to 768.0 billion CZK, i.e. 68.5% of all Czech exports,
and imports from the EU to the Czech Republic reached 772.9 billion CZK, i.e.
62.0% of all imports to the Czech Republic.
Compared to 1999, Czech exports to the EU increased by 23.7% and imports by
22.1%
The balance of bilateral trade was negative for the Czech Republic in 2000; there
was a deficit of 4.9 billion CZK.
As regards the composition of commodities in Czech exports, the predominant
items were in the spheres of machinery, electrical equipment, cars and transport
vehicles, products of the chemical industry, ceramic products and glass, and in the
food industry beverages. Among the major imports from the EU to the Czech
Republic there were again machinery, electrical equipment, cars and transport
vehicles, products of the chemical industry, iron and steel, timber and timber
products, and paper products.

_Pre-accession aid (Phare, ISPA and SAPARD)_

The number of programmes by which the Czech Republic receives pre-access
assistance has been expanded as of 2000. In addition to the Phare Programme, there
is now the programme for supporting agriculture and the revival of rural areas
Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development (SAPARD)
and the programme of infrastructural projects in the environment and transport
Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession (ISPA). While in 1999 the annual
resources allocated under Phare amounted to 69 million euro, the sum total of
preliminary defined annual contributions under the three mentioned programmes for
the period 2000 2006 amounts to 158 184 million euro (Phare 79 million euro,
including 19 million euro from the programme of cross-border cooperation, SAPARD
22 million euro, ISPA 57 83 million euro).


-----

The Phare Programme helps to implement the Copenhagen criteria of EU
membership and the selection of projects, which are determined by priorities of the
Accession Partnership and the National Programme for the Preparation of the Czech
Republic for the EU membership.
A full 20 projects of the total of 29 contained an instrument for pre-accession
twinning assistance, which acts as an intermediary for assistance by counsellors from
the EU Member States in implementing projects on the spot. Receiving pre-accession
assistance was determined by participation of the Czech side in the financing of all
projects, at least by one-quarter, furthermore by adopting legislation essential for the
implementation of the projects.
The ISPA project focused on supporting investment projects, which help improve
the infrastructures of the environment and transport networks in Trans-European
corridors. Under this programme the sum of 55 80 million euro per annum has been
earmarked for the Czech Republic.
Financial assistance by the EU has been subordinated by participation in financing
ISPA programmes by public funds of the Czech Republic. Funds for ISPA projects
will be drawn after the conclusion of the international treaty, entitled Memorandum
on understanding on the use of the ISPA National Fund (it was signed on
13 December, 2000) and after the signing of the Finance Memoranda on individual
projects.
In 2000, the ISPA governing board approved five projects, which are to commence
in 2001. They include two environmental projects renewal of the sewage systems
in Ostrava and Brno, and three projects in the field of transportation reconstruction
of sections of the railway lines Usti nad Orlici-Ceska Trebova, and Zabori-Prelouc,
and the construction of a Dobra-Frydek-Mistek by-pass.
The objective of the SAPARD programme is to help the candidate countries to
solve concrete tasks in introducing the acquis related to a Common Agricultural
Policy and structural changes in individual sectors of agriculture in rural areas. The
annual sum of 22 million euro has been earmarked for the Czech Republic to be
distributed at a 2:1 ratio among projects in the agricultural sector and rural
development. Financial assistance is linked with the requirement of participation in
financing by public funds.
The basic programme document of the Czech Republic for the SAPARD
programme is the Agriculture and Rural Development Plan of the Czech Republic for
2000 2006, which the European Commission approved by its decision of 26 October,
2000. The contractual relationship will be secured by a financial agreement covering
several years and an annual finance agreement to be negotiated for each current year.
Apart from signing a finance agreement for several years and specific annual finance
agreements as well as an agriculture and rural development plan for the Czech
Republic, the accreditation of a Payment Agency and implementation section of the


-----

Ministry of Agriculture by the European Commission is an essential prerequisite for
commencing the functioning of the SAPARD programme.

_Communication strategy_

Communication with the widest public preceding the acceptance of the Czech
Republic by the EU has been defined in the outline of the document Communication
Strategy of the Czech Republic before the accession to the EU, which was discussed
by the Committee for European Integration of the Chamber of Deputies of the
Parliament of the Czech Republic and afterwards completed by the Working
Committee on the Implementation of the European Agreement in October 1997. The
nature of the communication strategy is mainly educational; its aim is to give Czech
citizens objective information on the EU and the broader connection of admission of
the Czech Republic to the EU.
The Government entrusted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic
with carrying out a communication strategy. In view of the progress of negotiations
and an increasing demand for information, a new communication strategy sector
dealing with this agenda was introduced on 1 May, 2000. Apart from this, the sector
drew up a concept of external communication strategy and coordinates the training of
civil servants in European affairs.
The aim of the communication strategy can be achieved only if it is perceived as
a national strategy, which incorporates all sections of society. A Council for
Communication Strategy was set up in 2000 for this purpose. It carries out the
function of a consultative body of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech
Republic on matters of principle pertaining to communication strategy. Its first
meeting took place on 7 June, 2000. The Council is composed of political
representatives from all political parties (chairmen and vice-chairmen of committees
for European integration of the Parliament of the Czech Republic and chairmen of
committees for foreign affairs of the Czech Parliament), representatives of the
academic community, specialists in media affairs, and representatives of key sectors
and interest groups. Inter-ministerial coordination is the responsibility of the earlier
established consultative committee for the implementation of communication
strategy.
In 2000, the communication strategy concentrated on improving information about
the EU among relatively well informed sections of the population, e.g. small and
medium-size firms and young people. It also did its utmost to attract attention of
sections which until then had not given too much attention to the EU housewives,
senior citizens and, to some extent, those living in rural areas. This orientation
motivated the introduction of several projects, for example, a nationwide essay
competition on a European topic, regional activities in smaller towns, a project on the


-----

gradual training of non-governmental organizations and interlinking these (so-called
netting), study trips for journalists, the Euroskop internet website, issuing
publications, the establishment of European regional information centres, events for
business people, competitions for students, cooperation with the media, etc.
Specialized agencies arranged regular opinion polls which made it possible to update
the focus of the communication strategy regularly.
The second session of the Council for Communication Strategy took place on
15 December, 2000. Its extensive discussion, the useful results, and consensus on
points of principle demonstrated the justification for this body.
In the middle of 2000, the Communication Strategy Section prepared a concept of
external communication strategy in relation to EU Member States with the aim of
presenting the Czech Republic as a candidate country capable of fulfilling
commitments arising from EU membership without major problems and prepared to
accept its share of responsibility for the future progress of Europe. A large proportion
of activity is carried out under the sponsorship of Czech Republic s embassies in
EU Member States, which are based on territorial plans drawn up by the embassies
(media projects of the Czech Republic, seminars, conferences, etc.). In August 2000,
the Communication Strategy Section announced a competition for a unified image of
communication strategy and basic information materials. These are publications
about the Czech Republic (in English, French, and German), informative leaflets
about the Czech Republic and its relationship with the EU (in 11 languages),
exhibition material (so-called kits), identical folders and material for a series of
lectures at Czech embassies. The Council for Communication Strategy also discussed
these items and they were submitted to the Consultative Committee for the
implementation of communication strategy.
In May 2000, the European Commission adopted a new communication strategy to
promote enlargement. In the second half of 2000, individual embassies contacted the
representatives of the European Commission in each member state offering their
collaboration, with a view of taking concrete actions in 2001.
Regular contacts continued with the delegation of the European Commission in
Prague with the aim of coordinating information as part of communication strategy.
In 2000, 39 million CZK was earmarked in the state budget for the communication
strategy.

_Training in European affairs_

In 2000, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic continued to
coordinate activities focusing on training civil servants in the EU affairs. On the basis
of Government Resolution No. 841 of 25 August, 1999, the Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister of Foreign Affairs Kavan together with the Deputy Prime Minister and


-----

Chairman of the Legislative Council and the Minister of Interior, submitted a draft of
unified methodology for training officials in European affairs. The draft was adopted
by the Government Resolution No. 46 of 12 January, 2000. The decision stipulated
that deputy ministers, senior directors, directors of departments, and selected groups
of officials at ministries and other central bodies of the state administration complete
their training in European affairs by 31 August, 2000. All departments fulfilled this
task.
The basic source of the funds for the training in 2000 were the Phare Programme
and the state budget. Moreover, support was also given by Technical Assistance
Information Exchange Office (TAIEX) bilateral assistance coming from EU member
states.

Phare projects:
Basic training of 80 civil servants in European affairs (10 lecturers);
Additional training on the EU of 50 officials;
The ABC of the European Union (25 two-day courses on the EU) for 500 officials;
A course on financial control in the EU countries for 100 participants;

Educational activities funded from the state budget:
Basic course on the EU for 1,000 participants;
Seminar on an Introduction to Laws of the European Community for
70 participants;
Distance training course on EU affairs;
Seminar on committees and negation in the political process of the European
Community for 40 officials;
Training on negotiation techniques for 40 officials;
A conference Current Developments of the EU from Amsterdam to the InterGovernmental Conference on the reform of institutions for 400 participants.

Cooperation with TAIEX:
In 2000, TAIEX prepared a number of courses to meet the needs of the state
administration of the Czech Republic (seminars, workshops, study trips), focusing
mainly on:
Approximating the legislation of the single market;
Providing greater information on technical assistance offered by the European
Commission and member states;
Providing technical assistance based on specific requirements by individual subjects.

All the projects arranged in collaboration with TAIEX made it possible to train
500 officials in 2000.
Bilateral cooperation projects, especially with France and Denmark, were arranged
in the form of seminars.


-----

_Parliamentary cooperation_

A regular dialogue between Deputies and Senators of the Parliament of the Czech
Republic and Deputies of the European Parliament contributed significantly towards
achieving the objectives of the European Agreement. This took place mainly within
the Parliamentary Committee on the Czech Republic-EU accession which consists of
a Permanent Delegation of the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech
Republic for Cooperation with the European Parliament, a Permanent Delegation of
the Senate for Cooperation with the European Parliament and a Permanent Delegation
of the European Parliament. Meetings are generally held once every six months. The
11[th] session of the parliamentary committee on Czech Republic-EU accession was
held on 18 19 April, 2000, in Prague and the 12[th] session on 13 14 December, 2000,
in Strasburg.
Meetings of chairmen of Parliaments in associated countries with the President of
the European Parliament Ms. Fontaine continued on a multilateral level. One such
meeting was held in Ljubljana between 17 19 April, 2000. The Chairwoman of
the Senate of the Czech Republic Bene ovÆrepresented the Czech Republic. The
Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic Klaus
attended a meeting of Chairmen of Parliaments on 11 12 July, 2000, in Brussels. The
items on the agenda were the ongoing Inter-Governmental Conference on the reform
of the EU institutions, or rather the conclusions of the European Council in Feira.
The chairmen of foreign relations committees of the Parliaments of member and
candidate countries also met regularly. Chairmen of European integration
committees held similar meetings. The chairmen of the relevant committees of the
Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic regularly attended
these meetings.

_Cooperation among candidate countries_

The candidate countries of the so-called Luxembourg Group (the Czech Republic,
Poland, Hungary, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus) inaugurated their negotiations on
membership in 1998 and continued their effective cooperation based on common
interests in the process of approaching the EU.
Two significant meetings of the foreign ministers of the said countries took place
during that period. At the meetings in Ljubljana (5 June, 2000) and in Budapest
(15 November, 2000), joint declarations were adopted demanding a concrete
timetable for the enlargement of the EU. The fundamental ideas of the joint
declarations of the foreign ministers of the Luxembourg Group were reflected in the
conclusions of the European Summit in Nice.
Cooperation also continued in preparations for admission to the EU among the
chief negotiators of the countries of the Luxembourg Group. Three meetings were


-----

held in the period under discussion: 30 June 1 July, 2000 in Krakow (exchange of
views on the subsequent progress of negotiations), 5 October, 2000 in Brussels
(review of negotiations so far) and 10 11 December, 2000 in Budapest (discussion of
the conclusions of the European Summit in Nice).
Senior representatives of the foreign ministries of all candidate countries met in
Vilnius on 13 14 September, 2000.
The issue of European integration became a crucial item in the collaboration of the
Visegrad countries. Enlargement of the EU became a constant item on the agenda of
talks among senior representatives. The Prime Ministers of the V4 countries also met

_Incorporation of the Czech Republic in the EU Common Foreign_
_and Security Policy_

The Czech Republic participated in the Common Foreign and Security Policy in
the manner facilitated by the country s associate status. During the period under
discussion, the Czech Republic demonstrated a high measure of compatibility with
the acquis of the Second Pillar of the EU. This helped Chapter 27 Common Foreign
and Security Policy to be proposed in April 2000 for preliminary completion (its
preliminary completion was formally confirmed on 14 June, 2000); this was within
the framework of negotiations on the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU. By
joining common activities, statements, declarations, and measures and by their
implementation the Czech Republic demonstrated its preparedness for the accession
to the EU in the fields of these common policies. As soon as the Czech Republic is
admitted to the EU, it must be capable to participate fully in all its structures and to
take advantage of all its instruments. The Czech Republic, together with the other
candidate countries, continued to take an active part in a political dialogue with the
EU, especially in working groups focusing on various topics, such as disarmament,
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, terrorism, human rights, and the UN or in
working groups based on territories, such as the Western Balkans or Eastern Europe.
This dialogue on an expert level was accompanied by regular meetings of political


-----

directors of the foreign ministries, European correspondents, and directors of political
planning, meeting generally every six months.
The introduction of the Associated Countries Network (ACN) in December 1999
brought a new quality to the political dialogue between the Czech Republic and the
EU. This system of special electronic mail established a link between the Secretariat
of the EU Council and the foreign ministries of the candidate countries and thus
provided for an operative multilateral exchange of relevant information between the
EU and the associated countries.
The Czech Republic closely followed development of the Common European
Security and Defence Policy. As a member of NATO and a candidate for membership
in the EU, the Czech Republic demonstrated its eminent interest in consolidating
European security and strengthening defence capacities. It confirmed this not only by
an intensive and cooperative dialogue with the EU on the concept of European
defence, but also by a concrete offer of a Czech contribution to the European rapid
deployment forces. The Czech Republic declared that it would take an active part in
an institutionalised dialogue on Common European Security and Defence Policy, both
in the 15 + 15 format (e.g. the EU + candidate countries, Iceland, and Norway), and in
the 15 + 6 format (e.g. the EU + the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Turkey,
Iceland, and Norway the European NATO members as well as non-members of
NATO).

**Common European Security and Defence Policy**

Throughout 2000, the EU continued to work with intensity in promoting the
Common European Security and Defence Policy (CESDP), by fulfilling the
conclusions of the EU Helsinki Summit in December 1999, and by outlining and
carrying out new tasks from the EU summits in Feira (June 2000) and Nice
(December 2000). Czech foreign policy closely followed this process and presented
its views on all major issues of the CESDP at bilateral and multilateral meetings.
The advance of the CESDP within the EU led to the gradual limitation of the
activities of the Western European Union (WEU). The ministerial meetings of the
WEU in 2000 (Porto May, Marseilles November) definitely decided to reduce the
activities of this organization to a minimum, and transfer responsibility for the
fulfilment of the so-called Petersburg tasks to the EU. The Czech Republic was an
associate member of the WEU and participated in all its activities, except joint
defence. The limitation of the activities of the WEU brought the status of associate
member to an end. The Czech Republic expects that associate membership in the
WEU will be replaced by a mechanism of intensive collaboration with the six
European states that are members of NATO and not members of the EU (so-called
Non-EU European Allies, NEEA).


-----

On the basis of the WEU ministerial session decision from Marseilles, the major
WEU operational activities have been terminated. The WEU military staff will cease
to exist by July 2001. The Multinational Advisory Police Element (MAPE) police
mission in Albania will be transferred to the EU during the first half of 2001. Western
European Union Assisting Mission (WEUDAM) in Croatia will continue under the
WEU command until the end of its mandate until 9 May, 2002. During the first half
of 2002, the Satellite Centre and the Institute for Security Studies will be reassigned
to the EU.
The WEU has not ceased to exist de jure as an organization, since its contractual
foundation is the so-called Modified Brussels Treaty of 1955. Its Article 5 speaks of
the collective defence of member states. The transfer of the Treaty to the jurisdiction
of the EU did not have the support of all the EU members. That is why it was decided
that WEU would remain in its residual form as the guardian of collective security. The
WEU will continue to function as a forum for parliamentary cooperation
(Parliamentary Assembly of WEU) and as a platform for defence industry
cooperation, Western European Armaments Group (WEAG).
At the WEAG meeting which took place simultaneously with the WEU session in
Marseilles, six new member states were admitted to this organization (Sweden,
Finland, Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland). For the Czech Republic this
was the culmination of long-term efforts to achieve full membership in WEAG.
Membership in this organization can be regarded as highly positive in the light of the
opportunities for domestic firms in the defence industry, especially those that are
united in the Defence Industry Association.
At its session in Helsinki on 10 11 December, 1999, the European Council decided
to establish interim bodies for CESDP An Interim Political and Security Committee,
an Interim Military Committee and an Interim Military Staff. These bodies began to
work in early March 2000. Their work, lasting almost one year, has been evaluated,
and the Nice Summit of the EU in December 2000 drew up the modalities of their
functioning. In the course of 2000, the Czech Republic attempted to insist on the
inclusion of its representatives in the work of these bodies. But this did not occur since
the EU retained its decision-making autonomy. Yet, the EU decided to hold regular
joint information meetings of these bodies with representatives of third countries.
The EU Planning Conference was held in Brussels in November 2000. Contributions
of individual countries to the implementation of the fundamental European objective
European Headline Goal (EHG) were summarized there. The amount of the resources
was also assessed and the extent of additional resources was reviewed. The EU
candidate countries, including the Czech Republic, made proposals for their
contributions to the implementation of the EHG. These were favourably received by
the EU with the proviso that they would be calculated above that of the EHG
framework. But they will be assessed according to the same criteria as units of the EU


-----

member states. The contribution of the Czech Republic consisted of a motorized
battalion, chemical defence units, special forces, a field hospital, centres for
humanitarian and relief operations and a helicopter flight. But the Czech Republic
offered this contribution under the condition that it would be allowed to participate in
political decisions on operations, in which it would be involved. This was the point
the Czech Republic stressed in its position to the EHG, which it submitted in writing
to the countries of the EU and NATO in May 2000.
The EU met the demand for political participation by third countries in operations,
in which these states would be involved, by establishing a Committee of Contributors.
This will be a platform for decisions on planned operations and will include all states,
making a substantial contribution to EU operations.
The modalities on cooperation between the EU and third countries became one of
the key questions of further cooperation in 2000 not only between these states but
also between the EU and NATO. At its summits in 1999, the EU declared that it
would draw up procedures for the incorporation of EU non-member countries in
preparations of the decision-making on EU military operations while respecting the
autonomy of the EU decision-making. In April 2000, an agreement was reached
within the EU on methods of collaboration between the EU and these states. The
negotiations between the EU and the candidate countries, Iceland, and Norway on
matters concerning the CESDP were based on the 15 + 15 format (EU + 6 non-EU
countries + 9 EU candidate countries). Another format of 15 + 6 (EU + non-EU
countries) was subsequently set up within this format. The Czech Republic was able
to participate in these debates, taking place mainly within the EU, only indirectly by
submitting its views within the WEU, NATO, or at bilateral meetings with the EU
member states. In negotiations with the key EU countries, it was possible to include
principles in the EU documents that are acceptable for the Czech Republic and of
which it would make maximum use in the future.
Since May 2000, several meetings have been in the 15+15 and 15+6 format at the
level of military experts, political directors, ambassadors and one session at the level
of defence ministers. At the Nice Summit of the EU in December, the EU Member
States decided to hold these meetings as the need arose, but at least twice every six
months, including one at the ministerial level. In the event of a crisis, the modalities
of negotiations would be determined differently: either with regard to operational
matters with the use of NATO capacities and means, or without them. A state, which
takes part in such an operation, would be involved in the decision-making by means
of the Committee of Contributors, and if the operation takes place with the utilization
of NATO means and capacities, European NATO members, non-EU members would
be involved automatically.
For the further development of relations between the Czech Republic and the EU
on CESDP matters it is important for the candidate countries to be allowed to


-----

nominate their representative for contacts with the EU Political and Security
Committee as well as a liaison officer for contacts with the EU Military Staff.
The Czech Republic considers an agreement between the EU and NATO on
establishing direct relations between the two organizations as a significant step for the
future of CESDP. There have been meetings of the North Atlantic Council (NAC) and
the interim Political and Security Committee. A NATO and EU meeting at the level
of foreign ministers was held on the margin of the NATO ministerial session in
December 2000.
An agreement was, moreover, reached, on establishing four EU/NATO working
groups, where key issues pertaining to the NATO and EU cooperation are dealt with:
1. Security matters (especially classified information);
2. The question of Berlin + (adaptation of NATO defence planning for the
requirements of the EU and involvement of the EU in NATO planning capacities
together with the identification of means and NATO command structures for EU
operations);
3. Improvement of defence capacities;
4. Establishment of permanent EU/NATO working relations.
Since the Helsinki Summit in December 1999, the EU has been intensifying the
coordination of non-military sources with the aim of managing crises and increasing
its capacity in civilian crisis management. A EU Committee for Civilian Crisis
Management has been set up and the Feira Summit in June 2000 approved an interim
proposal of concrete aims for civilian crisis management. The proposal stipulated that
the EU would establish rapid deployment police formations of 5,000 members of
which 1,000 will be capable of being deployed within 30 days along the entire
spectrum of operations, from conflict prevention to the specific requirements in
various phases of operation in order to restore peace. During the second half of 2000,
the French rotating presidency concentrated chiefly on establishing autonomous
military capacities and left civilian crisis management more or less aside. That is why
the commitment taken in Feira was merely repeated in Nice, and this sphere will be
among the priorities of the Swedish rotating presidency.
In 2000, the Czech Republic began preparations that would enable it to offer the
European Union some of its capacities for the solution of non-military crises in 2001.

**3. The Czech Republic**
**and North Atlantic Treaty Organization**

In March 2000, the Czech Republic celebrated the first anniversary of its accession
to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Throughout the year, the country


-----

took an active part in the activities of all political and military sections of the
Alliance. In accordance with the new Strategic Concept of the Aliance, the Czech
Republic continued to adapt its armed forces and completed an essential revision of
its internal security legislation. A great success of Czech diplomacy was the fact that
the December 2000 session of foreign ministers decided to hold the next NATO
Summit in Prague.
The entry of the Czech Republic into NATO resulted in a significant change in the
position of the state in the European security system. The Alliance became the
fundamental framework, guaranteeing the security of the Czech Republic.
Membership in NATO allows the Czech Republic to be a full component of the TransAtlantic consultation mechanism of the nineteen allies in all matters concerning the
security of the Euro-Atlantic region. Membership commits the Czech Republic to
defend the territory of other allies and to build up its own defence capacities,
including the capacity of taking an effective part in peacekeeping operations outside
the territory of NATO.
The Czech Republic fulfilled the duties arising from membership in the Alliance.
It participated actively in the agenda of political and military committees, command
structures, agencies and other NATO bodies. It took part in the Alliance military
missions. It gradually adapted its armed forces to be able to fulfil the requirements
formulated in the Strategic Concept of the Alliance. The Czech Republic completed
the adaptation of its internal security legislation, as well as the process of joining
all multilateral NATO treaties and accords. Individual sections gradually
established direct specialized contacts with bodies of the Alliance and attended
their meetings.
The formulation of national positions on various NATO initiatives and
establishment of cooperation and mutual support with other allied countries are
essential for the successful work in bodies of the Alliance. The shortage of staff
screened for work with NATO classified information remained one of the obstacles
to the full incorporation in the work of the Alliance.
The Czech Republic, as a member of the Alliance, is most concerned about the
security and stability in South-Eastern Europe. One of the means in carrying out this
policy was the participation of the Czech Republic in Alliance operations in Bosnia
and Herzegovina and in Kosovo in 2000. By Government Decision No. 1112 of
8 November, 2000, the Government of the Czech Republic decided to extend the
Czech participation in two Alliance operations in 2001; they are to remain on the
same scale as in 2000, e.g. a mechanized battalion in Bosnia and Herzegovina
(approx. 600 men and an extended company in Kosovo (approx. 200 men). The
Czech Republic is, moreover, preparing conditions at home to make it possible to
send non-military experts to missions abroad. This will require a longer period since
it is not a question of merely choosing suitable candidates, but also of adapting


-----

internal legislation, which at the moment does not provide optimal conditions for the
deployment of such experts.
Political developments in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia culminated with the
defeat of Slobodan Milosevic in the autumn of 2000 in the course of presidential
elections and the victory of the opposition in the parliamentary elections in Serbia. In
the opinion of the Czech Republic, political developments created the conditions for
a certain restructuring of alliance operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in
Kosovo.
The integration of the countries of South-Eastern Europe into the Euro-Atlantic
community is a significant instrument in safeguarding peace and progress in the
region. The Alliance is working towards this objective by means of the Euro-Atlantic
Partnership Council (EAPC) and Partnership for Peace, by means of the South-East
European Initiative (SEEI) which it supports, and the Stability Pact for South-Eastern
Europe.
The fundamental political changes in Croatia are a significant contribution to the
regional stability. The Czech Republic encouraged Croatia to carry out its programme
of reforms. It welcomed Croatia s membership in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership
Council, the Partnership for Peace and the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe,
and stated its desire to cooperate with Croatia in these institutions.
In 2000, the Czech Republic for the first time attended a session of the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council at a ministerial level. At these sessions the Czech
Republic underscored the importance of the Russian Federation as a major component
of the European security system. The Czech Republic joined the positive evaluation of
the ratification of the START II and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, as
well as welcoming the inclusion of the Russian Federation in NATO s operations in the
Balkans. The ministerial session in Brussels approved the working plan of the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council for 2001 and documents were exchanged on opening
a NATO Information Office in Moscow.
The Czech Republic, together with other Alliance partners, emphasized the validity
of the NATO-Russia Founding Act on the basis of which cooperation is taking place,
which helps to improve stability in the Euro-Atlantic region. It assessed the results of
the past period and found them promising and going in the right direction. But the
Alliance countries criticized the Russian Federation for its operations in Chechnya.
The Czech Republic underlined the need for a political solution, the investigation of
all crimes, and enabling non-government organizations to function smoothly.
As a member of the Alliance, the Czech Republic appreciated the successful
cooperation and consultations as part of the working plan of the NATO-Ukraine Work
Plan, which helps to intensify this partnership. It favourably assessed participation in
the Partnership for Peace, in military as in non-military aspects, and the incorporation
of Ukraine in the Kosovo peacekeeping force. This participation demonstrates


-----

Ukraine s commitment to join common efforts to safeguard peace and stability in the
region and assists the inter-operability between Ukrainian and allied forces. The
Czech Republic, moreover, attaches great importance to the NATO liaison office,
which plays a decisive role in increasing Ukraine s participation in the Partnership for
Peace and the NATO Information and Documentation Centre in Kiev.
The NATO ministerial session endorsed the NATO open-door policy. Ministers of
member countries confirmed their determination to continue the enlargement of the
Alliance, and stressed the significance of the Membership Action Plan (MAP). The
plan outlines the aim of reinforcing the capacity of candidate countries in political,
economic, defence and military, resource, security, and legal areas.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic together with the Ministry
of Defence of the Czech Republic and other sectors took an active part in the
implementation of the second annual cycle of MAP. The Czech Republic expressed
determination to offer advice, feedback, and assistance to applicants in preparing for
possible future membership. A number of consultation rounds on several issues were
arranged with Slovakia and Latvia. Regular round tables were held with Lithuania,
attended by representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic
and Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic was also
helping Slovenia in its preparation to join NATO.
The Czech Republic has a strategic interest in the continued process of the
enlargement of NATO. It has expressed the hope that at the forthcoming NATO
Summit in Prague the Alliance will invite further countries which are willing and
capable of accepting the responsibilities and commitments arising from the
membership. No European democracy, whose acceptance would be in keeping with
the Washington Treaty, will be excluded and will be judged purely on its own merit.
The process of establishing the European Security and Defence Identity (ESDI), in
accordance with the conclusions of the NATO s Washington Summit in 2000, has
been rather stagnating. It has not been possible to arrive at a consensus on the
demand, of the EU to ensure access to the planned capacities and resources of the
Alliance in the event of an operation under the leadership of the EU.
The Czech Republic welcomed the progress achieved in implementing the Defence
Capabilities Initiative (DCI). DCI is an instrument for reinforcing military capacities
which the Alliance urgently needs in order to fulfil its security tasks for the 21[st]

century by making future multinational operations through the NATO spectrum
effective. The purpose of DCI is to gradually create forces, which would display
greater interoperability, mobility and which could be deployed without delay and
capable of being involved in effective combat activities.
For this reason, too, the continued adaptation of the armed forces and the full
integration of the Army of the Czech Republic in the military bodies and the
integrated military structure of NATO was one of the priorities. Here the Ministry of


-----

Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic contributed to preparing the conceptual
documents on the structure of Armed Forces. It took a major part in drafting amended
planning documents for NATO bodies and expert negotiations with representatives of
the Alliance and individual member states.
The Czech Republic was fully aware that the state of the Armed Forces did not
fully correspond to the requirements of the current security environment. That is why
the Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic prepared studies on the future
requirements of the Czech Armed Forces. It knew that this would be a complicated
process which was intended to create a more professional army within the next ten
years, an army that would be smaller in size, lighter and more mobile and so far better
prepared for missions abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, together with other sectors,
played a significant role in the institutionalisation of the crisis management bodies in
the Czech Republic and in drawing up methodological materials for preparations and
activities in crisis situations. Among the most vital forms of preparing crisis
management bodies was the CMX/Crisex 2000 exercise which aimed at exercise in
procedures and activities of the Czech Republic crisis management bodies, linked to
NATO and WEU crisis management bodies in planning and preparing measures
connected with crisis situations abroad. The Czech Republic now had the opportunity
for the first time to carry out training of specific tasks at a level beyond departments
as a member of the Alliance. The inclusion of members of the Permanent Delegation
of the Czech Republic to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western
European Union was of great significance.
A significant legislative adjustments took place in the Czech Republic. Conditions
were gradually created for the incorporation of the Czech Republic in the activities of
the Alliance and the implementation of its commitments stemming from the
membership in NATO. At the beginning of August 2000, the Chamber of Deputies of
the Parliament of the Czech Republic approved an amendment to the Constitution of
the Czech Republic with regard to the deployment of troops abroad and accepting
foreign troops on the territory of the Czech Republic. Parliament also approved the
acceptance of the Status of Forces Arrangement (SOFA) and the Paris Protocol. Once
the ratification papers are deposited, the Czech Republic will become a party to all
NATO statutory treaties.
One of the crucial tasks in 2000 has been to fulfil the requirements of Act No.
148/1998 on the protection of classified information. Emphasis was placed on
securing the protection of NATO classified information and on the introduction of
a rigid secrecy regime.
The Czech Republic also joined the programme of NATO Contact Embassies in
partner countries, which helped to present the policy, activities, and objectives of the
Alliance. In August 2000, it was decided that the Czech Republic would represent


-----

NATO interests in Lithuania. The Contact Embassy ensured a two-way
communication between the partner country and the NATO Headquarters. The
programme is to ensure information about the alliance policy, ensure important
contacts, provide commentaries for conferences and seminars arranged by NATO in
partner countries and make arrangements for travel by the highest NATO
representatives.
On 22 May, 2000, President Havel sent a letter to the NATO Secretary
General Lord Robertson, in which he proposed to hold the 2000 NATO Summit in
Prague. President Havel suggested that this would make it clear that the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization differed from the organization of the Cold War era.
The Summit would be a signal testifying that NATO was in fact changing to become
an organization encompassing the entire Euro-Atlantic world. The choice of
Prague, the capital of one of the new NATO members, would confirm that the
Alliance takes its new members seriously; it would also have a symbolic
significance for the countries which are only just applying for membership. The
ministerial session of NATO finally decided in December 2000 to hold the next
Summit in Prague.
In 2000, the first Czech officials began working in the NATO Executive Secretariat
in Brussels. However, an adequate representation of the Czech Republic in the
Alliance would need many Czech citizens to work in the NATO structures. The
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic received several hundred
notifications of vacancies in the Alliance structures in 2000. It distributed them to
appropriate locations, which included 33 addresses outside the Ministry. However,
not a single candidate from the Czech Republic replied to the NATO offer. The reasons
for the lack of interest were clearly the very high professional requirements NATO
requires the knowledge of the two official languages (English and French) and
lacking security clearance NATO requires the category NATO SECRET  and
possibly the fact that legislation has not been completed on sending citizens of
the Czech Republic to work at foreign missions and secretariats of international
organizations.
A concept providing for sending Czech citizens to international government
organizations has been drawn up under the auspices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
of the Czech Republic. In the future, an active approach by human resources
departments in the appropriate sectors and the establishment of a database of
applicants would be the key to finding suitable candidates.

**4. The Czech Republic and regional cooperation**

**Visegrad Cooperation**

Visegrad Cooperation was restored in 1998; the signature of a joint declaration by the
highest representatives of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary in 1991 establisbed it.
At the Bratislava Summit in 1999, the Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Poland, and Slovakia decided that this cooperation would not be institutionalised.
Regular meetings of its representatives at various levels form the basis for cooperation
among the four Central European states. During the period between these meetings, it
is always one of the V4 countries which preside over Visegrad Cooperation.
In 2000, an official meeting of the Prime Ministers of the Visegrad Group was held
on 9 June, 2000, at tił n Castle in the Czech Republic. There the Prime Ministers
signed a Joint Declaration and an Agreement Concerning the Establishment of the
International Visegrad Fund. They published an annual report on the activity of the
Visegrad Group, which summarizes events and actions since the previous Bratislava
Summit (the report contains information about more than twenty gatherings at the
presidential, governmental, parliamentary, and expert level). They discussed the
further orientation of Visegrad Cooperation.
This Summit brought to an end the annual period when the Czech Republic held
the presidency. Visegrad Cooperation proceeded successfully during the Czech
presidency. One of the key tasks for 2000 had been fulfilled the establishment of the
International Visegrad Fund. Another priority of the restored Visegrad Cooperation
had also been carried out assistance to Slovakia in its endeavour to bridge the
setback in the European integration process.
Visegrad Cooperation became a fait accompli. Individual sectors organized their
own meetings of Visegrad sections in accordance with their current needs. Advantage
was taken of the natural possibilities offered by cooperation within the Visegrad
Group. There were meetings of representatives of the Ministries of Interior, Culture,
Defence, the Environment, Justice and Foreign Affairs, which have the task of
coordinating Visegrad Cooperation.
Visegrad Cooperation expanded to the parliamentary and expert level.
The Visegrad Group was well received also on the international scene and among
the direct neighbours of its countries. Several neighbouring countries showed interest
in cooperation with it. A demonstration that the Visegrad Group is nowadays
a generally respected regional association are frequent meetings of the Prime Ministers
of the V4 countries with top representatives of European Union Member States.
Information about Visegrad Cooperation also improved. Proof is in the increasing
number of articles in the press as well the greater frequency of visits on the Visegrad
website (www.visegrad.org)


-----

_International Visegrad Fund_

The Agreement Concerning the Establishment of the International Visegrad Fund
was signed by the Prime Ministers of the countries of the Visegrad Group at their
meeting on 9 June, 2000, at tił n Castle. The purpose of the International Visegrad
Fund is to support and promote cultural cooperation, scientific exchanges, research
and cooperation in education, youth exchanges, and cross-border cooperation. The
founders of the Fund aimed to boost activities going beyond those financed by
individual ministries in which all V4 member countries are interested and which
would assist improved awareness of the common Central European area.
Individual countries of the Visegrad Group contribute the sum of 250,000 euro per
annum. This means that the Fund has an annual budget of 1 million euro.
The Secretariat of the Fund is in Bratislava. Its executive director is appointed by
a Conference of Foreign Ministers, which is the supreme body of the Fund. The
Council of Ambassadors (of the V4 countries) decides which concrete projects the
Fund is to support; the Council is at the same time the body superior to the Secretariat.
Assistance by the International Visegrad Fund has been requested by civic
organizations, non-governmental organizations as well as certain state and non-profit
organizations. By 15 September, 2000, the first deadline for submitting requests for
grants, the Fund had registered 236 projects. The total sum requested was in excess
of 9 million euro. In view of the budget limitations, only 11% of all applicants, e.g.
26 projects, could be satisfied; 450,000 euro was available for the first round (every
year two rounds are held to select projects).
Of the projects selected, 24 were quadrilateral, one was trilateral and one bilateral.
This confirmed the great interest in cooperation among the countries of the Visegrad
Group. It is to be expected that in the coming period this interest will increase even
further.

**Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA)**

The Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) was signed on
21 December, 1992, in Krakow and came into force on 1 July, 1994. The following
are CEFTA member countries: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia,
Slovenia, Romania, and Bulgaria. The purpose of the institution is to create free trade
areas for industrial goods and the far-reaching liberalization of trade in agricultural
produce. CEFTA does not cover trade in services. In the case of industrial goods, the
objective of the Agreement will be achieved, and on 1 January, 2001, all tariff and
non-tariff obstacles to trade will be removed. The CEFTA countries are convinced
that the liberalization of trade will facilitate their accession to the European Union.
CEFTA is not an international organization and thus has neither a secretariat nor
any other bodies; negotiations are held mainly on the expert level and focus
exclusively on the elimination of obstacles in trade.
Ministers responsible for external trade discuss and deal with topical problems
once a year at meetings of the Joint Committee, the highest body of CEFTA. The
presidency of CEFTA is held on a yearly rotation basis by Member States. Poland
held the presidency in 2000.
The CEFTA is an open institution. To join it, a country must be in the World Trade
Organization (WTO), it must have an Association Agreement with the EU and the
consent of all members of the CEFTA. In 2000, no new state has applied for
membership.
Several export meetings were held in 2000. They concerned the reciprocal
recognition of certificates and the findings of laboratory tests, the activities of the
Sub-Committee for Agricultural Trade and other issues.


-----

The meeting of the Joint Committee took place in Warsaw on 11 October, 2000. It
appraised the activities of the Sub-Committee for Agricultural Trade, it recommended
a continued exchange of information on progress in negotiations with the EU and
dealt with the way all CEFTA countries were fulfilling their commitments. It
appreciated the results of expert negotiations in the field of the reciprocal recognition
of certificates, it assessed the problem of protective measures and the position as to
the ratification of supplementary protocols amending regulations in determining and
verifying the origin of commodities; it also discussed preparations for a Summit of
Prime Ministers of the CEFTA states.
The Summit of Prime Ministers of the CEFTA countries was held in Warsaw on
15 November, 2000. The Prime Ministers agreed that cooperation within CEFTA
assisted the economic progress of the countries of the Agreement, the increase of
mutual trade and promoted the process of their integration in the EU. It made
a favourable assessment of the work of the Sub-Committee for Agricultural Trade but
also noted persisting problems in trade in agricultural produce. They stressed the need
to find a solution, which would correspond to the interests of all parties involved. The
Summit adopted a Declaration in which the Prime Ministers recommended the further
improvement of CEFTA mechanisms, the intensification of bilateral negotiations on
the reciprocal recognition of certificates and the finding of laboratory tests. They also
came out in support of greater contacts among business people and professional
associations. They maintained that the exchange of information among CEFTA
countries on their accession negotiations with the EU was most useful. The Prime
Minisrers welcomed the cooperation of the CEFTA countries with the WTO and
agreed to increase efforts to launch a further round in multilateral trade negotiations.
The Czech Republic appreciates the significance of the CEFTA for promoting
trade, and is interested in the further liberalization of trade in the field of
agricultural produce. It proposes to coordinate the fight against economic crime
and the development of mutual investments. It sees the implementation of the
CEFTA as part of the process of stabilization on the European continent.

**The Central European Initiative and the Stability Pact**
**for South-Eastern Europe**

The Central European Initiative (CEI) came into being in 1989 as a quadragonale
and included Italy, Austria, Yugoslavia, and Hungary, based on cooperation in the
Adriatic-Danube Region. Its objective was to increase inter-governmental relations
and promote various forms of cooperation among these neighbouring countries. The
entry of the former Czechoslovak Federation in 1990 changed it into a pentagonal,
and after a further enlargement it became the Central European Initiative. Following
the break-up of the federation, the Czech Republic and Slovakia became two


-----

independent member states. In 2000, the CEI had 17 members in Central, Eastern
and South-Eastern Europe. In 2000, the Czech Republic paid a great attention to
relations between the Central, Eastern and South-Eastern European countries,
which are associated in the CEI. This applied in particular to assisting stabilization
and democratisation in the region and promoting cooperation among these
countries.
In 2000, Hungary and the Czech Republic held the presidency, as the presiding
country in 1999, the Czech Republic acted as part of a Troika .
Annual meeting of Heads of Governments (Summit) took place on 24 25 November,
2000, in Budapest as well as a meeting of the foreign ministers of the CEI countries.
The Summit confirmed that the CEI countries would continue to apply the principle
of shared aims and solidarity, and support less advanced countries in the region in
their transition to European standards and incorporation in the European integration
process and Euro-Atlantic structures.
One of the significant results of the Summit, proceeding from attempts by the
international community to bring the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from its
political and economic isolation and to prevent new dividing lines on the continent,
was acceptance of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a member of the Central
European Initiative. The Czech Republic supported membership of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia also since it believed in the irreversibility of democratic
reforms and in the interest of speeding up the renewal and reconstruction of SouthEastern Europe.
In view of the fact that tension continued in some parts of Kosovo even after local
elections, the Central European Initiative advocated the continued activity of the
United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and Kosovo Force (KFOR), and called
on all parties involved to respect UN Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).
At the Summit the Prime Ministers discussed the increase of cooperation, above all
in the field of cross-border and regional cooperation, which stimulates relations
between Euro-region firms, institutions, and the local administration.
At the Summit, the Czech Republic expressed interest in joining the Danube
Commission and in incorporating Czech firms in projects to restore the navigability
of the Danube, the construction of bridges and in supplies for the protection of the
environment.
The Summit stated the conviction that the process of stabilization and
incorporation in the EU offered the countries concerned (F.Y.R. of Macedonia,
Croatia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina) a clear perspective for integration in the
European process and that the EU would soon specify the criteria for the accession of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as well. In this connection, the countries of the
Central European Initiative welcomed the conclusions of the EU Summit in Zagreb
of 24 November, 2000, which confirmed these expectations.


-----

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, in collaboration with the
Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, and
with the Council of Europe, arranged an International Conference on Ombudsman
(27 28 April, 2000), attended by ombudsmen from the countries of the Central
European Initiative and Western Europe. The Conference was a contribution by the
Czech Republic and the Central European Initiative to the work of the First Working
Table of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, in collaboration with the
National Educational Fund, arranged seminars on the following subjects: a policy of
active employment and its financing, the competitiveness of small and medium
firms, reform of the finance sector, reform of the public administration and the
strategic management of firms. This was done within the framework of the Central
European Initiative Working Group on Human Resource Development and Training.
The Czech Republic was, furthermore, actively involved in the work of other Central
European Initiative Working Groups for Science and Technology, Transport
Environment, Culture and Education, Youth Affairs, and Combating Organized
Crime.
In the course of 2000, the Czech Republic advocated the need for making the
activities of Working Groups and other working bodies and structures of CEI more
effective in order to take greater advantage of the potential of this regional institution.
The assessment of the work of the Czech Republic in the Central European Initiative
by other countries was most positive and consequently at the end of the year all
members unanimously approved the membership of the Czech Republic in the
Finance Committee for the next two years (2001 2002). This is a consultative body
of the Central European Initiative with the jurisdiction to decide specific questions on
behalf of the Committee of National Coordinators.
The Central European Initiative expanded its contacts and identified spheres of
common interest with international organizations (EU, Council of Europe, United
Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)), with financial institutions
such as European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and with other
regional initiatives. This applied mainly to the South-East European Cooperative
Initiative (SECI), the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC), and the South-East
European Cooperation Process (SEECP). The OECD participated in the preparation
of the CEI Workshop on Women in Business . It is expected that the OECD will in
the future also participate in further activities of the CEI.
The Czech Republic advocated the transfer of expert knowledge and experience of
the OECD, the European Economic Commission, the United Nations and United
Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) to member organizations of
the CEI in South-Eastern Europe region. The Czech Republic considered sharing
experience accumulated in the integration process with the other countries of the CEI.


-----

The Czech Republic was active in the implementation of the Stability Pact for
South-Eastern Europe and endeavoured to obtain the status of a full participant and
member. The Government of the Czech Republic earmarked resources for various
projects. A Working Table for the Good Governance area in the section devoted to
reform of the state administration. The Czech Republic took part in the preparation of
educational programmes for members of the armies in South-Eastern Europe and the
implementation of the Dayton Peace Accord as part of the Third Working Table. The
greatest demands were made on the preparation and putting into practice of projects of
the Second Working Table with an economic dimension for economic revival,
development and cooperation as a result of the incomplete transformation in accepting
countries of South-Eastern Europe, but in a number of instances as a result of
complicated administrative procedures in negotiations with international finance
institutions. The Czech Republic mainly sponsored projects, dealing with pressing
humanitarian problems (reconstruction of a ward at the Dragisa Misovic hospital in
Belgrade) and the renewal of the infrastructure, as well as projects of a systems
character, for example, in the power industry, transport and the protection of the
environment.
In 2000, the Czech Republic placed great emphasis on a political dialogue among
member countries on current problems connected with developments in the region, on
the preparation of high-quality projects of the Central European Initiative and as part
of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe e.g. building democratic institutions
and a constitutional state, the defence of human rights, imposing European standards
and the revival of trade and economic ties for Czech firms. The Czech-Greek Council
was set up on 23 February, 2000; it was inaugurated by the Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister of Foreign Affairs Kavan on the basis of a Memorandum on CzechGreek Cooperation in the Economic Renewal and Development of the South-East
European Region. It is expected that the two countries will use the potential of their
traditional links with the South-East European countries and that the Czech Republic
will join the Greek plan for restructuring Balkans.

**5. The Czech Republic and other European fora**

**The OSCE**

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which includes 55 states,
is the only all-European organization for security and cooperation of a Euro-AtlanticAsian dimension. It is a natural place for a political dialogue among all countries in
this part of the world about security and stability problems. The Trans-Atlantic


-----

dimension of the OSCE contributes to security and stability in Europe. The OSCE is
the only security organization in Europe in the sense of regional accords under Chapter
VIII of the UN Charter. Consequently, it is the basic instrument for early warning,
forestalling conflicts, crisis management, and post-conflict renewal in this region.
The OSCE has drawn up a broad range of standards in the security and human
rights sphere and is carrying out a vital role in monitoring the situation. It is engaged
in conflict prevention consultancy and in post-conflict reconstruction, in building
a constitutional state and applying human rights standards.
In 2000, the OSCE was under the Austrian presidency and did its utmost to
implement and outline the decisions of the Istanbul Summit of November 1999.
In the sphere of security, the OSCE, which plays a major role in armament and
disarmament (Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, Dayton Peace
Accord), dealt primarily with the question of small arms and light weapons. The
approval of the OSCE Document on Small Arms and Light Weapons which
concentrates first and foremost on combating illegal trade in these weapons, was one
of the few successes of the November session of the OSCE Council of Ministers in
Vienna on 27 28 November, 2000.
The OSCE was, furthermore, a forum for negotiations of 30 countries on
conventional disarmament in Europe. The Agreement on the Adaptated Treaty on
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, signed in Istanbul on 19 November, 1999,
which goes beyond the numerical and zonal limits of the original treaty, will come
into force after ratification by all the 30 contracting countries. The great majority of
countries, including the Czech Republic, had not yet ratified the Adapted Treaty in
2000.
The return of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the OSCE in November 2000
was a significant event. This took place at the session of the OSCE Council of
Ministers in Vienna. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has been admitted as a new
state just as have the other states of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (the
membership of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the OSCE had been suspended
as of 1992). Intensive negotiations took place during the last few weeks of 2000 on
the preparation of the OSCE mission to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
OSCE missions in the territories have been successful. Strong OSCE missions
operated in South-Eastern Europe, additional missions with various mandates and
names were active in all Central Asian republics but also in Moldova, the Baltics,
and Belarus. An Assistance Group to Chechnya, which was not permitted to return to
this area, operated in 2000 in Moscow.
The OSCE participated in organizing and conducting elections in Bosnia and
Herzegovina and sent observers to monitor elections in a number of states involved.
At the session of the OSCE Council of Ministers in Vienna on 27 28 November,
2000, which was intended to be the culmination of the activities of the organization


-----

in 2000, agreement could not be reached among the participating states in a number
of spheres important for European security and for the work of the organization as
such. Agreement was not reached on the preparation of a ministerial declaration (only
a text was adopted concerning South-Eastern Europe) which was meant to be the
basic document of the session and which was to include a passage with an
inventory of the Istanbul Commitments.
The OSCE Council of Ministers managed to adopt merely part of the originally
anticipated documents and decisions. The most important of these was the OSCE
Document on Small Arms Light Weapons. The Council of Ministers also adopted
a decision on enhancing the OSCE s efforts to combat trafficking in human beings.
But it did not adopt a document on the protection of children in armed conflicts. After
two years of complicated negotiations, a decision was adopted on the nomination of
a new High Commissioner of the OSCE on Ethnic Minorities; as of 1 July, 2001,
R. Ekeus from Sweden was appointed. On the other hand, the Council of Ministers
did not succeed in drawing up and adopting a decision on the legal status of the OSCE
and scale and criteria for financing future OSCE activities.
In 2000, the Czech Republic participated in all aspects of the work of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The country devoted due
attention not only to the political and security dimension of the OSCE but also to
economic and human rights aspects. In its activities within the OSCE, the Czech
Republic collaborated closely especially with its partners and allies in NATO, the EU
and the Visegrad Group.
The Czech Republic frequently took the initiative within the OSCE in submitting
proposals on a number of regional problems such as Chechnya, Moldova, and
Belarus. The Czech Republic supported positions put forward by the EU on various
aspects of the activities of the OSCE or its declarations on events or problems under
discussion in the OSCE. The Czech Republic also adopted at times EU positions in
its own declarations.
The Czech Republic participated in the work of the OSCE mainly through its
Permanent Mission to the United Nations, the OSCE and other international
organizations in Vienna. Deputies and Senators of the Parliament of the Czech
Republic members of the Permanent Delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of
the OSCE of the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic
worked on a parliamentary level of the OSCE. Czech representatives took part in
OSCE missions in Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia, as well as in other
states in the Balkan and Central Asian region. A Czech representative served as
a Deputy Head of the OSCE Assistance Group for Chechnya.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Kavan represented
the Czech Republic at the OSCE Council of Ministers meeting in Vienna on
27 28 November, 2000.


-----

The Czech Republic, like a number of other states, considers the flexibility of the
OSCE to be a great advantage, since it proceeds from the fact that its functioning is
not based on international legal documents but on political commitments. The
continued flexibility and effectiveness of the organization remains a priority interest
of the Czech Republic in its relations with the OSCE. The Czech Republic shares this
interest with its allies in NATO and the EU countries.
Among the significant contributions made by the OSCE to the stability of the
region has been the monitoring of elections in countries, which are only starting to
establish a democratic environment. This is a problem coming under the Office for
Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) which assesses the preparation
and procedure of elections, e.g. whether basic democratic standards are respected,
above all, transparency, equality in the contest of political parties, and so forth. The
Czech Republic took part in a number of short-term OSCE monitoring missions.
Observers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, Deputies or
Senators, as well as members of non-governmental organizations participated in these
missions.
The Czech Republic was among the countries, which advocated the reinforcement
of the economic dimension of the OSCE. The most noteworthy OSCE action in this
field is the Economic Forum, held every year in Prague. The Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of the Czech Republic as well as other ministries participate in its preparation
and organization. The Eigth Economic Forum was held on 1 14 April, 2000, on the
subject Economic aspects of post-conflict rehabilitation: the challenge of
transformation . A number of preparatory and follow-up OSCE conferences and
seminars are closely connected with the Economic Forums. The states of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) showed a special interest in the
economic dimension of the OSCE.
Heads of OSCE missions in most cases highly appreciated the work of Czech
members of these missions. As a result of the endeavours of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of the Czech Republic and the Permanent Mission of the Czech Republic to
the international organizations in Vienna, a Czech representative was appointed to the
office of the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media. This was part of socalled seconding when the post is filled by the State sending a representative. Another
Czech representative has been appointed to the Office for Democratic Institutions and
Human Rights (ODIHR) to work in the group of the coordinator of OSCE activities
combating trafficking in human beings.
The Czech Republic also gave its full attention to the human rights element of the
OSCE and took an active part in the organization in this field. It continued its active
work following from its initiative in the Roma question, which is now seen as an allEuropean issue. It prepared the work of the contact position for Roma and Sinti
(CPRSI) in the ODIHR, for example by offering a voluntary contribution of


-----

USD 10,000. In November, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic in
collaboration with CPRSI organized a seminar in Prague on the political involvement
of the Roma.
The Prague Office of the OSCE Secretariat, which serves as the OSCE archive and
documentation centre and supports the Prague activities of the organization, mainly
the Economic Forum, confirms Prague as one of the OSCE centres. The Czech
Republic gives its all-round support to this office.
Among the contributions of the Czech Republic to the work of the OSCE in 2000,
it is worth to mention:
The Czech Republic (supported by Denmark) initiated and organized
a reconnaissance flight by an aircraft of the Army of the Czech Republic above
Bosnia and Herzegovina and covered a major portion of the expenses incurred by
this action. The flight covered the two parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Serb Republic) and included
representatives of the two parts of the state. This was done in support of the Dayton
Peace Accord and as a contribution to the security element of the Stability Pact for
South-Eastern Europe. The objective of the flight was to verify the possibility of
exploiting air space as a security and confidence-building measure in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and inform the parties concerned about the methods used in this
process;
The Czech Republic offered USD 10,000 as a contribution to the OSCE voluntary
fund for Moldova which was to be used in part to help the Russian Federation
finance the withdrawal of its armaments from Moldova;
The Czech Republic provided USD 30,000 for humanitarian aid to Chechnya,
through the intermediary of the Foundation People in Need ;
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, in collaboration with other
ministries prepared a database of civilian experts for REACT (OSCE Rapid Expert
Assistance and Cooperation Teams). The database is expected to be fully functional
during the first half of 2001.
Inter-departmental cooperation continued, directed towards overcoming persisting
problems in connection with sending citizens of the Czech Republic to various offices
and posts in international organizations, and with finding a comprehensive systemic
solution for this matter.

_Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe_

Negotiations between 30 parties to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in
Europe, which have been going on for several years, were completed on 19 November,
1999, during the OSCE Istanbul Summit, when finally the Agreement on the Adopted
Treaty was signed and the Final Act of the Conference of the CFE Treaty parties
concerned was adopted. The Agreement sets out the principles of the amendment of


-----

the provisions of the original CFE Treaty, which reflect the changed political and
security situation in Europe since the signing of the Treaty. The adapted CFE Treaty
is a vital component of the European security structure. During the existence of the
CFE Treaty, many states, above all NATO states, have cut the size of their
conventional weapons by more than agreed to in the original treaty.
The original Treaty was negotiated on the basis of group limitations (for the states
of NATO and the former Warsaw Pact Treaty) with the aim of reducing the
concentration of conventional weapons, especially in Central-Eastern Europe, and to
setting a collective ceiling to the military hardware of these groups of states, limited
by the treaty. The Adapted Treaty eliminated this group approach. Similarly, as with
the original CFE Treaty, its amended version contains numerical limitations for five
basic categories of conventional weapons (tanks, infantry combat vehicles, artillery
systems, combat aircraft, and helicopter gunships). In the view of the Czech Republic,
the amendment eliminates one of the last, albeit indirect, ties of the former
Czechoslovakia s membership in the Warsaw Pact Treaty. The new system of
limitation is based on a legally binding confirmation of the level for each signatory
state. Since armed forces from other signatory states could be stationed on the
territories of some of the signatory states, the Treaty distinguished between the
so-called national and territorial level.
Even though the amended CFE Treaty lays down the limitation of the level
individually, it stipulates the possibility for situations of crisis of a so-called
temporary deployment of the armament of another state over and above the declared
national/territorial level. If the need arises, this would allow the Czech Republic
to deploy alliance reinforcements on its territory while not violating the amended
CFE Treaty. Temporary deployment is accompanied by a number of transparency
measures, which should rule out its misuse.
The amendment of CFE Treaty furthermore reinforces verification mechanisms,
notification and a more extensive exchange of information among signatory states,
which is a reflection of a higher degree of confidence among them. The amendment
also creates the conditions for the accession of new states, which is a great
contribution to improving stability and security in Europe. The possibility of
accession applies to OSCE Member States located geographically between the
Atlantic and the Urals.
At the negotiations, the Russian Federation was the one who applied pressure on
Central European States (especially the new members of NATO) to impose the same
binding limitations to this region as to the flank region. The Czech Republic and its
allies managed to reach a compromise solution in the sense that legal commitments
are supplemented only by political commitments as regards certain regional
limitations without denying the right to use the mechanisms of the Treaty, which
create the essential flexibility to secure national security (temporary deployment).


-----

During the negotiations, it was agreed that other states, too, accepted similar political
commitments. The Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Germany, Slovakia, Belarus,
Ukraine (on part of the territory of the flank region) and the Russian Federation (for
the Kaliningrad and Pskov Regions) undertook not to use the possibility of a gradual
increase in their levels, which the Adapted Treaty allows under certain circumstances.
For a similar reason, the Czech Republic (as Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia)
undertook to reduce the size of hardware in territorial categories, limited by the
Treaty. This reduction is fully in keeping with the concept of the development of the
defence sector and has been discussed with the other allies within NATO.
All signatory countries, in keeping with their internal legal code, must ratify the
Treaty. It will come into force 10 days after the last ratification documents have been
submitted to the CFE Treaty depository, i.e. the Government of the Netherlands.
Under the legal code of the Czech Republic, the Agreement on the Adapted Treaty
needs to be ratified by both chambers of the Parliament of the Czech Republic.

**Council of Europe**

_Activities in the political sphere_

The major political topic of the Council of Europe in the first half of 2000 has been
the situation in Chechnya. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe
suspended the Russian delegation s right to vote and called on the Committee of
Ministers to consider suspending the membership of the Russian Federation in the
organization. At the 106[th] session of the Committee of Ministers in May 2000, which
was to deal with the appeal of the Parliamentary Assembly, the Czech delegation
called on the Russian Federation to intensify its co-operation with the Council of
Europe and its bodies. The Committee of Ministers did not support the exclusion of
the Russian Federation from the organization, pointing to the gradual move of the
Russian Federation towards co-operation and to the absolute necessity to maintain
lines of communication with the Government of the Russian Federation.
The 107[th] Committee of Ministers in November 2000 mainly discussed the
situation in South-Eastern Europe and in the Caucasus. It also dealt with the
membership applications of Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Czech Republic supported
the admission of both countries to the Council of Europe and called on them to make
greater efforts to observe human rights. It welcomed democratic changes in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and hoped that existing problems would be settled by
diplomatic means.
Lord Russell-Johnston, accompanied by the Deputy Chairwoman of the
Parliamentary Assembly and Head of the Permanent Delegation of the Czech
Republic to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Ms. t povÆ,
visited the Czech Republic in June 2000. In September 2000, Prague hosted a session


-----

of the Political Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
In August 2000, the Permanent Delegation of the Czech Republic submitted a report
to the Monitoring Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly on fulfilling its
commitments in fields of nationality, the legal status of aliens, higher territorial selfadministration entities, racism, xenophobia, the registration of religious associations,
and the lustration law. The report will be used in the so-called post-monitoring
procedure for observing further progress in adhering to commitments, which are
linked with membership in the Council of Europe.
In May 2000, the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of
Europe approved a resolution and recommendation on the state of local and regional
democracy in the Czech Republic. The report on the documents appraises the positive
development in regionalization in the Czech Republic, the signature of the European
Charter of Regional Self-Government and the European Framework Convention on
Transborder Co-Operation.
The Czech Republic proceeded with its initiative in the Council of Europe on the
establishment of a General Judicial Authority, which would ensure a uniform
interpretation and application of all treaties of the Council of Europe. On the basis of
a report submitted by the Rappourteur Cyril Svoboda, the Parliamentary Assembly
supported the establishment of a General Judicial Authority in its recommendation
No. 1458 (2000). In connection with this recommendation, the Committee of
Ministers asked the Committee of Legal Experts on International Law to assess the
initiative. But at its session in September 2000, the Committee recommended
postponing the discussion of the initiative, especially in view of differing views held
on the matter.
The Council of Europe organized two significant conferences in 2000. The
European Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia, and
Related Intolerance was held in Strasburg in October 2000. Its objective was mainly
to harmonize the positions of European countries prior to the forthcoming World
Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related
Intolerance to meet in August 2001 in Durban, South Africa.
The European Ministerial Conference on Human Rights was held in Rome in
November 2000. It marked the 50[th] anniversary of the signing of the European
Convention on Human Rights. But it also paved the way for the signing of Protocol
No. 12 to the Convention. The Czech Republic was among its first signatories.

_Treaty activities_

The incorporation of the Czech Republic in the treaty mechanism of the Council
of Europe continued in 2000. By 31 December, 2000, the Czech Republic was
a contracting party of 73 and signatory of 22 treaties. It held first place among all


-----

post-communist countries (by a comparison: by that same date Slovakia was
a contracting party of 57 and signatory of 12 treaties, Slovenia 68 and 5, Hungary
51 and 15 ). In 2000, the Czech Republic placed 14 instruments of ratification and of
accession with the Depository of the Council of Europe and signed 16 treaties. Out of
the total of 59 treaties of the Council of Europe, which are important for the accession
of the Czech Republic to the EU (the so-called De Vel list), the Czech Republic is
a contracting party of 41 and signatory of 11 treaties.
Among the most noteworthy steps taken by the Czech Republic in joining the
treaty system of the Council of Europe in 2000 was the signing of the Revised Social
Charter and of the Protocol No. 12 to the European Convention on Human Rights,
which includes a general ban on discrimination.
The Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of
National Minorities visited the Czech Republic in October 2000. Members of the
Committee met representatives of the Government of the Czech Republic and nongovernmental sector who are involved in the implementation of the Convention.

**6. The Czech Republic and international organizations**

**The United Nations and associated organizations**

_The Millennium Summit of the United Nations_
_and the Fifty-fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly_

The Millennium Summit was held in New York as part of the fifty-fifth session of
the United Nations General Assembly. It was the biggest meeting of Heads of States
and of Governments in the history of the United Nations (UN). The central theme of
the Summit was the role of the UN in the 21st century in solving all major problems
of humanity. The most significant result of the Summit was the Millennium
Declaration, in which member states reiterated their confidence in the UN and its
Charter and stated their determination to work towards the achievement of its
objectives in the following fields: the values and principles of the world at the turn of
the millennium; peace, security, and disarmament; development and the elimination
of poverty; protection of environment; human rights; democracy and the smooth
running of public relations; protection of the most vulnerable; special needs of Africa;
consolidation of the UN. The firm support of the UN makes it clear that the world
community is aware of its potential and strives to increase it even further, mainly in
priority areas such as the development and struggle against poverty, ignorance,
disease, injustice, violence, terror and crime, and degradation and destruction of the


-----

Earth. The determination to increase the role of the UN and take energetic steps
towards safeguarding peace has been confirmed in the Security Council s Declaration
on Ensuring an Effective Role for the Security Council in the Maintenance of
International Peace and Security, Particularly in Africa (Security Council s resolution
1318 (2000)), which the Security Council adopted unanimously at the highest level
(only for the second time in the UN history) on 7 September, 2000. President Havel
represented the Czech Republic at the Millennium Summit. In his speech on
8 September, 2000, he called for greater effectiveness and reform of the UN and
underscored the key role of human responsibility in the worldwide process of reform.
President Havel signed the International Convention for the Suppression of the
Financing of Terrorism and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of
the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. He also submitted
ratification documents of the International Convention for the Suppression of
Terrorist Bombings.
The main topics at the General Debate at the fifty-fifth session of the General
Assembly (role of the UN in maintaining peace and security, in the sphere of
globalisation, the defence of human rights, the protection of the environment and
making the activity of the UN more effective) were essentially a follow-up to
discussions in previous years, but their concept was greatly influenced by the
Millennium Declaration. Tuvalu and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were
accepted as new members of the UN, thereby increasing the number of UN members
to 189.
In his address in the General Debate on 16 September, 2000, the Head of the
Delegation of the Czech Republic, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign
Affairs Kavan stressed that the Millennium Summit was a unique opportunity to
make the UN more effective and to reinforce its capacity to solve global problems.
He welcomed the Brahimi Report on the reform of the UN peacekeeping operations
and recommended increasing the quality and the effectiveness of the UN peacekeeping
operations in safeguarding peace by the more comprehensive understanding of peace
in all phases of conflict (from prevention to the post-conflict reinforcement of peace).
He further recommended a more effective decision-making process of the Security
Council, the reorganization of the certain pertinent structures of the Secretariat, and
closer cooperation of the UN with regional organizations. He stressed the need for
reform of the Security Council, supported its enlargement in the two categories of
membership, and further supported the reform of the scale of contributions to the UN.
The Czech Republic, which had supported the introduction of a new scale of
contributions for peacekeeping operations, declared that all debts ought to be paid up
before accepting a new contributions scale. The Minister expressed appreciation for
the work of the two criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and
suggested the establishment of similar tribunals for Cambodia and Sierra Leone. He


-----

greeted efforts by the international community to establish an International Criminal
Court. He said that the attention of all member states should be turned towards
securing the right of every human being to a dignified and secure life. Referring to the
question of humanitarian intervention, he said that the Czech Republic demands that
any intervention in the sovereignty of member states should have the mandate of the
UN. He called for re-evaluation of economic sanctions, which are frequently counterproductive. Instead of the individuals against whom they are directed, they hit the
innocent population. That is why the Czech Republic advocates targeted sanctions
directed against leading representatives of states which are violating international
law, for example, an embargo on visas for specific persons or freezing foreign bank
accounts of specific persons. The Minister proposed formation of a panel of
experts, which would deal with these matters and draw up a thorough report. He
advocated the independence of Palestine and emphasized that the Czech Republic
opted for a peaceful solution. He spoke in favour of continued disarmament and the
non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. He apraised the work of Kosovo
Force (KFOR) and United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) but pointed to
the need for further steps to ensure a multiethnic, multicultural, and democratic
Kosovo.
At the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, the Czech Republic was the cosponsor of a number of resolutions. In accordance with the priorities of the foreign
policy of the Czech Republic, the delegation submitted some of its own positions on
various points (for example, disarmament, the International Atomic Energy Agency,
reform of the UN Security Council, reform of the scale of contributions, human
rights, the combating of international terrorism, the report of the International Law
Commission, etc.). As in previous years, the Czech Republic joined most of the joint
declarations of the EU and cooperated with delegations of EU member states, which
was a manifestation of the improving coordination of foreign political positions on all
major problems on the agenda.

_Conferences and special sessions of the United Nations_

The Twenty-third special session of the General Assembly on the advancement
of women entitled Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the
21[st] century was held in New York at the beginning of June 2000. It evaluated the
implementation of the conclusions of one of seven world conferences, which were
held in the 1990 s on the most pressing problems of economic and social progress.
The objective of the Twenty-third special session was to sum up the situation as
regards the implementation of the action platform adopted at the Fourth World
Conference on Women in 1995 in Beijing and to outline updated tasks for future
work. The national report prepared by the Czech Republic points to the need for


-----

greater equality in opportunities for men and women with their incorporation in the
decision-making process; a struggle must be waged against violence used against
women, against the trafficking in women, etc.
A Political Declaration and a Final Document were the key documents of the
session; these documents contain commitments of the Governments of Member
States, adopted by consensus. Their compromise character, the procedure of informal
talks at the special sessions in the course of their preparation, as well as several
speeches demonstrated that for the time being the difference in political and cultural
positions on the subject on the agenda on a global scale was a serious obstacle to the
solution of the questions outlined. The delegation of the Czech Republic, together
with the majority of the EU member states and associated countries, did not consider
the results on the deliberations sufficiently useful, especially in the areas of
reproduction health, family or rights in the sexual sphere.
The Twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly on social development,
held at the end of June 2000 in Geneva also assessed the implementation of the
commitments in the Action Programme of the World Summit for Social Development
(Copenhagen 1995). The Political Declaration and the Final Document confirmed the
validity of demands such as reducing the number of persons living in extreme poverty
by 2015, and raising the volume of development aid by advanced countries to the
value of 0.7% of their annual GDP (the present volume offered by OECD countries
amounted to less than 0.3% of annual GDP). The Czech Republic as a starting donor
has until now provided approximately 0.02% of its GDP), the need for investments in
human resources, as well as fundamental conditions for sustainable economic growth,
the struggle against HIV/AIDS and making pharmaceutical products for other
contagious diseases widely accessible. On the basis of experience accumulated in
recent years, the humanization of technical progress, a more radical approach to
debt cancellation initiatives, cooperation of the UN with Bretton Woods institutions
and of governments with civil society, the elimination of barriers obstructing access
to technical achievements and for vulnerable groups of the population or including
the private sector in development activities were strongly emphasized. Developing
countries made the strongest protest against the exploiting by the UN Secretariat
of statistical data, which do not fall within the series of monitored criteria approved
by consensus. The Czech Republic supported first and foremost a policy of full
employment and the implementation of recommendations by the International Labour
Organization, advocated by the European Union.
At the election into UN specialized commissions and programmes at the session of
the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) the Czech Republic, a member of
ECOSOC, succeeded in having its candidates elected and became a member of the
Commission for Social Development and the Statistical Commission. The June 2000
ECOSOC high-level meeting in New York discussed the utilization of information


-----

and communication technology for the improvement of the work of the UN and for
sustainable social and economic development. The Ministerial Declaration adopted
together with expert analyses laid the foundation for the Information and
Communication Technologies (ITC) Task Force in the UN to expand development aid
in the technological sphere. Other sections of the ECOSOC meeting concentrated on
increasing the effectiveness and coordination of humanitarian operations with a view
to utilizing the information and communication task force for technologies and
resources of the private sector and dealing with the pressing issue of the security of
humanitarian relief workers. In view of the concern expressed by many member
countries that humanitarian aid could be replaced by humanitarian intervention, no
generally acceptable final document has been adopted.
Negotiations on harmonizing and eliminating duplicities in UN development
programmes were important for the Czech Republic because, since 2000, the country
has been going through a three-year transition period, after which it will be
transferred permanently from the group of recipients of development aid to that of
donors, and this in view of the values of annual GDP. Apart from bilateral
development aid, multilateral development programmes offer great scope for making
the donor activities of the Czech Republic more visible.
The Eight session of the Commission on Sustainable Development, meeting in
April 2000, adopted a decision on procedure in international trade, financing and
investments and territorial planning in the interest of sustainable development.
Professor Moldan, representing the Czech Republic, was elected chairman of the
Commission for a one-year term, which will culminate at the Ninth session of the
Commission in April 2001.
The election of Ambassador Vacek, Head of the Permanent Mission of the Czech
Republic to the United Nations, the OSCE and other International Organisations in
Vienna, to the post of chairman of the Forty-fourth session of the Commission on
Narcotic Drugs (CND), was an expression of recognition of the work of the Czech
Republic in the Commission; the Czech Republic has been a member of the
Commission for three years. The Czech Republic has been concerned with the
implementation of the conclusions of the Twentieth UN special session of the General
Assembly in 1998 on drugs. While cooperating with the International Narcotics Control
Board in carrying out UN agreements in the field of international cooperation in the
fight against drugs, the Czech Republic also supported the expedient consolidation of
UN programmes in this field with special emphasis on control of acute centres of the
threat of drugs (Afghanistan) and a greater balance between UN activities in favour
of drug supply reduction on the one hand, and drug demand reduction on the other
hand. As a country with an advanced chemical and pharmaceutical industry, the
Czech Republic devoted special attention to the control of substances, representing
a significant element in the worldwide reduction of the manufacture of drugs.


-----

In 2000, ECOSOC gave its greatest attention to the transportation of hazardous
goods, safety in transportation tunnels and the problem of violence against women.
Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Inland
Waterways was signed. The joint project ECOSOC/Central European Initiative (CEI)
connected with the CEI Economic Forum in November 2000 was of great significance.
In relation to the World Food Programme (WFP), the Czech Republic continued on
the course of cooperation and offered 80 tonnes of sugar worth 1.5 million CZK to
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as part of its development aid through the WFP.
The conditions were created in the WFP to incorporate Czech exporters of food and
agricultural products in tender invitations of the WFP.
In collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the
Czech Republic has been issuing a Report on Human Development in the Czech
Republic for four years, which summed up the major trends of social and economic
transformation. The Labour and Social Affairs Research Institute in Prague drew up
the Report for 1999, published in 2000. Following its earlier successful membership
in the Executive Board of the UNDP/United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
Population Fund, which is the joint governing body of the UNDP and the UN, the
Czech Republic presided over this Executive Board in 2000. The meeting of foreign
ministers with the UNDP Administrator on seeking new sources for the financing of
development was assessed most favourably. The meeting was held in New York on
the eve of the fifty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly under the
chairmanship of the Czech Foreign Minister.
A four-year programme of training experts from developing countries was covered
by resources of the UNDP Trust Fund as part of the Czech Republic development aid.
The signing of an agreement with the UNDP regional office created the conditions for
the active involvement of the Czech Republic in UNDP regional projects in Central
and Eastern Europe.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic arranged an agreement
with the winning candidate of a public contest for the post of national contact persons
for cooperation with the UN Volunteers programme (UNV). This is based on
a government agreement between the Czech Republic and UNV of 1998. In 2000,
there was a slight increase in the number of offers for participation of Czech
volunteers, mainly in UNDP development programmes, and the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of the Czech Republic began to take systematic advantage of the services of
the national contact quarters as part of preparations for the International Year of
Volunteers in 2001; the Ministry made arrangements for citizens whose preparedness
for voluntary service abroad is regarded as a contribution to the development of
a civil society as well as a significant form of non-state diplomacy.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, in collaboration with the
Czech Committee for UNICEF, took part in 2000 in the preparation of special


-----

session of the General Assembly on children, which is to meet in September 2001
to assess the implementation of the conclusion of the 1990 World Summit for
Children. The Ministry welcomed the opportunity for the Czech Republic to
participate in the production of an introductory documentary film for the opening
of this session.

_International specialized organizations of the United Nations system_

At the end of 2000, the Government of the Czech Republic discussed the
Additional Protocol, which the country had signed in 1999 in accordance with the
interest in consolidating the effectiveness of the international safeguards system of
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The Czech Republic also supported
activities aimed at a revision of the Agreement on the Physical Protection of Nuclear
Materials. In February 2000, two expert missions, organized by the IAEA, were
arranged in the Czech Republic. They stated unequivocally that the Czech Republic
had a clearly defined control and legislative framework and that the license process
was proceeding in accordance with the best global standards. Experts of the IAEA
furthermore made a favourable evaluation of the state of preparation of the Temelin
nuclear power plant the Head of the Czech Delegation at the Forty-fourth General
Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the President of the State
Office for Nuclear Safety Ms. D. DrÆbovÆ, responded to Austrian concerns about the
safety of Temelin. A report by the Western European Nuclear Regulatory Agency
(WENRA) of October 2000 spoke in similar terms.
The Czech Republic contributed to the IAEA technical assistance programmes.
Between 1998 2000 it contributed the sum of USD 200,000 to a project for Ukraine,
which aimed at installing a new system for non-destructive control of VVER-1000
reactor vessels. A two-year programme to help Armenian nuclear surveillance in
evaluating the integrity of the primary circuit of the Medzamor nuclear power plant
was inaugurated in 2000; its value was USD 100,000. A joint programme between the
Czech Republic and the IAEA for building a centre for the manufacture of short-term
radiopharmaceuticals for determining diagnoses in cardiology and oncology at the Na
Homolce Hospital was successfully concluded in 2000.
The Czech Republic continued its intensive cooperation with the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The Czech Committee
for UNESCO, which includes among its members representatives of central and other
significant scientific, cultural and educational institutions and personalities of Czech
science and culture, offered their moral sponsorship to about 20 events. In 2000 2001,
UNESCO will offer financial subsidies for 7 projects, amounting to approximately
USD 100,000. Ms. MoserovÆ, member of the Senate of the Parliament of the Czech
Republic, was for two years chairwoman of the UNESCO General Conference. In this


-----

capacity, she attended a meeting of the Executive Council in 2000 as well as a number
of major UNESCO international events in various parts of the world.
The Director-General of UNESCO K. Matsuura visited the Czech Republic in
February 2000 at the invitation of President Havel. There was an open exchange of
views on the future activities of the organization.
The Czech Republic s representation at UNESCO was reorganized in 2000 (the
post of the permanent representative was separated from the post of bilateral
ambassador), which will provide for more intensive cooperation with the
organization s Secretariat and the Permanent Missions of other countries.
The Czech Republic took an active part in the reform process of the organization.
It was a member of the UNESCO working group for the 21st century, whose
decisions of will clearly influence the future orientation of the organization. The
Czech Republic presented itself in UNESCO as an advanced democratic state with
a rich cultural tradition. Member states appreciated the fact that 10 government
scholarships were regularly offered to the UNESCO scholarship bank. The meeting
of the World Heritage Committee in November 2000 approved the inclusion of the
column of the Holiest Trinity in Olomouc in the UNESCO World Heritage List. This
increased the number of the enlisted historical sites on the territory of the Czech
Republic to ten.
The Czech Republic became a member of the Council of the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) between 1999 2002. In 2000, it began to take an
active part in preparations of the World Summit on the Information Society to be held
in 2003 and organized mainly by the ITU.
In June 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued its World Health
Report 2000 which aims to quantify and compare health systems. The Czech
Republic received one of the foremost places among Central and East European
states. At an official visit by the Director of the Regional Office for Europe
M. Danzon and negotiations of the Standing Committee of the Regional Office for
Europe in Prague, it was announced that next year the Czech Republic would be the
pilot country for further statistical analyses following on the Report.
A visit by the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
J. Diouf to the Czech Republic in May 2000 was the climax of the successful
cooperation of the Czech Republic with that organization. An agreement was signed
during the visit on including Czech experts, financed by resources earmarked for
Czech development aid, in FAO projects and programmes. Both sides stated their
favourable opinion on the current state of relations, especially in the Czech
development aid offered through the intermediary of the FAO trust fund. The Czech
Agricultural University in Prague demonstrated its appreciation of the work of
Mr. Diouf by awarding conferring an honorary doctorate on him. President Havel also
received the FAO Director-General.


-----

The Eighty-eighth International Labour Conference, the supreme body of the
International Labour Organization (ILO), met at the end of May and beginning of
June 2000. The Conference was attended by a tripartite delegation of the Czech
Republic. It adopted a revised accord and ILO recommendation on the protection of
motherhood, dating back to 1952, and rescinded a number of obsolete accords of the
1930s; it also stated its views on a number of current political problems and trends
such as the rights of workers suffering from HIV/AIDS, the rights of workers in
occupied Palestinian territories, equal opportunities for both sexes in places of work,
and so forth. In light of continued forced labour in Myanmar a resolution was passed
calling for the speedy introduction of sanctions under Article 29 of the ILO accord,
which the Czech Republic supported.
A tripartite delegation of the Czech Republic attended the Sixth Regional
Conference in December 2000; the main point on its agenda was the inclusion of
database and communication technologies in the work process and in the preparation
of human resources.
Work on the amendment of the law on civil aviation proceeded in connection with
relations with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) under the
specialized auspices of the Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Czech
Republic; the objective is to unify the country s legislation with international
standards. The Czech Republic announced its intention to propose its candidate in
2001 for a seat in the ICAO Council.
The participation of the Czech Republic in the work of the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) in 2000 concentrated mainly on IMO specialized committees
with regard to harmonizing legislation with international legal, technical, safety and
environmental standards for the shipping and transportation of cargo by sea, both on
a global and on a European scale.
The Sixth meeting of the International Seabed Authority (ISA) was held in 2000.
At its autumn session, the Czech Republic was elected to the ISA Council. The
activities of the Czech Republic in ISA follow mainly from successful participation
in exploratory missions and in the interest of a specialized sponsor, e.g. the Ministry
of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic. Another objective is the follow-up
exploitation of this favourable position in the promising branch of excavating
minerals from the seabed. In 2000, the Czech Republic signed an Agreement on the
Privileges and Immunities of ISA and commenced the process of their ratification.
New opportunities were considered in 2000 for including the Czech Republic as
a donor in the future activities of the United Nations Industrial Development
Organization (UNIDO) and in the implementation of its integrated development
programmes. UNIDO has undergone some internal reforms. UNIDO is an
organization, which in the previous period was among those which promoted
development aid to the Czech Republic. The Director-General of UNIDO


-----

C. Magarin[~]os visited Prague in October 2000. He discussed the preparedness of the
Czech Republic for continued cooperation, especially in the field of cleaner
production.
The Czech Republic became a contracting party to the Agreement on Combating
the Expansion of the Desert (the agreement came into force in April 2000). It is
important from the point of view of an integrated procedure against the expansion of
the desert, which has a not negligible adverse influence on the food situation of a
number of countries. Membership will provide for the direct participation of Czech
experts in projects in which the Czech Republic has been involved with success, such
as geologists or veterinary surgeons; it will also help to activate Czech development
aid to developing countries.
The Sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change met in The Hague in November 2000. It was intended to determine
the mechanisms of implementing the Kyoto Protocol and thereby assist its large-scale
ratification. But agreement could not be reached in view of differing standpoints. It
was decided that the Conference would continue in Bonn in May 2000. The Czech
Republic played a significant role in the establishment of a group of states which hold
similar views on climatie change close to the EU, stressing the environmental
integrity of the Protocol and legally binding limits of greenhouse gases production.
The participation of the Czech Republic in the International Organization of the
Francophonie (OIF) extends the possibilities of cooperation with its member states,
which include not only traditional Francophone states but also the Central and East
European countries. The Czech Republic was awarded observer status at the OIF in
September 1999. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, as the
specialized organizer of cooperation with OIF set up a network of permanent
collaborators at other Czech ministries (Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Education,
Youth, and Sports, Ministry of Industry and Trade, and Ministry for Local
Development). A Club of Friends of Francophone Affairs was set up in the Chamber
of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic. A Club of Francophone
Journalists was also established. In February 2000, the Czech Republic was
represented at the International Conference on Women and La Francophonie in
Luxembourg and in June 2000, the Director of the Regional Branch of the Agency
of Francophonie Universities visited the Czech Republic. It was decided to set
up a Czech Committee of the Francophone Economic Forum which should start
the work from 1 January, 2002. In November 2000, a Czech delegation attended
the International Symposium on Democracy, Rule of Law, and Freedom in the
Francophone region in Bamako, Mali. A Czech representative attached to UNESCO
regularly attended the deliberations of the UNESCO Francophonie Section in Paris.
In the sphere of the environment, cooperation was established between the Ministry
for the Environment and the Institute of Energy and the Environment with its seat in


-----

Canada. The Four Days of Francophony were held in March 2001 in the Czech
Republic. The Czech Republic participated for the first time in the Fourth Games of
la Francophonie in Ottawa-Hull in July 2001.

**WTO, OECD**

_World Trade Organization (WTO)_

The World Trade Organization (WTO) was established on 1 January, 1995, as
a result of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The WTO is responsible for controlling the
multilateral trade system and is a forum for negotiations towards the liberalization of
trade in commodities and services and for drawing up regulations in all spheres
connected with trade. In 2000, the WTO had 140 members and some 30 states were
negotiating their membership. The WTO and its documents represent the basic
outline for the Czech Republic s foreign trade policy.
The Czech Republic, one of the founding members, underlined its trade policy and
economic interests in the WTO. It conducted bilateral talks with states joining the
WTO. Customs duty on industrial goods was carried out in the Czech Republic within
the WTO in accordance with the conditions stipulated in the List of Concessions to
the Czech Republic. The latest reduction (with the exception of textile, pharmaceutical
and chemical products where the operational period is 10 years) has been carried out
on 1 January, 1999, which put into practice the commitment of cutting customs duties
of these products, as agreed.
The Czech Republic also fulfilled its obligations arising from the agreement on
agriculture. Under the List of Concessions and obligations and in accordance with
the set timetable, the Czech Republic reduced import duties and gave access to its
market to selected items. Obligations concerning the level of domestic support and
export subsidies, provided in individual calendar years have also been observed and
gradually reduced. With regard to protective measures for imports of agricultural
produce, the Czech Republic currently applied these measures only in the case of
sugar imports.
License procedure is carried out in the Czech Republic in accordance with the
provisions of the Agreement on Licensing Procedures, which are reflected in Act No.
62/2000 on certain measures in the export and import of commodities and on license
procedure. The agreement on the application of Art. VI GATT 1994 (antidumping has
been incorporated in Act No. 152/1997. Antidumping procedure has been applied in
accordance with the antidumping law and as of 11 October, 2000, antidumping
customs duties have been imposed on the import of certain salt products for human
consumption. The Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures has been
reflected in Act No. 63/2000 on protection against the import of subsidized products.


-----

Specific obligations adopted by the Czech Republic under the General Agreement
on Trade and Services (GATS) and the protocols referring to these include the
consolidation of previous autonomous liberalization measures, e.g. maintaining
standards in access to markets and national performance, valid on the date these
agreements were concluded. The Czech Republic has undertaken not to introduce
new limitations on access to markets in these regions, which applies in the same way
as the notification duty on new legal arrangements on the pertinent sector of services.
Czech suppliers of services have until now used the opportunities for access to
foreign markets on a relatively small scale.
The Agreement on Trade Aspects of Intellectual Property Protection has
committed States parties to provide minimum protection and the imposition of rights
of intellectual property as a condition for the elimination of obstacles to international
trade. The Czech Republic completed implementing the provisions of this Agreement
in 2000 and included it in its legislation.
Following the abortive third WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle in 1999, it was
not possible, even in 2000, to reach agreement on the launching of a new round of
multilateral trade negotiations, notwithstanding considerable efforts. But a preparatory
phase was in progress, i.e. a phase of so-called mandate negotiations on trade in
agricultural products and trade in services.
Negotiations on trade in agricultural products will be gradually directed towards
reducing domestic support, export subsidies, and protection of the market. The first
phase which will last until March 2001 is to take the form of preparations and is
to determine the objectives, methods, and procedure of future negotiations. The
Czech Republic proceeds from the need to achieve an appropriate standard of support
and protection for the domestic market. It notes that further reform measures in Czech
agriculture will depend on the continued EU accession process. The Czech Republic
will place emphasis on the extra-production function of agriculture.
The first preparatory phase of negotiations on trade in services will end by March
2001. The negotiations will concentrate on the reduction or elimination of the adverse
effects of regulatory measures with regard to the objectives of national policy and the
level of development of individual Member States. The Czech Republic advocates
recognition of contractual and unilaterally adopted liberalizing measures in trade in
services. The negotiation position is regularly coordinated with the EU with the aim
of harmonizing Czech legislation and bringing commitments and the trend of
liberalization measures into line with the EU commitments. The Czech Republic
proposes that all sectors of services should be incorporated in the negotiations, that
conditions of access to markets be balanced with regard to the quantity and quality of
national obligations. Other proposals are the restriction of exceptions in the most-favoured-nation clause, greater transparency of the list of commitments and
completing negotiations on protective measures and subsidies.


-----

Negotiations took place in the Council for trade aspects of rights to intellectual
property, which aimed at creating a multilateral system for the registration of
geographical labels for wine, possibly spirits. Consultations were started on the
initiative of the Czech Republic on a possible increase of the degree of protection for
geographical marking of other products. The Czech Republic and other states would
like this agenda to be included among mandate negotiations and open multilateral
negotiations hand in hand with negotiations on agriculture and services. These
attempts came up against the negative position of certain Member States but in 2000
a final decision had not been made.
The failure of the third WTO Ministerial Conference gave the impetus to a further
search for a way out from the impasse that had arisen. That is why a process of
restoring mutual confidence among Member States and other states vis-a‘-vis
WTO and of increasing internal and external transparency has been launched.
A mechanism has been set up under which questions linked with the application of
WTO accords and agreements are assessed; the aim is to find a mutually satisfactory
solution and change the hesitant, and even negative attitude of most developing
countries to the new round of negotiations. It was hoped that the new round of WTO
negotiations would commence at the end of 2001.
In connection with the confidence restoration process, verification was carried out in
2000 on the way WTO agreements and accords were being carried out. It concentrated
mainly on the failure by developing countries to implement the agreements and accords
of the GATT Uruguay Round which make it impossible to take full advantage of
benefits arising from the multilateral trade system. Advanced states were interested in
a link between the implementation and the new round of multilateral negotiations,
whereas developing countries were more concerned merely with the continued
verification of implementation and the functioning of the existing mechanism.
The Czech Republic took an active part in negotiations aimed at measures to
improve access to markets for products originating in the poorest countries and
backed an initiative for duty-free and quota-free access of the least developed
countries to foreign markets. The Czech Republic came out in favour of the concept
of a broad based round of multilateral trade negotiations.
The EU conference with associated countries, attended by the Czech Republic at
the ministerial level, took place in July 2000; it dealt with the coordinated activities
of these countries in the WTO.

_Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)_

In 2000, it was 40 years since the foundation of the OECD. The Czech Republic
has been a member of the organization for five years it joined the OECD on
21 December, 1995, among the first transforming economies in Central and Eastern


-----

Europe. In accordance with its strategic interest in creating external conditions for
economic growth and the prosperity of the state and in a long-term sustainable
progress of the world economy, the Czech Republic was increasingly involved in the
OECD in 2000. Its active work in the organization helped to create good initial
conditions for membership in the EU.
The new dimension of cooperation between the Czech Republic and the OECD
began when the country was asked to join the agreement on the International Energy
Programme of 1974, e.g. to take full membership in the International Energy Agency
(IEA), which is associated with the OECD. This membership will follow at the
beginning of 2001 after the submission of ratification documents.
The Czech Republic continued to support Slovakia s efforts to join the OECD in
2000. The Czech Republic also supported assistance in stabilizing and renewing
South-Eastern Europe, as demonstrated by its substantial financial contribution.
As globalisation expanded and worldwide economic processes became more and
more interdependent, the OECD devoted great attention to cooperation with selected
significant economies of non-member states. The Czech Republic supported these
activities and, in line with of its own national interests, regarded some of them as
a priority. They include the programme of cooperation with the Baltic states and
Russia.
The inclusion of Member States in the activities of the OECD, which has the
character of a permanent inter-governmental conference on economic and social
development problems, requires active participation by the majority of the central
bodies of state administration. This facilitates the informal coordination of national
economic policies and procedures in expanding a homogeneous economic
environment. Apart from the tasks arising for the OECD from the founding
agreement, activities in 2000 focused on topical problems. Their solution is necessary
in the current stage in the development of global economic processes. These included
in particular:
Maintaining the sustainable development of society. The OECD helps to bring this
about by striving for the integration of the economic, social and environmental
policy of the governments of member countries. For this purpose it prepared
recommendations for governments both of member states, and of non-members
with the aim of ensuring the development of a global society on a sustainable
trajectory;
Harmful fiscal competition that damages national fiscal systems can be solved only
on a global scale. The OECD opened a dialogue in 2000 with the most significant
so-called tax havens in non-member economies. The Czech Republic plays a vital
role in this dialogue;
The struggle against the corruption of foreign public individuals in international
business transactions. In 2000, the OECD continued its investigation into how


-----

member countries ensured the application of an international agreement by the
same name in their legislation. The Czech Republic presented its ratification
documents on this agreement on 21 January, 2000. The evaluation, which the
OECD published in June 2000, was favourable for the Czech Republic.
Further noteworthy projects proceeded in 2000, such as the identification of
growth sources, an analysis of health systems, employment strategy, electronic trade,
equal opportunities for men and women, the public administration and management,
or a regulatory reform.
The Director-General of the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) Echavarri
visited the Czech Republic on 6 8 March, 2000. (NEA is one of the specialized
organizations of the OECD). During his visit, Mr. Echavarri visited the Temelin
nuclear power plant and observed a successful functioning test.
On 25 27 June, 2000, a Czech delegation attended a session of the OECD Council
at ministerial level. The meeting concentrated on a policy of supporting growth and
social solidarity, proposals arising for administration and management from
technological progress, and on a multilateral trading system. The OECD Council
approved an amendment to the Declaration on International Investments, which is
part of the Directive for a supra-national society. Governments of Member States are
advising their investors to maintain these Directives on the territories of OECD
Member States, as well as in other countries where they are engaged in transactions,
and to maintain ethical principles, taking into account aspects of human rights as
distinct from economic aspects and basic work standards, the environment,
sustainable development, the protection of consumers and the struggle against
corruption.
A conference on the labour market and employment in public services was held in
Prague on 3 4 July, 2000. It was attended by a number of ministers from the OECD
member and non-member countries as well as by the OECD Deputy Secretary-General Moe. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Labour and Social Affairs
pidla represented the Czech Republic. The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of
the Czech Republic organized the Conference in collaboration with the OECD.
The visit of the OECD Secretary-General Johnston in Prague on the occasion of
the meeting of the IMF and World Bank in September 2000 helped to promote
contacts between OECD top representatives and members of the Government of the
Czech Republic.
Work on the preparation of reviews of national policies in the field of regulatory
mechanisms and economic and energy policy was most useful for the Czech
Republic.
Throughout 2000, the Czech Republic expanded its activity in all OECD working
groups. The appointment of Czech representatives to the Committee for an
Environment Policy to several Deputy Chairman posts in this area, and the inclusion


-----

of Mr. Moldan in an eight-member working group for the preparation of proposals for
environment strategy and future prospects for the first ten years of the 21[st] century,
were a demonstration of the recognition of the Czech Republic s contribution to the
work of the OECD.

**International Monetary Fund, World Bank**
**and other major international economic organizations**

_International Monetary Fund (IMF)_

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was founded in 1944 and Czechoslovakia
at that time was one of the founding members. But in 1954 its membership was
suspended for failing to fulfil obligations stipulated in the statute (the volume of
economic data to be submitted). In 1990, Czechoslovakia s full membership was
restored. Following its break-up, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as successor
states, became members in 1993 and took upon themselves all rights and obligations
arising from their membership. The IMF today has 182 members. The Articles of
Agreement of the IMF clearly state that its major aim is to promote international
monetary cooperation and currency stability and facilitate the expansion of balanced
growth of international trade. The Board of Governors is the supreme body of the
IMF. The official representative of a member country in the IMF acts the governor,
nominated by the Government. The Czech representative is the Governor of the
Czech National Bank, currently Z. Tøma. According to international practice, a deputy
minister of finance normally holds the post of deputy governor. The number of votes
of the Czech Republic in the IMF is determined by its membership quota and stands
at 0.39% of all voting rights.
Current cooperation takes mainly the form of regular IMF missions to the Czech
Republic under Article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the IMF. They result in
recommendations for economic policy, above all, in the monetary, fiscal, and salary
areas. In addition to these regular missions there, are occasional non-regular visits
(so-called Staff Visits the last of these was in October 2000), aimed at expanding
and supplementing information gathered during regular missions. The results of these
missions are always submitted to the IMF Council of Executive Directors. After that,
the Council of Executive Directors draws up a detailed report giving an account of
the economic and financial situation of the Czech Republic and its evaluation. This
serves as a basis for a brief report to be published in the media. The Czech Republic
is among the IMF countries, which have also given their consent to the publication of
a detailed report in full.
In 2000, the Czech Republic participated in the Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP), organized by the IMF and the World Bank. The Programme makes
a very thorough evaluation of the financial sector in the context of the identification


-----

of its strong and weak aspects. The first stage of the work was executed at the end of
November and beginning of December 2000, aimed at observing the standards and
codes of the financial sector of the Czech Republic. The second visit by a mission
took place at the beginning of 2001 and its objective was an assessment of the
vulnerability of the financial sector.
On 26 28 September, 2000, the Annual Meeting of the Boards of Governors of the
International Monetary Fund and of the World Bank Group was hosted in Prague. The
joint deliberations of the Boards of Governors of the two institutions was preceded by
deliberations of their consultative bodies, e.g. the Development Committee, the joint
consultative body of the IMF and the World Bank for safeguarding and the transfer
of resources to developing countries, and the International Monetary and Financial
Committee, the consultative body of the IMF Board of Governors. By its magnitude
and importance, this event was one of the most important international occasions and
the biggest congress event ever to be organized in the Czech Republic the Annual
Meetings of the Boards of Governors of the IMF and the World Bank in Prague were
attended by almost 20,000 persons from 182 states from all over the world. The
Czech Republic was one of 20 states, which so far have had the opportunity to
organize such a session of prominent bankers, economists and politicians. All official
assessments had words of praise for the Czech Republic and of recognition for the
perfect organization under most difficult circumstances.

_World Bank_

The Czech Republic is a member of the World Bank, as of the IMF, since the
foundation of the country on 1 January, 1993. The Board of Governors is the supreme
body of the World Bank. The Governor of the World Bank representing the Czech
Republic was the Minister of Finance and his alternate was the Deputy Governor of
the Czech National Bank. Voting rights of the Czech Republic are determined by the
size of its capital deposit and amount to 0.41%.
The World Bank Group consists of the following institutions:
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which provides
financial and technical assistance to developing countries and to economies in the
process of transformation;
International Development Association (IDA), which finances the development of
the poorest countries;
International Finance Corporation (IFC), which finances development projects in
developing countries and economies in the process of transformation, such as the
Czech Republic, by means of long-term credits and minority capital investments;
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA);
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).


-----

The Czech Republic is among the clients of IBRD. In 1991, IBRD granted
Czechoslovakia at the time a credit of USD 450 million to finance structural changes
in the economy, especially the establishment of an infrastructure. After the break-up
of Czechoslovakia, USD 300 million were allocated to the Czech Republic. At
present the Czech Republic still has to repay USD 180 million. The Czech Republic
has not drawn any further credits from IBRD and does not intend to do so in future.
Cooperation presently concentrates on technical assistance by the World Bank, which
in 2000 included the following projects:
A project assessing public expenditure which was to serve as one of the foundations
when preparing the budget for 2002;
A project to build institutional capacities for crisis management;
A project of the Financial Sector Assessment Programme, aimed at investigating
the stability of the finance sector; executed in the Czech Republic by the World
Bank in collaboration with the IMF;
A project for the completion of the transformation of banks and firms aimed at
evaluating the legislative and institutional framework of the restructuring of
banks and businesses by claiming the settlement of debts has been completed in
2000.
Cooperation between the Czech Republic and the World Bank in the environment
sector continued successfully in 2000. Under the relevant project the Czech Republic
made contributions in this sphere but also drew grants from the World Bank
environment fund for the protection of the environment of the Czech Republic,
mainly for protection of the ozone layer, the biological diversity and the utilization of
waste heat.
In 2000, preliminary discussions began between the Czech Republic and the World
Bank on the so-called graduation of the Czech Republic from the IBRD, e.g. the
transfer of the Czech Republic from the group of recipients of technical assistance
and credits into the group of advanced states, which provide this assistance. The
Governor of the State Bank is to state his opinion on this matter officially at a 2001
joint spring session of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington.

_Other major international economic organizations_

Contrary to the worldwide focus of the IMF and the World Bank, the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) aims to offer assistance to
transitional countries of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as to the countries of the
former Soviet Union in support of their market economies. The EBRD offers loans
to 26 countries; it is expected that as of 2001, financial assistance will also be given
to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which became the sixty-first member of the
EBRD in October 2000.


-----

The supreme body is the Board of Governors, where the Czech Minister of Finance
represents the Czech Republic. His alternate was the Governor of the Czech National
Bank. The share of the Czech Republic in the subscribed capital of the EBRD amounts
to 0.88%, which also represents the voting rights of the Czech Republic. The Board of
Governors meets once a year at an annual session of EBRD. The last annual session
of the Board of Governors was held in Riga on 21 22 May, 2000.
The EBRD in the Czech Republic concentrates mainly on financing the private
sector. Since its foundation, it has approved 32 projects for the Czech Republic,
amounting to 676.6 million euro. Of these, 18 projects have been financed by
the capital deposit of EBRD (409.3 million euro) and 14 projects by a credit
(206.0 million euro). In the public sector, the EBRD has concluded two agreements
on financing: 42.8 million euro for the development of telecommunications and
18.8 million euro to finance the Czech railways. Six new projects to the value of
51.5 million euro have been signed in 2000.
The European Investment Bank (EIB), is a financial institution of the European
Union that has its own legal jurisdiction and financial independence. Its members
include the EU member states. The membership of the Czech Republic and its share
in raising the capital of the EIB will be negotiated together with accession of the
Czech Republic to the EU. The activities of the EIB in the Czech Republic
concentrate chiefly on financing projects to integrate transport, telecommunication,
and energy infrastructures. The EIB also pays attention to the environment, support
of small and medium businesses, and public services. Outline agreements on financial
cooperation are concluded to support activities of the EIB. These agreements are the
contractual legal foundation for grants offered to the Czech Republic and Czech
economic institutions. The latest outline agreement between the Czech Republic and
the EIB was signed on 2 December, 1997, and it is expected that it will remain valid
until the Czech Republic s accession to the EU. In 2000, EIB granted the Czech
Republic financial resources amounting to 455 million euro (4 projects). Altogether
the Czech Republic obtained financial resources from EIB worth of 2,362 million
euro. These resources were used to pay for projects with state guarantees amounting
to 1,605 million euro (12 projects), as well as for projects without state guarantees to
the value of 757 million euro (13 projects). All projects are devised in such a way as
to help the Czech Republic to come as close as possible to the standards of the
European Union.
The Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB), formerly (until 1 November,
1999) Social Development Fund of the Council of Europe, was founded in 1956 and
belongs to the Council of Europe. It contributes to the development of social
investment programmes and offers credit to its member countries or to finance
institutions approved by the Governments of these countries. The activity of the CEB
is based on subscribed capital and its own available funds. CEB is a multilateral


-----

development bank with a social vocation. It is legally and financially autonomous and
constitutes the chief instrument of a solidarity policy pursued by the Council of
Europe. The CEB has 35 members. The Czech Republic has been a member since
12 February, 1999.
The prime objective of CEB is to help to solve social issues associated with the
presence of refugees, displaced persons, migrants, or victims of natural or ecological
disasters. CEB finances primarily projects for job creation and the construction of
social housing, creating a social infrastructure, helping small and medium businesses
and projects in protection of the environment, promoting education and health, the
modernization of agriculture, improving the quality of the environment in urban areas
at a disadvantage and the restoration of historical monuments.
The governing bodies of CEB are: the Governing Board, the Administrative
Council and the Auditing Board.
In May 2000, the CEB Administrative Council agreed to a loan of 32.5 million CZK
to participate in financing a project of communal housing for the Romany population
in Brno. The loan has so far not been used since in the course of a revision of the
project at the end of the year it was found that the budget expenditure had risen from
65 million to 150 million CZK and consequently the structure of the financing of the
project must be amended. In 2000, work commenced at the Ministry for Local
Development of the Czech Republic on two compact projects (social housing and
reconstruction of selected castles and chateaux in Central Europe), which should be
financed in collaboration with CEB credits.

**7. Non-proliferation, arms control, and disarmament**

_Weapons of mass destruction_

In 2000, the Czech Republic continued to support measures aimed at advancing the
non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and bringing about gradual
elimination of nuclear weapons and their delivery vehicles.

_a) Nuclear weapons_

The Czech Republic continued to implement the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and to support its full implementation and universal
application. It actively participated in the Sixth NPT Review Conference in New York
on 24 April 19 May, 2000, the most significant event in the area of nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament in that year. Among its successes was the fact that for
the first time in 15 years its participants adopted a Final Document. The Czech
Republic welcomed the fact that the Conference recognized the need for negotiating


-----

a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT) within the next five years and for
establishing in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva an appropriate subsidiary
body to deal with nuclear disarmament, that it confirmed the principle of
irreversibility in nuclear disarmament, the need for reduction of tactical nuclear
weapons on the basis of unilateral initiatives, etc. The Joint Declaration of the
nuclear-weapon states at the Conference, with an unequivocal obligation regarding
nuclear disarmament, greatly contributed to a consensus even though specific
timetable has not been given.
In the First Committee of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, the
Czech Republic voted in support of the resolution A World Without Nuclear
Weapons: the Need for a New Agenda, which was among the most important items
on the agenda of the disarmament talks in the General Assembly. The Czech
Republic supported the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones, as well as zones
without other weapons of mass destruction on a voluntary basis, in accordance with
the guidelines on the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones adopted by the
Disarmament Commission in April 1999. The Czech Republic does not consider it
to be realistic to apply pressure on introducing nuclear-weapon-free zones in areas
where political conditions for this or a necessary consensus of all countries
concerned does not exist.
The Czech Republic held the chairmanship of the Preparatory Commission of the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) in the first half of
2000. It strived to help towards the CTBT s entry into force. On various occasions, for
example in the First Committee of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, it
appealed to states which had so far not signed or ratified the CTBT to do so without
delay. As the chairing country, the Czech Republic participated in promoting the
Facility Agreement adjusting the relationship between the UN and the Preparatory
Technical Secretariat of the CTBTO. This agreement will enable investments to be
made through the intermediary of local UNDP offices and UN passports to be granted
to all officials of the Preparatory Technical Secretariat of the CTBTO. The Czech
Republic supported, and is involved in completing and testing the International
Monitoring System (IMS) even before the treaty comes into force. In 2000, the Czech
Republic continued to negotiate Agreement between the Preparatory Commission of
the CTBTO and Government of the Czech Republic on the Conduct of Activities,
including Post-Certification Activities, relating to International Monitoring Facilities
for the CTBT (Facility Agreement) which will create the conditions for the operation of
a seismological monitoring station of the IMS in Southern Moravia.
The Czech Republic, as a member of the Zangger Committee and the Nuclear
Suppliers Group, concentrated on the activities of these informal groups of countries,
mainly on increasing their transparency.


-----

_b) Chemical and biological weapons_

The Fifth Conference of the contracting states of the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) met in The Hague on 15 19 May, 2000;
that is where the two-year term of the Czech Republic in the Executive Council of the
OPCW officially came to an end. Based on the Convention on the Prohibition of the
Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their
Destruction, the Executive Council meets five times a year.
The Director-General of OPCW Bustani visited the Czech Republic in May 2000,
at the invitation of the Minister of Industry and Trade. During his visit, the Ministers
of Foreign Affairs, Industry and Trade, and Defence received him. In October 2000,
a delegation of the Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Security of the Senate
of the Parliament of the Czech Republic visited the OPCW and was briefed about its
activities and objectives. In November 2000, the Czech Republic arranged for the
OPCW Technical Secretariat to conduct practical training of inspectors of the
Organization at the training premises in Vy kov, together with instruction on ways of
investigating and liquidating an attack with chemical weapons.
Throughout the year, experts of the Ad Hoc Group (AHG), conducted negotiations
in Geneva with the aim of drawing up the final version of a text of an internationally
and legally binding instrument the Verification Protocol on consolidating the
Convention on the Prohibition of Development, Production, and Stockpiling of
Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction (BTWC).
Representatives of the Czech Republic from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs,
Defence, and Health participated in these negotiations. The negotiations were
extremely complicated and demanding. The delegation of the Czech Republic
repeatedly requested the prompt completion of the text of the protocol, so that it could
be submitted for signing even prior to the BTWC Fifth Review Conference in 2001.
In this context, the Czech Republic started preparations for the establishment of an
independent national control body.
In October 2000, the Czech Republic was represented at the Plenary Session of the
Australia Group in Paris, which discussed certain measures to make the activities of
this control body in the sphere of chemical and biological weapons more effective.
As in previous years, no firm progress was made in 2000 on the non-proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction and disarmament. Somewhat more promising
progress was made in the areas of chemical weapons, at least as regards fulfilling the
provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention, and, as regards biological weapons,
constant pressure was being applied on intensifying verification measures. On the
other hand, there is stagnation in the sphere of nuclear weapons and their nonproliferation and total liquidation. This unfortunate state of affairs has its long-term
impact especially on the negotiations of the main disarmament forum the
Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The Czech Republic, in collaboration with


-----

EU members and associate members and with NATO members intends to strive in the
Conference on Disarmament to overcome the present unfavourable state of affairs
and to support universal and consistent implementation of NPT and CTBT, as well as
prompt negotiations on FMCT.

_Delivery vehicles of weapons of mass destruction_
_and anti-missile defence_

A plenary session of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) met in
Helsinki in October 2000. The main topic on the agenda was a discussion and the
approval of the text of an international code of conduct against the proliferation of
ballistic missiles. If the code receives wide support in the international community, it
could contribute towards endeavours to halt the proliferation of missiles and related
technology. In the First Committee of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly,
the Russian Federation together with China and Belarus submitted a resolution
Preservation of and compliance with the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic
Missile Systems, which was passed by a majority. The Czech Republic, alongside the
majority of EU members and associate members, as well as other states, abstained,
because it is of the opinion that the question of the ABM Treaty should be addressed
on a bilateral basis by the United States and the Russian Federation.

_Conventional weapons_

The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and
Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction (hereafter the Ottawa
Convention) came into force for the Czech Republic on 1 April, 2000. Since that date,
more than 120,000 land mines of a total of 329,100 have been destroyed in the Czech
Republic. A new technology and a delaboratory belt was used in the destruction in the
Czech Republic as of 2 May, 2000. The development and introduction was the
responsibility of the Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic. The last deadline for
the destruction of all land mines in the Czech Republic will be set on the basis of
experience gathered during the first year the delaboratory equipment is in use. In
accordance with Art. 4 of the Ottawa Convention, the Czech Republic will in any case
do everything possible to observe the specified deadline, namely 1 April, 2004. The
Czech delegation presented information on the destruction of mines and the
fulfilment of obligations arising from the Ottawa Convention at the second meeting
of participating countries in Geneva in September 2000.
In December 2000, a delegation of the Czech Republic attended the Second Annual
Conference in Geneva on the Protocol II on Prohibition or Restrictions on the Use of
Mines, Booby-Traps and other Devices, annex to the Convention on Certain
Conventional Weapons (CCW), which the Czech Republic ratified in 1998. At these


-----

negotiations and at the Preparatory Committee for the Review Conference of the state
parties, several proposals were submitted regarding anti-vehicles mines and explosive
remnants of war, as well as proposal on expanding the scope of the connention to
include non-international conflicts.
Throughout 2000, efforts continued in the international community to look for
a solution to the problem of small arms and light weapons (SALW). In the course of
ongoing negotiations, the Czech Republic hoped to achieve a balanced relationship
between the interest of the international community in the implementation of foreign
political obligations, concentrating on the most stringent control, especially the
export, import, and re-export of SALW, including adequate international transparency,
and the protection of the security and trade interests of states. The Czech Republic
took account of commitments arising from the country s membership in the United
Nations, NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well
as of the process of incorporating the country in the EU and also having regard to the
share in implementing measures emerging from the participation of the Czech
Republic in the international control regime for the control of exports of conventional
weapons, material for dual use, the so-called Wassenaar Arrangement.

**8. Foreign development and humanitarian aid**

_Foreign development aid_

Foreign development aid provided by the Czech Republic is governed by the
Principles of Foreign Development Aid, approved by the Czech Government
Resolution No. 153 of 15 March, 1995. This aid is given predominantly to countries
which aim to introduce or consolidate democracy, human rights and a market
economy, as well as to countries with which the Czech Republic maintains traditional
close relations. Concrete development projects are an inseparable part of Czech
foreign policy.
Development aid projects are approved annually by the Government of the Czech
Republic on the basis of a plan of individual projects, submitted by the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, which coordinates them. The projects are
proposed and carried out by the various departments depending on their purpose; they
take the form of bilateral or multilateral cooperation. The Chamber of Deputies of the
Parliament of the Czech Republic approves the amount of the resources earmarked
for foreign development aid as part of the Czech state budget. After the approval, the
resources are transferred from the chapter of the General Accounts Administration to
the budgets of the individual departments. In 2000, the sum of 345 million CZK was


-----

set aside for development projects, in the years to come this sum is to increase
proportionately, depending on the possibilities of the economy so that the Czech
Republic gradually reaches the level of development aid granted by EU or OECD
Member States.
The Czech Republic granted development aid mainly to Asia (approximately
34%), followed by the Middle East (21%), Latin America (15%), Eastern European
countries (12%), the Balkan countries (12%), and Africa (7%).
The system of granting development aid, its principles and organizational
provisions were thoroughly assessed in 2000, with the aim of introducing amendments
to increase its effectiveness and to make its priorities and organizational provisions
comparable with the policy and practice of advanced OECD and EU countries.

_Foreign humanitarian aid_

By providing foreign humanitarian aid, the Czech Republic demonstrates its
solidarity with the international community in dealing with crisis situations and
problems, which are beyond the power of the countries affected. The Czech Republic
offers aid to specific countries, either directly or through international governmental
and non-governmental organizations and institutions, observing the principles of the
international community and of the International Committee of the Red Cross and
Red Crescent, the United Nations, the EU, and Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. It respects the principle of impartiality. The Czech Republic
grants humanitarian aid through the following means:
Sending a rescue team (firefighters, dog handlers, speleologists, mine rescue
service, chemical experts, etc.);
Offering material aid needed or requested in the affected area (food, medicine,
medical material, blankets, tents, awnings, accommodation units);
Financial aid to Czech or foreign humanitarian organizations by a specific frozen
transfer for operations in the affected region, possibly directly to the institutions in
the country concerned;
Advisory and technical aid provided by specialists on the spot or providing
information to prevent human casualties or limit material losses;
Combined aid.
In 2000, the Czech Republic offered humanitarian aid within the limits of its
possibilities to almost 30 countries affected by exceptional events natural
catastrophes, technical disasters, or conflicts and war. Under the terms of the new
Act No. 239/2000 on an integrated rescue system the jurisdiction, of individual
institutions (Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Finance, and
Ministry of Agriculture) has been clarified, in order to make humanitarian aid more
effective. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, in accordance with


-----

Act No. 2/1969 on the establishment of ministries and other central institutions of the
state administration, the so-called law on authority, is responsible for coordinating
activities.
In 2000, the Czech Republic granted humanitarian aid from resource reserves of
the General Accounts Administration to 23 countries with 25 projects; this aid
amounted to 26.7 million CZK. The Government of the Czech Republic further
decided on 21 July, 1999, in decision No. 765, to release 22.7 milion CZK from the
funds of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, to help to reduce the
effects of the Kosovo crisis and to give additional humanitarian aid to the Balkan
countries.
The territorial distribution of humanitarian aid was most varied. Apart from the
Balkans, which represented a separate chapter, aid by the Czech Republic went to
three continents:
In Europe to France (lending electricity generators to reduce the effects of storms
during the first few days of 2000), to Hungary (during the floods and the escape
of cyanide into the river Tisa), to the Netherlands (following the explosion of
a pyrotechnical warehouse in the town of Enschede), to extinguish fires in Greece
and F.Y.R. of Macedonia, and to Belarus (Insulin supplies), to Ukraine (supplies of
medical instruments), to Moldova (to reduce the effects of storms and severe icing)
and to Slovakia (extinguishing extensive forest fires);
In Asia to Mongolia (struggle against famine), to Cambodia (aid during floods), to
Georgia (help to refugees after the conflict of war), to Vietnam (floods), Palestinian
Authority (medical equipment), to the Democratic People s Republic of Korea
(restoration of agriculture) and to Chechnya (food and distribution of water filters);
In Africa to Mozambique, South Africa, Zimbabwe (floods), Sierra Leone (aid to
children hit by war), and to Ethiopia and Eritrea (reducing famine and help to
refugees).
Humanitarian aid by the Czech Republic has helped the countries affected to save
lives and property and did much to spread the good name of the Czech Republic
abroad.

## II. Bilateral Relations of the Czech Republic

**1. Summary information on bilateral relations**

Bilateral relations are the foundation of the external relations of the Czech
Republic. At the end of 2000, the Czech Republic had diplomatic relations with
176 states. In accordance with the Concept of the Foreign Policy, priority attention
was devoted to relations with neighbouring states and member states of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU).
With the accession of the Czech Republic to NATO in 1999 relations with the other
member states in Europe and in North America strengthened. The countries included
Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Iceland, Canada, Luxembourg, Germany, the
Netherlands, Norway, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Greece, Spain, Turkey, the United
States and Great Britain.
In connection with the ongoing negotiations on the Czech Republic s accession to
the European Union, bilateral relations with the 15 member states of the EU increased
and became closer. This applied to the following countries: Belgium, Denmark,
Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal,
Austria, Greece, Spain, Sweden, and Great Britain.
The revival of regional cooperation within the Visegrad Group helped to
promote bilateral relations with Slovakia, Hungary and Poland. The Czech
Republic did its utmost to ensure that relations with Slovakia reach an
above-standard level. Agreements were reached with Germany and Austria,
providing for compensation to be paid to Czech citizens who were in forced labour
camps during the Second World War. The Czech Republic was engaged in an
intensive dialogue with Austria on certain issues, which had an impact on their
relations.
The Czech Republic maintained most intensive political and economic relations as
well as extensive cultural contacts. More than 80% of the turnover of Czech foreign
trade was with these countries and the countries in this region had the greatest share
in direct foreign investments in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic made every effort to maintain and promote relations with the
countries in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe. The objective of Czech foreign policy
was to restore standard contacts with the Russian Federation, with special emphasis
on expanding and increasing economic cooperation.


-----

The Czech Republic laid emphasis on expanding relations with the South-Eastern
European countries and increasing relations with its traditional partners in the region.
It took advantage of bilateral relations and international organizations to consolidate
stability in the region. The Czech Republic identified with the priorities of the
Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, which included the preservation of lasting
peace, prosperity, and stability in the region, the expansion of effective regional
cooperation and a firm position of the region in Europe.
In keeping with the Concept of Foreign Policy the Czech Republic expanded its
contacts with the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin American during the period
under discussion. The main emphasis in bilateral relations was on the economic
sphere. During this period, more treaties and agreements were signed with special
reference to visas and trade.
The chapter on bilateral relations contains basic data on the relations of the Czech
Republic with individual countries. In accordance with the Concept of Foreign Policy
it gives pride of place to neighbouring countries. In the next section it deals with
relations with the countries of NATO and the EU, then with relations of the Czech
Republic and the Baltic countries, with relations with the countries of Eastern and
South-Eastern Europe and certain other European states. Separate sections are
devoted to relations of the Czech Republic with the countries of Asia and the Pacific,
the Middle East and Eastern and North Africa, relations with the countries in SubSaharan Africa and relations with the Latin American countries. Individual countries
are listed in the relevant sections in alphabetical order with the exception of section
2. Relations of the Czech Republic with the countries of Central Europe .
The data on foreign trade of the Czech Republic with individual countries have
been taken over from information provided by the Czech Republic Customs
Administration; they are given in current prices and rounded up or down. (The exact
values are given in the table supplement.)

**2. Relations of the Czech Republic**
**with the Central European countries**

**SLOVAKIA**

The special relations between the two countries were maintained in 2000. After
solving the matter of the division of property of the former Czechoslovak Federal
Republic in 1999, there has been a further intensification of contacts in 2000 covering
all spheres and at all levels. An example was the increasing number of treaties
especially in the field of culture, education and health, which will be of substantial


-----

assistance to citizens of the two countries. Broadening cross-border cooperation also
did much towards more active relations. Great attention has been devoted to
procedure on border checkpoints between the two states as well as to other methods
of making travel between the two countries more comfortable. Cooperation within

_Economic relations_

In 2000, Slovakia remained the second biggest trade partner of the Czech Republic
with a 6.8% share of the total foreign trade turnover. The Treaty on the Introduction
of a Customs Union contributed to extensive economic and trade cooperation.
Czech exports to Slovakia amounted to 86.1 billion CZK in 2000, while imports
amounted to 74.7 billion CZK. With a turnover of 160.7 billion CZK, the Czech
Republic was in credit to the equivalent of 11.4 billion CZK.
The commodities most in demand were machinery and equipment (29.8%), market
products (25.6%) and chemicals (13.5%). koda automobiles were the most
significant export item.
Trade in agricultural and food products was a sensitive aspect of trade relations in
2000; it accounted for approximately 11.3%. Problems in this sphere have been
regularly discussed at meetings of the Customs Union Council as well as at sessions
of its Committee for the Coordination of Agricultural Policy.
A problem that in part influenced the results of mutual trade was caused by certain
protectionist measures. Non-tariff measures introduced by the Slovakia were mainly
quantitative limitations, and as of June 1999, also an import surcharge which was
reduced to 5% as of 1 July, 2000, and abolished by 1 January, 2000.
Quantitative limitations affected mainly cane or beet sugar (3,500 tonnes),
sweetened non-alcoholic beverages (540,000 hectolitres) and beer (532,000
hectolitres). On the other hand, the Czech Republic applied a reciprocal quota of the
same size to imports of sugar and a quantitative limitation of the import of iso-glucose
(5,000 tonnes/year for 2000).


-----

Expert talks took place in 2000, concerning significant economic treaties an
Agreement on the protection of and mutual support for investments and an
Agreement on mutual recognition of the findings of laboratory tests of agricultural
and food products.
Attention was also devoted to improving the situation at border crossing points in
dealing with cargo consignments. There were partial improvements in 2000 but
a greater qualitative shift is expected in 2001.

_Cultural relations_

A common language environment, history, traditions and personal contacts provide
for exceptionally intensive contacts precisely in the cultural field. These took place
on three levels:
Official exchanges are guaranteed by an Agreement between the Government of
the Czech Republic and the Government of the Slovak Republic on Cooperation in
Culture, Education and Science, signed on 23 May, 2000, in Prague. The Ministry of
Culture the Czech Republic has drawn up a proposal for an inter-departmental
Programs of Cooperation for 2001 2003; the previous programs expired in 1999.
The permanent official support for theatre festivals (Nitra, Czech Theatre in
Bratislava, the Puppet Festival Babkarska Bystrica) as well as cooperation between
the two National Theatres is anchored in the treaty of 1992. In 2000, the Eight
ARTFILM film festival, under the auspices of the Minister of Culture of the Czech
Republic, was held in Trencianske Teplice with the participation of Czech artists and
Czech films.
The annual Czech Days, arranged at Ko ice with the support of the Czech General
Consulate in Ko ice, helped to promote the Czech Republic in Eastern Slovakia and
to promote bilateral contacts between associations of Czech expatriates in Slovakia.
Lively contacts were arranged on a comercial basis organized by agencies. This
applied mainly to popular music, performances by theatrical agency presentations,
exhibitions arranged by private galleries, etc. Non-profit organizations played
a significant part in mutual cultural exchanges by amateur or minority groups.


-----

**POLAND**

Relations between the Czech Republic and Poland developed in a positive manner
and can be described as especially good neighbourly relations. They are based not
only on common historical experience but also on common interests and, as of 1999,
also on the alliance of the two countries within NATO; they are reaching their
historically most active level.
The two countries collaborated closely in preparing for their accession to the
European Union, both bilaterally and within the Luxembourg Group of candidate
countries. Cooperation between the two countries is of a significant regional dimension.
A special place is held by Visegrad Cooperation and by Central European Free Trade
Agreement in economic relations. Cooperation within the Euro-Regions played
a special role.
Poland was in sixth place among the trade partners of the Czech Republic.

_Economic relations_

Poland is a traditionally significant trade partner of the Czech Republic. With
a 5.5% share, it was the fourth biggest market for Czech exports in the early 1990s.
After a temporary decline in the early 1990s, caused by the political and economic
transformation of the two countries, exchanges are now picking up dynamically.
There has been an increase in economic exchanges, investments and other forms of
economic cooperation.
The Czech Republic and Poland have a similar position in many international
economic organizations they are associate members of the EU, members of OECD,
the WTO and also founding members of Central European Free Trade Agreement
(CEFTA). The Central European Free Trade Area has created the fundamental
framework for trade exchanges. The meeting of prime ministers of the CEFTA
countries in Warsaw in November 2000 confirmed that a free trade area covering
industrial goods would be created on 1 January, 2001, between the Czech Republic
and Poland, as a result of the abolition of all tariff and non-tariff obstacles to trade.
Whereas trade in industrial goods has been greatly liberalized, certain restrictions
arising from the significance of the agricultural sector in individual countries persist
in agriculture between the CEFTA countries.
From the very beginning of their existence, Czech exports have had a higher dynamic
than imports from Poland. In 2000, the turnover of trade attained 105.2 billion CZK.
Czech exports were worth 60.9 billion CZK, while imports from Poland amounted to
44.3 billion CZK. The Czech surplus was 16.6 billion CZK (a higher surplus was
attained only in trade with Germany). The growth of Czech exports in 2000 was due
mainly to agricultural products. Although exports of industrial goods with a higher
value added tax increased more slowly, they nevertheless accounted for two-thirds of
Czech exports. Although more than half of the trade surplus with Poland was from trade
with products included in the category of machines and transportation equipment, trade
in transportation equipment accounted for a substantial proportion of the trade surplus.
The koda MladÆ Boleslav car factory was the major Czech exporter (about 10% of
total exports to Poland). The commodities that predominated in Polish exports to the
Czech Republic were semi-finished goods and raw materials, while exports of
consumer goods increased rapidly.
There were no problems of substance which would hamper the further
development of trade. Both sides have applied protective measures on certain
commodities (coal on both sides, the Czech side on sugar and syrups, the Polish side
on wheat, butter, tomato concentrate, starch and maize).

_Cultural relations_

Relations between the two countries in this field are based on the Programs for
Cultural, Educational, and Scientific Cooperation. Work has been in progress to
prepare a new cultural agreement, which would follow on the Agreement on Cultural
and Scientific Cooperation of 1991.
An example of successful cultural cooperation was the theatre festival On the
Border, arranged every year since the beginning of 1990 simultaneously in the towns
of Czech and Polish T n. It was a review of the most interesting performances by
Czech, Polish, Slovak, and Hungarian ensembles, plus seminars and discussions by
drama experts from the countries concerned.
A large Festival of Czech Culture was held in Wroclaw in November 2000; it
presented major trends in Czech music and literature, from rock to classical music
and modern folklore, all performed by top artists.

**FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY**

Czech-German relations have developed dynamically in all spheres, mainly in the
political, economic and cultural fields. There have been more intensive contacts at all
levels and these relations have been supplemented by contractual documents.
As a result of the admission of the Czech Republic to NATO in 1999, the
partnership with Germany has for the first time in our modern history turned into an
alliance. Germany has concluded an agreement to support the accession of the Czech
Republic to the European Union. The Governments of the Czech Republic and of the
Federal Republic of Germany put strong emphasis on the orientation of CzechGerman relations into future.


-----

In 2000, an agreement was reached on the compensation of citizens of the Czech
Republic and of certain other Central and Eastern European countries who had been
forced to slave labour during the Second World War. In July 2000, the _Bundestag_
passed a law establishing the Foundation Remembrance, Responsibility and Future,
which will deal with this type of compensation. The Czech-German Discussion
Forum has been successful, allowing the Czech and German public to get to know
each other. It has contributed to cultivating a common dialogue.
In 2000, Germany remained the biggest trading partner of the Czech Republic: CzechGerman trade accounted for 36% of all Czech foreign trade. During the past few years,
Germany was, moreover, the major foreign investor in the Czech Republic. Regional
and cross-border cooperation with various länder (Saxony, Bavaria), as well as at the
level of the five joint Euro-Regions on the Czech-German border has greatly expanded.

_Economic relations_

Germany is the most significant trade partner of the Czech Republic. Trade
turnover increased to 855.5 billion CZK (a 20% increase as opposed to 1999).
Germany s share in the overall turnover was 36%.
Czech exports to Germany reached 452.9 billion CZK (a 18% increase as opposed
to 1999). This means that a full 40% of all Czech exports went to Germany. Imports
from Germany rose to 402.6 billion CZK, that is to say, 21.3% higher than in 1999.
Czech trade with Germany showed a profit of 50.3 billion CZK. This favourable trade
balance was brought about mainly by exports of machinery and means of
transportation.
When examining the commodity structure of trade with Germany, there is
a continuing rise in the share of higher-value-added products while the share of raw
materials, foodstuffs and semi-finished goods had dropped. Direct German
investments concentrated mainly in commerce and commercial services,
communications, and banking. A higher interest by German investors in industry can
be expected in connection with investment incentives offered by the Ministry of
Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic on a more long-term basis.
There are no pending problems which might hamper the further development of
trade and economic relations.

cultural activities worth mentioning is the Reconciliation Building in Liberec where
a new Czech-German library has been opened and a Jewish Centre is being
refurbished. The Reconciliation Building has been constructed with the support of
the Czech-German Future Fund and was inaugurated in November 2000 under the
auspices of President V. Havel and President J. Rau.
The traditional German Language Theatre Festival was held in Prague in 2000.
Regular meetings of young Czechs and Germans have become a tradition. They are

The conclusion of inter-governmental agreements on educational cooperation and
on sending German teachers to work in Czech schools in December 2000 contributed
towards strengthening mutual relations. One-year study sojourns of Czech secondary
school students in Bavaria proceeded well as did cooperation with Departments of
Czech studies in Berlin and Potsdam.

**AUSTRIA**

The Czech Republic regards neighbouring Austria as one of its most significant
foreign political and trade and economic partners with which it is linked by a common
past and close culture. The policy of the Czech Republic vis-a‘-vis Austria is
determined by a long-term interest in good neighbourly relations, especially in the
light of its future partnership within the EU.
After the new Austrian Government came to power, political relations cooled
somewhat in 2000, since its programme contained certain features that were
problematic for the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic, furthermore, endorsed
measures taken by the remaining 14 EU Member States vis-a‘-vis Austria. The
persistent efforts by the Czech and Austrian diplomacy and the readiness of the highest
representatives of the two countries, reflected in the conclusions reached at a meeting
of the Prime Ministers of the two Governments in Melk on 12 December, 2000,
created an outline bringing the positions of the two sides closer together on the issue
of the Temelin nuclear power plant and the gradual improvement of political relations.
Austria s practical approach to the compensation of Czech citizens displaced on
forced and slave labour sites during the Second World War on the territories of
present-day Austria, enabled the Czech Republic and other states, involved in
international negotiations, to conclude bilateral agreements on 24 October, 2000,
providing for the speedy and non-bureaucratic compensation of victims of Nazism.
Economic relations developed dynamically. In 2000, Austria was again the third
biggest trade partner of the Czech Republic and was one of the most important
investors. Cooperation in culture continued in the same way, and cross-border
contacts have strengthened successfully.

security and political fields. Regional cooperation and the Euro-Atlantic integration of
the Czech Republic also played an important role in bilateral relations. The Czech
Republic conducted a regular dialogue with Hungary on questions relating to the EU.
Topical issues concerning developments within the EU and the prospect of

_Economic relations_

There were favourable conditions in 2000 for the development of trade and
economic cooperation. The agreement on free trade was concluded in 1993. In
accordance with the Central European Free Trade Agreement, customs duties on all
industrial products have been abolished while an agreement has been signed
recognizing the findings of tests, which makes certification far simpler. Liberalization
of trade could not be introduced to cover agricultural products and foodstuffs.
Although there has been an increase in mutual turnover, Czech exports dropped. In
2000, Czech exports amounted to 9.1 billion CZK, imports 7.0 CZK. The Czech
Republic registered a favourable balance to the value of 2.1 billion CZK with
a turnover of 16.1 billion CZK.
The Czech Republic exported mainly metallurgical products and semi-finished
products. Iron semi-finished products a traditional export commodity retained its
first place in the exports of the Czech Republic, but registered a drop in relative and
absolute terms. While in 1999 their volume amounted to 40% of the exports, in 2000
it had dropped to 23%. Automobiles were in the second place with 13%. Exports of
timber fibre and waste paper, rubber products, consumer electronics, household
chemical products, wheat, glass, paper, aluminium and aluminium products
registered significant results.
Imports concentrated mainly on pharmaceutical products with 13.8% of total
imports. These were followed by electronics (9.5%), leather goods (7%), instruments
and equipment, paper, aluminium and aluminium products, iron, steel, motor
vehicles, furniture, lighting equipment, and bed linen.

_Cultural relations_

Official relations in this field have been based on the Cultural Agreement of 1994
and the Procedural Protocol for 1998 2002. Cultural cooperation was of an excellent
standard. Czech-Slovene cultural relations were most extensive in the field of music.
Guest performances by Czech theatre companies have become a tradition, and there
was excellent cooperation between the Slovene film archive and the National Film
Archive in Prague. Every year, about three translated Czech literary works are
published in Slovenia.
Cooperation between universities is governed by a 1994 Agreement on
Cooperation between Charles University in Prague and Ljubljana University,
which provides for formal contacts. A similar agreement was concluded in 1997
between Ostrava and Maribor universities, as well as between the philosophy


-----

faculties of Charles University and Ljubljana University. Partnership exists
between the towns of Slovenj Gradec and ¨esk Krumlov, Celje and Opava, Idrija
and Vimperk, Msngesa and Kyjov, Zalec and atec, Piran and Litomy l.

_Cultural relations_

Cultural relations, as well as relations in education and science, are not governed by
any official agreement. Cultural relations took place predominantly on a commercial
basis. The most significant Swiss institution, which acted in 2000 as an intermediary
for Czech-Swiss cultural exchanges, was the Prague office of the Pro Helvetia
Foundation. Its biggest project was the world premiere of the opera The Physicians
by the Swiss composer Pfl ger, based on the libretto by the same name by the Swiss
author D rrenmatt, performed by the State Opera in Prague. Among significant

**FRANCE**

In the course of intensive preparations by the Czech Republic for accession to the

Czech Republic to explain and justify its position on the question of the enlargement
of the European Union. These endeavours also aimed at encouraging French
businesses to increase their investments in the Czech Republic and at gradually


-----

expanding the Czech presence in France. Representatives, as well as consultations
between the two countries at the level of senior officials, reflected the standard of an
intensive political dialogue also in the frequency of visits and in negotiations.
Negotiations characterized by frankness and by a professional approach did much
towards a better understanding of each other and played a vital role in the dialogue
between the candidate countries and member states and bodies of the European

initiative of the Franco-Czech Masaryk Association.
The programme of Barrande bilateral cooperation contributed to promoting
cooperation in the field of science and research.

events in the Czech Republic have been strengthened mainly thanks to Czech-French
sections in bilingual secondary schools and the teaching of selected subjects at some
faculties in the French language. The Czech Republic began to take an active part in
the work of the International Organization of the Francophonie.
Courses of the Czech language were inaugurated in 2000 at the M. Bloche
University in Strasburg.

programmes. But negotiations began in 2000 on an educational and scientific
agreement and a first impulse was given for negotiations on a cultural agreement.

intensive development of bilateral relations in all spheres was based on the shared
joint political environment and ties of alliance.
Apart from a political dialogue on an executive level as well as on a level of
parliamentary delegations, emphasis was placed in 2000 on increased and more
balanced trade and economic relations and on problems connected with the European
Union.
Italy strongly advocated an effective reform of the EU and its speedy enlargement.
Its constructive position greatly contributed to the success of the Nice Summit of the
EU. At all bilateral contacts, Italy supported the accession of the Czech Republic to
the EU in the earliest wave of enlargement. The dialogue that culminated during the

_Economic relations_

In the course of the past ten years, trade between Italy and the Czech Republic has
been marked by a dynamic upsurge. There has been a permanent deficit on the Czech
side. Italy s share in the overall turnover amounted to 4.5% in 2000. The turnover of
mutual trade reached 106.5 billion CZK, of this exports 42.3 CZK and imports
64.2 billion CZK. The Czech deficit in 2000 amounted to 21.9 billion CZK.
In 2000, evident attempts were made to increase Czech exports to Italy and reduce
the deficit in mutual trade, as well as to encourage more direct Italian investments in
the Czech Republic. With direct investments totalling $142.9 million, Italy was the
thirteenth largest foreign investor in the Czech Republic.
The Italian market is very demanding. The predominant commodities in Czech
exports have been machines and transportation equipment, market products, various
industrial goods and chemicals (the share of automobiles was 15.3%, textile fibre and
fabrics 7.3%, iron and steel 5.2%, metallurgy processing machines 3.4%, paper and
mill-board 3.2%, chemicals 3.3% and electrical energy 3.1%).
The major items imported from Italy were machines and transportation equipment
(42.1%), market products (19.7%), industrial goods (18.4%), household electrical
and engineering appliances (washing machines, refrigerators) (5.6%), fabrics and
fibre (4.8%), fruit and vegetables (3.2%), valves and fixtures (3.1%) and footwear
(2.8%).

_Cultural relations_

Cultural relations were boosted by the Czech participation in the Great Jubilee
2000. Czech-Italian relations were advanced by the Czech contribution to the all-year
celebration of the millennium (presentation by the President V. Havel of a Christmas
tree to the Pope, concert by the Brno State Philharmonic in the presence of the Prime
Minister M. Zeman, an exhibition The Last Flowers of the Middle Ages, attended
by the Minister of Culture P. DostÆl).

**CANADA**

Canada has been the Czech Republic s significant partner as an economically and
technically advanced country. Its membership in all major international organizations,
its orientation on multilateral diplomacy as well as its staunch promotion of TransAtlantic relations, which is reflected especially in the security sphere by its membership
in NATO and the OSCE, have been vital factors promoting a mutual dialogue.
The accession of the Czech Republic to NATO in March 1999 brought about
a substantial shift in bilateral relations, as both countries bacame allies.

imports 3.6 billion CZK. In 2000, there was a deficit on the Czech side, which
amounted to 1.2 billion CZK. In spite of a rise in turnover, the volume has been low
for three consecutive years and did not correspond to the favourable conditions,
which exist for bilateral trade. The main Czech export items remained machine tools,
printing machinery, tractors, glass, jewellery, and textile products, footwear, and toys,
and sports equipment. The Czech Republic imported from Canada primarily machine
tools, pumps, hydraulic equipment, computers, telecommunication supplies, optical
and measuring instruments, signalling and security equipment, automobile spare
parts, pharmaceuticals, live animals, and foodstuffs.
The most significant event in the sphere of trade policy in 2000 was the visit by
a Canadian trade mission to the Czech Republic on 12 14 September, 2000, headed
by the Minister for International Trade P. Pettigrew. Approximatelly 60 representatives
of Canadian firms and institutions were part of the mission.

of 2.6% of overall direct foreign investments.

_Cultural relations_

Cultural, educational and scientific relations are formally based on an agreement
between the Government of the Czechoslovak Federal Republic and the Canadian
Government on cooperation in the field of cultural, academic and sports contacts
from 1990. Relations relied mainly on direct cooperation and contacts between the
relevant institutions, agencies and art organizations.
The most extensive Czech-Canadian cultural relations were in the field of music
(concerts).


-----

The events worth mentioning include concerts of J. Sv cen and M. SynkovÆ and
cooperation in staging the premiere of L. JanÆŁek s opera Katya Kabanova by the
Opera de Montreal; further a charity concert of the Ms Kapralova Society. In the area
of films, there was the first Central European Film Festival in Ottawa and the
K. Zeman Film Festival in Montreal.
Organizations and associations of Czech expatriates in Canada have played an
invaluable role in transmitting Czech cultural traditions to future generations.
According to statistical data of 1996, there are 31,080 persons in Canada who declare
that they speak Czech. But more than 70,000 persons acknowledge their Czech origin.
The biggest expatriate organization is the Canadian Czech and Slovak Association,
noted for its political tendencies. In the past, it offered assistance to Czech and Slovak
exiles, as well as to dissidents in Czechoslovakia and it opposed the communist regime.

have become relations of alliance. Relations have acquired a new dimension not only
in the political but also in the trade and economic sphere. The close interests and

**UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND**

In 2000, Great Britain has been one of the most important political and economic
partners of the Czech Republic, which has been reflected in the frequency of visits
and the strengthened development of Czech-British relations.


-----

The signing of a plan of common activities by Great Britain and the Czech
Republic during the visit of Britain s Foreign Secretary R. Cook in Prague in July
2000 gave a strong impulse to the further progress of cooperation.
In 2000, Great Britain was the seventh biggest trade partner of the Czech Republic
and also held seventh place among foreign investors.
The increased number of applicants for political asylum in Great Britain had to
some extent complicated the mutual relationship. But throughout 2000, both sides
were doing their utmost to solve this problem.

overall trade turnover amounted to 4.2%.
Products with a high added value predominated in Czech exports automobiles,
electrical machinery, and engineering products. The trend of Czech exports was
boosted mainly by the strong pound and by economic growth, backed by British
domestic demand.
Great Britain also held a prominent place among foreign investors its share in
direct foreign investments in the Czech Republic was 2.8%.

_Cultural relations_

Music was the traditionally predominant in the presentation of Czech culture in
Great Britain in 2000. It was followed by art and architecture. The presentation of
Czech films at various festivals in London and elsewhere was particularly extensive.
Contacts with organizations of expatriates were also rising. Several major events
were organized to mark the 60[th] anniversary of the Battle of Britain, which
highlighted the participation of Czech and Slovak airmen. Among major events was
a ceremony at Cholmondeley, attended by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and
Defence of the Czech Republic.
The most extensive event in 2000 was the new production of the Greek Passion
by B. Martinø at the Royal Opera House (18 April 8 May). The art programme of the
Czech Centre in London included a major exhibition of works by K. Teige, which
presented not only his collages from the surrealist period of the 1930s and 1940s, but
also his well-known selections of poems.
In the sphere of education, there were certain negative aspects in Czech studies in
Great Britain, which had been imposed by financial problems. These adverse trends
had been there for several years and in some cases imposed the restriction or abolition
of teaching altogether.
Certain noteworthy activities arranged by the British Council in Prague promoted
cultural and educational cooperation. It was planned to organize an English for
Europe project, which would centre on courses in the English language for officials
in the state administration.

**UNITED STATES OF AMERICA**

The United States is politically, militarily and economically a super-power and
as such it is able to exercise its influence in all parts of the world. Membership in
NATO establishes a framework of mutual alliance and promotes the Trans-Atlantic


-----

link, which the United States systematically advocates. Its membership in
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and in the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development testifies to the active presence of the United States
in Europe. The United States is a leading member of many international organizations
and since the early 1990s it has been a key political and economic partner of the
Czech Republic.
The political significance of the United States arises from its leadership role in the
community of democratic forces in the world. Its influence is felt in virtually all
countries throughout the world, regardless of whether they are allies of the United
States or hold a negative attitude towards the United States. The American economy
is strong not only by its volume but also because of its capacity to utilize the most upto-date scientific and technical developments, the strength of its capital and its
currency. In addition to these, there are other factors, such as the influence of
American culture and the so-called American way of life.
Bilateral political relations between the United States and the Czech Republic were
on a high level in 2000, as in previous years. This was demonstrated by frequent visits
of the highest representatives of the two states.
In 2000, the United States was the ninth biggest trade partner of the Czech
Republic and the fourth biggest investor in the country.

international trade, the Czech Republic held 65[th] place. The trade between the Czech
Republic and the United States was liberalized with some exceptions. The United
States only applied quantity of restrictions to Czech imports of textiles, clothing, and
cheese. Quantity quotas applied to five categories of textile and clothing
commodities.
During the past few years, mutual trade has been steadily growing, the value of
Czech exports and imports has increased every year. The annual rate of increase of
Czech exports in 1999 2000 reached 47% and its value was 31.5 billion CZK,
compared to 21.5 billion CZK in 1999. Czech imports rose to 54.9 billion CZK.
Unfortunately, there has been a growing deficit in the balance of trade on the Czech
side which in 2000 increased to 23.4 billion CZK with a turnover of 86.4 billion CZK.
Czech exports to the US have comprised mainly machinery and equipment, electrical
consumer goods, glass, china, organic chemicals, toys, sports equipment, as well as
aircraft components, which were marked by a 44% increase. On the other hand,
exports of raw materials and foodstuffs dropped and amounted to a mere 1.7% of
overall trade with the United States. In the United States exports to the Czech
Republic, the predominant commodities were machinery and equipment, aircraft and
their components, optical and medical instruments, electrical machines, tobacco,
perfumery, cosmetics, and paper and cardboard.
The Czech Republic attempts to create favourable conditions for strategic partners
and therefore welcomes the entry of American investors focusing on the
modernization of production and facilitating exports. In the volume of investments in
2000, the United States held a fourth place. The United States investments during that
period amounted to 4.5% of the total volume of direct foreign investments. But their
actual value is higher due to investments through the intermediary of branches of US
firms in Europe. The Czech Republic has established Czech Trade agencies in Chicago
with the consent of the Federal Government with the aim of promoting mutual
economic and trade relations.

_Economic relations_

The year 2000 was significant not only because the negative development of 1999
has been reversed (deficit), but also after approximately six years the margin of profit
has been very distinct. Exports in 2000 amounted to 6.2 billion CZK and imports
4.2 billion CZK. Overall turnover was 10.4 billion CZK and the surplus of Czech
exports was 2 billion CZK. The relative vicinity of the Turkish market and its
considerable absorbing capacity and the complementary nature of the two economies
made increase in trade possible.
The main items on the Czech export list have been traditionally textiles,
automobiles, crude iron and steel, artificial and textile fibres, glass and glass products,
chemical products, dyes, and paper. New items on the export list were small-radius
knitting machines, trucks, tractors, and inorganic chemical products.
Imports from Turkey included mainly food and agricultural products and certain
types of raw materials. These included citrus fruit, cotton, tobacco, dried fruit, peat
raw material, and chrome ore. Recently, more Turkish consumer goods have been
imported to the Czech Republic, not only cotton textiles and leather clothing, but also
electrical domestic appliances.
The Free Trade Agreement with Turkey, which came into force on 1 September,
1998, brings the position of Czech exports of most industrial products into line with
that of its European competitors. The standard contractual base in the economic
sphere has been supplemented by the Agreement on the support and protection of
investments and by the Agreement on the prevention of double taxation.

held in Tallinn and Helsinki since the 1990s and are attended by Czech
representatives. The growing interest in courses of the Czech language in Estonia
also deserves attention.

**LITHUANIA**

Lithuania has traditionally been an important partner of the Czech Republic and it
has been our largest economic partner among the Baltic States. In 2000, cooperation
considerably deepened, particularly in the sphere of security. In this connection, the
fact, that the Embassy of the Czech Republic in Lithuania acts as the NATO contact
embassy for that country, is significant. The Embassy will act in this capacity from
1 September, 2000, until 31 August, 2002. An intensive high level political dialogue
is in progress between the two countries. The Czech Republic has supported the
inclusion of Lithuania among the candidates for membership in the European Union.

**5. Relations between the Czech Republic and the Eastern**
**and South-Eastern European countries**

**ALBANIA**

Albania was an important partner of the Czech Republic in South-Eastern Europe
in 2000. One reason was Albania s efforts to achieve long-term stability in the region.

In the 1990s, the volume of trade was stabilized, amounting to 2.5 3 billion CZK.
There was a steep rise in 1998 when the volume was in excess of 4 billion CZK. This
increase was due mainly to the gradual introduction of the free trade regime, as well
as to improving economic conditions in Bulgaria; but this was due also to fact that
Czech firms showed greater interest in the Bulgarian market. In 2000, the trade
turnover amounted to 4.7 billion CZK, Czech exports reached 3.8 billion CZK and
imports 904 million CZK. This brought the positive balance to 2.9 billion CZK.
The major Czech export items included metallurgical commodities, linen fibres,
automobiles, vehicle components (for tractors, automobiles, lorries, cranes, trolleys,
lever jacks), tyres, transmission shafts, radiators, central heating boilers, textiles,
paper, drugs, and dairy products. Imports from Bulgaria consisted mainly of parts and
components of means of transportation, zinc, copper, trolleys with manipulation
equipment, parts for excavators, bulldozers, certain metallurgical products, chemicals,
telephone technology, vegetables, wine and tobacco.

**THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA**

The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) is gradually overcoming
the legacy of the break-up of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which
severely affected the economy of FYROM. The Czech Republic supported efforts by
the international community to establish political and economic stability and
progress. The main part of bilateral relations was in trade and in the economy.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

_Economic relations_

In 2000, there has been no substantial development of economic relations. The
Czech Republic attempted to establish a link between its so-called energy
programmes, presented as part of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe and the
proposal by FYROM of establishing an energy centre of the Stability Pact for
South-Eastern Europe in Skopje. The foreign trade turnover was for South-Eastern
Europe in the region of 595.9 million CZK (of this exports were 481.8 million CZK,
imports 114.1 million CZK). The Czech positive balance amounted to 367.7 million
CZK.

**GEORGIA**

There has been a pronounced strengthening of Czech-Georgian relations in the
period under review. An Embassy of the Czech Republic in Georgia was opened in
Tbilisi on 6 June, 2000. It is also accredited for Armenia. This decision was very well
received in Georgia.


-----

A number of Georgian ministries and institutions showed interest in learning about
the experience of the Czech Republic during the transition to a market economy and
in the course of transformation. There was a constant interest in Czech commodities
and Czech investments. But the volume of trade turnover or investments by Czech
firms in Georgia did not correspond with this interest.

Association of Georgian-Czech Relations.

**CROATIA**

The position of Croatia on the international scene improved after the elections in

Cultural cooperation took place mainly in the form of direct contacts between
institutions and individuals, or on a commercial basis between art agencies. The
Embassy of the Czech Republic in Croatia was most active in presenting Czech
culture in Croatia. The major event in 2000 was an exhibition “Architecture for
a New Democracy – J. Plečnik”, arranged in collaboration with the Administration of
the Prague Castle. The launching of a translation of the book “How to Make a Boy”
by L. Vaculík was attended by the author; film director J. Menzel was also present at
the premiere of a theatre play which he had rehearsed with Croatian actors.

**KAZAKHSTAN**

The gradual transformation of the Kazakh economy and, above all, the mineral
resources of the country created the conditions for Kazakhstan to become


-----

a significant economic partner of the Czech Republic. Czech companies showed
interest in participating in modernization and restructuring projects of the Kazakh
industry and transport networks.
Visa regime has been introduced between the two countries in October 2000.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

in May 2000. Ten students from Kazakhstan studied at Czech universities on
government scholarships.

**CYPRUS**

Czech-Cypriot relations have been correct and without problems. The position of
the two countries as candidates for EU membership has created considerable scope
for mutual relations. There have been ongoing political exchanges between the two
countries.

_Visits by representatives of Cyprus_

174.5 million CZK.
The commodities exported to Cyprus were machinery, electrical equipment, iron,
steel and construction timber, glass and glass products, plastic material, chemicals,
textile fibres, and paper. Cypriot exports were mainly citrus fruit (58%), tobacco
products, and pharmaceutical products.
A significant feature of the expansion of trade was the participation of firms in
international trade fairs, organized in the two countries.
In 2000, Cyprus’s share in overall direct foreign investments was 2.7% and Cyprus
thus became the ninth biggest investor in the Czech Republic.

_Bilateral Agreements concluded in 2000_

– A procedural protocol to the Agreement on Cooperation in Education, Youth and
Sport for the period 1999–2001; Nicosia, 8 June, 2000.

protocol for 1999–2001. There has been a steady interest of Cypriot students in
studies at universities in the Czech Republic.

**REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA**

CZK, exports accounted for 382 million CZK, imports for 87.8 million CZK. The


-----

conclusion of agreements on trade and economic cooperation, the prevention of
double taxation, and the promotion and protection of investments in 1999 had
a favourable effect on economic relations.

**ROMANIA**

Romania is a traditional Czech partner in South-Eastern Europe. The points of
contact in bilateral relations have been membership in Central European Free Trade
Agreement (CEFTA) and Central European Initiative (CEI), the process of integration
in the EU, and Euro-Atlantic cooperation. Contacts have been intense and visits by
representatives of the two countries retained a high standard. The Czech Republic
supported the inclusion of Romania among the EU candidate countries, its admission
to NATO and its candidature for presidency of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 2001.

– Agreement between the Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic and the
Ministry of National Defence of Romania on the protection of military classified
information, Bucharest, 17 July, 2000.

_Cultural relations_

An inter-departmental agreement was concluded in June 1998 between the
Ministries of Education of the Czech Republic and Romania on cooperation in
education for 1998–2000. It makes provision for study at state universities of the two
contracting parties under financial conditions applying to citizens of their own
countries.
There are 5,500 Czech expatriates in Romania, descendants of Czech émigrés who
settled there in the 1920s, mainly in southern Banat. The Czech minority in Romania
is today probably the most authentic Czech community abroad. The Czech Republic
has continued to implement a programme of exceptional assistance to the expatriate
community (started in 1995); its objectives are the repair of Czech schools and
cultural centres in the region, repairs of access roads to Czech localities, introducing
telephones in these localities and providing their inhabitants with adequate medical
care.

**RUSSIAN FEDERATION**

Relations between the Czech Republic and the Russian Federation play a major
role in the Czech bilateral diplomacy as enshrined in Czech foreign policy. The
Russian Federation represents a significant factor in dealing with security matters in
the Euro-Atlantic area. It is an important trade and economic partner of the Czech
Republic.
The Czech Republic, as a member of NATO, has been advocating the strengthening
of a dialogue between the Russian Federation and NATO. The year 2000 was
characterized by the resumption of their mutual contacts. The participation of the
Russian Federation at the two sessions of the Permanent Joint Council at the level of
foreign ministers was an important factor in raising the quality of the NATO-Russian
Federation dialogue.


-----

A mutual political dialogue between the Czech Republic and the Russian
Federation was revived in the second half of 2000. There was an exchange of
parliamentary delegations and both countries appointed new ambassadors into each
other’s country.
In the first half of 2000, the Government of the Czech Republic decided to
introduce entry visas for Russian citizens as a measure connected with the preparation
for the admission of the Czech Republic to the EU. The Russian Federation decided
to take the same step. The introduction of visas by both parties did not have any
adverse effect on their mutual relations.
The Russian Federation was the eigth biggest trade partner of the Czech Republic.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 11–13. 10. 2000 – visit by a delegation of the Committee for Foreign Affairs of the
Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Parliament.

_Visits by representatives of the Russian Federation_

– 29–30. 5. 2000 – visit by the Governor of the Sverdlovsk Region E. Rossel;
– 9–13. 10. 2000 – visit by a joint delegation of the Economic and Agriculture
Committees of the Council of the Federation of the Federal Assembly;

Office of the Government Shuvalov at the sixth session of the Inter-Governmental
Commission for Trade, Economic, Scientific and Technical Cooperation.

_Economic relations_

The share of the Russian Federation in overall foreign trade turnover of the Czech
Republic in the period under review reached 3.3% and amounted to 95.1 billion CZK.
In 2000, imports from the Russian Federation increased to 80.2 billion CZK, i.e.
6.4% of overall imports to the Czech Republic (second place in total imports to the
Czech Republic). The primary reason was the steep increase in the price of energygenerating raw materials. Czech exports to the Russian Federation amounted to
14.9 billion CZK and the share dropped from 1.5% to 1.3% of overall Czech exports.
The deficit in bilateral trade amounted to 65.3 billion CZK (i.e. 30.4 billion CZK
more than in 1999).
The main reason for the unbalanced trade balance was the high import of energygenerating raw materials from the Russian Federation (oil, gas). The Czech Republic
attempted to reduce the deficit, above all by increased exports to the Russian
Federation. A tendency emerged to regroup the commodities of Czech exports to the
Russian Federation in favour of machines, completing equipment and transportation
equipment.


-----

The sixth session of the Inter-Governmental Commission for Trade, Economic,
Scientific and Technical Cooperation took place in Prague on 13–14 November, 2000.
Number of concrete decisions aimed at further expansion of economic cooperation
and at the solution of pending problems were adopted.
Contacts with Russian regions were a significant aspect of direct trade and
economic relations with the Russian Federation; these contacts have already been in
existence for several years. The regions, with which the Czech Republic has been
engaged in successful cooperation in 2000, include first of all Moscow and the
Moscow Region, St. Petersburg, and the Sverdlovsk Region.

_Cultural relations_

Cultural relations between the Czech Republic and the Russian Federation were
mainly based on direct contacts of the organizers of various events.
In 2000, the Czech Republic took part in the exhibition, “Fotobiennale 2000”, in
the Kinosok Film Festival at Anapa and in the Mosfilm Festival in Moscow. It was
represented at a competition exhibition of children’s drawings etc.
The ensemble of the world-renowned Theatre Na Taganke, headed by the producer
Ljubimov, took part in the International Drama Festival in Pilsen in the autumn of
2000.
Translation grants provided by the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic made
it possible to revive the publication of Czech literature works by the Russian
publishing houses and to launch a publicity drive in the Russian media on
personalities of Czech cultural life (J. A. Komenský, T. G. Masaryk, J. Hašek,
F. Kafka and others).

**FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA**

The political changes in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 2000 met with
a favourable response on the international scene. The result was the speedy
incorporation of the country into international organizations and the abolition of the
regime of sanctions by the EU, with the exception of some sanctions directed against
Miloševič.
The Czech Republic conducted a fairly intensive dialogue with the opposition to
Miloševič before and after the changes. The internal political development was
characterized by relatively clear democratic elements and laid the foundations for the
full restoration of bilateral relations in all spheres.
In light of these changes, the Czech Republic was prepared to restore a full political
dialogue, which had been completely suspended as a results of the Miloševič regime.
The Czech Republic also expected the speedy resumption of trade and economic


-----

relations and the involvement of Czech firms in projects under the Stability Pact for
South-Eastern Europe. That is why the Government of the Czech Republic without
delay called off the sanctions in its relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
and declared its readiness to offer the country economic as well as humanitarian aid,
which had been provided regularly in the past.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 23. 10. 2000 – official visit by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign
Affairs J. Kavan.

_Visits by representatives of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia_

– 21. 11. 2000 – working visit by the President of Montenegro M. Djukanovic.

_Economic relations_

The sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had an adverse
effect on trade and economic relations between the two countries. Trade could be
carried on only in areas not affected by the sanctions. The abolition of sanctions and
the incorporation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the Stability Pact for
South-Eastern Europe created favourable conditions for restoring trade and economic
relations. After almost ten years of isolation, the market of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia became most attractive. Czech firms showed keen interest in penetrating
this sphere. By the end of 2000, a group of Czech business people visited the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia with the aim of investigating the requirements of the
Yugoslav market. The mutual trade turnover was around 3.3 billion CZK. Czech
exports amounted to 2.6 billion CZK, imports 676.7 million CZK. This enabled the
Czech Republic to register a favourable balance of 2 billion CZK.

_Cultural relations_

At the initiative of the Embassy of the Czech Republic in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, a relatively large number of cultural events were organized in Belgrade.
The Yugoslav students was offered 20 scholarships as part of Czech assistance to the
country.

**UKRAINE**

During the period under review, Ukraine belonged to the most significant partners
of the Czech Republic in Eastern Europe. Bilateral relations were of a good standard;
both sides were interested in their further strengthening. Contacts between the


-----

Parliaments of the two countries, between departments of the govermental bodies,
especially the Ministries of Defence and the Ministries of Agriculture, were most
active.
Following a decision of the Government of the Czech Republic, the agreement
between the government of the Czechoslovak Federal Republic and the government of
the USSR on conditions of travel by citizens of the two states (Prague, 17 December,
1981) was rescinded as of 28 April, 2000. As of 28 June, 2000, visas are required for
the citizens of the two countries for travel to the other country. It was noted that the
introduction of visas did not in any way have an adverse effect on cooperation
between the two countries.
The Czech Republic welcomed endeavours by Ukraine towards its closer
cooperation with NATO, the European Union and with Central European regional
groups and organizations. The Czech Republic also expressed appreciation for the
policy pursued by Ukraine vis-a`-vis neighbouring countries as well as its efforts to
strengthen regional security.
Ukraine was among the significant economic partners of the Czech Republic –
second most important among the countries of the former Soviet Union.

The turnover of mutual trade amounted to 14.7 billion CZK in 2000; of this, Czech
exports amounted to 5.6 billion CZK, imports to 9.1 billion CZK. This resulted in
a Czech deficit of 3.5 billion CZK, which in its absolute value exceeded the
cumulative negative balance of the Czech Republic in mutual trade during the past
five years.
The predominant import commodities from Ukraine were iron ore and iron ore
concentrate (53% of overall imports), flat rolled products made of iron or non-alloy
steel (10%), black coal tar, brown coal tar and peat tar (5%), crude non-processed
aluminium (4.5%), oils and distilling products of high thermal tar (3%) and ferrous

a Czech deficit balance of 197 million CZK. After a steep drop in bilateral
trade in 1998 and 1999, caused by the deteriorating economic situation in
Uzbekistan, mainly due to the financial crisis in the Russian Federation and in


-----

South-East Asia in 1998, as well as by the rigid currency regulation and import
restrictions imposed by the Uzbek Government, there was an increase in two-way
trade in 2000.
98% of all imports from Uzbekistan were raw cotton; the remaining 2% consisted
of chemicals (sodium, sulphates), raw hide and cotton yarn, zinc and acrylic fibres.
The major share of exports to Uzbekistan were sugar (36%), weaving machines
(12.7%), tyres (11%), machines for the food industry (8%), metal constructions
(7.8%), other machines for industry (5.7%) and pipes (4.7%).

Film Forum “Days of European Films 2000” – in May 2000, met with an enthusiastic
response.
In the period under review, ten students from Uzbekistan received grants provided
by the Government of the Czech Republic to study at Czech universities.

**OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE AREA**

**ARMENIA, AZERBAIJAN**

Relations between the Czech Republic and the Armenia and Azerbaijan were
renewed in 2000.
The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic H. Kmoníček
visited Armenia on 4–7 November, 2000. During the visit, Armenia gave its consent
to the additional accreditation of an ambassador of the Czech Republic in Georgia to
Armenia.
The Czech Republic expressed its desire, above all, for further expansion of trade
with the two states. The current trade volume did not correspond with the capacities
of these countries. Economic relations between the Czech Republic and the two states
remained limited in 2000.


-----

The overall turnover of foreign trade with Armenia was 358.2 million CZK in
2000, of this Czech exports accounted for 355.7 million CZK. In view of the minimal
imports from Armenia, amounting to a mere 2.5 million CZK, the trade balance was
strongly positive in favour of the Czech Republic (353.2 million CZK). Czech exports
concentrated on machines and semi-finished goods, Czech imports concentrated on
spirits.
The turnover of trade with Azerbaijan reached 682.5 million CZK, of which Czech
exports amounted to 473.0 million CZK, and imports 209.4 million CZK. The Czech

government scholarships as part of development aid.

**KYRGYZSTAN, TAJIKISTAN, TURKMENISTAN**

In its relations with Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, the Czech Republic
regarded as its priority the enlargement of economic cooperation. The present trade
between the three countries does not correspond with the capacities of these countries.
Czech-Tajik relations were reinforced by the visit by the Tajikistan President
Rachmonov in Prague on 10–12 April, 2000, on the occasion of the eigth session of
the OSCE Economic Forum. He held talks with Czech Prime Minister M. Zeman, the
Chairwoman of the Senate L. Benešová and the Chairman of the Chamber of
Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic V. Klaus.
Trade with Tajikistan reached a turnover of 408.1 million CZK, of which Czech
exports account for 18.6 million CZK and imports for 389.5 million CZK. The Czech
Republic thus reached a deficit amounting to 370.9 million CZK.

As a new independent state, the Czech Republic approached Liechtenstein at the turn
of 1992 and 1993, in the same way as all other states, with a request for diplomatic
recognition and the establishment of diplomatic relations. However, Liechtenstein has


-----

not yet recognized the Czech Republic. Prince Hans Adam II links the normalization
of relations with a demand for bilateral negotiations on disputed property.

**MALTA**

There are no obstactes in bilateral relations between the Czech Republic and
Malta. They centre mainly on trade and economic cooperation. After reiterating its
application for admission to the European Union, Malta became a candidate for EU
membership at the Helsinki summit in 1999. It is now a leading candidate for
admission to the EU, together with the Czech Republic, in first wave of enlargement.
Political consultations are in progress between the two countries on the problem of
European integration.

_Economic relations_

Malta is a traditional importer of Škoda automobiles and Czech textiles and glass.
So-called “passive” tourism is an important part of economic cooperation.
Trade between Malta and the Czech Republic has in recent years been characterised
by a positive balance on the Czech side which, however, is decreasing. In 2000, this
balance amounted to 16 million CZK. The trade turnover reached 263.4 million CZK
in 2000, of this exports were 139.7 million CZK and imports 123.7 million CZK.
The main Czech export commodities are Škoda automobiles, dairy products and
eggs, tyres, textile yarn, woven material, spare parts, motorcar accessories, musical
instruments, and pharmaceuticals. The Czech Republic imported from Malta
vulcanised rubber products, electronic instruments, office machines, parts for jet
engines, textile yarn.
Investments by the Maltese Corinthian Palace Hotel Co. were a significant
landmark in Czech-Maltese economic relations; they concerned the purchase of
hotels in the Czech Republic in the second half of the 1990s.


-----

**HOLY SEE**

Bilateral treaty negotiations were the predominant feature of relations with the
Holy See in 2000. There were five rounds of talks. Agreement was reached on the text
of a preamble, fundamental agreement on general articles of the treaty and on the

a concert by the Brno State Philharmonic in the presence of the Prime Minister
M. Zeman, an exhibition “The Last Flowers of the Middle Ages”, attended by the
Minister of Culture P. Dostál) was the contribution of citizens of the Czech Republic
to the celebration of Holy Year.

**7. Relations between the Czech Republic**
**and the countries of Asia and the Pacific area**

**AFGHANISTAN**

Relations between the Czech Republic and Afghanistan have been stagnating for
a long time because of the continuing civil war and internal instability in the
country. The Czech Republic has refused to recognize the government of the
Taliban. In 2000, Afghanistan was represented in the Czech Republic by the
Government of President B. Rabbani.

_Economic relations_

There is only limited trade between the Czech Republic and Afghanistan. The
volume of trade in 2000 amounted to 40.1 million CZK (Czech exports 26.2 million
CZK, imports 13.9 million CZK, a positive balance of 12.3 million CZK).
The main obstacle to two-way trade and the development of economic cooperation
was the disintegration of the national economy, the chaotic state of the country and
the absence of a functioning central government in Afghanistan.


-----

**AUSTRALIA**

Australia plays a significant role in the Asian and Pacific region from the
political and economic point of view. There are many Czech expatriates in
Australia who have contributed significantly to promoting Czech-Australian
contacts. In November 2000, it was decided to open an additional Honorary
Consulate in Perth.

there are possibilities existing on both sides. Turnover in 2000 was 3.0 billion CZK
(export 1.2 billion CZK, import 1.8 billion CZK); the deficit increased in comparison
to previous year by higher imports and amounted to 629.9 million CZK.
The main Czech export commodities were metal machine tools, glass, textiles, data
processing technology, engineering products, components for the transmission of
electrical power, sports arms and ammunition, sports accessories and toys, chemicals
and chemical components.
The predominant Czech imports were wine, sheep and lamb skins, meat and food
ingredients, medical instruments and pharmaceuticals, manganese, aluminium,
titanium, and other ores.

_Cultural relations_

Relations in the area of culture, education, sports and science were expanding at all
levels in 2000. The Olympic Games and Para-Olympic Games in Sydney in
September-October 2000 gave a powerful impetus to the revival of contacts.
Expatriate organizations arranged a series of cultural events in 2000. A particular
success was marked by an exhibition of the work of 14 Czech artists representing the
most diverse forms of art, arranged in Sydney in the spring of 2000 with the financial
assistance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic. An exhibition on


-----

the Terezin Jewish ghetto, held in the spring of 2000 in collaboration with the Prague
Jewish Museum on the premises of Parliament of Austria in Canberra, was especially
well received by the media.

**PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA**

The People’s Republic of China is a regional super-power and also aims to play the
role of a power on a worldwide scale. Its influence permeates the Asian and Pacific
area. The People’s Republic of China is a permanent member of the United Nations
Security Council and participates in the activities of many international organizations.
It plays a significant role in world trade. It belongs to no political or military
association.
Traditional friendly relations link the Czech Republic to the People’s Republic of
China. In 2000, the People’s Republic of China was the sixteenth biggest trade partner
of the Czech Republic.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

_Economic relations_

The People’s Republic of China is one of the most important trade partners of the
Czech Republic in Asia. However, in the last few years, there has been a long-term
negative balance of trade with the People’s Republic of China. In 2000, imports
were 26.8 billion CZK, exports 2.5 billion CZK, turnover 29.3 billion CZK, and
negative deficit 24.3 billion CZK. Trade is influenced by substantial import
restrictions imposed by the Chinese Government, by considerable year-by-year
fluctuations, and by the scaled-down structure of Czech exports. Both sides agreed on
the need for a further diversification of economic relations in commodities as well as
for the participation of individual export enterprises.
Opportunities for Czech exporters exist primarily in such sectors as energy, mining
industry, ecological engineering, transportation systems, medical technology, and
food processing equipment among the export products.


-----

The Chinese market is demanding in terms of investments and therefore among the
determining factors for a more pronounced presence of the Czech firms are
cooperation with strong partners in third countries, sub-contractor participation on
individual projects, and possibly cooperation with credible domestic partners.
Work on the project of the Shentou power station had not yet started in 2000;
a contract on its construction had been signed during the visit of Czech Prime
Minister M. Zeman in the People’s Republic of China in December 1999.

_Cultural relations_

Cultural, educational, and scientific contacts proceed on the basis of departmental
agreements of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports and the Academy of
Sciences of the Czech Republic, to a lesser degree also on the basis of individual
activities and non-governmental institutions.
An exhibition of Czech studio glass was held in Shenzhen in April while the
exhibitions “Loud Solitude”, “The Czech Republic at the Turn of the Millennium”
were also present as well performances by the Danaj folk ensemble. There is a regular
exchange of students of the two countries. The two government scholarships offered
to the People’s Republic of China for post-graduate studies in 2000 have not been
accepted.

**SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION OF HONG KONG**

Republic of China, while retaining its full autonomy in all aspects of social life with
the exception of defence and that part of foreign relations that affect the sovereignty
of the People’s Republic of China as a whole. The Czech Republic pursues its
relations with Hong Kong under the policy of “one country, two systems”.
Trade between the Czech Republic and Hong Kong in 2000 amounted to
5.1 billion CZK (exports 3.1 billion CZK, imports 2.0 billion CZK, balance

on a non-governmental level under the policy of one China.
Trade in 2000 amounted to 11.0 billion CZK (exports 1.3 billion CZK, imports
9.2 billion CZK, balance –8.4 billion CZK). Taiwan is among the promising foreign
investors in the Czech Republic.

**PHILIPPINES**

Philippines represents a significant member of the community of South-East Asia.
The country’s foreign policy focuses on cooperation with the regional organizations
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Asia–Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) and on all-round cooperation with the United States. In recent

_Cultural relations_

An exhibition of paintings and lithographs by J. Skalník was held in Manila and
Cebu in November 2000.

**INDIA**

India is among the regional super-powers and also aims to play the role of a superpower on a worldwide scale. International reaction to its nuclear tests in May 1998
was negative. India’s economy is advancing successfully and is gradually opening up
to the world. India’s strive to obtain permanent membership of the United Nations
Security Council is one of the priorities of its foreign policy. India is not a member of
any military alliance.
Relations between the Czech Republic and India have been traditionally friendly
and balanced. They focus on trade; India is among the significant partners of the
Czech Republic in Asia.

_Visits by representatives of India_

– 30. 6.–4. 7. 2000 – visit by a delegation of the Indian Parliament, led by its Speaker
G. M. C. Balajogi.

_Economic relations_

India is the Czech Republic’s seventh largest trade partner among the Asian
countries. In 2000, Czech exports reached 3 billion CZK, imports 2.8 billion CZK
and the overall trade turnover 5.8 billion CZK. This means that the Czech Republic
achieved a positive balance of 123.5 million CZK. A protocol was signed in April
2000 between the Czech Commerce Bank, the National Bank of Slovakia and the


-----

Reserve Bank of India on the division of the account of rupee claims into the Czech
Republic and Slovakia.
More than half of Czech exports to India consists of machines and transportation
equipment (machine tools, railway wheelwork, textile and footwear machines,
components for lorries, ball bearings, spare parts and components for the defence
industry), regulation and control technology, optical fibres, glass and paper products,
and plastic material in granules.
Czech importers concentrate primarily on coffee, tea, spices, hides, tobacco, cotton
and, cotton yarn. The proportion of finished products is gradually increasing, such as
clothing, leather goods including footwear, pharmaceuticals, and handcrafts.
Czech exporters have the greatest opportunities in the infrastructure. This applies
especially to supplies, reconstruction and modernization of energy-generating
installations. There are great chances for supplies to be used in the modernization of
the army. The only joint venture in the country is a joint enterprise for the production
of heavy TATRA trucks (Tatra – Udyog in Hosur in the state of Tamil Nadu).

_Cultural relations_

Cultural cooperation is taking place on the basis of a cultural agreement and has
traditionally been of a good standard. There is a regular exchange of university
scholarship holders; the Czech Republic offers India two to three scholarships
each year.

**INDONESIA**

Because of its geographical position and large population, Indonesia is a major
factor for stability and security in South-East Asia.
Czech-Indonesian relations have primarily economic dimension.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 2–3. 10. 2000 – visit by a delegation of the Committee for Foreign Affairs, Defence
and Security.

_Visits by representatives of Indonesia_

– 6–7. 3. 2000 – visit by the Minister of Trade and Industry Y. Kally;
– 4–7. 5. 2000 – visit by a delegation of Parliament, headed by its Speaker A. Rais.

_Economic relations_

The trade balance has been in deficit since 1994 and continues to decrease. In
2000, trade turnover was 2.8 billion CZK (imports 2.4 billion CZK, exports


-----

453.6 million CZK, balance –1.9 billion CZK). Opportunities for Czech firms exist
in Indonesia in privatisation projects announced by the Indonesian Government, or in
participating in development projects financed by the World Bank.
The development of economic relations between the Czech Republic and Indonesia
does not correspond to the possibilities and potential of the two countries. The Czech
Republic is doing its utmost to intensify economic and trade cooperation.
Commodities that are likely to succeed on the Indonesian market include
agricultural equipment and technology, the production of the automobile industry, the
mining industry, and oil refinery and the processing of natural gas.

_Cultural relations_

All cultural relations and the promotion of the Czech Republic are organized
through the Embassy of the Czech Republic in Indonesia. The Government of the
Czech Republic offers two to three scholarships for postgraduate study to Indonesian
students.

**JAPAN**

Japan is a global economic power that plays a major role in world organizations
and advocates political, economic and security integration of the Asian region. In
view of its position in the world and in the region it is striving to become a permanent
member of the United Nation Security Council. Japan does not belong to any military
alliance. Traditional cultural ties of long standing have linked the Czech Republic and
Japan. In 2000, Japan was the seventeenth largest trade partner of the Czech Republic.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 6–10. 6. 2000 – representation by the First Deputy Chairman of the Senate
I. Havlíček of the Czech Republic at the funeral of the Prime Minister K. Obuchi.

_Visits by representatives of Japan_

– 9–10. 11. 2000 – Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs R. Kato at regular interministerial consultations.

_Economic relations_

Bilateral trade was for a long time in deficit for the Czech Republic. During the last
few years, the trade deficit with Japan was approximately 15–18% of the total trade
deficit of Czech foreign trade. Mutual turnover in 2000 amounted to 28.1 billion CZK
(imports to the Czech Republic 23.7 billion CZK, exports 4.4 billion CZK, with


-----

a deficit of 19.3 billion CZK). The Czech Republic is perceived in Japan as a country
with traditionally advanced industrial and engineering production and lately also as
a possible partner for direct investments, perhaps even as a location where factories
could be transferred from EU countries.
Notwithstanding the difficulty in penetrating Japanese markets, and the
establishment of trade links with Japanese partners, Japan is nevertheless a promising
market for Czech exporters. It is an important market with a great demand for
foodstuffs, consumer goods, raw materials, industrial materials and semi-finished
goods, engineering equipment and components for industrial use.
The increase of Japanese exports since 1995 is connected with investment and
cooperation projects by Japanese firms in the Czech Republic and with imports of
industrial technology for these projects from Japan. The total volume of Japanese
investments in the Czech Republic has been in excess of $560 million. The actual
amount is hard to estimate since some of these investments are carried out through
the intermediary of European branches of Japanese firms.
There are no serious obstacles to economic and trade cooperation between the
Czech Republic and Japan.

_Bilateral Agreements concluded in 2000_

– Agreement between the Government of the Czech Republic and the Government of
Japan on a grant to supply musical instruments to the Brno State Philharmonic,
negotiated in the form of an exchange of personal notes; Prague, 11 December,
2000.

_Cultural relations_

Czech-Japanese cultural relations are traditionally active and both sides are keen to
promote them even further. Czech classical music and Czech glass are particular
popular in Japan, while Japanese art (drama, music, tea-drinking rituals, ikebana),
films, and the performance of classical music are in turn popular in the Czech Republic.
The Japanese Government offers the Czech Republic annual cultural and educational
grants amounting to 50 million Japanese yen (approximately 12 million CZK). In
2000, the grant was awarded to the Brno State Philharmonic to be used for the
purchase of musical instruments.
There is an exchange of four scholarship recipients each year and there are
discussions under way with an aim of increasing this number to at least six.

**DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF KOREA**

The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, under the leadership of the Worker’s
Party of Korea based on a communist ideology, is among the least developed
countries in the world. The Czech Republic maintains no embassy in Pyongyang, The
Czech Ambassador in Beijing was accredited also for the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

Ministry of Foreign Affairs V. Hubinger.

_Visits by representatives_
_of the Democratic People s Republic of Korea_

– 2. 10. 2000 – visit by the Vice-Chairman of the Supreme Court Office Han Ju-chol.

_Economic relations_

The foreign trade balance between the Czech Republic and the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea developed favourably between 1998 and 2000. Mutual
trade registered an evident revival in 2000 compared to the previous year, but it
remained on a very low level. The share of Czech exports in overall turnover
increased as did the positive balance of the Czech Republic (111.1 million CZK).
Mutual trade in 2000 was worth approximately 125.1 million CZK, of this export
to Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was 118.1 million CZK and imports
7.0 million CZK.
The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea imports mostly engineering products
and dyes and exports to the Czech Republic mineral raw materials, furs, and traditional
medical products. The Czech Republic is interested in expanding economic
cooperation and in sub-deliveries for the construction of light water nuclear reactors in
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, financed by the Korean Peninsula Energy
Development Organization (KEDO), which the Czech Republic joined as a member in
1999.
Under a humanitarian aid project, the Czech Republic offered the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea in 2000 a supply of grapevine seed worth of
800,000 CZK. It is expected that this type of aid will continue.

_Modifications in bilateral agreements in 2000_

The Agreement on the mutual abolition of visas for holders of diplomatic, service
and special passports of 1956 was rescinded on 26 October 2000.

**REPUBLIC OF KOREA**

The Republic of Korea is an important partner of the Czech Republic on the Asian
continent. Relations focused mainly on trade and the economic sphere. Cultural
cooperation between the two countries was also noteworthy. The Czech Republic
demonstrated its desire to strengthen relations with the Republic of Korea by sending
its first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Seoul in October 2000.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 25–28. 10. 2000 – visit by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs H. Kmoníček;

_Economic relations_

Trade and economic cooperation between the Czech Republic and the Republic of
Korea has been satisfactory in 2000 both as regards the trade turnover compared to
the previous period and as regards to the reduction of the Czech trade deficit. Mutual
trade turnover amounted to 7.2 billion CZK in 2000 (exports 2 billion CZK, imports
5.2 billion CZK with a Czech Republic deficit of 3.2 billion CZK).
Predominant Czech export commodities were glass products, textiles, electric and
electronic equipment, engineering products, chemical products and metals. Imports
from the Republic of Korea consisted mainly of consumer electronic equipment,
automobiles and textiles.
The fate of the only significant direct investment of the Republic of Korea in the
Czech Republic – investment by Daewoo in the Avia firm in Prague Letňany, where
Republic of Korea owned 50.2% of all shares – was tied to the solution of the
situation at the headquarters of Daewoo Motor.
The Czech Republic is keen to expand economic cooperation with the Republic of
Korea to cover other countries as well. That is why the Czech Republic became
a member of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) in
1999, which was established to ensure the financing and implementation of the
delivery of nuclear power equipment in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.
The second session of the Joint Czech-Korean Commission for Economic and Trade
Cooperation, which met in Seoul in December 2000, noted good possibilities for
cooperation between the Czech Republic and the Republic of Korea on third markets
and enabling Czech sub-suppliers to cooperate in the construction of light water
reactors for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The main supplier of these


-----

would be the South Korean energy company KEPCO as part of a project of the
KEDO consortium.

_Cultural relations_

Cultural, educational, and scientific contacts were arranged in 2000 under the
terms of a procedural programme of the Cultural Agreement for 2000–2002, signed
in Prague on 17 May, 2000. To mark the tenth anniversary of the establishment of
diplomatic relations between the former Czechoslovak Federal Republic and the
Republic of Korea, the Czech Embassy in the Republic of Korea in Seoul organized
piano recitals by H. Dvořáková in Seoul and in Suwon in the spring of 2000. In May
2000, the Korean drama society Yobaek gave a performance of the Asian premiere of
V. Havel’s play “Asanace” in the South Korean capital under the auspices of the
Embassy of the Czech Republic in the Republic of Korea. In the autumn, an
exhibition of photographs by J. Chmelař was arranged as part of the “Czech Days”,
organized by the Embassy of the Czech Republic in the Republic of Korea in Seoul.
In December, the Prague Mozart Orchestra gave six concerts in Seoul and in Pusan,
co-organized by the Embassy of the Czech Republic in the Republic of Korea.
In 2000, the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic offered a South Korean
translator a grant of 100,000 CZK for a translation of K. Čapek’s “War with the
Newts”.
The Korean sculptor Hong Sung Hwan arranged an exhibition of his works in
Prague in the spring of 2000. Negotiations were in progress with the Republic of
Korea on the introduction of a separate Korean section of exhibits of Asian
collections at the National Gallery at Zbraslav. The Korean Kumho Asiana String
Quartet performed in Prague. The Embassy of the Czech Republic in the Republic of
Korea was a co-organizer of the concert.
Lecturers in the Czech and Korean languages were again working in both countries
under an agreement between Charles University in Prague and Hangkuk University
of Foreign Studies in Seoul. The Government of the Czech Republic offered the
Republic of Korea one undergraduate and two post-graduate scholarships at Czech
universities for the academic year 2000–2002. The Government of the Republic of
Korea offered scholarships for two students from the Czech Republic for the
academic year 2000–2002. Other students were studiyng in the Republic of Korea in
2000 on the basis of grants provided by the Korean Foundation.

**MALAYSIA**

From the political and economic point of view, Malaysia is a significant member
of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN); it plays an increasingly active


-----

role on the international scene and also in the context of the Asian-European
dialogue. Malaysia is a country with a great economic potential.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 16–18. 11. 2000 – visit by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance
P. Mertlík.

_Economic relations_

The Czech Republic would like to put greater emphasis economic relations, which
should focus gradually on cooperation in the economic sphere. The current level of
trade does not correspond to the potential of the economies of the two countries. In
2000, mutual trade turnover was 7.7 billion CZK (imports 6.4 billion CZK, exports
1.3 billion CZK, Czech deficit 5.1 billion CZK).
The main export commodities to Malaysia were engineering products, machine
tools, and electric motors. There are good chances for future exports of pianos,
gliders, and aircraft. In 2000, the engineering products included predominantly metal
processing and duplicating machines, textile and knitting machines, tractors, valves,
armatures, ball bearings, and weavers’ looms.
The Czech Republic is working towards a further strengthening of economic
cooperation with Malaysia, where Czech firms see opportunities for investments and
the establishment of joint enterprises.

_Cultural relations_

There is no agreement on cultural relations. Contacts in this area have not even
developed on a commercial basis and remain confined to individual events. In 2000,
the Kühn Children’s Choir toured Malaysia with great success. The Government of the
Czech Republic offers Malaysia one scholarship for post-graduate study every year.

**MONGOLIA**

Mongolia is going through a complicated process of social transformation and at
the same time seeks to diversify its external relations. It is a major recipient of
development aid from abroad. Relations between the Czech Republic and Mongolia
are traditionally friendly and are founded on democratic values, advocated by both
countries.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 15–20. 5. 2000 – visit by a delegation of the Committee for Public Administration,
Regional Development, and the Environment of the Senate.


-----

_Economic relations_

Mutual trade in 2000 amounted to 186 million CZK (imports 11.3 million CZK,
exports 174.7 million CZK, positive balance 163.4 million CZK).
Mongolia remains in the forefront of interest by Czech business. The shortage of
Mongolian finances and the weak capital resources of Czech firms are a problem
hindering mutual economic relations.
Mongolia has been included in the Czech Republic programme of development
aid, which in 2000 amounted to 18.6 million CZK. The financing of two projects for
the reconstruction of an Ulaanbaatar hospital and geological exploration continues.
In 2000, the Czech Republic offered Mongolia humanitarian aid in alleviating the
effects of famine.

_Cultural relations_

In 1999 and 2000, a number of prominent Czech cultural personalities visited
Mongolia (J. Topol, I. Chaun, I. Kelarová with the Romano Rat Group, P. Rut, and
others). Moreover, a series of noteworthy cultural events took place (an exhibition of
works by twenty Czech graphic artists, an exhibition of glass, a concert by Czech
virtuosi, film shows, etc.).
In September 2000, six Czech students of Mongolian studies arrived in
Ulaanbaatar for a two-semester course. During that same period, six Mongolian
government scholarship recipients started their studies in the Czech Republic. Two
Mongolian students of Czech Studies attended a summer school of Slavonic Studies.
Talks opened in the course of 2000 on an Agreement on Educational, Scientific and
Youth Affairs cooperation.

**NEW ZEALAND**

New Zealand plays an active role in international organizations and maintains
special political and economic relations with Australia, which is its major trading
partner. Both countries established a free trade area. In November 2000, it was
decided to open a second Honorary Consulate of the Czech Republic in Auckland. In
December 2000, New Zealand announced the introduction of visas for travel by
Czech citizens to New Zealand; the decision came into force on 1 January, 2001.

_Economic relations_

Trade between the Czech Republic and New Zealand is on a low level. The
overall turnover increased in 2000 in comparison to 1999 but the Czech Republic
trade deficit remained. In 2000, mutual trade turnover amounted to approximately


-----

347.7 million CZK (export 114.4 million CZK, imports 233.3 million CZK, deficit
118.9 million CZK).
The main Czech export articles were household glass, arms and ammunition,
musical instruments, tyres, textiles, footwear, engineering products (machine tools
and instruments, road building machines), electric motors, furniture, and chemicals.
The Czech Republic imported chiefly wool and there was also an increase in
imports of other products, such as textile machines, artificial materials, medical
instruments, and meat.

_Cultural relations_

Cultural, educational, sports and scientific contacts have been organized
predominantly on a commercial basis. There are Czech expatriates in New Zealand
who play a significant role in promoting contacts.

**PAKISTAN**

The Czech-Pakistani relations were limited in 2000 as a result of nuclear tests in
1998 and the military coup in 1999.
At the end of 2000, Pakistan closed down its embassy in Prague for economic reasons
and the Pakistani Ambassador in Warsaw was accredited also for the Czech Republic.

_Economic relations_

Mutual trade for quite some time ranged between 600 and 800 million CZK. But
during the past few years there has been an increase in imports to the Czech Republic.
In 2000, the turnover amounted to 827.1 million CZK – imports were 567.8 million,
exports 259.3 million CZK. The trade deficit amounted to 308.5 million CZK.
Mutual trade and investments do not correspond to the possibilities of the two
countries. The Pakistani market has a great absorption capacity. There are trade and
investment opportunities for Czech firms in a variety of sectors ranging from
consumer goods to entire investment projects (medicines, chemicals, glass, textile
machines, transportation machines and equipment, energy, manufacture and
transmission of energy, extraction and processing of crude and natural gas).

**SINGAPORE**

Singapore, a significant economic centre, is a stable and the biggest trade partner
of the Czech Republic in South-East Asia and potentially a major investor in the
Czech Republic.


-----

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 14–16. 11. 2000 – visit by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance
P. Mertlík.

_Economic relations_

Singapore is the Czech Republic’s most important trading partner among the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. The commodities that
have a chance of penetrating the Singapore market, possibly third markets through the
intermediary of Singapore firms, are electronic components, building technology,
certain types of specialised technology, or sub-supplies for major Singapore capital
investments at home and abroad. The most extensive import commodities were
computers and computer components, household electronics, electrical appliances,
raw rubber, medical instruments, and electronic components.
In 2000, the mutual trade turnover amounted to 8.8 billion CZK (imports 3.7 billion
CZK, exports 5.1 billion CZK, with a positive balance of 1.4 billion CZK).

_Cultural relations_

It should be pointed out that there has up to now been a one-way trend in this field,
from the Czech Republic to Singapore. Membership of the Czech Republic in the
European Union is expected to lead to more intensive cultural relations since
Asia–Europe Foundation (ASEF), oriented mainly on cultural cooperation and
exchanges, is located in Singapore. In April 2000, the Kühn Children’s Choir
performed in Singapore and the classical guitarist J. Mazan in May 2000.

**SRI LANKA**

The falling interest in cooperation with Sri Lanka, which was particularly evident
in the early 1990s, has been overcome and there was an upsurge of Czech-Sri Lankan
relations in 2000. But the ongoing civil war has been an obstacle to the development
of relations.

_Economic relations_

Mutual trade between the two countries has increased substantially during the past
three years. In 2000, the balance turned in favour of the Czech Republic, mainly due
to cooperation in the military sphere. Overall turnover in 2000 was 1.1 billion CZK
(exports 898.2 million CZK, imports 277.1 million CZK, positive balance
621.1 million CZK).


-----

Trade is based on a Trade and Payment Agreement of 1975. The Czech Republic
imported mainly rubber and coconut products. It exported individual engineering
items and small volume rolled material, malt, and paper.

_Cultural relations_

Cultural cooperation is based on a Cultural Agreement from 1975 but due to
a shortage of resources and lack of interest on both sides, contacts have been
stagnating. The Czech Republic yearly offers Sri Lanka one or two scholarships.

**THAILAND**

Thailand is among those Asian countries where a system of parliamentary
democracy has been functioning for several decades. The year 2000 saw a revival of
the Thai economy, which had previously been greatly slowed down by the financial
and economic crisis in 1997–1998.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 26. 4. 2000 – visit by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs H. Kmoníček.

_Visits by representatives of Thailand_

– 16–21. 5. 2000 – state visit by Princess Chulabhorn.

_Economic relations_

Thailand is among the significant trade partners of the Czech Republic in Asia. The
prospering mutual trade was, however, affected by the 1997–1998 economic crisis in
Thailand and by the devaluation of the local currency. In 2000, overall turnover was
4 billion CZK (exports 1 billion CZK, imports 3 billion CZK, Czech deficit
2 billion CZK).
Among the major imports were foodstuffs (rice, shrimps, fish, tinned fruit),
clothing, footwear, raw rubber, and textile yarn. Engineering products included
equipment for automatic data processing, including peripheral units.
The second session of the Czech-Thai Joint Trade Commission met in Prague in
June 2000.

_Bilateral Agreements concluded in 2000_

– Inter-governmental agreement on handing over offenders and on cooperation in
implementing criminal verdicts between the Czech Republic and Thailand;
Bangkok, 26 April, 2000.


-----

_Cultural relations_

The Czech Republic offers Thailand two government scholarships per year, but the
demand by Thai students is much higher.

**VIETNAM**

In the Asian region, Vietnam is a country with considerable economic possibilities.
It takes an active part in regional institutions and also in global organizations. CzechVietnamese relations based on traditional ties concentrated in 2000 on economic
and commercial cooperation. The year 2000 marked a 50[th] anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between the Czech Republic and Vietnam.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 18–22. 4. 2000 – Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs H. Kmoníček on the occasion
of inter-ministerial consultations.

_Visits by representatives of Vietnam_

– 18–21. 5. 2000 – visit by the Minister of National Defence Pham Van Tra;
– 20–24. 5. 2000 – visit by the Deputy Minister of Health Pham Manh Hung.

_Economic relations_

Czech-Vietnamese economic and trade cooperation has a long tradition. The
volume of trade has been rising, but has been affected by the stagnation of Czech
exports, which resulted in a growing trade deficit on the part of Czech exports. In
2000, mutual turnover amounted to 2.5 billion CZK (exports 407.7 million CZK,
imports 2.1 billion CZK, deficit 1.7 billion CZK).
The primary import commodities were textiles, footwear, wicker furniture, tropical
fruit, rice, coffee, tea, spices, and other products of the food industry. Czech exports
involved mainly machines and means of transport (locomotives, pumps, ships’
motors, generators), metal products, pipes and tubes, glass products, tools and
instruments, chemicals, plastics, and various industrial goods (measuring and
monitoring instruments, lighting technology, clothing accessories, office equipment).
Opportunities for Czech firms on the Vietnamese market will be improved by
defining a medium- and long-term trade and economic strategy and policy which will
take account of the interests and possibilities of the state and of Czech firms as well
as of the interest, requirements and possibilities of Vietnam. These questions are
dealt with at the Joint Czech-Vietnamese Commission for Trade and Economic
Cooperation.


-----

Vietnam remains a country to which the Czech Republic offers development aid.
Vietnam is among the main recipients. In December 2000, a representative of the
Czech Republic attended a conference of development aid donors to Vietnam in
Hanoi. In October 2000, it was decided to provide humanitarian aid to the value of
$30,000 to be used to alleviate the effects of the catastrophic floods in Central and
Northern Vietnam.

_Cultural relations_

The promotion of the Czech Republic in Vietnam has taken place by means of
exhibitions on various subjects, organized by the Embassy of the Czech Republic in
Vietnam in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic
and other Czech and foreign institutions. A series of cultural and social events was
held in 2000 to mark the 50[th] anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic
relations.
There is a large Vietnamese community on the territory of the Czech Republic,
which according to official information from the Ministry of Interior of the Czech
Republic amounts to 22,000 persons with legal residence permits.

**and the Countries of the Middle East**
**and North Africa**

**ALGERIA**

During the past ten years, Algeria has been shaken by struggles between
the Government and armed formations of the banned Islamic Salvation Front. Algeria
participates in the Euro-Mediterranean Dialogue as part of the Barcelona Process.
Notwithstanding the complex internal situation in the country, which also had an
adverse influence on bilateral relations with the Czech Republic, Algeria is among the
significant trading partners of the Czech Republic in the region.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 15–18. 5. 2000 – visit by the Minister of Industry and Trade M. Grégr;
– 19–23. 5. 2000 – visit by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs H. Kmoníček;

Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament.


-----

_Economic relations_

In 2000, the trade turnover reached 4.6 billion CZK. Czech exports amounted to
469.6 million CZK and imports 4.1 billion CZK. The deficit amounted to 3.6 billion
CZK. Despite restrictions caused by the situation in Algeria, economic relations did
not correspond fully to the potential of the Czech Republic; consequently the trade
balance is in the long term at a deficit.

_Cultural relations_

The Lipta Folk Ensemble performed in Algiers in January 2000 and the Czech Trio
in April 2000. An exhibition “Africa through the Eyes of Czech Travellers” opened
in July and M. Forman films were screened in November 2000.

**EGYPT**

Egypt, as a major regional power in the Middle East and as one of its traditional
commercial, economic and cultural centres, plays a significant role in inter-Arab
relations and in the peace process in the Middle East; in this respect it has the support
of the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic regards its traditional relations with Egypt as one of its foreign
policy priorities in the region; this was demonstrated also by the visit by the Deputy
Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs J. Kavan.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 22–24. 1. 2000 – visit by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs
J. Kavan;
– 13–15. 4. 2000 – visit by Minister of Agriculture J. Fencl.

_Economic relations_

In 2000, the turnover amounted to 2.4 billion CZK with Czech exports at
2.0 billion CZK, and imports at 400 million CZK. The favourable trade balance
amounted to 1.6 billion CZK. Czech firms were involved in several major investment
projects such as the construction of the Ajn Músá Power Station in Sinai. Among
developing countries, Egypt was one of the main importers from the Czech Republic.
Czech exports concentrated on engineering products, equipment and automobiles
(approximately 70%) as well as military material.

_Cultural relations_

The Czech Republic maintained cultural relations with Egypt on a larger scale than
with other countries in the region; this was done mainly on a non-commercial basis.


-----

Cultural exchanges saw a visible upsurge even though it was the Czech side that was
more active. In March 2000, there was a cello recital by J. Bárta. There was also the
exhibition “650 Years of Charles University”, and a performance by B. Hybner. In
April 2000, an exhibition of works by the graphic artist F. Doubek was organized.
After launching of the activities of the Czech-Egyptian Art Club, a number of Czech
films were shown in the course of 2000. In September, the ensemble Sklep took part
in the International Cairo Festival of the Experimental Theatre. An expedition of the
Czech Egyptology Institute of Charles University has been traditionally very active
in the country. The team is engaged in long-term successful research in the Abu Sir
locality.

**IRAQ**

Iraq has found itself in strict international isolation as a result of the sanctions
imposed by the United Nations Security Council after the invasion of Kuwait in
August 1990. The Czech Republic fully respected the provisions arising from
relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and also backed the
project “Oil for Food”.
Bilateral relations continued to stagnate. The Czech Republic has declared its
interest in expanding relations with Iraq for the benefit of both sides but only when
the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions are observed.

_Economic relations_

In 2000, the trade turnover was 275.3 million CZK; Czech exports were
7.6 million CZK and imports 267.7 million CZK. The deficit amounted to
260,1 million CZK. Czech firms did not succeed in asserting themselves in the
partially open trade authorized by the United Nations under the “Oil for Food”
programme, set up by the United Nations Security Council resolution No. 986. In
view of the broadcasts by Radio Free Iraq to Iraq, the Iraqi Government adopted
a package of measures restricting the activities of Czech trading firms on the Iraqi
market. Imports centred on oil and partly on cotton products. Actual trade was done
via third countries.

_Cultural relations_

A Czech ensemble has been participating every year in the Babylon Festival since
1997; in 2000 the Olšava Folk Ensemble accepted an invitation and participated in
this event.


-----

**ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN**

Certain internal political changes have taken place in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Iran has succeeded in breaking through its international isolation and settle its
relations with the EU Member States. The Czech Republic welcomed the positive and
promising trend evident in Iran’s approach.
Iran’s opposition to the broadcasting of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in the
Persian language adversely affected bilateral relations with its editorial office in
Prague. The visit by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs H. Kmoníček in Teheran
represented an opportunity to express of the interest on both sides in closer relations
in the future, mainly in the economic sphere.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 30. 5.–1. 6. 2000 – visit by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs H. Kmoníček.

Teheran in September 2000. An exhibition of traditional and contemporary Iranian art
was held in Brno in October 2000, and the Fourth Festival of Iranian Films was
organized in Prague in October 2000.

relations expanded successfully in 2000.

_Economic relations_

Trade turnover reached 235.5 million CZK in 2000; Czech exports represented
233.3 million CZK and imports 2.2 million CZK. The positive balance of the Czech
Republic amounted to 231.1 million CZK. Yemen showed interest in Czech products
on the basis of their favourable reputation, as well as in the participation of Czech


-----

firms in development projects in the infrastructure (energy, water projects, the
construction of cement factories with the financial participation of the World Bank
and donors). The main export articles were automobiles and cammions, pumps, glass
and equipment for electrical installations.

**JORDAN**

Jordan, important because of its strategic position between Iraq and Israel,
continued to be active in the peace process in the Middle East.
Czech-Jordanian relations are not burdened by any problems and expanded
successfully in 2000.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 29. 4.–6. 5. 2000 – participation of 13 representatives of the Chamber of Deputies
of the Parliament of the Czech Republic in the 103[rd] Conference of the

**SAUDI ARABIA**

Saudi Arabia is the biggest state in the Arab Peninsula and also the most powerful
country militarily and economically of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
The Czech Republic has perceived the development of contacts with Saudi Arabia
as promising in general and for the economy. The Czech Republic has emphasized the


-----

need for opening a Embassy of Saudi Arabia in the Czech Republic, which would
make an effective contribution to the further expansion of relations mainly in trade
and in the economic sphere.

_Economic relations_

In 2000, the trade turnover reached 1.4 billion CZK. Czech exports represented
1.37 billion CZK, imports 50.5 million CZK. The positive Czech balance amounted
to 1.3 billion CZK. The economic sphere dominated the relations; the primary Czech
export commodities were automobiles and trucks, engineering equipment, glass and
foodstuffs. In 2000, negotiations continued on a General Agreement, which Saudi
Arabia considers crucial for the negotiation and signing of other contractual
documents.

_Cultural relations_

The Czech Republic maintained good relations in the field of culture, education
and the health service. The exhibition “The Artistic Heritage and Art of Saudi
Arabia” contributed significantly to the improvement of mutual understanding. It was
held in the Czech Republic from the autumn of 1999 until the winter of 2000 in
Prague, Brno, and Vyškov. This was the first exhibition of its kind in Central and
Eastern Europe and the third in Europe as such. In 2000, the Embassy of the Czech
Republic in Saudi Arabia, together with the embassies of the EU Member States and
associate countries, participated in a film festival; exhibitions “650 years of Charles
University” and “Ten Personalities in Czech Graphic Art” were also organized. At the
turn of 2000–2001, the Faculty of Philosophy and Arts of the Charles University took
part in an international exhibition of prints of the Koran in Riyadh.

**LEBANON**

The Lebanon has been in a state of reconstruction after the end of a protracted civil
war. Until May 2000, the Israeli army occupied the south of the country. The Czech
Republic regards Lebanon as a significant partner among the Arab countries in the
Middle East. Relations concentrate primarily on trade and economic cooperation.

_Economic relations_

In 2000, the trade turnover amounted to 1.39 billion CZK with exports at 1.38 billion
CZK and imports at 6.4 million CZK. The Czech positive balance amounted to
1.37 billion CZK. Lebanon is among the major importers of Czech commodities in
the Middle East. Czech firms are mainly interested in participating in certain


-----

development projects in the transport infrastructure where opportunities exist for
direct or sub-contracting participation. A business mission, arranged by the Comenius
Foundation, visited Lebanon in September 2000.

_Cultural relations_

An “Exhibition of Theatre Photography” by J. Krejčí was held in Beirut in March
2000.

_Economic relations_

In 2000, trade turnover amounted to 778.9 million CZK; Czech exports were
388.5 million CZK, imports 390.4 million CZK. The Czech deficit amounted to

2000 on the Moroccan market and Czech exports have been higher.

_Cultural relations_

The Czech film “The Dance Teacher”, directed by J. Jireš, was screened in July
2000 at the International Film Festival in Morocco. An exhibition of 150 Czech books
in the French language was organized in Rabat in October 2000.

**UNITED ARAB EMIRATES**

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) are a significant member of the Gulf
Cooperation Council and a major trading and economic partner of the Czech Republic
in the Middle East.
Political activities between the two countries continued in 2000 and confirmed the
growing interest of the two countries in strengthening predominantly economic
relations.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

doubled in 2000 as opposed to 1999 and reached 4.7 billion CZK while imports
amounted to 674.9 million CZK. The Czech positive balance was 4 billion CZK. The
United Arab Emirates were among the significant trading partners of the Czech
Republic not only in the Middle East but also among developing countries. Since
1998, the UAE has been biggest importer from the Czech Republic among countries
in the Middle East. In 2000, like every year, Czech firms were represented at
a number of specialized international exhibitions and trade fairs.

_Cultural relations_

Two exhibitions were held in Abu Dhabi in October 2000: 150 Czech books in the
English language and an exhibition of graphic works by the graphic artist F. Doubek.

**ISRAEL**

Czech-Israeli relations have been on the highest level in their history. A series of
visits at various levels confirmed the interest on both sides in a substantial
strengthening of relations. Major events included a visit by the Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister of Foreign Affairs J. Kavan in Israel and a visit by Israeli Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs D. Levy in the Czech Republic.
Following the escalation of the situation at the end of September 2000 and the

The application of the Free Trade Agreement, signed on 20 May, 2000, had
a favourable impact on mutual relations. With certain exceptions in agricultural and
food production, the agreement stipulates the further abolition of customs duties in


-----

the course of 2000. The more favourable trading conditions were reflected in the
gradual increase in Czech exports.
In 2000, trade turnover reached 4.4 billion CZK. Czech exports amounted to
2.3 billion CZK and imports to 2.1 billion CZK. There was a Czech deficit of
204 million CZK, yet developments indicated that a balanced trade balance could be
achieved. The overall turnover placed Israel in third place in the Middle East and
North Africa, but in imports Israel is in first place.
The commodity structure of Czech exports is favourable: almost half accounts for
machines and means of transport. Other significant export articles are iron and steel
products as well as glass, tyres and chemicals. Czech imports centred mainly on
technically more demanding items in the field of communication, data processing,
engineering equipment, medical and laboratory instruments, chemicals and cotton.

_Bilateral Agreements concluded in 2000_

Medani textile factory was still working in Sudan.

**SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC**

While the Syrian Arab Republic represents for the Czech Republic a traditional
trade and economic partner in the region, relations have been stagnating since the
early 1990s because of certain issues in abeyance (the problem of the succession of
treaties and of financial claims). The Czech Republic manifested its interest in
settling these matters and during the visit of Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs
H. Kmoníček confirmed its readiness to activate a high-level dialogue, which would
help to find a mutually acceptable solution of these questions.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 19–20. 12. 2000 – visit by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs H. Kmoníček.

_Economic relations_

769.3 million CZK, imports 122.2 million CZK. The Czech positive balance amounted
to 647.1 million CZK. Czech firms failed to acquire new orders and essentially
concentrated on maintaining earlier projects. A shortage of convertible currency in the
Syrian state sector prevented a trade increase.


-----

_Cultural relations_

A concert by the Academia Brass Quintet was given in Damascus in April
2000.

**TUNISIA**

The Czech Republic regards Tunisia as a significant partner in the Mediterranean
region. Regular high-level mutual visits contribute to friendly relations.

represented 274 million CZK, imports 306.5 million CZK. The Czech deficit was
32.5 million CZK. After changing over to using compound fertilisers, the Czech
Republic ceased to purchase phosphates; this was reflected in the trade turnover,
which does not correspond to the potential of both countries. Tunisia has traditionally
been and remains a popular destination for Czech tourists – almost 60,000 visit
Tunisia each year.

_Bilateral Agreements concluded in 2000_

– An agreement on cooperation between the Ministry of Defence of the Czech
Republic and the Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Tunisia, Tunis,
12 May, 2000;
– An agreement on visa-free travel for holders of diplomatic and service passports
came into force on 1 January, 2000.

_Cultural relations_

“Days of Bohumil Hrabal” were organized in Tunis in January 2000. The event
comprised of an exhibition on the life and work of B. Hrabal and the screening of the
film “Postřižiny”. Films directed by M. Forman were shown in October 2000. The
event was organized in collaboration with the Embassy of the Czech Republic and the
Tunisian association for the promotion of film critique.
The Czech violinist P. Šporcl and the pianist P. Jiříkovský gave recitals as part of
the Carthage Music Festival in October 2000.

**LIBYAN ARAB JAMAHIRIYA**

In 2000, the Czech Republic was most active in aiming at reviving mutual
economic cooperation and solving still unresolved questions including the problem
of the successions of treaties and debts of Libya. Negotiations by the Deputy
Minister of Foreign Affairs H. Kmoníček in Libya and a meeting of Minister of
Foreign Affairs J. Kavan with the State Secretary for Foreign Affairs in September
2000 at the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York confirmed the
common interest in the restoration of mutual relations.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 16–19. 5. 2000 – visit by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs H. Kmoníček.

_Economic relations_

In 2000, trade turnover amounted to 149.4 million CZK; Czech exports amounted
to 138.4 million CZK, imports to 11.0 million CZK. The Czech positive balance
amounted to 127.4 million CZK.

**PALESTINIAN NATIONAL AUTHORITY**

The autonomous Palestinian territory was established under the joint Palestinian
and Israeli Declaration on Principles of 13 September, 1993 and the Cairo Agreement
of 4 May, 1994. The handing over of more territories to Palestinian administration is
a matter for negotiation on the ultimate status under the Palestine-Israeli peace
process. The Czech Republic supported the commencement of the peace process in
the Middle East from the very beginning. This process is based on United Nations
Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and on the principle “land for
peace”, which is the only way of achieving lasting and just peace in the region. After
the escalation of the situation at the end of September 2000 and growing violence
between the Israeli and the Palestinians, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech
Republic issued repeated declarations calling on both sides to show restraint,
responsibility, and to observe signed agreements.
Direct Czech-Palestinian relations in the political and economic sphere were
achieved through the Palestinian National Authority, which is the official
representative of the Palestinians and of their self-administration in the autonomous
Palestinian territories.
Mutual relations were promoted by the visit by the Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Foreign Affairs J. Kavan in the Palestine autonomous territories in July
1999. The Czech Republic was the first of the EU candidate countries to open its
liaison office at Ramallah on the Palestinian autonomous territory.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 15. 7. 2000 – visit by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs
J. Kavan.

_Visits by Palestinian representatives_

– 9–11. 3. 2000 – visit by the Minister for Planning and International Cooperation
N. Shaathe.

_Economic relations_

In 2000, trade turnover amounted to 4.1 million CZK. Czech exports amounted to
4.1 million CZK and imports to 35 thousand CZK. But these figures are not exact
since trade contacts with Palestinian businessmen were statistically indicated
primarily as part of trade with Israel.
Under the international development aid, the Czech Republic participated in the
renewal and development of the Palestinian territories by financing and organizing
the electrification project of the Túbás area in the West Bank for which the Czech
Republic earmarked more than 103 million CZK between 1996–1999, and additional
33 million CZK in 2000.

**9. Relations between the Czech Republic**
**and Sub-Saharan African countries**

**ANGOLA**

During the period under review mutual relations between the Czech Republic
and Angola have been further consolidated; they were formally settled at the end of
1999 after a five-year period when they were in fact frozen. The Czech Republic
considers Angola as a country with a great potential for trade and economic
cooperation.

_Visits by representatives of Angola_

– 27–31. 3. 2000 – private visit by President J. E. dos Santos.


-----

_Economic relations_

Trade between the Czech Republic and Angola was low. The overall turnover in
2000 was 36.5 million CZK. There was a 200% increase of Czech exports (35 million
CZK) compared to 1999. The main export articles were machines and means of
transport and industrial goods. Czech imports accounted for 1.5 million CZK. The
Czech Republic’s trade balance shows a long-term positive trend; in 2000 it reached
33.5 million CZK.

**ETHIOPIA**

Ethiopia is traditionally an important partner of the Czech Republic on the African
continent. In view of the armed conflict with neighbouring Eritrea, conditions could
not be created during the period under review for a further expansion of mutual
cooperation.

_Economic relations_

In 2000, the trade turnover amounted to 70.9 million CZK and the amount was
affected by the ongoing conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Ethiopia felt a shortage
of financial resources to pay for imports. Czech exports, which amounted to
37.6 million CZK, had dropped comparison to 1999. But this trend appears to be of
a temporary nature. Exports consist mainly of engineering products and means of
transport. Czech imports accounted for 33.3 million CZK. The Czech positive trade
balance was 4.3 million CZK.

_Cultural relations_

The Government of the Czech Republic offered the Government of Ethiopia four
university scholarships. In 2000, 30 government scholarship recipients were studying
in the Czech Republic.

**GHANA**

Mutual relations concentrated primarily on economic cooperation and were
reflected in an upsurge of trade.

_Economic relations_

In 2000, the trade turnover increased by approximately 80%, compared to 1999.
But this still does not reflect realistic possibilities. The long-term balance of trade


-----

is favourable for the Czech Republic (90.5 million CZK). Czech exports of
124.5 million CZK represented about three-quarters of the overall turnover which
in 2000 reached 158.5 million CZK, while the Czech Republic imported goods for
34 million CZK.
Export commodities include mainly engineering products and foodstuffs. Two
agreements on the establishment of joint enterprises, negotiated in 2000 by Czech and
Ghanaian firms, could greatly assist an increase of trade.

_Cultural relations_

The Government of the Czech Republic offers the Government of Ghana one
government scholarship yearly. In 2000, eleven government scholarship recipients
were studying in the Czech Republic.

**SOUTH AFRICA**

South Africa is the most advanced country in Sub-Saharan Africa and is also the
most significant and most promising partner of the Czech Republic in the region. In
2000, there was a rapid expansion of bilateral relations in the political but, above all,
in the commercial field. The visit by the South African Vice-President in the Czech
Republic testified to this.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 18–20. 6. 2000 – visit by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs H. Kmoníček.

_Visits by representatives of South Africa_

– 15–17. 3. 2000 – visit by the Chairman of the Upper Chamber of Parliament

Population Development Z. Skweyiya, Deputy Defence Minister N. MadlalaRoutlledge and Minister of Industry and Trade I. Hendricks.

_Economic relations_

The trade turnover, which in 2000 amounted to 1.5 billion CZK, witnessed a rise
of approximately 6%, compared to 1999. Czech exports, which amounted to
588.5 million CZK, represented approximately 40% of turnover. Export items
consisted mainly of engineering products and consumer goods. Imports amounted to
944 million CZK and the deficit thus reached 355.5 million CZK.

Chairwoman of the Senate L. Benešová.


-----

_Economic relations_

The trade turnover between the Czech Republic and Kenya reached 112.9 million
CZK in 2000. There has been a slight drop compared to 1999, especially because
of the limitation of Czech exports of consumer goods and engineering products
(80 million CZK), which dropped approximately by 40%. Czech imports accounted
for 32.9 million CZK. However, the overall volume of mutual trade remained far behind
realistic possibilities. In the long-term, the trade balance was traditionaly favourable
for the Czech Republic and in 2000 this balance amounted to 47.1 million CZK.

_Cultural relations_

An exhibition of works by the graphic artist O. Kulhánek was organized in Nairobi
in May. The Government of the Czech Republic offered the Government of the
Republic of Kenya three government university scholarships. In 2000, there were
23 government scholarship recipients studying in the Czech Republic.

**DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO**

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is among the promising partners of the
Czech Republic, especially in the trade and economic sphere. Relations began to be
gradually revived in the late 1990s, but they were hampered by the complicated
internal situation in the country. The Democratic Republic of the Congo opened its
Embassy in Prague in January 2000.

_Visits by representatives of the Democratic Republic of the Congo_

Films” with the film “When the Cat Comes”. The Government of the Czech Republic
offered the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo three university
scholarships and eleven Congolese students were studying at Czech universities.


-----

**LIBERIA**

There has been a certain revival of bilateral relations between the Czech Republic
and Liberia during the period under review, possibly also thanks to the establishment
of an Honorary Consulate of the Czech Republic in Monrovia. Liberia showed an
interest in economic cooperation, but its strengthening has been hampered by the
unstable domestic situation in Liberia.

_Visits by representatives of Liberia_

– 21–25. 8. 2000 – visit by the Minister of Foreign Affairs M. Captan.

_Economic relations_

Mutual trade dropped by approximately half in comparison to previous year.

one university scholarship. In 2000, there were two Liberian government scholarship
recipients studying at Czech universities.

**NAMIBIA**

Relations between the Czech Republic and Namibia have been friendly and
correct, but there are still considerable open possibilities in trade and in the economic
sphere. There has been particularly active cooperation in education.

_Economic relations_

Trade between the two countries has been very low. Turnover in 2000 dropped by
about one-third, as opposed to the previous period and amounted to
10.5 million CZK; a 40% drop was due especially to lower Czech exports (consumer
goods) which amounted to 8.9 million CZK. Imports were at 1.6 million CZK.

_Cultural relations_

The Government of the Czech Republic offered the Government of Namibia four
university scholarships. In 2000, there were 21 government scholarship recipients
studying at Czech universities.

_Cultural relations_

The Government of the Czech Republic offers the Government of Nigeria one to
two government university scholarships every year. In 2000, there were two
government scholarship recipients studying at Czech universities.

**CÔTE D’IVOIRE**

Relations between the Czech Republic and Côte d’Ivoire concentrated primarily on
trade and economic cooperation. The complicated domestic situation in the country
hampered more intensive relations.
The post of the Czech Republic’s Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary
was filled for the first time in the history of relations between the two countries with
his seat in Abidjan.

_Economic relations_

Trade turnover between the Czech Republic and Côte d’Ivoire reached
743.8 million CZK in 2000, which is a rise of approximately 30% as against the
previous year. Czech imports (cocoa) predominated, reaching of 659.7 million CZK.

but notwithstanding, amounted to only 84.1 million CZK. The Czech Republic has
a long-term deficit with the country and in 2000 this deficit amounted to
575.6 million CZK.


-----

_Cultural relations_

A week of Czech films was organized in Abidjan in July and “Days of Jazz” by
J. Koubková were organized in 16–18 October, 2000.

**SENEGAL**

The Czech Republic considers Senegal as a significant partner in West Africa but
the level of mutual relations has not been substantially expanded during the period
under review.

_Economic relations_

Trade turnover in 2000 amounted to 39 million CZK, which represents an increase
of approximately 30%. Czech exports predominate (34.5 million CZK), consisting of
engineering and consumer goods, which also increased by 30%.

**ZIMBABWE**

Zimbabwe was going through a complicated political and economic situation in
2000, which limited the possibility of a further expansion of mutual relations.

_Economic relations_

Even though there had been a drop in mutual trade turnover by approximatelly15%
(to 340.7 million CZK), due to lower imports of tobacco, Czech exports rose four
times as opposed to 1999 and reached 56 million CZK. Imports amounted to
284.7 million CZK and there was a deficit of 228.7 million CZK.

**10. Relations between the Czech Republic**
**and the countries of Latin America**

**ARGENTINA**

Argentina is one of the most important and traditional partners of the Czech
Republic in Latin America. The dominant aspect of mutual relations is in the
economic sphere. The Czech Republic cooperates with Argentina on the international
scene.


-----

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 2–3. 3. 2000 – the Head of the Office of the President I. Mathé met the Head of the
Office of Argentinian President J. de la Rua in Buenos Aires;
– 7–10. 6. 2000 – visit by a delegation of the Committee for Foreign Affairs of the
Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament.

_Economic relations_

Despite the economic potential of the two countries, mutual trade has been
dropping since 1993. The main reason is the transformation of the structure of Czech
exports and the economic crisis in Argentina during the past two years. In the 1990s,
Argentina held the third to fifth place in Czech trade turnover with Latin American
countries. In 2000, mutual trade turnover dropped to 806.3 million CZK with
a relatively steady trade balance with Czech exports amounting to 407.0 million CZK
and imports 399.3 million CZK. The positive balance reached 7.7 million CZK. But
a considerable proportion of Czech exports to Argentina is carried out via third
countries.
Following a structural reorientation of Czech exports in the first half of the 1990s,
the emphasis of Czech exports shifted to the sphere of metallurgical semi-finished
goods, machinery and equipment, ball bearings, motor vehicles, tractors, motorcycles,
and consumer goods. The predominant Czech imports from Argentina are oleaceous
groundnuts, meat and meat products, fish and seafood, aluminium wire, wool, leather,
and leather goods.
The participation of the Czech Republic in the EMAQH machine tool fair in 2000
was most successful.

_Bilateral Agreements concluded in 2000_

– 2. 1. 2000 – The Agreement on visa-free travel between the Czech Republic and
Argentina came into force.

_Cultural relations_

Argentinian cultural institutions showed keen interest in the establishment of
contacts with partners in the Czech Republic, especially in traditional fields of Czech
culture such as cinematography, music, and photography. There has been a certain
revitalization thanks to several successful events by Czech orchestras and theatre
ensembles but also to exhibitions arranged by the Embassy of the Czech Republic in
Argentina or with its participation (exhibition to mark the 150[th] anniversary of the
birth of T. G. Masaryk, exhibition of the contemporary Czech poster “Carteles de
Praga”). The Embassy of the Czech Republic in Argentina has sponsored several
theatre performances. The most interesting of these were two plays by F. Kafka.


-----

Concerts by the Czech Philharmonic and the FOK orchestra were most successful.
A regular exchange of university scholarship recipients is in progress.

**VENEZUELA**

Because of its immense crude oil deposits, Venezuela is among the most significant
Latin American countries. The Czech Republic maintained correct relations with
Venezuela with special emphasis on economic and trade cooperation.

_Economic relations_

Trade in 2000 confirmed the trend of reviving and increasing economic and
commercial cooperation. The overall trade turnover amounted to 389.3 million CZK,
of this Czech exports 374.3 million CZK and imports 15 million CZK. Venezuela is
among the few countries in the region with which the Czech Republic has
a positive trade balance. In 2000, this balance amounted to 359.3 million CZK.
The Embassy of the Czech Republic in Venezuela is accredited, alongside
Venezuela, for 13 other countries in the Caribbean and the Northern part of the South
American sub-continent (e.g. Guyana, Suriname, the Dominican Republic, Trinidad
and Tobago, the Virgin Islands, Barbados, and Haiti). The states which are included
in the trade and economic range coming under the Embassy in Caracas, represent the
second biggest volume of trade between the Czech Republic and the countries of
Latin America and the Caribbean, following after Brazil.
Czech export commodities include milk, glassware, iron and steel, chemicals,
pipes, valves and armatures, jewels and products of the goldsmith trade, textile and
leather processing machines and spare parts, photographic and film accessories, china
table- and kitchenware, textile yarn, fibres and market products, road vehicles
(mainly motorcycles), office equipment, clothing and accessories, metal processing
machines and paper, cardboard and products made of cardboard.

_Cultural relations_

Cultural contacts are arranged mainly on a commercial basis or at the initiative of
the Embassy of the Czech Republic in Venezuela in Caracas. In 2000, the Embassy
arranged two exhibitions on the life and work of B. Hrabal and on the contemporary
Czech poster. The “Black Theatre” gave guest performances in Caracas and five other
towns under the auspices of the Czech Embassy.
As part of a development programme, the Government of the Czech Republic
offered unilaterally two scholarships for studies at Czech universities to Venezuelan
applicants.

America. Mutual trade in 2000 was no more than 37.1 million CZK (exports
16.7 million CZK, imports 20.4 million CZK). The deficit amounted to 3.7 million CZK.
Predominant Czech export commodities were printing machines, glassware, textile
machines and their spare parts (knitting machines), and china. Bolivian exports to the
Czech Republic included unroasted coffee – 65% - and Brazil nuts – 31.5%. Other

Czech-Brazilian trade represents in the long term one-third of all Czech trade with
Latin America.
In 2000, the Czech and Brazilian business communities have shown greater
interest in more active trade relations. The Czech Republic responded to this by
sending two economic delegations, which backed this trend. Trade turnover in
2000 increased by 54% and reached 5.8 billion CZK; Czech exports amounted to
1.8 billion CZK, imports 4 billion CZK. The deficit amounted to 2.2 billion CZK. The
Czech Republic imports from Brazil coffee, foodstuffs, tobacco, natural oil, chemical
products, leather and leather goods (footwear), industrial and machine equipment,
optical instruments, etc. The main Czech export articles are foodstuffs, live animals,
hops, alcoholic beverages, mineral oils, fuel, chemicals, plastic articles, glass and
glassware, industrial technology (cement works), metal and steel ingots, machines

and equipment, automobiles and tractors. A positive feature is the trade and economic
cooperation of Czech firms with individual Brazilian states.
A new Honorary Consulate of the Czech Republic has been opened in Manaus
(Amazonas), which, alongside the other honorary consulates, is expected to promote
relations between the Czech Republic and Brazil.

_Cultural relations_

post-graduate courses at Czech universities. Colombia in turn enables one to two
Czech students every year to take post-graduate courses at Colombian universities.

**CUBA**

Czech-Cuban relations in 2000 focused mainly on the trade and economic sphere.
Relations were influenced by the resolution, adopted by the UN Human Rights
Commission, condemning the Cuban Government for failing to respect human rights
and fundamental democratic liberties. The Czech Republic was one of the authors of
the resolution. The Cuban Government reacted to this initiative by totally freezing all
contacts with the exception of contacts between Czech and Cuban firms.

_Economic relations_

Trade turnover between the Czech Republic and Cuba in 2000 amounted to
246.4 million CZK (exports 199.9 million CZK, imports 46.5 million CZK, the active
balance was 153.4 million CZK). An increase is limited by the chronic shortage of
currency in the Cuban state economy.
However, the repayment of the Cuban debt to the Czech Republic (approximately
540 million of transferable roubles) remains an open problem; but this sum will first
have to be calculated in a convertible currency.

_Changes in bilateral agreements in 2000_

– The Agreement on the abolition of visas between the government of the
Czechoslovak Federal Republic and the government of the Republic of Cuba for
holders of valid travel documents, concluded by an exchange of notes on 3 and
29 April, 1992, was abrogated as of 19 January, 2000.

**PARAGUAY**

Relations with Paraguay were limited by the continuing complex internal political
situation in the country.

_Economic relations_

Since the mid-1990s, trade between the Czech Republic and Paraguay has
registered a declining tendency. In 2000, the mutual trade turnover rose to
26.9 million CZK with a roughly 100% increase in Czech exports to 26.2 million
CZK and a basically equal imports amounting to 685 thousand CZK.


-----

_Cultural relations_

Under a foreign development aid programme, the Czech Republic offers Paraguay
scholarships for a complete university and post-graduate course of study in the Czech
Republic, which is in great demand, and applications exceed availability.

**PERU**

The good bilateral political relations between the Czech Republic and Peru have been
demonstrated, for example, by a visit by the Peruvian Minister of Foreign Affairs in the
Czech Republic. Trade and economic relations were at the centre of cooperation.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 6–13. 10. 2000 – visit by Minister of Education E. Zeman.

_Economic relations_

Trade in 2000 reached a turnover of 459.4 million CZK (exports 147 million CZK,
imports 312.4 million CZK with a deficit of 165.4 million CZK). The predominant
commodities in Czech exports in 2000 were textile machines and their spare parts,
(knitting and weaving machines), metallurgical products (pipes), chemical products –
especially cyanides, office equipment, and glassware. Imports from Peru were mainly
fishmeal – 67% – fish and seafood – 18% - and cotton yarn.

exhibition of works by students of the Lima arts school in Prague (October). The
Pacha Peru folk ensemble of songs and dance performed in Prague in September
2000. The Embassy of the Czech Republic in Peru prepared an exhibition of works
by Czech painters F. Skála, T. Císařovský and O. Placht in Lima (December).


-----

In 2000, six of the most outstanding students of secondary schools at Callao
(March) and several Czech students from the Budejovicka Grammar School in Prague
(August) took part in reciprocal student exchanges.
The Government scholarships granted under a development aid programme can be
regarded as a significant aspect of cooperation in education. Peru again offered one
scholarship for a course of study at the diplomatic academy in Lima.

**MEXICO**

The Czech Republic maintains traditional, long-term and friendly relations with
Mexico, which grew stronger in 2000. The level of these relations has been
documented by the significant number of visits by representatives of the two
countries. Mexico is among the most important partners of the Czech Republic in
Latin America. It is the first Latin American country whose firms have been investing
in the Czech Republic.

steel, waste water purifier, musical instruments, weapons and ammunition, tyres,
beer, and wine. The predominant items imported from Mexico were products of


-----

Volkswagen and other engineering products (80% of all imports), coffee, pectin
materials, electrical installations, office and data processing technology,
medicaments, fluorite, clothing, and foodstuffs.
The Mexican food company Ricolino (Karviná-Petřvald) launched production in
the Czech Republic in 2000, while preparations proceeded for the construction of the
Mexican engineering firm Nemak (Pilsen). Another Mexican food manufacturing
firm, Barcel, decided to invest “on the green meadow” in the Czech Republic. During
the period under review, the Czech Republic continued preparations for investments
by the Česká gumárenská společnost (San Luis Potosi) and by Karbon Invest
(Coahuila). A Czech mini-brewery and restaurants opened in Tijuana.

_Bilateral Agreements concluded in 2000_

– A Phyto-Sanitary Agreement; Mexico City, 13 March, 2000.

_Cultural relations_

and, scientific relations between the two countries. The text of an agreement on
cultural and educational cooperation was drawn up at a session of the Joint
Commission in Prague.
The most significant cultural event in 2000 was a ceremony to mark the unveiling
of a statue of T. G. Masaryk on a street of the same name in Mexico City. An
exhibition of Czech design and graphic art works was held in 2000, accompanied by
the publication of a special catalogue. The Black Theatre of F. Kratochvíl toured
some of the tourist centres on the Caribbean coast. The Czech Republic was
traditionally represented at the Cervantino Festival and at the Cervantes en Todas
Partes Festival. Significant ventures included the reconstruction of the sculptural group
“The Three Graces” by the Czech sculptor M. Chlupáč, and the installation of a bust
of T. G. Masaryk in the passageway of a shopping centre on T. G. Masaryk Street.
The regular exchange of university scholarship recipients continued in 2000 as
well; a group of 30 Mexican students was sent to spend one month in the Czech
Republic. In the field of science, cooperation began between the Institute of
Astronomy of Charles University, Prague, and the Guanajuato University. Projects
and grants were carried out also at other levels.

**URUGUAY**

The Czech Republic maintains long and correct relations with Uruguay. During the
last few years cooperation was stepped up especially in the trade, economic and
cultural fields.


-----

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 29. 2.–2. 3. 2000 – participation of the Head of the Office of the President
I. Mathé in the swearing-in ceremony of the newly elected President of Uruguay
J. Batlle.

_Economic relations_

The volume of trade dropped in 2000 compared to 1999 and did not correspond
fully to the export potential of the two countries. The overall turnover amounted to
160.8 million CZK, of this Czech exports were at 61.8 million CZK and imports at
99 million CZK. The deficit amounted to 37.2 million CZK. The most significant
commodities in Czech exports in 2000 were iron and steel, drugs and pharmaceutical
products, machines and equipment for the building industry, instruments and hand
tools, glassware, and electrical engineering hand tools propelled by electric motors.
Among the chief import items were combed and cut wool, oranges, tangerines and
other citrus fruits, leather, clothing accessories made of textiles, clothing, and leather
accessories.

_Changes in bilateral agreements in 2000_

– 29. 12. 2000 – an agreement on mutual assistance and protection of investments
came into force (signed on 26 September, 1996).

_Cultural relations_

Uruguayan cultural institutions are showing considerable interest in boosting
contacts with their partners in the Czech Republic, mainly in traditional branches of
Czech culture such as cinematography or music. In 2000, Czech culture was strongly
presented. Czech cinematography was represented at the XVIII. International Film
Festival in Montevideo, an exhibition of contemporary Czech posters was arranged.
The Prague Chamber Orchestra under the renowned Uruguayan conductor
R. Montenegro gave guest performances here. The Czech Trio Guarnieri, as well as
the Prague Symphony Orchestra FOK under its conductor J. Bělohlávek played to
enthusiastic audiences.
The Czech Republic grants scholarships unilaterally every year to Uruguayan
applicants to attend courses at Czech universities. During the 2000–2001 academic
year, 2 scholarship recipients studied in the Czech Republic. In light of a great
interest, one additional scholarship has been allocated for 2001. There were five
scholarships granted for post-graduate studies.

**CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES**

**(COSTA RICA, GUATEMALA, EL SALVADOR,**
**HONDURAS, PANAMA, NICARAGUA)**

The Czech Republic maintains correct relations. Lately, there has been a revival
and strengthening of trade and economic cooperation.

_Visits by representatives of the Czech Republic_

– 14–15. 2. 2000 – visit by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs H. Kmoníček in
Panama.

_Economic relations_

**COSTA RICA**

Economic and trade relations have for a long time been correct and essentially free
of problems, but they are not very dynamic. Mutual trade reached a turnover of
289.9 million CZK in 2000 – Czech exports were 70.3 million CZK and imports
219.6 million CZK. During the past ten years, the trade balance has been running at
a steady deficit for the Czech Republic. In 2000, the values reached 149.3 million
CZK. This deficit is caused mainly by imports of bananas and coffee, which are the
predominant Costa Rican export items. Czech exports centre on iron and steel and
products made of these commodities, printing machines, cutlery, tools and equipment,
rubber products, textile yarn, and others.

**GUATEMALA**

In 2000, mutual trade amounted to 112.4 million CZK; Czech exports amounted to
44.7 million CZK, imports to 67.7 million CZK. The main items of Czech exports
were machine tools and textile machines, arms and ammunition, and costume
jewellery. Imports centre mainly on coffee, fruit and spices.

**EL SALVADOR**

Economic relations with El Salvador are without any problems. Trade has been
noticeably increasing during the past few years and El Salvador has become one of
the significant trade partners of the Czech Republic in Latin America. In 2000, mutual
trade reached a turnover of 2.6 billion CZK; Czech exports amounted to 680.1 million
CZK and imports to 1.9 billion CZK. Czech exports included tantalum, metal


-----

processing machines and equipment while imports centred on electrical condensers.
The Czech participation in the trade fair in San Salvador could well give a fresh
impetus to promoting mutual trade.

**HONDURAS**

Economic and trade relations between the Czech Republic and Honduras are
without any major problems. In 2000, mutual trade amounted to a turnover of
176.9 million CZK; Czech exports were worth 29.7 million CZK and imports
147.2 million CZK. The Czech Republic exports to Honduras mainly various
industrial products, energy equipment, and electrical appliances. The main import
commodity is coffee.

**PANAMA**

Economic and trade relations with Panama are without major problems. In 2000,
mutual trade amounted to a turnover of 396.7 million CZK; Czech exports amounted
to 116.0 million CZK, imports to 280.7 million CZK. Deputy Minister of
Foreign Affairs H. Kmoníček opened a Czech Trade Publicity Office during a visit to
the country in February 2000. The Czech Republic exports to Panama mainly glass
and glassware, textile products, iron, and steel. Škoda automobiles reappeared on the
Panamian market in October 2000. Panama exports to the Czech Republic raw hide
and leather products, bananas and other tropical fruits and nuts.

**NICARAGUA**

The volume of trade has been very low in recent years. In 2000, mutual trade
turnover amounted to a mere 105.4 million CZK; Czech exports amounted to
6.8 million CZK, imports to 98.6 million CZK. The Czech Republic exports to
Nicaragua mainly motors and parts for leather processing machines while the only
imports are coffee.

_Bilateral Agreements concluded in 2000_

– An agreement on abolishing visas for holders of diplomatic and service passports.

_Cultural relations_

Cultural relations are limited by the geographic distance and by a shortage of
financial resources. The presentation of Czech culture in the countries of Central
America is determined by events organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the
Czech Republic or rather by the Czech Embassy responsible for the region with its


-----

seat in San Jose, Costa Rica. It has nevertheless been possible to arrange an exhibition
“The Czech Republic at the Turn of the Millennium”.
Cultural and education contacts focus nowadays on scholarships granted to
students from all Central American countries. Every year, each of these countries is
offered one to two scholarships for a complete university education and for postgraduate studies in the Czech Republic.

## III. The Economic Dimension of Czech Foreign Policy

The fundamental strategic document of policy in external economic relations
is the statement of the Government of the Czech Republic of 12 August, 1998. It states
the intention to create a pro-export policy, to draw up a concept of territorial policy, to
reinforce the significance of and expand commercial and trade representations at
embassies with the aim of creating a sense of balance in the trade balance which had
been developing unfavourably and, last but not least, of promoting the establishment
and expansion of foreign representations of the CzechTrade Agency, boosting exports.
The policy statement, the drafting of which was the direct and indirect task of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic and the Ministry of Industry and
Trade of the Czech Republic (under Act No. 2/1969, the so-called law of competence),
related to external economic relations, was further elaborated and put into concrete
terms set out in other conceptual documents.
The Agreement on Cooperation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the
Czech Republic and the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic in
Matters related to Implementing a Foreign Trade Policy (hereafter Agreement) of
8 October, 1998, is the fundamental document, which respects the relevant
jurisdiction of the two ministries. The Agreement was amended in October 2000 on
the basis of comments by the heads of the embassies and proposals by the two
ministries. The Agreement stipulates the principles to be applied in the selection and
training of candidates for the posts of managers in charge of trade and economic
sections at embassies and of other staff of trade and economic sections at embassies,
their assessment, and the financing of the activities of trade and economic sections;
it outlines the scope of the activities of the Permanent Working Group which is
a consultative body of the two ministers.
In 2000, the creation of fundamental material and personnel conditions was shared
between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry and Trade. This
was to enable the extended network of trade and economic sections at embassies to
meet the demand of the Ministry of Industry and Trade that by 2001 the trade and
economy department every embassy world 130 diplomats. These diplomats should
operate in approximatelly 100 countries and concentrate exclusively on economic
problems. During the period mentioned, the trade and economy sections had a staff
of 106 while a further 25 were given combined tasks, part of which were economic
agendas.


-----

In 2000, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs purchased KOMPASS database systems
on firms to ensure more adequate equipment of the trade and economic sections, and
subscribed to handbooks and economic reviews published by The Economist. It also
made financial contributions for export-promoting events organized by these
sections.
Representatives of the business community declared that the material, personnel,
and methodical improvement of trade and economic sections had done much to raise
the effectiveness of Czech economic diplomacy. This will remain the crucial priority
also in 2001. Improved cooperation between trade and economic sections and the
CzechTrade Agency should help to ensure this.
When assessing the economic dimension of foreign policy, one must not overlook
the activities of non-profit organizations coming under the jurisdiction of the two
ministries, i.e. the Czech Centre Administration, CzechTrade Agency, and CzechInvest.
The Czech Centre Administration, falling under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is
responsible also for the “www.export.cz” website, which contains a summary of
territorial information, reports on public tenders and topical requirements put forward
by territories, prepared by individual trade and economy sectors at embassies and
Czech Centres. The number of the website visitors is steadily rising. A total of
seventeen Czech Centres arranged 261 projects in the field of external economic
relations in 2000 in collaboration with trade and economic sections. These projects
enabled several hundred Czech firms to introduce themselves abroad. An agreement
on cooperation between the CzechTrade Agency and the Czech Centre Administration
was concluded on 20 January, 2000. The objective is to collect and process
information on the preparation and organization of seminars at home and abroad.
Under the Government resolution No. 259 of 15 March, 2000, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Industry and Trade
concluded an accord on 3 October, 2000, on Principles of Cooperation between the
State and the Defence Industry. The accord is directed primarily towards territories
where there is a trade and economic section alongside a military and air force attaché.
But all other embassies will apply the agreed forms of cooperation and presentation
of products of the Czech defence industry.

## IV. Human Rights in the Foreign Policy of the Czech Republic

**Activities in the negotiation sphere**

Human rights represent one of the priorities of Czech foreign policy. In the
process of defending and promoting them the Czech Republic is committed in many
specific spheres, whether in its approach to certain countries or regions. Domestic
activities carried out in collaboration with the government representatives for human
rights, by the Government Council for Human Rights and by the Government Council
for Nationalities equally significant.
The rights of ethnic minorities (with a view to the Roma community), the rights of
women and of children, and the problem of refugees are all of key significance for
Czech foreign policy in the area of human rights.
The Czech Republic has underscored the European dimension of the Roma
problem. An appropriate solution has been explored within international structures
(UN, OSCE and the Council of Europe).
The third and fourth Periodical Report of the Czech Republic on the way
commitments arising from the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
Discrimination is being implemented was discussed in the United Nations in August
2000. The discussion focused on general issues, the history of the Roma in the Czech
Republic, the question of assimilation and integration, the situation in Maticni Street
and the mosque in Brno, the education of members of the Roma community in the
context of special schools, the punishment of race-motivated criminal offences and
those committed by extremist groups, the position of refugees and applicants for
asylum. The Czech Republic provided information on its approach to the solution of
all these problems.
Art. 14 of the Convention which recognizes the authority of the Committee on
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to accept complaints by individuals or
groups on the violation of the rights set out in the Convention by a Contracting
Party was a major step towards the elimination of racial discrimination in the Czech
Republic.
The Czech Republic submitted two of its own draft resolutions to the Commission
on Human Rights in the spring of 2000; it was the resolution on thematic procedures
and on the situation of human rights in Cuba. Negotiations on the resolution on
human rights in Cuba, which the Czech delegation had submitted for the second time


-----

alongside the Polish delegation, were complicated. The point was to reach an
agreement on whether to include in the text a so-called economic terminology, in
other words, whether to show disapproval for the economic sanctions. A compromise
version, noting the violation of human rights in Cuba and inadequate progress made
in abolishing this violation was adopted by 21 votes against 18, in other words, with
a better result than in 1999.
The second resolution submitted emphasizes the significance of thematic
procedures in the Comission on Human Rights. It calls on governments to cooperate
in providing prompt replies and in extending invitations for visits of the Commission’s
mechanisms. The resolution also suggests that special rapporteurs, special
representatives, experts, and working groups submit recommendations on ways and
means of forestalling the violation of human rights. Their reports should note any
progress made by individual states. The resolution was adopted by a consensus. This
resolution, sponsored by the Czech Republic, was followed by a permanent invitation
extended to all thematic mandates of the Commission. In the Third Committee of the
fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, the Czech Republic called on the other
countries to extend such an invitation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic is responsible for the
application of international and regional standards in human rights, mainly in
creating national norms. It collaborates with national institutions, especially the
Government Council on Human Rights, in drawing up national reports on
implementation of the commitments arising from international and regional human
rights treaties.
The Czech Republic takes an active part in the process of reforming the UN Treaty
Bodies, which at present is taking place on a rather informal level. The aim is to
improve the quality of the Treaty Bodies, eliminating duplication of procedures and
last, but not least, eliminating the overburdening of individual Treaty Bodies due to
the increasing number of contracting parties.
Human rights are among the three items high on the agenda of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). In April 2000, the High Commissioner
for National Minorities published a report on the position of the Roma minority in
OSCE Member States, which also deals with extremism, racism, and intolerance and
contains relevant recommendations. At a seminar of experts about the report, held in
Bratislava in June 2000, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic
presented the latest steps taken by the Government of the Czech Republic towards
mitigating shortcomings in the position of the Roma in the Czech Republic. One of
the results of the Bratislava Initiative was another seminar on the subject “Political
Participation of the Roma”, held in Prague in December 2000 in cooperation
between the OSCE ODIHR and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech
Republic.


-----

At OSCE implementation meeting in Warsaw on the human dimension, held in
October 2000, the representative of the Czech Republic underscored the problem of
racism and extremism as one of the priorities of the Government of the Czech
Republic; this was demonstrated, for example, by the concept of the Government’s
policy vis-a`-vis the Roma population aimed at promoting its integration in society.
In the Council of Europe, the Czech Republic concentrated on solving the Roma
problem within concrete and substantive projects. In October 2000, the Advisory
Committee of the Council of Europe on the Framework Convention for the Protection
of National Minorities visited the Czech Republic to investigate the application of
commitments arising from the agreement signed by the Czech Republic. In October
2000, the Government of the Czech Republic approved a proposal to sign the
European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages. This aims basically at
protecting and promoting historical regional and minority languages striving for the
guaranteed use of a regional or minority language in both private and public life,
thereby preserving and promoting traditions and the European cultural heritage. In
October 2000, the Government of the Czech Republic approved the signing of
Protocol No. 12 to the European Convention on Human Rights.
In its relations with the European Union, the Czech Republic continued to use this
forum within the bodies established on the basis of the agreement on association. In
this respect, the Czech Republic takes advantage of these opportunities in
implementing its foreign policy, including the protection of human rights. Speaking
on the creation of a tolerant and multi-cultural society, the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Kavan addressed the association council and proposed the opening of an all-European
debate aimed at creating and exchanging well-tried procedures, especially in attitudes
towards the Roma population; this is a concept of the so-called Europeanization.
These procedures would offer solutions for various problematic areas of interest, such
as racial discrimination, housing, education and the political participation of members
of the Roma population.

**Activities in the contractual sphere**

Great progress has been made in the area of the rights of children. In March
2000, the Czech Republic presented the second periodical report to the High
Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva on the implementation of the provisions
of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The report covers the period
between 1995 and 1999. In May 2000, the Czech Republic deposited in New York an
instrument on endorsing the amendment of Art. 43, par. 2 of the Convention, which
increases the number of members of the Committee on the Rights of the Child from


-----

ten to eighteen. In October 2000, President Havel, while attending the Millennium
Summit in New York, signed the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights
of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflicts. The Optional Protocol
raises the age limit for direct participation in combat and for the mandatory
participation of children in armed forces from 15 to 18. The Czech Republic is
a “model” country with regard to the Protocol since the country’s legislation forbids
even voluntary participation in armed forces below the age of 18. In the sphere of
international private law, the Czech Republic ratified the Hague Convention on the
Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption in
January 2000. In February 2000, it ratified the Hague Convention on Jurisdiction,
Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in respect of Parental
Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children.
The visit by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Ms. Sadako Ogata in the
Czech Republic in February 2000 was a significant event. She visited the Czech
Republic on the occasion of signing of a treaty between the Office of the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Czech Republic on the legal status of
the UNHCR and its staff in the Czech Republic in light of the transfer of the UNHCR
Liaison Office to the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic undertook to support the
activities of the UNHCR and signed an agreement to this effect. The High
Commissioner said she was pleased with the situation in the Czech Republic and
praised the new Asylum Law. She also recognized the progress which the Czech
Republic had made in its approach to refugees over the past ten years, as well as the
approach and the role of state in integrating foreign nationals into society. Both sides
regarded the visit most favourably. For the Czech Republic, it was an open
contribution especially in connection with the persisting problem of submitting
asylum applications, mainly in economically advanced countries.
In the Council of Europe, the process of involvement of the Czech Republic in its
treaty system continued with the ratification of two agreements referring to the rights
of children: in March 2000, the European Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Decisions concerning Custody of Children and on Restoration of
Custody of Children, and in October 2000, the European Convention on the Adoption
of Children. In April 2000, the Czech Republic signed the European Convention on
the Legal Status of Extra-Marital Children and the European Convention on the
Exercise of Children’s Rights.
As for the rights of refugees and the rights of foreign nationals, the Czech Republic
acceded to the European Agreement on Transfer of Responsibility for Refugees. This
accord follows up on the United Nations Convention on the Legal Status of Refugees,
which guarantees them the right to freedom of movement and to travel document
issuance. The Convention expands this right depending on the place of residence of
the refugee in such a way that it determines the conditions under which the


-----

contracting parties are compelled to issue the refugees a travel document, even if they
have been granted the status of refugee in another state. In July 2000, the Czech
Republic also adhered to the Convention on the Participation of Foreign Nationals in
Public Life at Local Level. This is one of the most up-to-date agreements of the
Council of Europe which reacts to the greater mobility of individuals in the European
area by guaranteeing resident citizens rights which are historically tied to state
citizenship, i.e. political rights.

## V. Foreign Cultural Policy of the Czech Republic

**1. The presentation of the Czech Republic**
**and its culture abroad**

A series of factors share in presenting the image of the Czech Republic; but
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic is able to influence these only
to a limited degree. The domain of culture is a significant instrument of foreign policy
and is an important factor in presenting the Czech Republic abroad. It helps to create
and strengthen its positive image. The cultural dimension of foreign policy is an
inseparable component of diplomacy and is an instrument of the foreign policy of the
Czech Republic in incorporating it into the context of commonly shared democratic
values and cultural traditions in achieving the political and economic interests of the
country.
The presentation of the Czech Republic in cultural terms takes account of political
and economic interests. Every attempt is made to join prestigious multilateral projects
in the course of which bilateral interests can be placed in a context in which the Czech
Republic is perceived as a serious partner and also as an intermediary for the cultural
heritage and contemporary culture and art. In the light of the clear vision of the
accession of the Czech Republic to the EU, culture becomes a substantial link with
other countries; it also provides scope for the achievement of Czech interests abroad.
Among the major objectives of foreign cultural policy is the creation of an
objective image of the Czech Republic abroad, the presentation of the cultural wealth
in its entirety and variety as well as the promotion of direct contacts between foreign
and domestic institutions in the field of culture. The presentation of the Czech
Republic not only as a country with a significant cultural heritage but also as the
author of new cultural values has been a target on which the activities of the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic have concentrated in 2000 in the field of
culture. Attention has been devoted to increasing contacts with Czech artists and art
institutions or to supporting and exploring contacts with the aim of enhancing and
expanding cultural relations.
The variety of events in 2000 included all aspects of art; special attention was
devoted to painting, sculpture, music, films and literature. The individual projects
were mainly presented as independent events, but where this was suitable and
possible, exhibitions were accompanied by the screening of corresponding Czech


-----

films, concerts of Czech music were given at the opening of exhibitions, there were
book-reading sessions by authors at book exhibitions, etc. Various projects were
appraised and prepared with a strong emphasis on quality and on the ability to address
the widest public in a specific country. EXPO 2000 at Hanover was a unique event.
Special attention concentrated on the preparation of cultural events in different
territories with a view to their specific features. Special care was given to the
preparation of projects in Central and West European countries. Everything was done
to present the Czech Republic as a future member state of the EU. Relations with
these countries embrace a host of cultural contacts at different levels, which provide
for a busy exchange of values, but what matters most is to address the broadest
possible audience.
The constant shortage of financial resources is a limiting factor in the presentation
of Czech culture, which has not permitted the organization of major cultural events of
the size and quality, which could be achieved. That is why exploring and ensuring the
assistance of suitable sponsors abroad and in the Czech Republic with maximum
emphasis on the professional and social prestige of the institutions contacted, is an
important aspect in arranging cultural programmes.

**2. EXPO 2000 in Hannover**

The world fair EXPO 2000 took place between 1 June–31 October, 2000.
The Czech Republic presented itself successfully with its own pavilion, a rich
programme and considerable publicity, especially in the media abroad.
The Czech pavilion welcomed 1.3 million visitors, on record days almost 20,000
while the daily capacity had been originally estimated at 3,000 persons a day. In June,
between 3,000–5,000 visitors came to the Czech pavilion, while in October their
number had risen to an average of 12,000 a day. The total number of those who had
come to see the Czech exhibition amounted to over 1.3 million. Additional tens of
thousands visited the Czech restaurant, the Czech store, and information centre, or
watched some of the regional and cultural programmes.
A Czech Day was organized on 7 June, only a few days after the opening; it was
attended by an official delegation, led by Prime Minister Zeman.
Other Government officials visited the fair during the later days as well as several
groups of Deputies and hundreds of Czech mayors and representatives of the regions.
The Czech pavilion welcomed large numbers of personalities from abroad.
Symbolically, the first was the Slovak Minister of the Economy Harach, followed by
Polish President Kwasniewski, Hungary’s Prime Minister Orban, the Croatian Prime


-----

Minister Racan, the former Mexican President de la Madrid, the Vatican
representatives for the Holy Year 2000 Cardinal Etchegarray, the Vatican Foreign
Minister Tauran, Slovak Prime Minister Dzurinda, the Estonian Prime Minister
Laar, the European Commissioner for Enlargement Verheugen, and many more.
Among the German guests were R. Klimmt, the Federal Minister of Transport and
Housing Riester, the Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Henkel, the
Chairman of the influential Union of German Industry, and Cardinal Meissner from
Cologne.
On the Day of the Environment on September 1, the Minister of Environment
Kužvart presented three ecological projects in the Czech pavilion, which won the
prize of World EXPO 2000 Projects. One was a project by the North Bohemian
Waterworks Company, entitled Healthy Towns and Centre for Cleaner Production.
Czech and Moravian regions presented themselves in the Czech pavilion. The first
ones to introduce themselves were Velke Losiny and the Jesenik region, followed by
Valassko, Moravian Slovakia, and East Bohemia. These “days of the regions” always
included a music programme, exhibitions of folk hand crafts and the tasting of local
specialities.
On International Children’s Day on September 20, visitors admired Czech wooden
toys and puzzles. A large wooden chessboard outside the pavilion was also very
successful.
The Czech pavilion and its management staff were introduced in the Czech and in
the German media, for example, on the ARD, ZDF, SAT 1, Deutsche Welle, MDR,
WDR television channels. The NDR channel (part of ARD) broadcasted three live
programmes of regional line-ups (a Valassky weekend, an ecological day, wine
harvest). The General Commissioner of the Czech Participation Bartuska, together
with the then Federal Secretary for Culture Naumann, were the guests of a television
programme on the Phoenix TV station on 3 October, the tenth anniversary of German
reunification.
At the otherwise non-political EXPO, the Czech pavilion arranged two “political”
events: a concert to mark the 32[nd] anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion (21 August,
1968) and, together with the Slovak pavilion, a Czechoslovak Day on 28 October under
the slogan “In honour of a state that exists no longer, but is still alive in our memory”.
Artists, musicians, singers who performed in the rich cultural programme in the
Czech pavilion and on other stages included E. Urbanova, K. Gott, V. Hudecek,
J. Stivin, J. Cerny, V. Brabec, I Bittova, J. Pavlica with the Hradistan folk ensemble,
M. Eben, the Prague Original Music Theatre, Virtuosi Quartet, children’s choirs,
brass bands and classical music orchestras. Altogether, some 1,500 artists performed
at the cultural events of the Czech Republic.
After the many earlier ambiguities and delays, the Czech participation in the EXPO
2000 world fair was relatively successful. This was due not only to the large number


-----

of visitors but also to the predominantly positive response in the media abroad to the
cultural and regional programmes. It is worth mentioning that the response abroad
was far more favourable than that in the Czech Republic.

**3. Media and information,**
**the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic**
**website**

The September 2000 Annual Meeting of the Boards of Governors of the IMF
and the World Bank in Prague attracted attention from more distant countries. Although
the proceedings were widely reported in the media, especially the unprecedented
discussions between the opponents of globalisation with representatives of the world
finance institutions, the greatest attention was paid (especially by the electronic media)
to the violent clashes of the demonstrators with the police. Although the acts of violence
by the demonstrators were evident and initially, for the most part, the media appreciated
the successful intervention by the Czech police, later reports noted blunders committed
during the investigation of demonstrators detained by the Czech police.
The media also paid attention to a new law on the presence of foreign nationals on
the territory of the Czech Republic, which contained a series of inaccuracies, apart
from objective information. But our embassies gradually clarified these inaccuracies;
however, the media in countries with which visa-free travel had been abolished
reacted in a similar manner (the Russian Federation, Belarus, Ukraine); all in all, it
was evident that in these countries an attempt was made to be objective and show
a deeper understanding for various aspects of mutual relations.
Among topics that aroused media interest abroad was the Temelin nuclear power
plant. The Austrian and German media, above all, criticized the test operation of the
nuclear power plant. When comparing the reaction in our two neighbouring countries,
it becomes evident that despite certain adverse commentaries, the German media
featured more objective information about the Czech Republic. The situation in
Czech Television was clearly reflected in foreign reporting as late as early in 2001.
The issue of human rights, including the Romany question, was viewed less
critically than during the previous year. In some instances, the Czech Republic was
presented as a country where work is successfully in progress to solve Romany
problems. Czech sportsmen and sportswomen, as well as representatives of the
cultural community did a lot to present a favourable image of the Czech Republic
abroad: the Skoda car factory is most frequently mentioned as an example of the
success of Czech industry.


-----

In 2000, the Czech Republic was often mentioned as one of the favorite countries
for admission to the European Union. Reports about fundamental characteristics, the
state of negotiations and the results which the Czech Republic has attained in
connection with the enlargement of the Europen Union were also registered in EU
countries, where the Czech Republic is not in the centre of public attention and
reports about it are infrequent.
In Europe, it is generally only a joint article by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of
the Czech Republic Kavan and reports dealing with the European country concerned,
reflecting important political issues, which meets with any considerable response and
is seen as an interesting contribution to the discussion on the future of Europe,
especially the European Union. The same applies generally also to declarations by
other top Government representatives whenever they deal with international
problems and topics frequently discussed in the countries concerned.
Bilateral relations and official or even working visits by state representatives are
given pride of place in the presentation of the Czech Republic in the media in various
parts of the world. It has become a tradition that the personality who is given the
greatest attention is President Havel, who attracts the interest and attention of the
media in territories where as a rule there is hardly any mention of the Czech Republic;
these reports are mostly items taken over from world news agencies.
As the Internet has expanded, the importance of information accessible to the
public directly, without the intermediary of the media has become far more
significant. Moreover, the new Act No. 106/1999 on Free Access to Information has
come into force. Consequently, the opening of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the
Czech Republic to the public at large marked the year 2000.
On 1 January, 2000, a homepage of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech
Republic was launched (www.mzv.cz). The section dealing with presentation on the
Internet within the Press Department is responsible for the technical and operational
part of the material, i.e. processing, classification, upgrading, correction and
complementing all the information due to be presented by individual sections of the
Ministry. The corresponding specialized sector of the Ministry, dealing with a specific
subject, is the guarantor and supplier of the content of these texts. The Press
Department draws up a section of the content: documentation of contact activities,
press reports and statements, material from press conferences and photographic
documentation.
The homepage contains basic archive documents, current reports, addresses of
Czech embassies, as well as of foreign embassies accredited in the Czech Republic,
information on the organizational structure of the Ministry and the names of its senior
officials with some basic personal information about them. The Consular Section
offers information for Czech citizens on conditions of entry and stay in 130 countries
worldwide. The website further features press statements by the Ministry of Foreign


-----

Affairs of the Czech Republic, as well as positions and announcements, which are
passed on to news agencies for publication. The website can be used for access to
original and full texts provided directly by the Ministry and not through a news
agency, which in some cases could be inaccurate or incomplete. The information
featured on the Ministry’s homepage also serves those interested to obtain
information under Act No. 106/99 on Free Access to Information.
The structure of the information available on the Internet website of the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs is being systematically expanded with information about
possibilities of employment in the diplomatic service, reviews of humanitarian
activities and assistance, information on security strategy and policy, replies by the
press spokesman and others. Information on all embassies, including information
about their senior officials, office hours for the public and on their responsibilities has
been completed.
The homepage of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs facilitates the simple search of
the homepages of other state institutions of the Czech Republic and of foreign
ministries worldwide.
In keeping with the spirit of a public information system a section of the website
has been created, known as _Formular, where one can find application forms for_
requests to be submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by citizens or institutions
A modified English version of the homepage of the Ministry was made accessible
in the middle of 2000. Alongside selected information, gradually translated from the
Czech version, the English version contains an additional section “The Czech
Republic and the European Union”. It contains a multitude of extensive documents
(at times several hundred pages) about the history, relations and the progress of the
association of the Czech Republic with the European Union. In the Czech version
these documents are presented in a separate project, Euroskop (www.euroskop.cz).
Pages of the Czech embassies are gradually added to the structure of the web.
“WAP” pages of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been made available in May
2000 (wap.mzv.cz). They give access via mobile terminals, especially mobile
telephones. They contain a succinct selection of information taken from the www
pages, to be exact, information useful for Czech citizens travelling abroad, listed in
various sections, changes in visa requirements, personal security, local conditions and
adaptations, lists of countries with visa-free travel plus a brief announcement on the
possibilities of supplying information via the Section of Public Information of the
Press Department, including contact data.
In 2000, the volume of published information increased more than five times.
Between January 2000 and January 2001, the number of visits to the website rose
more than nine times; the number of pages scanned in January 2001 was 383,000,
compared to 42,000 in January 2000. The volume of data made accessible is more
than eleven times higher.


-----

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs devoted great attention to the implementation of
Act No. 106/1999 on Free Access to Information. A directive on the procedure for
dealing governs information made accessible under this law with applications for
information and on the duties of individual sectors and officials. A Section of Public
Information has been established as part of the Press Department of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs which is responsible not only for carrying out the tasks arising from
the law mentioned, but the possibilities of a more open access to the public have
already been tested on several projects.
On March 1, 2000, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs published its annual report for
2000 on information provided under law Act 106/1999 in its valid version. The large
number of requests received and an analysis of the subjects on which information is
requested make it clear that the public in the Czech Republic and abroad closely
follow the foreign policy of the country. Requests for information cover a wide
spectrum of subjects such as those of a trade and economic nature, culture, education
and expatriates, the coordination of relations between the Czech Republic and the EU,
human rights and the position of ethnic minorities, refugees, asylum granting,
including consular and visa questions, the implementation of international treaties
and foreign development and humanitarian assistance by the Czech Republic.
Providing public information is closely linked with the Internet presentation of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Information is also provided on the way of obtaining
information via the Internet as well as at other places where it is possible to find
information on the foreign policy and activities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(for example, the communication strategy prior to the accession of the Czech
Republic to the EU).
The Section of Public Information organizes seminars of senior officials of the
Ministry with secondary school students on current aspects of the foreign policy of
the Czech Republic. A competition for students of elementary schools has been
arranged in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and UNICEF to test the
knowledge of the students and possibly for them to submit artistic work.

**4. Foreign language broadcasts on Czech Radio**

Foreign broadcasts are managed by Czech Radio 7 Radio Praha, commissioned
by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic under Act No. 468/1991 on
the regulation of radio and television broadcasts, and under subsequent versions of
regulations in accordance with Act No. 103/1992 on the Council for Radio and
Television Broadcasting and in accordance with subsequent regulations, as well as
in accordance with the decision of the Government of the Czech Republic No. 573 of


-----

10 September 1997. In this Act, the Government of the Czech Republic gave its
consent for broadcasts abroad to be run by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. An
agreement has been concluded between Czech Radio and the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs on running and operating radio broadcasts abroad.
Foreign broadcasts offer professional and objective information on political,
economic, cultural and social developments in the Czech Republic. Czech Radio
is responsible for the content of broadcasts, their objective and balanced character.
A Consultative Council for Foreign Broadcasts was formed as a consultative body of
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and appointed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs; its
function is supervising and consultative. In 2000, the Consultative Council, which
meets every three months, examined the proper application of the agreement between
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Czech Radio, above all, whether the financial
resources earmarked by the state budget for foreign broadcasts are being used with
expediency and effectively and whether the programme criteria are being observed. It
paid special attention to expatriate communities abroad, as well as to alternative
forms of broadcasting as recommended by the Consultative Council. This applied
first and foremost to the use of the Internet, satellite transmissions, and international
cooperation when stations abroad are using programmes of Radio Prague.
Radio Prague participates in the satellite system of the World Radio Network
(WRN) in Europe and North America with five 30-minute programmes a day, two in
English, and one each in German, Spanish, and Czech. It intends to start satellite
programmes also in French and Russian, but WRN has so far not started to operate
the frequencies for these languages. The significance of satellite broadcasting does
not consist merely in the fact that a listener is able to tune in to a programme via
satellite, but also because WRN supplies entire broadcasting channels or parts thereof
to other broadcasting networks in Western Europe and the USA (FM and cable)
which adds more listeners to Radio Prague. Satellite broadcasting is important also
for relaying to remoter short wave transmitters (for example, Radio Miami) which is
another way of improving the quality of reception.
International cooperation is of exceptional importance. Radio Praha regularly
prepares programmes for the expatriate stations in Croatia, Romania, and Australia,
less regularly for certain stations in North and South America and it also prepares
special programmes for Czech embassies and consulates. The foreign broadcasts
section also participates in an exchange of programmes and co-productions in
collaboration with the BBC, RFI, Deutsche Welle and Radio Polonia.
The foreign broadcasts are prepared by individual sections in English, German,
French, Spanish, and Czech and, as of the end of October 2000, also in Russian. At
the end of 2000, daily foreign broadcasts consisted of 7 hours in English, 6 hours in
Czech, 4 hours in Spanish, 3 hours in French, 2 hours in German and 1.5 hours in
Russian – a total of 23.5 hours a day.


-----

The foreign broadcasts have something to offer also to listeners on the territory of
the Czech Republic: broadcasts are targeted at foreign nationals visiting the Czech
Republic or English-speaking residents. It is possible to tune in to programmes in
English on weekdays on FM on the Prague frequency of the BBC on 101.1 FM in
Prague and in Central Bohemia. The programmes consist mainly of cultural, tourist
and economic information from Prague and the regions. FM broadcasts within the
country have been a trend that has gained popularity in recent years owing to the
greater mobility of people. The response to these transmissions is most positive.
The foreign broadcast radio station offers a voice and text version of its
transmissions on the Internet which it has been using since 1994 as one of the first
Czech media (www.radio.cz); these Internet transmissions are supplemented by
specific services. The voice version transmits live programmes as RealAudio and
individual language broadcasts in the MP3 format. The text is in graphics and
illustrated to meet the requirements of modern computer graphics; it is currently
supplemented by additional information and references to partner organizations.
Other services are offered as well such as transmitting news on the Internet and so
forth. Radio Prague is steadily expanding its services.
One can only guess the audibility of Radio Praha on the basis of listeners’ reports
and visits on the Internet website. According to a poll by the European Broadcasting
Union, Radio Prague is one of five stations in Europe, which for financial reasons is
unable to administer listening surveys. In 2000, the various foreign broadcast sections
received almost 13,000 letters from which it is evident that listeners of transmissions
are following events in the Czech Republic with great interest. The average number
of those browsing the Internet website is 100,000 page hits a month. For example,
listeners reacted to the results of the Senate and regional elections, to integration
endeavours by the Czech Republic especially in the light of the French presidency of
the EU, or they discussed the subject of the Temelin nuclear power plant on which
they are sending in their views and questions. Many letters referred to the death of
Emil Zatopek. Transmissions in Russian were very well received and both the content
and structure of programmes meet with positive response.
In 2000, foreign broadcasts had at their disposal 64 million CZK. Because of the
later commencement of transmissions in the Russian language the total budget was
reduced by 2 million CZK.

**5. Czech Centres**

The task of the Administration of Czech Centres and of the Czech Centres
as such – under the terms of the new Statute of the Administration, approved on
28 December, 2000 – is to assist the presentation of the Czech Republic abroad,


-----

especially in the field of culture, trade and tourism, providing a high-quality
information service about the Czech Republic and promote external economic
relations. The Czech Centres are non-profit organizations of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of the Czech Republic and most of their activities are financed from the
budget of the Ministry. The Czech Centres adapt their activities to the situation in the
country where they function and to the objectives of the foreign policy of the Czech
Republic in specific countries. They coordinate their work with the embassies in
specific countries, possibly with representatives of partner organizations. At the end
of 2000, there were 17 Czech Centres, of these 16 in Europe, including nine in
member states of the European Union, and one in the United States. In 2000, one
centre was added to the network in Munich, which started to function in the autumn
of 2000.
Despite attempts by the Administration of the Czech Centres to clarify their tasks
in presenting the Czech Republic abroad, the public at home frequently regards the
Czech Centres as purely cultural institutions. A Consultative Council of the
Administration was set up in the second half of 2000 with the objective of making the
work of the Administration more effective and more open. Its members are
representatives of ministries cooperating with the Centres, as well as of non-profit
organizations collaborating with these ministries, of cultural and commercial
organizations and the media. The Consultative Council shares in the overall strategy
and activities of the Administration, it submits its views on the territorial expansion
of the Centres and the coordination of foreign cooperation of individual ministries,
and on the way the finances of the Administration are being used, to the annual report
on their activities and the annual programme.
In 2000, the Administration focused its attention on a number of measures to
simplify the running of the entire organization and making it more transparent. New
statutes have been adopted and all main codes and regulations have been updated or
newly formulated. By 31 December, 2000, 46 officials with a contract have been
working at these Centres abroad, specially sent there for this purpose; of these 9 were
there on behalf of partner organizations and there was a staff of 70 local employees,
of these two from partner organizations. Certain Czech Centres have to struggle with
a shortage of staff; many have only one member of staff. As opposed to 1999, the
contribution from the state budget was reduced by approximately 11 million, which
resulted in a number of austerity measures and in attempts to obtain funds from other
sources. It has, nevertheless, been possible to maintain the extent of activities in all
fields at the level of the previous year and in some cases even improve their quality,
for example, by taking advantage of the Internet.
Czech Centres prepare a rich cultural programme every month motivated by the
desire to present to the public all aspects of Czech traditional and contemporary
culture. In preparing their plans for programmes, the Czech Centres collaborate with


-----

a number of significant professional institutions and individuals. They frequently
arrange their cultural programmes in cooperation with Czech and foreign cultural
institutions.
Noteworthy events in 2000 included a festival of contemporary Czech films, The
Velvet Generation, in London, a tour by I. Kral to Moscow and Kiev, Days of Czech
Culture in Dresden, guest performances by the Prague Spring in Sofia, the multimedia
project “Franz Kafka, the European” prepared by the Czech Centre in Bratislava,
a concert and participation of I. Kelarova at the Roma festival in Romania,
a reading session by L. Rainerova in Munich, Czech Independence Day 2000 – an
83[rd] Street Block Party in New York, a travelling exhibition “The World in the Eyes
of the Roma” in Scandinavian cities, a concert by the Sum Svistu band as part of the
Festival of Music in Berlin, a charity exhibition “The Road of the Small Cloud
Dragon” in Brussels, “Days of Prague in Vienna”, a reading session by L. Vaculik in
Poland, an exhibition “Prints of Prague Architecture in Clothing Designs” in Paris, an
exhibition “Czech Vanguard Photography” in Budapest, a Christmas tour by the
Capella Regia in the Netherlands, a travelling exhibition “Czech Press Photo 1999”,
installed at most Czech Centres, and other.
In the cultural field, the Czech Centres act as an intermediary for arranging services
and contacts with various institutions, the foreign presentation of cultural events
arranged in the Czech Republic, the lending of Czech literature, etc.
In the educational field, Czech Centres arrange lectures and seminars, they
organize or participate in the organization of courses in the Czech language; in this
they have close contacts with foreign and Czech universities and language schools as
well as with the Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic.
Interesting events in 2000 included, for example, the Stories Exchange Seminar –
an exchange of stories related to the search of paths leading to open communication
between people of different cultures. It was arranged by the Czech Centre in London.
Or there was an exhibition on the recultivation of Northern Bohemia, entitled “The
transformation of a moonscape”, arranged by the Czech Centre in Dresden.
In the promotion of external economic relations, especially Czech exports and
tourism, Czech Centres cooperate with non-profit organizations of the Ministry of
Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic – (CzechTrade Agency, CzechInvest) and
the Ministry for Local Development of the Czech Republic (Czech Tourism Centre),
chambers of commerce, the Association of Industry and Transport, and trade unions.
They use specialized material issued by these organizations. Czech Centres further
participate in some events organized by these institutions, for example, a project of
the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic Business Centre 2000 at the
International Engineering Fair in Brno or at a specialized seminar on State Promotion
of Export, organized by CzechTrade. On the basis of agreements with the relevant
non-profit organizations, the representation of CzechTrade in London acts as part of


-----

the Czech Centre, and the representation of the CzechInvest agency works with the
Czech Centres in London and Paris and in The Hague, while the Czech Centre for
Tourism cooperates with the Czech Centres in London, Moscow, New York, Paris,
and Vienna.
Czech Centres offer those interested in export facilities for presenting their firms
abroad (including assistance services) and brokering important contacts and topical
information on potential countries for their exports. Foreign parties are given general
information by Czech Centres on matters pertaining to the economy and trade,
including arranging contacts with institutions and organizations in the Czech
Republic. Czech Centres also offer the free publication of demands and tenders on the
Internet website www.export.cz. Commercial information on various countries,
compiled by trade and economic sections of embassies are available on the website.
As in previous years, the number of those browsing the website has been rising
steadily. In its attempt to make information on demands and tenders as well as on
significant contacts for the wide public, the Administration of the Czech Centres has
established cooperation with a number of periodicals, featuring this type of
information.
Alongside the presentation of various firms, events like the “Czech Days” or
“Czech Weeks” are meeting with the greatest response. These projects are interesting
mainly because of the scope of the presentation spectrum, since one event can provide
opportunity for presentig culture, tourism, as well as trade opportunities. These events
usually involve embassies as well, together with specialized agencies and city and
district authorities. The most interesting of these were Czech Days in Kaposvar in
Hungary, Göteborg in Sweden, or in Brussels and the Czech Week in Wijk bij
Durstejde in the Netherlands.
Czech Centres also offer a wide range of information in relation to tourism, for
example, on transport facilities, on accommodation, on the use of leisure time. They
distribute propaganda material on towns and regions. In 2000, the Czech Centres
were represented at the national tourism fair TNT in Bucharest and at the Trade Expo
in Westchester (New York Czech Centre). The Administration of Czech Centres and
the Czech Centres themselves respect the expanding foreign network and mission of
partner organizations and their activities in promoting exports and tourism in
individual territories and complement them in a suitable manner. In this context, the
administration of Czech Centres is preparing a catalogue of the services by the Czech
Centres which will be regularly updated and will be available on the Czech Centres
Internet website.
The Administration of Czech Centres provides basic information about the Czech
Republic also via the www.czech.cz Internet website. The number of the website’s
visitors increased in 2000. The Administration of Czech Centres has established
cooperation also with individual media, for example, with Czech Radio.

## VI. Expatriates

The Czech Republic is fully aware of the positive role played by many
expatriate Czechs during the post-war period in their efforts to support the democratic
movement of the former Czechoslovakia, as well as of the direct and indirect help
they offer nowadays in promoting the Czech Republic and in creating its positive
image abroad. The authenticity and often personal nature of these contacts,
independent of the political climate at a given moment of time, strengthens relations
between the Czech Republic and countries where expatriate Czechs happen to live.
The principles in relation to expatriates and friends of the Czech Republic abroad
proceed from the decision of the Government of the Czechoslovak Federal Republic
No. 375/1992. It comprises maintaining a regular information link and good relations
by the Czech Republic with expatriates abroad (records of expatriate associations,
conferring honours on eminent personalities, especially the Jan Masaryk Prize Gratias
Agit). Assistance to expatriates who apply for this in preserving their cultural,
linguistic, and historical association with the Czech Republic (scholarships, language
courses, sending teachers to expatriate communities) is also significant. In the same
way an adequately forthcoming approach to expectations demonstrated by various
expatriate communities in their relations with the Czech Republic (financial
contributions to specific projects, directed at popularising the Czech Republic) is also
important. Relations with expatriates consist moreover in attempts to preserve the
Czech cultural heritage abroad (help in repairing schools and cultural centres of
expatriate communities as part of the Czech Republic’s Development Aidscheme).
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, or its Department for
Cultural Relations and Czechs Living Abroad, cooperates with the Sub-Committee
for Contacts with Expatriates of the Committee for Foreign Affairs of the Chamber
of Deputies of the Parliament and with the Standing Senate Commission on
Compatriots Living Abroad, as well as with other sections of the state administration
which are affected by the varied spectrum of problems of expatriates. Cooperation
with a broad range of civic associations, friendship associations, foreign broadcasts
of Czech Radio and scientific institutions in the field of ethnography plays an
invaluable role – this list reveals the wide spectrum of the various aspects of
expatriate activities.
The usefulness of an exchange of opinions between representatives of Czechs at
home and abroad was confirmed by the Second Conference of Expatriates, held in the


-----

Prague Karolinum on 1–5 October, 2000. Its organization was entrusted to the
International Coordination Committee of Charles University with the support of the
relevant sections of the Chamber of Deputies, the Senate and the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of the Czech Republic. It was held under the auspices of President Havel.
There were four sections (legislative, political, economic; social; cultural; and
educational) that held a constructive and often lively discussion on many issues which
worried expatriates. Invited representatives of Ministry of Interior, Ministry of
Labour and Social Affairs, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Justice, the Director of
Foreign Broadcasts of Czech Radio, and representatives of the Náprstek Museum and
archives together with other institutions reacted to specific questions from
participants. This open discussion helped to clarify many positions.
The preparation of a new five-year cycle of assistance in keeping alive the Czech
language and cultural awareness of expatriates by means of scholarships, language
courses and the dispatch of teachers to expatriate communities became a major
landmark in 2000. After appraising the first cycle which took place in 1995–2000 and
which met with a great response among expatriates, another five-year cycle was
proposed under the terms of Government Decision No. 1306.This was a follow-up to
the positive contribution made by the first cycle and broadly widening opportunities
for expatriates in this sphere. The new cycle places emphasis on four-week summer
Czech language courses at Dobruška with a cultural and entertainment programme.
Their capacity has been increased from 40 to 60 places a year, while the number of
teachers sent to expatriate communities has been increased from 10 to 12 a year. On
the other hand, the reduction of semester stays from 20 to 15 places in favour of
summer courses was due to the interest shown by expatriates in these courses. In
2001–2005, almost 80 million CZK will be earmarked by the state budget for this
programme, e.g. 30 million more than on the first cycle.
In 2000, 40 expatriates from all over the world attended the courses at Dobruška –
from Uruguay to Canada, from South Africa to Finland. In the school year 2000–2001,
Czech teachers have been working in Australia, Croatia, Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, Romania and Ukraine, in other words in countries with large Czech
communities. Their job is not only to teach but to promote education as well – they
help associations in their folklore, music and drama activities.
In 2000, publication of a new expatriate periodical České listy was launched in the
autumn. By the end of the year, the periodical was being published every two months
and as of 2001 it will be published monthly. The periodical is to become a platform
for the broadest possible expatriate debate. The Editorial Council that consists of
representatives of the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic,
the Senate of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, the Office of the President of
the Republic and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, headed
by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Palouš, guarantees an aim to establish

a businesslike, unbiased exchange of views. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs covers
the distribution of more than 2000 copies of České listy free of charge among 320
expatriate associations; it is expected that individuals will take out subscriptions.
Financial assistance to projects outlined by individual expatriate associations,
societies of friends of the Czech Republic abroad and Czech civic associations
cooperating with those abroad was given a prominent place in care for expatriates in
2000. This involves help in carrying out practical cultural projects by expatriate
associations and societies of friends of the Czech Republic abroad and in the Czech
Republic, aimed at popularising the country. Applicants have to submit their projects
by 30 April of a calendar year with requests for the next year. Projects submitted
abroad to embassies by 31 January must have an approval by the embassy. Funds
are not allocated automatically; the decisive factor is the quality of the project and
its financial feasibility. In 2000, such contributions amounted to a total sum of
10 million CZK; they included projects for the organization of a conference of Czechs
abroad, assistance to expatriate associations and groups of friends of the Czech
Republic in Australia, Croatia, Finland, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand and
Slovakia, to help them publish their periodicals, arrange expatriate folk festivals in
Croatia and in Ukraine, arrange cultural events to mark the Czech national holiday
and other projects.
Alongside financial contributions, expatriate communities receive textbooks of the
Czech language through the intermediary of Czech embassies and consulates, as well
as various publications, audio and visual material, at times even national costumes for
expatriate dance groups. In 2000, all this was worth 5 million CZK. In addition,
certain Czech Embassies have expatriate libraries or facilitate regular meetings of
expatriates. It goes without saying that expatriates are invited to cultural and social
events and that Czech diplomats participate at major events organized by expatriate
communities. The memorial service at Cholmondeley in Great Britain, attended by
expatriate war veterans is worth mentioning. It marked the 60[th] anniversary of the
arrival of Czechoslovak soldiers in Great Britain. Another noteworthy event was the
Washington special 20[th] Congress of the Czechoslovak Society for Science and the
Arts, an organization which includes the Czech scientific elite living abroad, or the
festive unveiling of the statue of T. G. Masaryk in Mexico City.
The Czech Republic showed its interest in expatriates by giving investment
assistance to repairing Czech schools and expatriate cultural premises abroad; this aid
has been offered since 1996 as assistance by the Government of the Czech Republic
to developing and other needy countries on the basis of an annual Government
Decision. The total sum of 20 million CZK was used primarily to finance long-term
assistance projects to expatriates. In Romania, this aid has been given since 1996 to
the remote Czech community in the Banat, in Croatia, Czech schools and other
premises belonging to expatriate associations have been undergoing repairs since


-----

1997. Certain minor newly started projects have also been carried out – the repair of
association buildings in Nova Ves in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Bila Cerkev in
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as well as several projects in Ukraine, where some
10,000 descendants of Czech immigrants live in a number of localities. 500,000 CZK
have been transferred to cover the cost of the repair of the Sokol premises in
Cleveland in the United States, and the last installment of 5 million CZK completed
a three-year project of cooperation between Czech, Dutch and Nicaraguan towns
which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic had taken over from the
Ministry of Interior.
Since 1997, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been able to convey gratitude to
dedicated expatriates or associations and groups as well as to other civil societies
abroad as well as in the Czech Republic by conferring on them honours of the
ministry, the Jan Masaryk Prize GRATIAS AGIT, presented by the Minister of
Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic in recognition of the way those honoured have
been spreading the good name of the Czech Republic abroad. The presentation which
takes place every year on the eve of the Cyril and Methodius Day (July 5) at a festive
ceremony in the Černín Palace, took place earlier in 2000 – on 28 June, 2000. Those
who were unable to accept the award personally received it at a later date from the
Czech ambassadors at a ceremony on the premises of the embassy, for example in
Moscow (Professor Nikolsky, a literary scholar), or in London (the conductor Vilem
Tausky). Among the laureates in 2000 were the heads of Sokol associations in the
United States Slavik and Kala; J. Polasek, an architect from Sweden; J. Vrzala, an
official of the expatriate community in France; societies of the Czech educational
foundation in Texas; the Australian Sokol group in Sydney as well as Unique Czech
Projects Association. The Chilean painter Francisco Otta and the pioneer of
Luxembourg-Czech friendship Dr. Ferdinand Zürn were honoured in memoriam and
members of their families received the awards.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs keeps a regular record of expatriate associations,
societies of friends of the Czech Republic and similar organizations abroad, whether
these are chambers of commerce and honorary consulates headed by expatriates, as
well as Czech book stores, museums or other cultural institutions, publishers of
expatriate periodicals, schools for expatriate children or education centres. An
updated list of addresses of these expatriate associations and societies of friends as
well as of the expatriate periodicals were sent out to Czech embassies in the spring
2000 and through them to various organizations. The purpose is to establish and
promote communication not only among expatriates and state institutions but also
among expatriates themselves. Expatriate associations and societies of friends of the
Czech Republic exist all over the world, in Patagonia, New Zealand as well as in
Vancouver in Canada or in Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia. The list of addresses is sent to
anyone requesting it.

## VII. Legal and Consular Dimension of Czech Foreign Policy

**A. Dimension of international law**

International law is one of the fundamental values of the civilized world and
the Czech Republic is based on its principles as a democratic state and full member
of the international community. In accordance with the United Nations Charter, the
Czech Republic wants international relations to be founded on the principles of
international law, sovereignty, political independence and the territorial integrity of
the state.
The Czech Republic observes the rules of international law and the ensuing
obligations in accordance with its objective of joining the community of advanced
democratic states and accepting a corresponding share of responsibility for
developments in Europe and in the world at large. In connection with its inclusion in
the system of contractual relations, the Czech Republic demonstrates its qualification
for performing legal duties by concluding bilateral and multilateral international
treaties.
In 2000, like in 1999, the Czech Republic adhered to measures adopted by the
United Nations Security Council or within the European Union, aimed at preserving
values shared by members of the international democratic community. But the
legislative activity of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic has
markedly increased, especially in the sphere of the sanction regimes. The General
Sanction Law of the Czech Republic that came into force on 25 April, 2000, was
undoubtedly the most important legal norm in this respect. This law makes the
process of the internal implementation of international sanction regimes more
effective. If at some future date the United Nations Security Council or the Council
of the European Union agree on certain international sanctions, the Czech Republic
will be able to react in a flexible manner under the provisions of this law and
implement the measures by means of its directives without the need of adopting
a special law in every instance.
Developments of the international political or internal situation in certain states
which are affected by international sanction measures, made it necessary for the
Czech Republic either to modify internal sanction measures imposed by special laws
by adopting government decrees -this applied to Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, – or to adopt a new amendment of the law, for example, with


-----

relation to the Afghan Taliban movement or the banning of supplies for the Iranian
nuclear power plant in Bushehr. This procedure provided for the operational reaction
to relevant decisions by the Council of the European Union or the United Nations
Security Council, while preserving the political and economic interests of the Czech
Republic.
International justice is an important area, which reflects the attitude of an advanced
state to the role of international law in the world of today. While cooperation with the
_ad hoc International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The_
Hague has taken on a standard form and is practically without problems, the
ratification and subsequent implementation of obligations of the Czech Republic
deriving from the Rome Statute are still at a dead end. The obstacles to the ratification
of the Rome Statute, which the Czech Republic signed in 1999, lie in the Czech legal
code, especially in the Constitution and in the Penal Code. The proposed partial
amendment of the Constitution, drawn up by a working group for the preparation of
the ratification of the Rome Statute, is intended to help to eliminate constitutional
hurdles, especially with regard to the extradition of a citizen of the Czech Republic to
another country and to limiting the application of special provisions for criminal
proceedings to be started by the President and members of legislative bodies. The
amendment of the Penal Code, which is currently in the process of approval by the
Czech Parliament, should help to solve the problem of cooperation between authorities
responsible for criminal proceedings with international bodies of the judiciary type.
In addition, the process of extending the treaty system of the Czech Republic in
relation to multilateral treaties, negotiated within the system of the United Nations,
and treaties which are binding for the European Union Member States and other
European states under private international law continues. In the United Nations
system, there has been a marked shift in the sphere of so-called anti-terrorist
agreements. The submission of the ratification documents for the International
Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings by President Havel on
6 September, 2000, during the Millennium Summit, has placed the Czech Republic
among the first ten contractual parties to this agreement. That same day President
Havel signed International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of
Terrorism, which was already assessed in the negotiation process as a groundbreaking
document in the suppression of terrorism.
Under the terms of the Hague Conference on Private International Law,
Convention on International Access to Justice was signed and deposited on
ratification documents Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition,
Enforcement and Co-Operation in respect to Parental Responsibility and Measures
for the Protection of Children.
The agreement on the establishment of the International Visegrad Fund can be
regarded as one of the most significant treaties of a regional nature outside the United


-----

Nations, the EU or The Hague Conference; the Prime Ministers of the Czech
Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia signed it on 9 June, 2000. It provides for the
establishment of a fund to help promote closer cooperation between the V4 states,
aimed at strengthening their mutual ties and encouraging their integration in the
European Union. The contractual parties all made an equal contribution to this
objective: the first annual contribution of the Fund to promote projects in culture,
educational and scientific cooperation and of cross-border cooperation amounts to
1 million euro.
In the field of bilateral agreements, greater attention has been traditionally
devoted to neighbouring countries and to countries with which the Czech Republic
is interested in strengthening economic and trade relations. Slovakia holds a special
place in this respect. A protocol between the Government of the Czech Republic
and the Government of the Slovak Republic on handing over and receiving the
remaining gold of the gold reserves of the former Czechoslovak State Bank entered
into force on 10 May, 2000. Based on the protocol, the gold was actually transfered
to and received by Slovakia. On 23 May, 2000, the Prime Ministers signed a treaty
on providing medical care and covering its cost, as well as an inter-governmental
agreement on cooperation in the field of culture, education and science. That same
day, the two Prime Ministers also signed a protocol on the joint procedure in
dividing the property of the Czechoslovak Federal Republic and on its transfer
to the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic (The Treaty was signed on
24 November, 1999). The Prime Ministers also signed an Agreement on CrossBorder Cooperation.
With regard to agreements with other neighbouring states, treaties were signed in
2000 with Hungary, Germany, Poland, and Austria on mutual assistance in the event
of catastrophes, natural disasters and major calamities as well as a number of treaties
adapting border traffic (with Poland), on cooperation between the police and
institutions in border regions protecting state borders and the creation and
enlargement of tourist trails (with Germany).
Among so-called security treaties signed in 2000, establishing, for example,
a uniform regime in handling classified information, three such treaties should be
mentioned: one with Slovakia, the others with Lithuania and Latvia. The treaty with
Slovakia came into force that same year.
Treaties on legal aid with the US and Canada came into force in 2000, as well as
a Convention between the Czech Republic and Belgium for the Avoidance of Double
Taxation and an Agreement between the Czech Republic and Bulgaria on the
Protection of Investments.
A number of agreements on social security have been signed (for example with
Chile, Israel, and Luxembourg) while similar agreements came into force with
Croatia, Cyprus, and Lithuania.


-----

In recent years, it has become generally recognized that organized crime or the
protection of the environment are spheres where contractual agreements and
cooperation between states is imperative. In 2000, the Czech Republic signed at an
international conference in Palermo Convention against Transnational Organized
Crime. An inter – governmental bilateral agreement on cooperation in the fight
against terrorism, illicit trade in toxic and psychotropic substances and organized
crime has been signed between the Czech Republic and Latvia. In 2000, the Czech
Republic stated its definite acceptance of a number of multilateral international
agreements in the field of the environment. Some of these have already come into
force, for example, Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary
Watercourses and International Lakes, a United Nations Convention to Combat
Desertification in those countries affected by desertification and/or drought, mainly
in Africa, and Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents.
Deposit documents of Amendment to the Basel Convention on the Control of
Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waters and Their Disposal and ratification
documents of Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for
Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade have been
deposited. Inter-departmental cooperation programmes have been negotiated as
a follow-up to the relevant outline ministerial agreements with France and the
Netherlands. Inter-ministerial agreements on cooperation in the protection of the
environment have been agreed upon with Bulgaria and Germany.
Negotiations have taken place on confirming the succession of the Czech Republic
as regards international treaties, which were binding for the Czechoslovak Federal
Republic at the time of its partition. Succession negotiations and discussions on
a revision of the contractual base were concluded in 2000 with Estonia, Latvia,
Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Among non-European states the same applied to Angola,
India, and Algeria.

**B. Consular dimension of Czech foreign policy**

One of the major priorities of the foreign policy of the Czech Republic is its
incorporation into stable Euro-Atlantic structures. Developments in Europe are
nowadays influenced chiefly by European integration, in which the European Union
plays a determining role. The Czech Republic is aware that the single European
market can work only if it is protected against outside destabilizing factors, against
organized crime and other negative features. That is why it takes gradual steps
towards harmonizing its migration, visa and asylum policy with the policy of the EU
and is preparing to accept the principles, which emerge for this sphere from the
Schengen Agreement and the Amsterdam Treaty.


-----

Once the Czech Republic joins the EU, it will have to accept the decision-making
rules and jurisdiction as well as a wide spectrum of legal norms of the European
Community, making up the so-called acquis communautaire, unless transition periods
are agreed upon for individual spheres. One of the current tasks of the Czech Republic
is the harmonization of its migration and visa policy with the policy of the EU
member states. The Inter-Governmental Conference of the EU in Amsterdam in 1997
made some fundamental changes to the Maastricht Treaty, a Treaty on the European
Union. The changes concern checks at external borders, migration, and asylum and
visa policy. The Amsterdam Treaty transfers some of these spheres under the
jurisdiction of the Community and strengthens cooperation in the remaining spheres
of the Third Pillar of the Community in the field of justice and internal affairs.
Moreover, it includes the Schengen Agreement and the Procedural Agreement in the
Treaty on the European Union. Until now the Schengen Agreement of 19, June 1990,
on the gradual abolition of checks on common borders have been binding only for the
signatories, but now the regulations are binding for all EU members. In the light of
future negotiations on the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU, this means that
the so-called Schengen acquis must be fully accepted by the Czech Republic at the
latest by the date of joining the EU.
The Amsterdam Treaty contains an entirely new chapter on adjusting the problem
of visas, asylum, migration, crossing external borders and the free movement of
persons. The Council of the EU is authorized to lay down new standards and
procedures for checks on external borders, regulations on issuing short-term visas,
procedures to be used in issuing visas and determining a list of third countries whose
nations must be in possession of a visa when crossing a EU border. All these
provisions must be applied up to five years from the date the Amsterdam Treaty
comes into force.
The geographical location of the Czech Republic, as well as of certain other states
applying for membership in the European Union, involves a threat of importing
problems from neighbouring countries. It is therefore most desirable and important
that corresponding institutions be already established in the sphere of security and the
judiciary during the period prior to accession to the EU. It is in this context that the
consular aspects of the foreign policy of a state increase in significance. The Consular
Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic at home and abroad
has a major share in carrying out the tasks related to creating the necessary
prerequisites to ensure the compatibility of the Czech Republic with the acquis
communautaire. The demand for harmonization frequently strongly influences the
entire sphere of the foreign policy of the state.
In accordance with the Amsterdam Treaty and on the basis of the recognized right
of initiative, the European Commission has prepared a new proposal concerning the
visa policy of the EU. The European Community Council has issued the follow-up


-----

Directive No. 574/1999 of 12 March, 1999, determining third countries whose
nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external border of
member states. The Directive has a supplement consisting of a list of 100 countries
and 1 territorial entity that is not recognized as a state by all EU countries (Taiwan).
In 2000, the Czech Republic took some radical steps towards the harmonization of its
own visa policy with that of the EU – it introduced a visa regime for the Russian
Federation, Ukraine, Belarus and other states of the former Soviet Union. The abovementioned list also includes states with which the Czech Republic still has a visa-free
arrangement (Romania, Bulgaria). On the other hand, the Czech Republic has a visa
regime with certain countries, which are not on the list (for example, Brazil). The
Directive allows individual EU member states to demand that nationals of other states
that are not included in the joint list be in possession of a visa.
Since the middle of the 1990s the migration of the Roma to Western Europe and
overseas has continued to be a problem. The decision of the Canadian Government of
October 1997, unilaterally introducing a visa regime for all citizens of the Czech
Republic was followed by a new wave of Roma migrants to seek asylum in several
West European countries – Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and first and
foremost in Great Britain and lately even in Ireland. If a coordinated approach were
to be agreed upon and a visa regime introduced in some of the states of the Schengen
group, this could complicate the conditions for Czech citizens to have access to all the
EU member states. New Zealand has adopted the same decision as Canada in
December 2000 to come into force on 1 January, 2001.
The Czech Republic remains a transit country on the journey of migrants to
Western Europe. The number of foreign nationals applying for asylum in the Czech
Republic remains relatively low. It is, however, evident that foreign nationals in their
illegal migration to neighbouring states, especially Germany and Austria, are abusing
the asylum procedure in the Czech Republic. As in previous years, a growing number
of illegal crossings of the state border as well as subsequent applications for asylum
have again been registered in 2000.
The fact is that the borders between the Czech Republic and Germany and between
the Czech Republic and Austria are the so-called Schengen external borders of the EU
and as such are secured by the Schengen states in a corresponding manner against
illegal crossings. The EU has systematically criticised the Czech Republic for some
time for its porous borders and for the country’s ineffective protection against illegal
migrants. This criticism is directed primarily against the situation on the border
between the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The imperative of eliminating an illegal
influx of foreign nationals to the Czech Republic across all parts of the state border
prompted the Czech Republic to adopt Government Decision No. 54 on 20 January,
1999, on the Concept of modernizing checks of persons on the state border. The
purpose is to make border control more effective. The Decision has a Supplement,


-----

a timetable of measures to make border control more effective. It contains a number
of legislative tasks and measures aimed at making an analysis of the legal provisions
for the protection of the state borders of EU member states and apply them in practice
also in the Czech Republic. On 15 November, 2000, the Government of the Czech
Republic adopted Government Resolution No. 1148 to the Report on the
implementation of tasks set out in the above-mentioned timetable.
The controlling and registration of foreign nationals who enter the Czech Republic
while in possession of a relevant authorization - a visa - is equally important. The
Government of the Czech Republic adopted Government Decision No. 748 on
18 November, 1998, Concept of the modernization of visa procedures, with the aim of
ensuring an adequate verification of persons applying for a Czech visa and the correct
registration of their entry and sojourn on the territory of the Czech Republic. The
primary objectives of the modernization of the visa procedure are to ensure
compatibility with the Schengen Information System and international norms for travel
documents, the introduction of a substantially more thorough system of screening visa
applicants, the standardization of working procedure by offices which participate in
granting and checking visas, which includes Czech embassies, ensuring a thorough
control of the visa granting process, facilities for an effective and technically simple
control of the entry and departure of foreign nationals at border checkpoints and an
effective registration and statistical assessment of the visa granting process.
The introduction of an information system for the verification of Czech visa
applicants as part of the project “Modernization of visa procedures” at all embassies
aims to make the Czech Republic compatible with the Schengen Information System,
which is one of the essential conditions for carrying out visa activities within the
EU. A new system of granting Czech visas was supposed to be introduced on
31 December, 2000, at all Czech embassies. Under the new system, more than
300,000 visa applications have already been processed and more than 260,000 Czech
visas granted.
The consular service has the no less important task of looking after expatriates
abroad, both those who come to the Czech Republic as tourists and those who are
permanently resident abroad. This contributes to the Czech Republic’s image abroad.
The development of relations with expatriate communities is a means of improving
the image of the Czech Republic as an advanced country with its culture, and forms
a contribution to bilateral relations with countries where expatriates are resident. A
number of Czech nationals permanently resident abroad have won outstanding
positions in political life and in society and as such can be most useful in advocating
and defending the interests of the Czech Republic in their countries of residence,
whether individually or as an expatriate lobby.
The interest of the Czech Republic in expatriate communities has been
demonstrated recently by a number of practical steps such as the amendment of the


-----

electoral law giving Czech citizens the right to vote in parliamentary elections at
Czech embassies abroad.
The Czech Republic has continued to be concerned about the prosperity and
preservation of the cultural and national identity of current Czech nationals as well as
of expatriates of Czech origin abroad. Contacts with these communities and their
support are maintained above all through the Czech embassies. In extreme cases,
expatriates living in remote or endangered territories that can prove their Czech origin
may be granted financial assistance on the basis of a government decision in order to
have the resources to obtain permanent residence on the territory of the Czech
Republic.
The image of the Czech Republic is also shaped to a considerable extent by the
conduct of Czech nationals who travel abroad on short-term visits or as tourists.
Every year, especially during the tourist season and above all in countries which are
attractive destinations for tourists, Czech embassies provide consular assistance to
Czech nationals who find themselves in distress abroad, whether caused by
themselves or for reasons beyond their control. Czech nationals in such a situation are
given the possibility of returning to their country independently without having to
apply to the authorities of a foreign state for financial or other material assistance. The
repatriation of injured or other medically indisposed persons is in the great majority
of cases provided by the health services of the Czech Republic arranged by or with
the cooperation of the consular service.
Consular business is more or less closely interlinked nowadays with the foreign
policy of every state. In the Czech Republic the impact of this is determined by a
priority, namely the early accession to the EU. In the current phase of preparations in
the Czech Republic, the harmonization of measures of visa policy and its practical
application with the policy and practice of the EU member states, the consistent
protection of state borders, especially against illegal migration, the preparation of
legislation to coincide with standard principles applied by the EU member states with
regard to the entry and sojourn of foreign nationals, asylum procedures, deportation
and readmission as well as the application of the Schengen Criteria are among the
most crucial tasks.

## VIII. The Czech Foreign Service

**1. Efforts by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs**
**of the Czech Republic**
**to improve its human resources management**

In 2000, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic continued in
its efforts to raise the quality of its personnel by means of strict selection procedures,
(more than 2,000 applicants participated in the foreign service examinations), and
of a new system of education and training. This applies first and foremost to
improving professional qualifications in matters concerning the EU and security
policy. A permanent system of education, testing and the assessment of every
employee has been introduced in advance of the time limit set, in brief, before the
planned service law comes into force; this law regards the systematic training of the
staff as a matter of principle. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic
has also taken steps to improve the recruitment of Czech nationals to civilian and
military missions in areas of crisis and to ensure a more adequate representation of
the Czech Republic in international government organizations. It commenced the
preparation of material to strengthen the participation of the Czech Republic in the
secretariats of international organizations. This applies primarily to the United
Nations and to organizations active in the security field – NATO and the OSCE,
where the need is felt to appoint a larger number of staff, which would correspond to
the foreign policy significance of these organizations and to the share of the Czech
Republic’s contributions to the budget of these international organizations.
Apart from the foreign service examinations, internal selection procedures have been
introduced for virtually all rotation posts at embassies. In this connection, it is worth
mentioning endeavours to raise the standard of qualification criteria, which helps to
improve the quality of career diplomats. The first and crucial requirement is to raise the
standard of language proficiency among the staff of the Ministry. The knowledge of two
major foreign languages among all diplomats and of one foreign language among the
administrative and technical personnel is now taken for granted. The study of other
languages, including less widespread ones, but necessary in various countries of
deployment, is also being strongly encouraged. This requirement is included in all
selection procedures and also influences the remuneration scale at the Ministry.


-----

The Career Code for diplomatic and consular personnel was in force for the second
year in 2000; this is in addition to the personnel structure of the Ministry, determined
by job specification and relevant salary rates. The principles of the Career Code
assess the rules, which are binding for personnel work. The rules, which have been
introduced by the Career Code, influence the professional advancement of diplomats
on the basis of their practical experience, specialized knowledge and results of regular
annual assessment.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic has also devoted maximum
attention to improving the trade and economic sections at embassies by qualified and
knowledgeable diplomats to make sure that this does not result merely in expanding
the pro-export policy of the state, but also in increasing the professional and linguistic
standards of these employees. The improvement in the quality of consular posts in
countries where a visa regime has been introduced is equally important; this is also
linked with the so-called law on foreign nationals. This demanding task has been
accomplished in a relatively short period of time and Czech embassies have been
capable of fulfilling all requirements, which the new law put before them.

**2. The Diplomatic Academy**

The five-month introductory preparation of the third course of basic diplomatic
training was completed at the end of January 2000. Nineteen students of that course
commenced their one-year internship in various sections of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of the Czech Republic and at embassies. Upon completing their internship, all
participants found jobs in ministerial departments.
A two-round foreign service examination of the was held at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of the Czech Republic in February and in March. More than 200 applicants
for study at the Diplomatic Academy attended it. On the basis of the results,
17 students were selected for the fourth course of basic diplomatic preparation. The
introductory part of the preparation was inaugurated in September 2000.
The second course of higher diplomatic preparation began in January 2000.
Alongside students, who did not succeed in completing the higher diplomatic
preparation in 1999, aditional 37 members of the diplomatic staff were included in the
course on the basis of applications submitted in 2000. Apart from four mandatory
courses laid down in the Career Code a further four optional seminars were included
after checking the subjects in which applicants were interested. In addition to
seminars on international law, security policy, and international economy and trade,
new seminars on diplomatic protocol and etiquette were included in this course. The


-----

curriculum on pro-export diplomacy was organized in 2000 in a more comprehensive
manner and, apart from a seminar “World Trade and Economy”, included also
a seminar on the management of commercial risks, organized in collaboration with
the Institute of International Trade, Transport and Haulage; a cycle of lectures on
the activities of CzechTrade Agency, CzechInvest, the Czech Export Bank, and
Export Guarantee and Insurance Corporation (EGAP) was also arranged. A further
38 diplomats completed the higher diplomatic preparation in 2000.

_The European Union Training_

This type of training was introduced on the basis of Government Decision No.
841/1999 and on the basis of the Decision of the Minister No. 6/2000 of 28 April,
2000, which gave the responsibility for this type of training to the Diplomatic
Academy. It was decided that this type of training be given in two courses:

_a) Course for senior officials_

All senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic and
embassies, selected by the Decision of the Minister, attended this course. A certificate
on the attainment of the required training in matters concerning the EU was issued
also to senior officials who had been exempt from the duty of attending a course of
training on the basis of a Decision of the Minister in the light of their practical
experience in integration branches or of the training they had already received in
matters related to the EU.

_b) Course for members of the staff_

Under the Government Decision, members of the staff are required to attend
courses on the EU in a 12-hour session. The training is to be completed by the end of
2002. In 2000, there were three two-day courses, attended by 78 staff members.

_Data processing training_

800 employees of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic and
embassies attended data processing courses at the Diplomatic Academy in 2000.

_Other activities of the Diplomatic Academy_

_a) Assistance in organizing major events_

During the period under review, students at the Diplomatic Academy again assisted
in organizing major events in the Czech Republic. On 28–30 September, they helped
the police as translators during the Prague Annual Meeting of the Boards of Governors
of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. This was the third time


-----

students had participated in the organization of the FORUM 2000 at Prague Castle.
President Havel sent a letter of thanks in recognition of the help provided by the
Diplomatic Academy. The Ministry of Interior of the Czech Republic used the
translation services of students of the Diplomatic Academy during Czech-British
exercises.

_b) Recruitment lectures at universities_

The Diplomatic Academy arranged lectures at universities. Their purpose is to
provide information on the foreign service examinations at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of the Czech Republic, held in the spring, and to encourage university
graduates to choose the diplomatic profession. In 2000, these lectures were given at
the Philosophy Faculty of Charles University, the Law Faculty of Charles University,
the Economic University and the Faculty of Social Science in Prague.

_c) Ministerial recognition “Honorary Ambassador”_

On the initiative of the Diplomatic Academy, a ministerial recognition – the title of
Honorary Ambassador – was introduced. These titles are conferred on commendable
diplomats who were dismissed from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after February
1948 and imprisoned in the 1950s. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech
Republic conferred the titles for the first time on 10 March, 2000, at a
commemoration ceremony on the 52[nd] anniversary of the death of Jan Masaryk. The
Diplomatic Academy is entitled to propose other persons for the title on the basis of
an academic project entitled “The Destiny of Employees of the Czechoslovak Foreign
Service after 1938”. Work on the project was commissioned in 2000 by the Academic
Council of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic including a team of
historians, headed by Dr. Valis. The Diplomatic Academy is a sponsor of the project.

_d) Research sponsorship_

The Academic Council of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic
has entrusted the Diplomatic Academy with the sponsorship of the above-mentioned
project also in relation to scientific research on the subject of The Situation under
Conditions of the Globalisation of the World Economy, Predicting its Development
in Europe and Implications of its Transformation for the Czech Republic. This project
is being carried out by Dr. Sereghyova.

_Activities of the Diplomatic Academy abroad_

_a) Lectures_

The Ambassadors of Poland, Hungary, Great Britain and Peru gave lectures at the
courses of the Diplomatic Academy. Mrs. Pernalowa, wife of the Polish Ambassador,
spoke about diplomatic protocol and etiquette.


-----

In the course of higher diplomatic preparation the Diplomatic Academy arranged
lectures by the Egyptian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fathallah and by the
adviser of the Israeli Prime-Minister, Professor Goldberg, on the peace process in the
Middle East.

_b) Cooperation with foreign institutions_

In the course of training on the EU issues, the Diplomatic Academy cooperated
with the international centre for European education in Nice, headed by Professor
Kinsky. The Academy also established and promoted contacts with partner
institutions. In 2000, the Diplomatic Academy sent its students to attend courses to
complete their education organized by the Diplomatic Academy in Vienna, Madrid,
Peru, Chile, by the foreign service programme in Oxford, and by the Clingendael
Institute in The Hague. A seminar on presentation skills and one on political analysis
as part of diplomatic preparation and higher diplomatic preparation were headed by
the former Director of the Foreign Service Programme in Oxford R. Feltham.
Those interested in more detailed information about the work of the Diplomatic
Academy will find further material in the annual report of the Institute of International
Relations of which the Diplomatic Academy is an organizational component.

**3. Budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs**
**of the Czech Republic**

On 3 March, 2000, the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech
Republic adopted Government Decision No. 859, the law on the state budget for
2000. The indicators of the chapter of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech
Republic in the budget were stipulated on the basis of this decision:
Total income 400 million CZK
Total expenditure 4,184,830 million CZK
of this capital expenditure 504,520 million CZK
When drawing up the draft budget consideration was given to government fiscal
priorities formulated at a government seminar held on 24 June, 1999, in Kolodeje. It
ensured for the chapter of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic
priority for the accession and incorporation of the Czech Republic in the EU and
promotion of a pro-export policy. The following facts must be taken into
consideration:
– the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, 80% of which
is in foreign currencies, is exceptionally sensitive to fluctuations in the exchange


-----

rate of the CZK, for example, a mere 10% drop in the exchange rate influences the
budget to the amount of 290 million CZK;
– the budget must absorb the development of inflation in all countries where there are
embassies;
– financial resources earmarked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech
Republic create the conditions for possible revenue (claiming the payment of debts
abroad, infrastructure for the future collection of contributions from the funds of the
European Union, revenue from visa activities, etc.);
– external economic relations encourage business activities in the Czech Republic.

_Current expenditure_

Current expenditure has been set at 3,680,305 million CZK. This sum covered the
requirements of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, although at
the price of stringent economizing measures, which cause frequent problems,
especially abroad, above all in the sphere of the security of embassies and other
Czech offices.
Expenditure from the 2000 budget was to a large extent influenced by the
contingency budget or by the regulatory measures governing the use of resources
from the state budget, which were laid down for the first three months of 2000.
There were six autonomous organizations, subordinated to the Ministry in 2000:
the Service for Diplomats, the Institute of International Relations, the Czech Centre
Administration, the Štiřín Conference Centre, the Office of the General
Commissioner for the Czech participation in the EXPO 2000 in Hanover and a health
centre for Czech nationals abroad.

_Institute of International Relations_

Institute of International Relations concentrated on research on international
relations and on ensuring contacts with partner organizations. The Diplomatic
Academy which has been responsible for the basic and higher diplomatic training of
young diplomats and the organization of various courses is part of the Institute. The
Institute of International Relations was allocated a contribution of 22,411 million
CZK for its activities in 2000.

_Czech Centre Administration_

Czech Centre Administration organizes activities abroad focusing on the
promotion of the Czech Republic and has cultural and trade contacts. The sum of
102,216 million CZK was allocated for its work in 2000.


-----

_Service for Diplomats_

Service for Diplomats organized material and other requirements of foreign
embassies in the Czech Republic and looked after premises which are the property of
the Czech Republic and are managed by it. The sum of 125 million CZK was
earmarked for its activities in 2000.

_The Štiřín Conference Centre_

The Štiřín Conference Centre provided conference and liaison services for the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic and for other central institutions; it
does not receive any operational financial contribution from the state budget. An
extensive reconstruction of the entire premises was carried out in 2000. The
accommodation, conference and entertainment sections will be extended so that the
centre is expected to make a profit to be paid into the state budget.

_The Office of the General Commissioner for Czech participation_
_in the EXPO 2000 world fair in Hannover_

This organization was set up under Government Decision No. 240 of 8 April, 1998,
to ensure the participation of the Czech Republic in EXPO 2000 in Hannover. The
sum of 94,880 million CZK was earmarked for its work in 2000.

_The health centre for Czech nationals abroad_

On 1 July, 2000, the organization was transferred from the Ministry of Health of
the Czech Republic to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech
Republic. The sum allocated for its work during that period was 14,386 million CZK.

_Promotion of science and research_

The budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic also includes
funds for research and development. The sum amounts to 17.3 million CZK. The
resources are used in such a way that 10.5 million CZK are devoted to grant projects
and 6.8 million CZK as “institutional resources” in the form of a contribution to the
Institute of International Relations.

_Capital expenditure_

Capital expenditure was earmarked at a total of 504,520 million CZK.


-----

_Non-budgetary funds_

Further financial requirements were contained in the budgetary chapter General
Cash Administration and in the course of the year they are released into the budget of
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic. They are:
– funds for humanitarian aid amounting to 30 million CZK. Humanitarian aid is
provided on the basis of Government Decision No. 342 of 1996 and reflects the
endeavour of the Czech Republic, as a democratic state, recognizing the principle
of solidarity among peoples and states, to take over its share of responsibility in
solving exceptional situations;
– resources for foreign broadcasts amounting to 62 million CZK. In Government
Decision No. 573 of 10 September, 1997, the Government of the Czech Republic
agreed that funds for foreign broadcasts be met from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
of the Czech Republic budget;
– contributions to international and other organizations amounting to 700 million
CZK; these sums arise from commitments of the Czech Republic and can virtually
not be influenced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic;
– the resources for foreign development aid amounting to 345 million CZK are
divided among the relevant chapters of the state budget. These funds are offered
through the intermediary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic
on the basis of Government Decision No. 153 of 15 March, 1995, with priority
given to countries which are moving towards the introduction or consolidation of
democracy and human rights and the introduction or consolidation of a market
economy;
– contribution to the Visegrad Fund of 10 million CZK.
