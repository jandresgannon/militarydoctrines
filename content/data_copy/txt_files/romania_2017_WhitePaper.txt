CHAPTER 6. Financial resources..................................................................63 Final remarks.......................................................................................................67 4 5 Defence has become all the more important within the current security context, which is extremely dynamic and complicated, characterized by an increasingly complex mix of risks and threats such as: the annexation of Crimea, the growing instability and the escalation of terrorism in the Middle East and Northern Africa, the impact of Islamic State activities on European states, the humanitarian crisis generated by the massive flow of refugees in Europe. 

The Romanian Government gives priority to defence and a key dimension of its activity is the implementation of a coherent defence policy. 

Thus, the 2017-2020 Government Program is an important pillar in defining the defence policy priorities and establishing its basic coordinates, namely: strategic continuity within NATO and EU, increased readiness of our armed forces, an optimum management of defence resources, professional training and wellbeing of the military personnel, renewal of the national defence industry, population training and territorial organization, inter-institutional management of military or security crises.

The White Paper on Defence 2017 renders, in an integrated and unitary manner, our Government's vision on national defence, correlated to the objectives of our National Defence Strategy. Coherence and credibility are key features, with special significance, which the Romanian Armed Forces have constantly exhibited. It is of paramount importance that our defence and security efforts be aimed at the reconfiguration of our forces, and the adapted planning of acquisitions and endowment be targeted mainly at promoting our national strategic interests at NATO and EU level, and at ensuring regional stability in the Eastern neighborhood of the Alliance. 

The human resource is a very valuable one for the Armed Forces. In this respect, our preoccupation for increasing the wellbeing of our military and civilian personnel needs to be reflected in the White Paper priorities. The results 

6 obtained by applying the new regulations regarding the remuneration system for state employees will also fully contribute to this.

I am convinced that the adoption of this document will enhance the coherence of our national effort to ensure our security and defence, to fulfill the expectations of the Romanian citizens and to adapt to the specific trends of the international and regional context.

From the very beginning, we understood that real coherence and credibility need adequate financing. The political agreement concluded at national level specifies that 2% of the GDP will be allotted to the defence budget starting 2017 and for the next ten years.

This is the real proof of the strong engagement of the Romanian Government to support the implementation of the defence policy objectives and the modernization and consolidation of the Romanian Armed Forces. 

Romanian's Prime-Minister Mihai Tudose The complex, unpredictable events in the security environment need the identification and implementation of appropriate solutions. *The White Paper* on Defence 2017 (WP17) is in accordance with this reasoning as it conveys the concerns of the Ministry of National Defence regarding the security challenges, being the main defence policy and planning document.

The increased dynamics of the current risks and threats requires, more than ever, the continuation of the defence capacity consolidation process, to ensure an adequate transformation, modernization and endowment of the Romanian Armed Forces, and increased interoperability with Allied and partner forces to provide the right response in crisis situations.

In this regard, an efficient military system, adapted to the new security architecture, needs to be able to respond adequately to all these complex developments in the security environment, both in our immediate proximity and at global level. In recent years, our country has proven to be a security provider, and this status demands making further efforts and taking measures to match our previous accomplishments. 

Needless to say that all these efforts have to be backed up by adequate resources. The Government in office has understood the current challenges and decided to make defence a priority in this year's budget allotment process. After a period of critical underfinancing of the defence sector until 2012, with a slightly ascending trend starting 2013, our current budget provides the necessary basis to accelerate the modernization of the military system. 

The human resource is a very special issue and it deserves to be addressed as such. Outstanding results require well-trained people, dedicated to defending their country. As a matter of fact, we have often received our partners' appreciation of the Romanian military personnel's courage and high professional qualities in the theatres of operations. 

7 8

The equipment, technique and strategic procurement programs are equally essential. Recently, the Romanian Parliament transmitted the prior approval of eight procurement programs, which will lead to a higher level of endowment for our armed forces.

The geostrategic challenges and Romania's responsibilities stemming from the engagements assumed at international level render our armed forces an important vector in ensuring our national security, while *WP17* provides the direction, dimension and support in this regard.

# Introduction

![9_Image_0.Png](9_Image_0.Png)

Premises The White Paper on Defence is developed by the Ministry of National Defence in order to fulfill the provisions of the National Defence Strategy and the implementation of the defence objectives established by the Government Program, based on the provisions of Law no. 203/2015 on defence planning.

The White Paper on Defence 2017 (WP 17) was developed so as to reflect the provisions of the 2017-2020 Government Program, approved by the Parliament of Romania, following the entrustment of the current Government (Decision no. 1/ 4th of January 2017 ). WP 17 is also based on the 2015-2019 National Defence Strategy, approved by the Decision no. 33/2015 of the Romanian Parliament.

From a conceptual point of view, the White Paper defines Romania's defence policy for a timeframe of four years, containing both medium and long term provisions. It is, in this sense, the main planning document at department level. It provides the basis for the development of the Military Strategy and as well as for the priorities when formulating the MoND's defence budget proposals.

WHITE PAPERON DEFENCE

## Outline

When drawing up the current document, the following were also taken into consideration: NATO's Strategic Concept (2010), the European Union's Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy, the EUGS Implementation Plan (2016) on security and defence, as well as the decisions of the NATO Summits in Wales (2014) and Warsaw (2016), the European Council in December 2016, the heads' of state and government meeting in Brussels (2017), and the subsequent ministerial meetings respectively.

The structure and content of WP 17 closely follows the legal provisions and establishes, in individual chapters, the defence policy objectives for 20172020, the necessary measures and actions for their fulfillment, the Romanian Armed Forces' specific missions and requirements, the main directions for capability development, and the policies regarding the integrated management of defence resources.

Additionally, in the first chapter, WP 17 presents an overview of the security environment, the risks and threats relevant to the defence sector. The document reiterates a series of elements from the previous White Paper1 as they are still valid and applicable in the present context. The 2017-2020 Government Program, that led to the development of WP 17, continues the Government's main approach to defence issues, namely it preserves the same major coordinates, such as Romania's status as a member of NATO, EU and other international organizations, Romania's strategic partnerships, including the partnership with the US, Romania's defence capabilities and participation in operations and missions, endowment and resources of any type. 

On resources, an aspect worth mentioning is that WP 17 is the first document of this kind having as main trigger an adequate budget allocation - 
2% of the GDP, which is a prerequisite for an adequate implementation of the defence policy objectives as a whole.

![11_Image_2.Png](11_Image_2.Png) Assessment Of The Security Environment

At global level, the security environment is continuously changing and this leads to a high degree of interdependency in 

![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)

international relations and to the difficulty of distinguishing classic risks and threats from the asymmetric and hybrid ones. The reduced predictability of the evolution of regional crises and the infringement of the principles of international legislation by some state and non-state actors render the regional security situation even more complicated and trigger increased risks and threats.

## The International Security Environment

The increased dynamics of the global security environment generates difficulties when it comes to a clear differentiation between the classic risks and threats and the asymmetric and hybrid ones, while the interdependency, instability and unpredictability of the international relations system represent important features that define the current security and defence paradigm. 

The developments in the global security environment will continue to be dominated by complex trends, among which: the reconfiguration of the regional and global geo-strategic relations, the re-assertion of the military force as a power vector in international policy; the development of information technology and its use to influence the political and social values; the revival 11

of nationalism and extremism; the ethnic-religious 

![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)

![12_image_1.png](12_image_1.png)

fragmentation and ideological radicalization with consequences in the emergence of separatist movements and the escalation of the terrorist phenomenon; the increased risk of non-compliance with international treaties and agreements, the increase of migrant flows towards the European Union states, the increase of economic imbalances at regional level and the adaptation of the critical infrastructure to real needs.

Regarding the anticipation and prevention of global security issues, an important role must be assumed by international organizations through intensifying their efforts, which should be materialized in solving regional crises, both by means of consultation and by decision making. The violation of international treaties and agreements on armament procurement, the reconfiguration of military devices through temporary or permanent deployment of military forces and capabilities, as well as through performing large scale, snap military exercises weaken trust and security at regional and international levels, possibly leading to a significant reconfiguration of international relations. 

The regional crises and conflicts in Eastern Europe, the Western Balkans, the Middle East and Northern Africa tend to interconnect and may trigger cumulative effects that require the adaptation of security and defence strategies at state level and at the level of international and regional organizations. The aggressive stance of some state or non-state actors and their strategies in the field of international relations generate unpredictable political developments and social imbalance at global and regional levels.

The security crises in the Middle East and Northern Africa are intensified

![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)

by the economic and financial difficulties and generate deeper social issues, increasing the flow of migrants towards the EU member states. The migration phenomenon acts as a catalyst for the terrorist one, enabling cross-border organized crime activities, such as the trafficking of illegal weapons, drugs and human beings, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and of nuclear technologies and material.

In this context of ongoing security crises in Eastern Europe, in the Middle East and Northern Africa, the North Atlantic Alliance has been facing a series of unprecedented challenges for the last two decades, the management of which implies a continuous process of adaptation and consolidation of its defence and deterrence posture.

The Russian Federation continues to consolidate its status as a great power, both at regional and global levels, with implications regarding the European and Euro-Atlantic aspirations of several states, such as Ukraine, the Republic of Moldavia and Georgia.

In the extended Black Sea Region, the infringement of international law, by questioning international order, the preservation of frozen conflicts, the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula and the increase of military presence brought to the attention of the North Atlantic Alliance the strengthening of its fundamental mission - collective defence and the validation of the security agreements concluded with the Russian Federation at the end of the 20th century.

The Western Balkans region is characterized by a tendency towards permanent instability, despite the aspirations of its inhabitants to European integration. Maintaining a certain destabilization potential at regional level, on ethnic, religious and historic origins, favors the emergence of extremism in the context of the possible return of the foreign fighters that activate in some terrorist organizations in the Middle East and Northern Africa.

Romania, as a NATO and EU member state, needs to continue to intensify the national efforts on the defence and security dimension, in accordance with other Allied states and partners, and to comply with international agreements, in order to increase its credibility and regional profile, and to maintain its status as a security provider.

## Risks And Threats

The main national security risks and threats, having an impact on the defence domain, are both conventional and unconventional.

A conventional threat to Romania's national security has a low degree of probability. On the other hand, deploying in Romania's proximity military structures equipped with modern armament systems and combat capabilities, including Anti-access/Area Denial (A2/AD2) by some states that are not NATO 
members, as well as the increase in number and scale of snap military exercises are elements of concern related to the national and regional security. The operational potential and the actional unpredictability of these capabilities pose risks to the security of Romania and its Allies.

Maintaining frozen conflicts in the extended Black Sea region and the possible emergence of new conflicts in the vicinity of Romania may generate negative effects at the regional level. At the same time, the existence and prolongation of inter-ethnic tensions and the regional or local imbalances in the near vicinity of Romania may lead to the emergence of new conflicts.

At the moment, Romania is not facing a direct, imminent and explicit terrorist threat. However, Romania's geographic closeness to areas dominated by terrorism and the refugee groups transiting the national territory, coming from conflict areas, may be considered factors that favour terrorist actions, with a high degree of unpredictability.

2 Anti Acces/Area Denial
Moreover, the national contingents that take part in international missi-

![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png)

ons are continuously exposed to the risks and threats generated by the extremist terrorist organizations and groups.

Radicalism originating from the Middle East and Northern Africa and the connections with the organized crime entities in Europe will increase as soon as the "European fighters" return to their countries of origin/residence.

In close connection with the means and manifestation forms of terrorism, cross-border organized crime triggers the risk of weapon and ammunition trafficking.

The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, of nuclear technologies and material, as well as of unconventional lethal capabilities will continue to be an external risk factor.

The development of the potential to use chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear means for deterrence and as a tool to promote political or ideological interests remains an important concern for some state and non-state actors. The combination of weapons of mass destruction and the vectors carrying classical ammunition is assessed as one of the most important risks to the Euro-Atlantic security.

Cyber-attacks are global threats, difficult to identify and counter. Recent times have seen an unprecedented number of such attacks which are continuous, dissimulated, with a high media impact and immediate major effects, at minimal costs.

Specific actions can be carried out simultaneously in order to increase the results, with the purpose of exfiltrating data and information, cyber terrorism, mission sabotage or informational warfare activities.

# White Paperon Defence Chapter 2 Defence Policy Objectives

Defence policy is a coherent and coordinated set of objectives, measures and actions aimed at fulfilling the national security goals and the defence obligations assumed at international level, making use of all political, diplomatic and military instruments of the Ministry of National Defence. 

The fundamental purpose of the defence policy is to provide the decisions and actions in the defence field so as to guarantee Romania's sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity. This process requires the implementation of the defence provisions established by the National Defence Strategy, as well as of the objectives, priorities and lines of action of the Government Program.

![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png)

![16_image_1.png](16_image_1.png)

Consequently, the formulation of defence policy objectives was aimed at projecting, in a synthetic and comprehensive manner, the aspects connected to the modernization and adaptation of the Romanian Armed Forces and, implicitly, to the development of resilience and the ability to provide an adequate response to the risks and threats of the current security context; to the opportunities provided by Romania's geostrategic position of asserting its

![17_image_0.png](17_image_0.png) status as a regional pillar of stability with a distinct profile as a strategic partner for NATO, EU, and especially for the US; and, last but not least, to the principle of dialogue and promoting security through bilateral cooperation and exchange of information in the military domain, as well as the implementation of an inter-institutional approach to the defence sector.

## Developing Robust Defence Capabilities

The development of robust, resilient, credible, interoperable, flexible and efficient defence capabilities meant not only to deter a possible aggression against Romania but also to provide an adequate response to the current and future challenges of the security environment, including in the unconventional, hybrid spectrum, represents a prerequisite for the fulfillment of the remaining defence policy objectives.

The fulfillment of Romania's engagements as a NATO and EU member state represents an important vector in the development of defence capabilities.

The development process of military capabilities will be aimed at making the best use of the resources available by means of prioritization, both for the

![17_image_1.png](17_image_1.png)

capabilities developed by national efforts and for those developed in common with other member or allied states in a multinational format (NATO, EU or other regional cooperation formats). 

The gradual development of capabilities assumed is aimed at providing the adequate conditions for the implementation of the Program of transformation, development and procurement of the Romanian Armed Forces by 2026 and beyond3.

The purpose of the Program is to develop the capabilities needed by the Romanian Armed Forces to promote and protect national interests against ongoing risks and threats, as well as future ones, to fulfill the security and defence engagements assumed by our country within NATO and EU, as well as in the framework provided by other international bodies, by means of developing a modern structure of forces, suitably equipped, deployable, interoperable, self-sustainable, with a multidimensional protection capability, with a flexible and efficient command and control system.

Further details on the main directions of capabilities development are presented in Chapter 4.

## Increasing Strategic Credibility At Nato And Eu Levels

This objective consists of both the consolidation of our country's profile in NATO, through operational and conceptual contributions - a course of action specified in the National Defence Strategy - and Romania's strategic continuity within NATO and EU - mentioned as a distinct measure by the Government Program.

The courses of action at NATO level: - active participation in formal and informal meetings of work groups or in high level meetings (of defence/foreign ministers, heads of state

18 and government) and pragmatic, flexible and consistent promotion

![19_image_0.png](19_image_0.png)

of national interests and objectives in relation to the issues on the NATO agenda; comprehensive and coherent national contribution to the implementation of the Alliance Readiness Action Plan / RAP, in order to increase the operational capacity as well as providing the Alliance with the national contribution to the enhanced NATO Response Force/ eNRF;
continuation and, where appropriate, enhancement of the actions aimed at the development and optimal functioning of Allied command and control structures4 on the Romanian territory, as well as of other initiatives in the framework of the Allied Forward Presence on the Eastern flank§, while emphasizing the importance of these structures

for the Alliance and supporting the coherence of the measures adopted to strengthen the deterrence and defence posture on this flank; 
- increase of the Black Sea strategic profile in the context of the Alliance, mainly by strengthening specific cooperation with NATO member states, primarily in order to ensure a visible Allied maritime presence in this maritime basin and to emphasize the importance of this region for Euro-Atlantic security; 
- further participation in Allied operations and missions - the operational effort will be focused on the theatre of operations in Afghanistan, where we will support all Allied approaches to ensure the success of NATO's involvement in this country. At the same time, we will maintain our engagements regarding NATO's efforts on stabilization in the Western Balkans. We will also focus on reconfiguring and adapting our participation with forces and capabilities to ensure an adequate contribution, in relation to our national interests, to the collective effort to manage the threats against Euro-Atlantic security, including the fight against terrorism, according to the decisions adopted by NATO heads of state and government at their meeting on May 25th, 2017;

level will be identified and performed in common; consolidation of our contribution to NATO partnerships by focusing our effort on fulfilling the engagement assumed in the Defence Capacity Building Initiative/ DCB-I for the Republic of Moldavia and Georgia, attempting to identify a level of ambition concerning the development of capabilities for consistent participation in this domain; intensification of national and Allied efforts to ensure the infrastructure so as to meet the conditions for the pre-positioning of Allied military equipment; contribution to the functional analysis of NATO Command Structure/NCS and manning with experienced personnel of all positions allotted to Romania in NATO command and force structures, as well as identifying and assuming key positions of high visibility in NATO
command structures (International Secretariat, International Military Staff, Supreme Headquarters Allied - ACO and ACT).

At EU level, the new security and defence challenges (the Ukrainian crisis, the migration crisis, the increase of the terrorist phenomenon), Brexit, the French-German Initiative in June 2016 have intensified the debates on the future of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Thus, the consolidation process of the EU's role in the security and defence domain has become

more substantial since 2016, after EU High Representative, Frederica Mogherini presented the EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy (EUGS) 
and the Implementation Plan on security and defence.

Romania supports the consolidation of the EU's role as a global actor on the international security stage, with a more efficient involvement in crisis management in its immediate vicinity (Eastern and Southern), simultaneously ensuring complementarity with NATO, avoiding any duplications and providing a common NATO-EU approach in the international crisis management process.

In this context, Romania will develop an active profile, including in the perspective of assuming the Presidency of the EU Council in the first semester of 2019, both by an active participation in the decision making process in the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and in the capability development process in the multinational cooperation formats provided by the European Defence Agency, and by contributing to the EU operations and missions.

The course of action on this dimension will be aimed at:
- consolidating Romania's position in the decision making mechanisms with impact on the Common Security and Defence Policy/
CSDP by means of promoting and supporting the national points of view on the issues stemming from the new geopolitical context and the dynamics of the security situation at regional, European and global level;
- contributing with military and civilian forces and capabilities to the EU operations and missions, in a balanced national effort, according to Romania's strategic interests and depending on other engagements assumed at international level;
- efficiently contributing to the consolidation of the CSDP, in the perspective of holding the Presidency of the EU Council, including by means of supporting the implementation of the EU Global Strategy on the security and defence dimension and reaching the EU level of ambition on the global security stage, regarding the ability to respond rapidly and efficiently to the entire spectrum of threats and

## Strengthening Strategic Partnerships, Especially The Strategic Partnership With The United States Of America

Strategic partnerships are the foundation of the solid and comprehensive relations with the countries with which we share common interests in the security and defence domains7.

ア Currently, Romania has strategic partnerships and special relations with: USA, France, Germany, Poland, UK, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Hungary, Azerbaijan, South Korea, China, Japan, India, and Moldova
The Ministry of National Defence will continue to contribute, through specific actions, to the development of privileged cooperative relations within the strategic partnerships along the following lines:
 **Extending the US-Romania Strategic Partnership for the 21st Century**, increasing cooperation and consolidating the bilateral relations in the defence sector, with an aim to promote Romania as a vector of stability and security in the South-East of Europe. 

This partnership provides the framework for the development of excellent relations between the two countries' armed forces. Consolidating the cooperation with the US in the defence domain will focus on the following:
- increasing the political and military cooperation, both bilaterally and within NATO (with a focus on the dialogue within the High Level Defence Group/HLDG, Romanian-US Joint Committee, US-Romanian Executive Committee, BST8);
- providing continuous support to the US forces in military activities on Romanian territory in accordance with the provisions of the Defence Cooperation Agreement between Romania and the US regarding the activities of US forces stationed on Romanian territory/DCA9; special attention will be paid to the European Reassurance Initiative/ERI10 and to Operation Atlantic Resolve/
OAR;
- fulfilling the commitments assumed in accordance with the US-Romania Ballistic Missile Defence Agreement (BMDA)11;

American partner, under the coordination of the Inter-ministerial Committee12.

* Developing and consolidating the defence cooperation relations within the other strategic partnerships, in order to implement the military and security components, based on the convergent interests in NATO, EU and the Eastern Neighbourhood.

Regarding the Strategic Partnership with France, special attention will be paid to the projects of bilateral cooperation in the defence and security Chapter of the Road Map. Cooperation activities will be organized in order to achieve the interoperability of all branches of service, military training and education by means of cadets' exchange; a permanent contact between military education institutions will be established in order to explore new ways of cooperation on major projects to develop military capabilities for the Romanian Armed Forces, as well as to encourage cooperation in the domain of armaments by implementing industry partnerships.

The Partnership with Germany already features excellent cooperation in the defence sector and a substantial high level political dialogue. A clear example in this regard is Romania's major involvement in the Framework Nation Concept (FNC)13, as well as the good cooperation of Romanian and

German troops in the theatres of operations in Afghanistan or Kosovo. All cooperation opportunities will be used in areas such as: defence intelligence, joint training and exercises, personnel training and cooperation between Special Operation Forces and the fields of military technique and defence industry. 

The Partnership with Poland is in an advanced development stage and is based on the converging interests of the two states within NATO, EU and the Eastern Neighbourhood. This partnership remains one of the main vectors of cooperation for the Romanian Armed Forces. It will be focused on strengthening the political and military dialogue and the relations, namely the direct military cooperation (both at the level of categories of forces and in military education institutions) for the successful implementation of common projects.

The development of the **Strategic Partnership with Turkey** will be focused on the application of the military and security component of the Action Plan for implementing the Joint Declaration, emphasizing the intensification of the political and military dialogue, both within NATO, and bilaterally, bearing in mind our countries' status as riverines to the Black Sea. The dialogue is instrumental in the process of stabilization and security in the Black Sea region. In addition, cooperation will continue in military training, through joint exercises and exchanges of cadets and instructors within military education institutions.

Intensifying the efforts to strengthen the cooperation relations within the Strategic Partnerships with the United Kingdom, Spain, and Italy will be targeted at increasing the high-level political-military dialogue, identifying and using the opportunities to develop multinational capabilities, as well as at the practical cooperation in mutual interest domains (military training and education, logistics and military technology).

The UK Partnership follows an ascending trend, with a major contribution of the UK to the efforts to implement the Allied decisions on reassurance measures on the Eastern flank, the tailored forward presence (TFP) 
respectively.

# The Development Of The

![27_Image_0.Png](27_Image_0.Png) International Cooperation Relations At Bilateral, Regional Levels And Within International Organizations

The development of bilateral cooperation with the strategic partners, as well as with NATO and EU Allies, and with the neighbour countries and states from the areas of strategic interest for our country contributes to the consolidation of the credibility of the Romanian Armed Forces and to the support of our national security interests.

Continuing to actively participate in the regional cooperation initiatives and the development of the judicial framework of international cooperation in the defence domain enables the consolidation process of Romania's profile as a promoter of regional stability. An important contribution to increasing Romania's profile at regional level is brought by the effective management of the political and military provisions of treaties, initiatives and regimes regarding the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and arms control.

At the same time, the continuation of the Romanian Armed Forces' participation in the missions and operations under NATO, EU, UN and OSCE aegis will contribute to the fulfillment of Romania's commitments, and will enhance Romania's strategic profile as a relevant actor on the international security stage.

The international defence cooperation objectives are consistent with Romania's general foreign policy objectives.

The bilateral and regional defence cooperation as well as the cooperation in international organizations is addressed in a gradual manner, within the allotted resources. The main lines of action for the period 2017-2020, are:
activating and consolidating the bilateral cooperation with NATO
•
and EU member states; strengthening the relations with the neighbouring states, from the

## Providing Support To Public Authorities In The Management Of Emergency Situations

The participation in the process of limitation and removal of the consequences of civilian emergencies is based on the need for inter-institutional coordination and cooperation and takes place according to the legislation that regulates the specific conduct of these situations14.

1 -1
Law no. 45/1994 on National Defence, Government Order no. 21/2004 on the National System for the Management of Emergency Situations/approved by Law no. 15/2005, Government Decision no. 94/2014 on the development, structure and function of the National Committee for special emergency situations, Government Decision no. 557/2016 on the management of risk categories, Guvernment Order no. 1/2014 on measures in emergency situations management and on the modification of Government Order no. 21/2004 on the National System for

the Management of Emergency Situations, approved by Law no. 104/2014
In emergency situations, the Ministry of National Defence capabilities will provide support to the local/central public administration authorities according to the action plans for risk categories concluded at central and local levels, based on the support functions established by the legislation in force. The MoND mainly performs search and rescue missions, provides protection to the population, and air, land or maritime transport for displaced population, as well as emergency medical and hospital assistance. 

The support provided to the displaced people and to the local/central public administration authorities may also consist of humanitarian aid or services according to the legal provisions.

The lines of action in this domain are aimed at:
- consolidating the cooperation relations with the specialized intervention structures, at central and local levels, including the non-governmental organizations;
- participating with intervention capabilities in the process of limitation and relief of the effects of natural disasters or technological accidents;
- participating in the support of the population affected by calamities 
(providing transport for intervention resources and immediate need materials, accommodation, medical assistance, facilitating access to remote or not easily accessible areas and distribute humanitarian aids) in cooperation with the public authorities with responsibilities in this field.

An integrated inter-institutional approach to civilian emergency management involves taking advantage of the cooperation opportunities with specialized structures set up within NATO, EU or regional initiatives.

In this context, there is the cooperation, within NATO, with the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Relief Coordination Centre (EADRCC); within the EU, 
through the Civil Protection Mechanism, namely the contribution of the Romanian Armed Forces with capabilities to the forces assigned for emergency situations relief missions, outside the country; within the European Emergency Response Capacity - the voluntary contribution for 2016-2020.

The Romanian Armed Forces will also continue to contribute to the nati-

![31_image_0.png](31_image_0.png)

onal approaches under the Ministry of Internal Affairs to implement the civil preparedness requirements in the civilian field by means of active participation in the development of risk analyses and by making their data/information and human expertise available.

# Chapter 3 Specific Missions And Requirements Of The Romanian Armed Forces

## Missions Of The Romanian Armed Forces

The Romanian Armed Forces represent the basic component of the National Defence System's armed forces, which ensures the integration in a unitary concept of the activities of all the forces participating in the country's defence, both during peacetime and at war.

The Romanian Armed Forces are exclusively subordinated to the will of the Romanian people, and have the fundamental mission to guarantee the sovereignty, independence and unity of the state, the territorial integrity of the country and the constitutional democracy by employing the available resources, harmonizing the contributions of all institutions, public authorities and economic operators with responsibilities in the defence domain, and by ensuring the coherence and complementarity of the national effort with that of NATO and EU member states, and of Romania's strategic and regional partners.

means of defence diplomacy; Providing support to central and local public administration authorities, in emergency situations, to assist the population and manage the consequences of disasters and technological accidents

## The Level Of Ambition

In order to fulfill their assigned missions, the Romanian Armed Forces must be able to:
•
.

.

•
perform, through their own effort, or, where appropriate, contribute to inter-institutional actions and measures, at national or allied level, in order to deter a potential aggression against the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Romanian state, and to counter any unconventional and/or hybrid actions and/or threats; plan and conduct a joint national defence operation at strategic level, until the deployment of allied main forces under the provisions of Art. 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty; facilitate the rapid deployment and ensure the combat engagement of allied forces on the Romanian territory or in its neighborhood, and decisively participate in the operation of defending the country and restoring the territorial integrity of the Romanian state after the joint defence operational responsibility is taken over by NATO authorities; provide a land forces, division-level operational group, adequately supported by air and naval forces, as Romania's contribution to the fulfillment of the NATO and EU Level of Ambition15, according to Romania's commitments and the Allied Operational Requirements.

15 According to the agreed principles ("a single set of forces"), Romania provides the same forces package to both organizations as its contribution to the collective defense efforts

## 33

The contributions to the operations/missions carried out under the aegis of international organizations (UN, OSCE, NATO, and EU) or other regional initiatives, as well as those aimed at supporting civilian authorities in the management of emergency situations, will also be provided by the forces and capabilities necessary to achieve the level of ambition. 

To guarantee the effectiveness and flexibility of the engagement of the Romanian Armed Forces capabilities, the deployability and sustainability indicators will be taken into account in terms of the percentages approved by allied consensus, as follows:
- 50% of the land forces must be deployable and 10% must be sustainable for a period of more than two years;
- 40% of the air forces must be deployable and 8% must be sustainable; - 80% of the naval forces must be deployable and 28% must be sustainable. In the short term, the Romanian Armed Forces must be able to maintain a high level of readiness for national defence, to develop the necessary capabilities for the participation in the collective defence of NATO allies and in mutual assistance within the EU, to contribute to the missions and operations under the auspices of international organizations with responsibilities in the security and defence field, as well as support public authorities in emergency situations, providing assistance to the Romanian population in disaster relief.

In the medium term, the Romanian Armed Forces will become a modern structure of forces able to provide an adequate response to unpredictable threats, to counter a potential surprise aggression and to guarantee the national sovereignty and independence. The Romanian Armed Forces will contribute to the maintenance of the credibility of the Alliance as part of NATO's collective defence system, as well as to regional and international security.

# Chapter 4 Main Directions In The Development Of Defence Capabilities17

Law no. 203/2015 on Defence Planning aligns the Romanian Armed Forces' defence planning process to the similar NATO and EU processes. 

Consequently, the Romanian Armed Forces are developing capabilities in the following areas: command, control and communications, engagement, intelligence, force projection, protection and support.

The capabilities are developed and maintained, taking into account the requirements and actions which include elements of: doctrine, organization, training, leadership, materiel, personnel, facilities and interoperability (DOTLMPFI).

The process of capability development focuses on developing modern forces, adequately equipped, deployable, interoperable, and self-sustainable, for multidimensional protection, with a flexible and efficient command and control system. The process is systemic and interdisciplinary, and is unfolding on medium and long term, by means of the efficient use of the available resources.

The defence capabilities required for the accomplishment of the assigned missions and tasks were set up by means of a strategic defence analysis conducted at the MoND level. Following the analysis, the "*Program of the* 

17 Capability is the ability to conduct actions to fulfil an objective. 
Transformation, Development and Procurement of the Romanian Armed Forces

![43_image_0.png](43_image_0.png)

until 2026 and beyond" was elaborated.

In order to perform the full spectrum of the tasks and missions assumed at national and international levels, the defence capabilities must ensure:
During peacetime: surveillance and early warning; immediate res-
.

ponse and low intensity engagements; participation in counterterrorism activities; provide support to civil authorities; In pre-conflict stage: avoid surprise; protection of the Romanian
•
airspace (integrated into NATINAMDS); exercise control over territorial waters; implementation of crisis response measures; perform deterrence actions; During conflict: strategic defence and repellence of aggression.

.

From an operational perspective, the Romanian Armed Forces develop the following types of capabilities:
Command, control and communications at the strategic, operational l.

and tactical level, communications and information centres, communications and information combat support units of the force structure; Engagement structures: mechanized, infantry, armoured, mountain 2.

troops, artillery, special forces, combat aviation, attack helicopters,

sea and river warships, marine infantry, military police, and psychological operations formations and units; 3. Intelligence structures: intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance formations and units; 4. Force projection structures: tactical airlift, naval support ships and land transportation formations and units; 5. Force protection structures: formations and units of surface-to-air missiles, air defence, combat engineers, CBRN, EOD, mine laying/
mine sweeping, and for the protection of Romanian and foreign military officials; 6. S**upport structures:** operational logistics and sustainment formations and units.

The Romanian Armed Forces will focus their efforts along the following lines of action:
- increasing combat readiness in order to carry out the established missions and tasks at national and international levels;
- implementing the Romanian Armed Forces Concept on the Command and Control of the Force Structure by means of developing a command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance system (C4ISR) and cyber defence capabilities;
- improving the level of inter-institutional interoperability and streamlining the use of capabilities at national level to ensure the coherence and complementarity of specific missions and tasks;

- increasing the operational level of intelligence structures and special operation forces in order to safeguard and promote the fundamental interests of Romania and its citizens, wherever necessary, during peacetime, in crisis, and at war.

# Chapter 5 Integrated Management Policies For Defence Resources

Resources allocated to national defence qualitatively define the defence policy of Romania, pointing out the efficiency and effectiveness requirements to be met in achieving the objectives assigned.

![47_image_0.png](47_image_0.png)

![47_image_1.png](47_image_1.png)

The recent economic developments and the European financial difficulties have highlighted the necessity to rethink the resource allocation mechanisms, especially their use, efficiency being the primary criterion. 

At national, allied and UE level, the opportunity of developing multinational defence approaches ("Smart Defence", "Connected Forces Initiative", 
"Framework Nation Concept", respectively "Pooling and Sharing") were 

emphasized, implying innovative solutions for an optimal resource management, through prioritized investments and multinational financing of common interest capabilities, all of them aimed at enhancing the security of member states. 

The general objective of integrated management of defence resources is the optimization of planning, allocation and employment of MoND 
resources.

The implementation of the general objectives on short and medium terms requires the consideration of the following aspects:
- improving the reaction capability of the defence planning system in order to provide variants, options and solutions in support of the decision making process whenever additional requests or budgetary constraints occur;
- improving the MoND Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Evaluation System and its correlation with the system of public policies development, coordination and planning at the central public administration level;
- improving the activity planning process, especially by means of achieving a better correlation with the available resources, and improving the resource estimation system;
- improving the system of accountability and allocation of resources, especially the material and financial ones;
- ensuring an optimal balance between "goods and services" expenditures and those allocated to the personnel, similar to other NATO 
members' models;
- continuing to develop capabilities within the multinational NATO 
and EU framework through the use of defence multinational initiatives ("Framework Nation Concept" "Smart Defence", "Connected Forces Initiative", respectively "Pooling and Sharing").

- adopting joint programs for several armed services, and developing dual-use capabilities - civilian and military.

The integrated management of defence resources is performed through maintaining an active relation with the other structures in the national defence system, public order and national security, or with responsibilities/assignments related to national defence, both for designing/applying operational and force employment plans and for setting up non-military capabilities and production facilities.

## Defence Planning

![49_Image_0.Png](49_Image_0.Png)

Defence planning, as an attribute and a core component of defence policy, is the process that underlies the transformation and modernization of the defence domain and includes all the programs, actions and measures initiated by Romania for identifying, developing and preparing the military and non-military capabilities required to perform the missions and implement the defence objectives, in order to:
meet the obligations specified in the republished Romanian Consti-
●
tution, and in the legislation in the field; fulfill Romania's collective defence and security commitments within
•
NATO;
•
.

participate in the EU Common Security and Defence Policy; fulfill Romania's commitments on international military defence cooperation with other nations, and comply with the obligations assumed by participating in the activity of other international organizations or in other situations regulated by international law, under the conditions of the legislation.

The Defence planning and the management of defence resources in the Ministry of National Defence are conducted in a modern, integrated and multi-annual approach. The core of this type of management is represented by the integrated defence planning which designates the coordination of the process of development and maintenance of military capabilities in order to meet the

defence policy goals as well as those of financial resource allocation. To reach the objectives of the defence policy, the MoND sets specific goals and priorities corresponding to the defence planning domains, which are harmonized within the process of integrated defence planning. 

Defence planning is achieved by the coherent integration of the objectives and actions specific to the following domains: force planning; armament planning; command, control and communications; logistics; civil emergencies; resources; air defence; air traffic management; defence intelligence; the medical field; research and development; standardization, and cyber defence.

The Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Evaluation System (PPBES) 
has an important role in this process, representing a robust and efficient management instrument, able to ensure both the elaboration and implementation of the defence policy, and an efficient audit on the achievement of its goals, the execution of major programs and the use of the resources allocated to the Ministry of National Defence. The decisions regarding the planning and allocation of defence resources, including the Defence Planning Guidance, are approved by the Defence Planning Council of the Ministry of National Defence.

## Management Of Human Resources

High quality, sufficient human resources represent a prerequisite for an outstanding performance of the military system. Therefore, this requires a comprehensive approach of all activities that include the planning, recruiting, selecting, promoting, developing and managing of the career of the military and civilian personnel that form the body of professionals within the defence sector and contribute to the success of the missions entrusted to the Ministry of National Defence.

Implicitly, the adaptation of the Romanian Armed Forces to the realities of the current security environment has to consider the optimization of the entire system of defence resource management. 

The following priorities are taken into consideration: increasing the

![51_image_0.png](51_image_0.png)

attractiveness of the military profession, the management of the personnel career, and the transformation of military education.

## Increase The Attractiveness Of The Military Profession

The Romanian Armed Forces use human resource management policies that constantly focus on ensuring the necessary conditions to provide candidates fit for military service, in the necessary numbers and meeting the established quality standards, in order to be able to carry out their missions and objectives assumed.

The promotion of the military profession in order to attract and retain suitable human resources, from a qualitative and quantitative perspective, represents a strategic domain with a powerful impact, both on the capacity to respond to the current security environment challenges, and on training the population and preparing the territory for defence.

The fact that the military career is currently less attractive in relation to national professional and educational offers, as well as the changes in the structure and dimension of the Armed Forces, the level of skills and attitudes necessary to achieve the performance standards required by the missions and operations carried out by the Romanian Armed Forces, demands the employment of efficient methods to attract the youth to the military field, as well as the cooperation with the civilian environment and local communities.

The advertising of the military career is based on a specific strategy, which involves the mass-media and public relations structures.

In this respect, mixed modern marketing techniques will be adopted -
(simultaneously using direct contact with the candidates, commercial advertising, information activities and public relations within the Romanian Armed Forces) - targeted advertising messages, as well as the use of symbols and specific features of the military system.

Furthermore, the feedback provided by the implementation of the system of recruitment, training and education of the voluntary reserve will also be exploited.

As a consequence, the efforts in this area will focus on:
- using the virtual space as the prevalent advertising environment, primarily to convey messages and to communicate with potential candidates, by means of an attractive recruiting site and social networks;
- conducting annual comprehensive campaigns that combine getting in touch with the potential candidates in a direct and personal manner with the public relations and advertising activities;
- developing messages and actions aimed at preventing the values promoted by the Armed Forces' values in society from becoming obsolete.

## Management Of Personnel Career

The need for increased organizational performance, stemming from the requirement that the Armed Forces be able to provide a rapid response to any challenge of the current complex and changing security environment, makes career management one of the main vectors of the professional competence development of the Romanian Armed Forces personnel.

Military career evolution is indissolubly linked to each military person's education, expertise and professional development potential.

In this context, the dynamics of the processes that are connected to the career management (as a competence-based performance management) requires the focus on the following trends:
1. developing the structural and organizational framework, able to create a competitive and motivational environment for military career development by means of:
- reorganizing military structures, redefining positions, and establishing layered organizational entities, based on the principles of effectiveness and efficiency; 52 rigorous planning of the human resource provision, based on the

![53_image_0.png](53_image_0.png) short, medium and long terms prognosis on the professional competences required, using the standards for military occupations; implementing efficient principles and rules for the organizational
.

planning of the individual military career, in accordance with the required human resources from the quantitative and qualitative point of view; 2. improving the methodological subsystem of career management in terms of:
its correlation with the cyclic plans of human resource provision;
•
increase in predictability and transparency when it comes to career
.

advancement, by implementing an efficient selection and promotion system based on meritocracy; assurance an optimal level of professional mobility.

.

## Transformation Of Military Education

The transformation of military education is focused on the change of training paradigm, by directing the resources to the training and professional development of leaders, combatants and specialists able to respond to the continuous changes in the operational environment, based on their professional

skills and in accordance with the requirements of the future structures of the Romanian Armed Forces.

Military education has to ensure an integrated approach to education and training processes, to make a decisive contribution to the attraction and retention of qualified human resources with a high potential for the military career, as well as to their efficient integration.

In this regard, the trends in this area are: 
- full correlation between the objectives of education and study programs and the requirements of the beneficiaries;
- identification of skills the graduates need in order to meet the standards required by the beneficiary in their job descriptions; the elaboration and accreditation of the initial and continuous training programs for the military personnel, in line with the human resource management;
- modernization of the military education system by developing new training modules/profiles, in keeping with: the evolution of the military phenomenon, the dynamics of the security environment, the requirements of the structures and the mission;
- improvement of the officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers' training by reorganizing the military education institutions and units under an integrated and unitary management;
- development and reinforcement of the cooperation with the NATO and EU Member States' military education institutions so that their institutions should train our staff that is to be appointed in units assigned to NATO/EU, as well as the personnel designated to operate the new weapon systems/equipment purchased through procurement programs.

## Increase In The Personnel'S Life Quality

The main objectives are:
- improving the legal framework for the remuneration of the Armed Forces personnel, within the single remuneration system for state employees, depending on the national social and economic realities,

![55_image_0.png](55_image_0.png) in accordance with the practices of other NATO member states' armed forces; providing accommodation for deployed Armed Forces personnel, by means of improving the legal and institutional framework as far as the monthly rent compensation is concerned;
�
.

•
modernizing the Armed Forces medical system, by increasing the quality of medical activity as an essential component for the personnel and their families' life quality, as well as for military pensioners; modifying and updating the legislation and procedures that regulate the issues of veterans, injured/disabled and the families of the deceased in military actions in order to correspond to the provisions of the connected national legislation and to the practices/trends of NATO
member states; optimizing social dialogue in order to develop a more efficient mechanism of communication with the Armed Forces personnel; developing and implementing an integrated management system for social problems of the Armed Forces personnel and their families, with a focus on veterans, injured/disabled and the families of the deceased in military actions; developing valuable partnerships with the governmental and non-governmental entities that can contribute to the development of social projects for the Ministry of National Defence with external funds or other resources that do not draw from the budget of the military institution.

## Management Of Financial Resources

The management of MoND financial resources aims at ensuring the funding of specific activities and measures in the Major Programs, in accordance with Law no. 203/2015 on defence planning.

. .

•

This process is carried out according to the national legislation, namely Law no. 500/2002 on public finance, with its ulterior alterations and additions, Law no. 69/2010 on fiscal and budgetary responsibility, with its ulterior alterations and additions, the Annual Budget Laws, the State Insurance Budget Laws, as well as other national pieces of legislation, aiming at adapting the military financial system to the requirements of the public finance system.

At the same time, in relation to NATO, EU and other international organizations, the management of financial resources is also taking into account the general financial rules of these organizations, as well as those deriving from agencies, programs or other cooperation formats operating on the basis of memoranda or joint agreements. 

## Management Of Defence Procurement

The Management of Defence Procurement is meant to ensure the efficient use of the public funds allocated for the acquisition of goods, services and works necessary for the armed forces, in a competitive context, based on the economic criteria for the assignment of a public acquisition contract and on the principles of the legislation in force.

The main objective of the management of defence procurement is the acquisition, depending on the resources allocated for defence, of modern armament systems and military equipment which uses modern technology suitable to fulfill the needs of the Armed Forces' branches of service, in conformity with the requirements of each stage, and to ensure the interoperability with NATO and the EU. 

Reaching these goals implies: - improving the system of integrated defence procurement management;
- permanently adapting the defence procurement policies in the Annual Programs of Public Procurement to defence planning and the resources allocated in this respect; ensuring a proper balance in the allocation of funds for procurement,

![57_image_0.png](57_image_0.png)

goods and services, and personnel, similar to those in other NATO
member states; obeying the public procurement regulations for the defence and security domains, in accordance with national and European directives; improving the implementation of defence procurement regulations; enhancing colaboration with the economic operators in the defence industry involving and stimulating them in the production of the military equipment for defence endowment, to meet the requirements of the Romanian Armed Forces and the standards of NATO and EU, as well as developing these operators' capability perform technical maintenance, and personnel and instructor training; planning the investments in the endowment sector in accordance with the Romanian Armed Forces' missions within NATO and EU,
and with the national security requirements; participating in NATO and EU projects/ programs for the common development of weapon systems and military equipment; participating in the projects of NATO 'Smart Defence' and EU 'Pooling and Sharing' initiatives; coordinating our country's own investments with those granted by the US Government and those of the NATO Security Investment Programme/NSIP;
performing acquisitions through the specialized NATO agencies;

WHITE PAPERON DEFENCE
- adopting joint procurement programs and developing 'dual-use' capabilities;
- the continuous training of the personnel with responsibilities in the procurement field;
- maintaining and developing military research, expertise and technical consultancy capabilities and developing testing and assessment capabilities of the Ministry of National Defence;
- ensuring specific control for importation and exportation of special goods;
- standardizing and optimizing the quality control process of the providers of military technology and equipment, as well as ensuring the compatibility of the existing armament and equipment with those owned by the Armed Forces of the NATO member states.

In order to fulfill these objectives, the Romanian Ministry of National Defence has implemented the Integrated Defence Procurement System, a modern instrument for monitoring the procurement programs, similar to other such instruments in NATO member states, which identifies and determines not only the needs and requirements for new weapons but also the priorities regarding the necessary resources, and coordinates and controls the procurement process

## Management Of Research, Development And Innovation Activities (Rdi)

The domain of scientific research, technological development and innovation contributes to the endowment of the Romanian Armed Forces with advanced weapons systems by participating in the development of essential endowment programs in cooperation with internal or external strategic partners and by transferring state-of-the-art technologies to the national defence industry. 

Research, development and innovation in the field of defence provide the scientific and technological support necessary to accomplish the missions assigned to the Romanian Armed Forces, by means of developing and capita-

![59_image_0.png](59_image_0.png) lizing their own scientific and technological potential, pursuing the efficient management of the allocated resources and the attraction of resources from the civilian internal and international environment. The scientific and technological research is performed by the specialized institutions within the Ministry of National Defence, by higher education military institutions and other structures appointed through norms and instructions.

The objectives of research, development and innovation in the field of defence are:
.

.

.

•
.

to increase performance by means of: achieving the goals and development priorities of operational capabilities for different branches of service; to maintain and develop national scientific and technological competence in the field of defence; to restore and strengthen the institutional connections among the following entities: research, industrialization and beneficiary.

to ensure own resources by: increasing allowances for scientific research in major programs of the Ministry of National Defence; to develop the RDI infrastructure, including by means of accessing structural funds; to develop the human resources involved in the research activity and to improve attractiveness for young specialists; to involve the national defense industry in the public, private partnerships on the RDI dimension in order to create new technologies with dual use; to become involved in the development of multinational programs and projects in the field of defence research and development, by participating in multinational consortia in order to attract funds based on contracts awarded under competitive conditions by the EU
programs; to ensure the national contribution to the fulfillment of NATO and the European Defense Agency (EDA) objectives in the field of longterm capabilities, the defence against terrorism, threat detection and WHITE PAPERON DEFENCE
early warning, by participating in the joint programs and initiatives coordinated by NATO or EDA; 
- to cooperate with the private sector in RDI activities by attracting the private civilian and governmental scientific community to the RDI projects financed from the Ministry of National Defence budget.

## Management Of Defence Infrastructure

In accordance with the efforts made for reaching the objectives in defence infrastructure it is essential to preserve the integrity and developing the real estate assets of the Romanian Armed Forces at a level that meets the requirements of the specific missions.

For this purpose, there have been increased endeavors to adapt the legal framework to the construction domain, complying with the main requirements regarding construction quality and allocating the necessary resources to meet the objectives.

Special attention is paid to the regulations on land sales in order to preserve the real estate assets in the property of the state under the administration of the Ministry of National Defence.

## The Objectives Of The Defence Real Estate Infrastructure

The following aspects are taken into account:
- the improvement of the policies of real estate infrastructure development in accordance with the real needs of the users of this infrastructure by means of prioritisation;
- the improvement of the anticipation capacity regarding the need for real estate facilities by means of an enhanced process of gathering information on the condition and reabilitation needs of the construc-

![61_image_0.png](61_image_0.png) tions within the Ministry of National Defence barracks;
.

•
the development of the methodological, organizational and informational framework to participate in the projects financed with European non-reimbursable funds; the modernization/reconfiguration of the military infrastructure (training and assignment) function of the potential scenarios of a conventional military aggression, while taking into account the operationalization of the Allied command and control structures established on the national territory, and the requirements of the Host nation support for possible NATO forces deployed in Romania in the case of a military aggression.

The optimization of the MoND development policy on real estate infrastructure requires the compliance with a minimum set of requirements to preserve the stability of the legal framework for the public funded real estate investments as any disturbance at national level may cause a domino effect with a negative impact on the deadlines of infrastructure objectives.

The short and medium terms priorities to fulfill these objectives are:
to correlate the military infrastructure with the revised missions
.

and force structure, the development of military capabilities and the requirements for a balanced posture/deployment of forces on the national territory; to disable an infrastructure and relocate, where possible, the forces to
.

other locations and resort to the joint use of the same facilities with the goal to reduce the number of buildings in use; to adapt the national legislation regarding the achievement of real
•
estate investment objectives of the Ministry of National Defence to the provisions of the NATO administrative and legal framework in order to develop NSIP projects in a timely manner; to reduce the functioning expenses of units by identifying, testing
•
and implementing alternative solutions;

In the long term, the activity will focus on: - fulfilling real estate investment objectives by means of public-public and public-private partnerships.

62
- to develop the necessary legal framework so that the Ministry of National Defence can benefit from the EU operational regional/sectorial funding programs for the rehabilitation of buildings under its administration.

Special importance will be given to the implementation of the real estate infrastructure projects stemming from the Strategic Partnership with the United States of America, and to those ensuring the prepositioning of Allied military equipment on the national territory.

# Chapter 6 Financial Resources

A coherent and credible defence policy needs adequate financial resources. Law no. 6/2017 on State Budget for 2017 sets 2% of the GDP for the MoND 
budget.

An efficient allocation of financial resources is the cornerstone for the development of the future capabilities required by the transformation of Romania's Armed Forces into a modern organization. The planning and programming of defence financial resources aim at meeting the defence policy objectives set in this Paper and this is achieved by means of the MoND Major Programs.

This budget allocation fully corresponds to the NATO decision concerning defence resources, adopted in 2014 - *The Wales Summit Pledge on* Defence Investment18 and it proves Romania's adequate implementation of this decision.

The budget for 2017 (16.322 billion lei, i.e. 2% of the GDP - budget credits) provides a solid ground for speeding up the modernization of Romania's Armed Forces. Thus, major equipment procurement accounts for 46.61% of 

18 The member states pledge to achieve **2% of the GDP for defence** in a period of ten years (until 2024), with the specifics of each group of allies (members who reached that level will maintain it, the others will gradually increase their defence spending based on their economic growth). Moreover, the document recommends the allocation of 20% of the defence budget for **major equipment procurement** and R&D activities, as well as improving individual results concerning the level of deployment and sustainability of forces.

63
the overall budget (7.608 billion lei), well above the 20% of the defence budget in the Wales Summit Pledge on Defence Investment.

At the same time, the budgetary allocation proves the coherence, validity, and especially, the materialization of the National Political Agreement signed by all the Parliamentary parties on January 13th, 2015 regarding **the allocation** 
of at least 2% of the GDP in 2017 to the defence budget and the maintenance of this level for the following ten years.

The Agreement is essential as it ensures the predictability of the Romanian Armed Forces' procurement of modern combat equipment, as well as the development of cooperation projects between our national defence industry and similar foreign companies.

The allocation of resources for the transformation, modernization and endowment of the Romanian Armed Forces capabilities/structures shall be made according to the priorities set by the *Program of transformation, development and procurement of the Romanian Armed Forces by 2026 and beyond,*
including the build-up and refilling of stocks.

The financial allowances for the modernization of military endowment by means of new acquisition programs, modernization and/or general overhaul of the existing equipment will target the following categories: 
- track and wheeled combat vehicles - armoured personnel carriers, MBTs, infantry fighting vehicles and their derivatives;
- field artillery systems - MLRS, self-propelled 155 mm and 105 mm howitzer, including ammunition;
- C4ISR systems - integrated communication information systems, brigade and division C2, specific equipment for tactical air controllers' teams (JTAC), satellite communication system (SATCOM), 
network security systems, IT strategic equipment stocks, software etc;
- individual and group armament and equipment - individual and collective CBRN detection and protection systems, NATO type individual weapons and specific equipment, including those for special forces, portable antitank missile systems, advanced individual combat systems;

# Final Remarks

In the current geopolitical context, security and, implicitly, defence, exceed the competences and capabilities of a single state. In Romania's case, its belonging to the Euro-Atlantic system of values and its status as a NATO and EU member, as well as its strategic partnership with the USA, provide the necessary security guarantees - the strongest in its entire history - based on the principles of Allied solidarity and indivisibility, namely the durability of the transatlantic relationship. 

The White Paper on Defence presents the perspective of the Ministry of National Defence on the consolidation of the Romanian Armed Forces operational capability and the development of adequate defence capabilities necessary to fulfill its missions.

A very important aspect in the implementation of the defence policy coordinates, based on the national political Agreement regarding the increase on defence financing, refers to the allocation by the Government of 2% of the GDP to the defence budget for the year 2017, corresponding to the Allied decisions adopted at the NATO Wales Summit in 2014 and to those on burden sharing adopted by the NATO heads of state and Government at their meeting in Brussels, in May 2017.

The strategic defence analysis is the process that assesses the fulfillment of defence policy objectives and the validity of the White Paper provisions two years after its approval. Based on the conclusions of the strategic defence analysis, if necessary, the White Paper review is initiated.
