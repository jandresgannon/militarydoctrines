### LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT

_In constant quest of freedom, peace and openness to the_
_world, Lebanon lives in the middle of a sensitive and turbulent_
_geopolitical spot on the Eastern Coast of the Mediterranean,_
_a region which has witnessed for decades conflicts and_
_confrontations whose interactions have affected it and whose_
_dangers are lingering._

_Since the dawn of Independence and up to the moment,_
_Lebanon’s modern history has testified that stability in our_
_nation depends on the international community’s paramount_
_understanding of its reality, and its support to face the issues_
_and challenges that were thrust upon it by the region’s events,_
_on top of which the issues of the Palestinian Refugees, the_
_Syrian Displaced, as well as Israel’s threats and constant violations of its sovereignty._
_History also testifies that Lebanon’s internal stability is consolidated through its_
_tenacious national unity, the powerful cohesion between its various components, and_
_the active role undertaken by its military and security organs, namely: the Lebanese_
_Army, the Internal Security Forces, the General Security, the State Security, and the_
_Lebanese Customs. This role aims at resisting any assault against the nation’s land_
_and any aggression targeting it, guaranteeing the sovereignty of the State and the_
_safety of the citizens, promoting civil peace, protecting the borders, safeguarding_
_the democratic system, public freedoms and human rights, countering terrorism_
_and preventing crime and drug smuggling and trafficking, and honoring Lebanon’s_
_obligations towards international resolutions._

_There is no doubt that the wave of chaos and bloody confrontations that invaded a_
_number of the region’s countries throughout the recent years and turned into wars,_
_violence and world-threatening obscurantist terror, infiltrated across the borders of_
_Lebanon into its interior. The entire world has borne witness to the achievements of_
_the Lebanese Army and our security institutions which have adopted a preemptive_
_approach in the face of the armed terrorist organizations and their undercover cells._
_Indeed, the battle “Fajr Al Jouroud” (the Dawn of the Barrens) carried out in the_
_summer of 2017 represented a crushing victory for the Army against the terrorist_
_armed men, thus consolidating our country’s safety net and preventing the danger_
_of expansion of terrorism from Lebanon._


_Out of national duty, we, the political, military and security officials of Lebanon, are_
_striving to accomplish the military and security strategy whose major headlines were_
_defined in my inaugural speech and included in the Ministerial declaration of the_
_present cabinet. This strategy relies essentially on promoting the Army’s capabilities,_
_ensuring the requirements of the military and security organs in terms of equipment_
_and personnel, providing them with sophisticated and quality weapons, enhancing_
_the competency of their troops with modern and specialized training in order to_
_enable them to perform actively and sustainably the missions assigned to them, to_
_protect Lebanon and prevent the regional fires from getting to it, to face any Israeli_
_assault against our land, and to pursue the constructive and vital cooperation_
_with the “UNIFIL” force which is active in South Lebanon in line with its duties to_
_implement Resolution 1701._

_Our country is grateful to the brotherly and friendly States which have believed,_
_over the past years, in the importance of providing support for the Lebanese Army,_
_and have contributed to responding to its pressing logistic and military needs. The_
_capabilities development plans for the Lebanese Army and military and security_
_institutions, adopted by the political authority in view of being submitted to the_
_Rome II Conference, hereby complete this cooperation which has proved efficient_
_and important, not only to ensure Lebanon’s stability and prosperity, but also to_
_prevent it from becoming a conflict and risk-generating arena whose negative fallout_
_may spread to the Middle East region and the world._

_The current security challenges are the most dangerous for the future of the States,_
_especially in this volatile region of the world. Nothing suggests that the coming days_
_will not bring further destabilizing challenges which imply some dangers that are_
_obvious to us all. Our strategic objective to protect our nation makes it imperative to_
_provide our national army and military and security institutions with the necessary_
_quality means to enable them to face the growing challenges, in order to remain the_
_safety valve at all stages and under all circumstances. This is a suitable opportunity_
_to deepen cooperation with our friends within the Rome II Conference, to contribute_
_to the region’s security and stability, and to cross together, States and peoples, over_
_to peace, tranquility and prosperity._

### LETTER FROM THE LETTER FROM THE PRIME MINISTER MINISTER OF INTERIOR AND MUNICIPALITIES


_For the past decade, we have channeled all efforts towards_
_building the Internal Security Forces into a strong institution._
_One that assumes a more central role in thwarting terrorism_
_and crime and above all advancing rule of law._

_The safety and security of the Lebanese citizens is at the core_
_of the ISF’s values. Our sons and daughters drawn from across_
_the nation have demonstrated a true sense of service to the_
_community, protecting our families, our streets, our schools_
_and our places of worship._

_The Five Year Strategic Plan – the first of its kind – provides_
_an ambitious vision for the future of the ISF and sets a road_
_map for a qualitative transformation of this institution into a modern police service,_
_with a focus on professionalism, community policing, protecting human rights,_
_countering terrorism and most importantly building trust and a solid partnership_
_with the citizens and the community as a whole._

_It also stresses the strengthening of a strategic cooperation with the Lebanese Armed_
_Forces by taking more responsibility for internal security._

_I am a firm believer that female representation in the security institutions must_
_increase to demonstrate the true potential of our society. The Strategic Plan reflects_
_this belief._

_I am confident that the Internal Security Forces will embark on this journey with_
_commitment and dedication and will be considering the public’s trust in the_
_institution as the key measure of success._

###### Saad Hariri


_From the first day I assumed office as Minister of Interior_
_and Municipalities, one of the key issues I have been committed_
_to was developing the strategic capabilities of the Internal_
_Security Forces as well as supporting their evolution into a_
_planning-oriented agency, capable of nurturing a closer, more_
_positive rapport with the citizens they serve and protect._

_Today, following a year of extensive efforts, initially led by_
_former Director General Ibrahim Basbous and subsequently_
_his successor Director General Emad Osman, working_
_together with the chief of ISF Academy and Head of Strategic_
_Planning Team General Ahmad Al-Hajjar, the completion of_
_this strategic document has become a reality. For the first_
_time throughout its long history of service, the ISF now has a well-defined, coherent_
_five-year plan that shall enable it to evolve into a world-class police service._

_During the last decade, ISF has faced many challenges and soldiered through_
_many menacing threats both locally and regionally at the most critical of times. As_
_Lebanon adhered to a policy of open borders towards the Syrian crisis, the ISF was_
_called upon to police a million-plus displaced Syrians scattered all over Lebanon, in_
_addition to Palestinians and other residents. Being well aware of the crucial role it_
_plays in providing security and stability, the ISF has never faltered in its duties. It has_
_succeeded in apprehending tens of lone-wolf terrorists and hundreds of cells which_
_they dismantled with minimal or no loss of life or property. All these achievements_
_were part of the ISF’s proactive mindset despite the critical lack in resources and_
_adequate equipment._

_The plan, which I present to you today, will unequivocally pave the way for a modern,_
_trusted police force that will set the standard for other public agencies._

_Throughout the performance of its duties, the ISF will firmly abide by international_
_regulations and provisions, and more importantly will fully serve and protect the_
_public equally without any discrimination._

_In planning for the strategic development of the ISF, we envisage a day where the_
_Lebanese government has monopolized the use of force throughout Lebanon’s_
_territory, and where the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) can return to its original_
_constitutional duty of protecting the Lebanese borders while leaving the duty of_
_protecting and maintaining internal peace and security to the ISF._


-----

_Finally, this comprehensive plan embodies the continuous efforts exerted by the_
_committed officers of the ISF as well as the exceptional cooperative relationship they_
_developed with our international partners, primarily in the United Kingdom._

_I sincerely hope that this plan and vision will be fully implemented, paving the way_
_for more successes in the not-so-distant future._

###### Nouhad al Machnouk


### LETTER FROM THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE ISF

_Great responsibilities rest upon the shoulders of the Internal_
_Security Forces (ISF); responsibilities towards the society, the_
_nation, the constitutional authorities, and responsibilities_
_towards the international community and other security and_
_law enforcement partners around the world. The institution_
_must therefore remain abreast of the latest developments in_
_policing. With this goal in sight, the ISF is continuously seeking_
_to develop its processes, improve its professionalism and_
_enhance its technical performance._

_Our work revolves around people: Protecting them and_
_their property, and supporting victims of crime. We are also_
_entrusted with the mission of keeping communities safe,_
_namely by combatting terrorism, curbing trafficking in drugs and persons, providing_
_traffic management services, and ensuring prisons are guarded and well managed._

_It is therefore necessary for us to put forward a strategic plan that takes into account_
_all the recent developments in policing methods, with our vision “Together towards_
_a safer society” pointing the way forward. Through the implementation of this plan,_
_we hope to achieve results that live up to the expectations of all – governmental_
_authorities, oversight bodies, and the community – under the slogan “Service - Trust_

_- Partnership.”_

_We will strive to implement this plan by providing exemplary security services utilizing_
_the most modern resources available. This includes enhanced automation and_
_means of communication, improved human resource management, and upgraded_
_equipment and buildings, all of which will help us fulfil our duties efficiently and_
_effectively._

_Our strategic plan constitutes, in and of itself, a commitment to serving the_
_community, as its fulfillment will reinforce trust between community members and_
_the ISF. The efforts we deploy will become ever more determined as we seek to instill_
_the culture of service and improve the quality of our performance, with the aim of_
_implementing this plan in all its various aspects._

_My hope and wish is that we reach a safer world, together._

###### Major General Imad Osman

ISF STRATEGIC PLAN I 2018-2022


### INTRODUCTION

Established in 1861, the Internal Security Forces
is one of the oldest institutions in Lebanon. Over
its 150-year history, the ISF has had to constantly
adapt and evolve to fulfil its mission as stated in
Article 1 of Law 17/90, which outlines the ISF’s
administrative, judicial, and other duties. As part
of its deep-rooted commitment towards serving
the Lebanese community, the ISF has adopted
a five-year Strategic Plan. The ISF Strategic Plan
2018-2022 will allow the institution to fulfil its
mission, meet the expectations of the people
of Lebanon, and take a significant step forward
in its ongoing transition to a modern policing
service.

Over the past decade, the ISF has continued to
work proactively with its local and international
partners to successfully disrupt terrorist plots
that have threatened both Lebanon and the
international community. Over the last three
years, the ISF has detained over 300 terrorist
suspects and dismantled over 60 terrorist cells.

The ISF has also sought to improve its crime
fighting capabilities through improved forensics
and crime scene management, and has
introduced measures to enhance Human Rights
protection and address community concerns.

Yet today, the threats to Lebanon’s national
security are significant. Terrorism remains a
primary concern, while globalization and the
digital age have brought new security concerns
and exacerbated others, including the rise of
violent extremism. In Lebanon, these challenges
are compounded by the evolving situation in
Syria and the continued presence of displaced
Syrians on Lebanese territory, which has given
rise to new public safety issues that pose
considerable challenges for the ISF.


ISF STRATEGIC PLAN I 2018-2022

The ISF has therefore set a clear strategic
direction that will allow it to meet the evolving
security needs of Lebanon. The plan centers
on two institutional trajectories: The will to
change from a police force to a police service
adhering to a set of values that ensure respect
for individual rights and responsiveness to
community concerns; and the need to evolve
from traditional to modern policing techniques
in order to fight crime more effectively.

Recognizing that the safety and security
challenges of the 21st Century cannot be met
exclusively through traditional means, the
ISF is committed to institutionalizing a more
community-oriented policing style that forges
sustainable partnerships between the ISF and
citizens to build a safer community for all.

The ISF Strategic Plan 2018-2022 constitutes the
foundation of this organizational transformation.
The plan draws on international best practice
and is based on findings from a Strategic Review
of the ISF conducted with the assistance of
international partners. The findings of the review
were based on public survey data, meetings
with external stakeholders, and thorough
consultations with ISF personnel from all ranks
and units. It therefore constitutes a valuable
evidence-base for the current plan, fostering
a shared understanding of safety concerns
between the ISF and the community it serves
while ensuring that the needs of ISF personnel
are reflected in the plan’s objectives.


The ISF has always worked alongside the
Lebanese Armed Forces and other security
agencies to ensure the safety of all of Lebanon’s
inhabitants. The realization of this Strategic
Plan will contribute to the ISF’s capability to
assume full responsibility for internal security
within Lebanon and shoulder all of its missions
as prescribed in Lebanese law. This in turn will
allow the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) to focus
on its core duties while remaining ready to
support the ISF whenever needed.

The Lebanese government has committed
resources to achieve the Strategic Plan’s
objectives and components of the plan are
already being implemented. With clarity of
purpose, the ISF is seeking the support of all its
partners to keep Lebanon safe for generations
to come.

ISF STRATEGIC PLAN I 2018-2022


#### STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE


### ENHANCE PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE COMMUNITY


Building partnerships with the
community is a cornerstone of moving
towards a community-based approach
to policing. Promoting communication
and collaboration between the police
and the community will help to more
effectively and efficiently identify,
prevent and solve problems of crime
and safety.

As a reflection of its profound
belief in the importance of building
partnerships with the community, the
ISF is continuously striving to enhance
and embed those partnerships as
a means of positively impacting on
the efficiency of police work and
perceptions of community safety.
This integrated approach between
police and citizen is directed towards
a common goal of securing the safety
of the entire community.


Placing the citizen and community
at the center of its work, over the
next five years the ISF will work
towards institutionalizing this modern
approach to policing service across
the organization. The ISF will also seek
to build further partneships with civil
society actors in relevant fields.


##### TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, WE WILL:

###### • Institutionalize a more community-oriented policing style
 • Adopt an ISF communication strategy
