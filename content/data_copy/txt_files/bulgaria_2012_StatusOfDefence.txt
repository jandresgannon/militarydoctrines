**1.** **INTRODUCTION**


The 2011 Annual report on the status of Defence and the Armed forces of the Republic of

Bulgaria was elaborated on the basis of article 23 of the Law on Defence and the Armed Forces of
the Republic of Bulgaria. In addition to the above-quoted legal commitment, during the past year
quarterly reports on the activities of the Ministry of Defence were published as well.

The political efforts in the sphere of defence in 2011 were concentrated on fulfilling the

aims, objectives and priorities set in the National Security Strategy, the National Defence Strategy,
the White paper on Defence and the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria, the Plan for
Development of the Armed Forces (PDAF) and the Investment Plan-Programme of the Ministry of
Defence – 2020 (MoD IPP - 2020).

In 2011 the national defence policy of the Republic of Bulgaria was carried out in a dynamic

and contradictory international security environment. In order to stabilize the situation in
Afghanistan, Libya, the Middle East and other world crises regions, it was necessary to engage
civilian and military capabilities and resources of many different countries, the UN, NATO, the EU
and of other organizations.

The most important achievement in 2011 was that the focus of the defence policy efforts

was categorically put on the combat capabilities of the Bulgarian armed forces – training,
participation in missions and operations abroad and modernization.

In total during the year, 197 exercises were conducted, including 28 large-scale international

joint exercises, which is 34% more than 2010. In order to improve the level of training and the
interoperability of the Armed forces, the effective use of the Bulgarian military facilities together
with the United States continued throughout the year.

In accordance to the approved by the Council of the Ministers scenarios of the Armed Forces,

the MoD elaborated a “Methodology for Wartime Planning” document, drafted a new “State
Wartime Plan”, and a draft “Strategic action plan of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria”.

All planned activities for 2011 regarding the transformation of the organizational structure

and personnel strength of the Armed Forces, as well as with respect to the development of a single
command and control (C2) system both for peacetime and for times of crises were successfully
fulfilled.

The strategic level C2 was restructured as a result of which a new fully integrated MoD was

introduced. An integrated operational level C2 was formed on the basis of the newly established
Joint Forces Command and the Services’ Commands. An achievement was the introduction of the
new command structures and the achieved increase in the efficiency, compatibility and
synchronization in the C2 system. The command structure parameters set in the White paper on
Defence and the Armed Forces were achieved. Implementing the “Top-down” approach in
conducting the reforms, the beginning of the reorganization of the units at the tactical level planned
for the current year were initiated as well.


-----

The improvement of the defence legal framework continued by adopting the Law on

Military police[1] and the Law on the Reserve of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria[2]. A draft
Law on Military Intelligence was also elaborated.

An important priority in 2011 was the modernization of the Armed Forces conceptual and

doctrinal base as a key imperative of the capabilities. A precise and clear hierarchic structure of the
doctrinal documents analogous to the one in NATO and EU was endorsed. A coherent system for
development, coordination, approval and review of the Armed Forces’ doctrines was established.
The most important doctrine – the “Armed Forces Doctrine” was approved as well. It is the capstone
document for the development of the whole set follow on conceptual and doctrinal documents.

In 2011 the operational concepts of the MoD IPP – 2020 “Thirteen priority investment

projects” were also developed.

With respect to the modernization of the Air Force, the projects for acquisition of C-27J

“Spartan” aircraft and of AS 532 AL “Cougar” helicopters were successfully completed. The Naval
Forces took delivery of three AS 565 MB “Panther” helicopters and introduced the EKRAN – “Coastal
surveillance system for shipping and maritime border control” and the Land Forces acquired new
automobile equipment under the contract with Daimler Chrysler.

The MoD actively participated in the formulation of NATO and EU security and defence

policies and provided an adequate contribution towards their implementation through the country’s
participation in expeditionary operations, different defence initiatives and the process of
transformation and reforms. The rotations and sustainment of the of the Bulgarian Armed Forces
contingents in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo were carried out in time. On a short
notice a Bulgarian Naval Forces combat frigate was deployed in the NATO-led “United Protector”
operation in Libya.


**2.** **DEFENCE POLICY PRIORITIES AND APPROACHES**


2.1. DEFENCE POLICY AND THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT


Among the factors exerting major influence upon the security environment in 2011 were the

conflict in Afghanistan; the Middle East and North Africa crises; the world financial and economic
crisis consequences; the asymmetric risks and threats - primarily trans-border terrorism; the
information and energy security and the demographic, ecological and climatic challenges. Parallel to
this the cooperation among countries, international partnership and the comprehensive approach in
dealing with the common problems had a major importance for guaranteeing Global security and
preventing large-scale military conflict.

The asymmetric risks and threats influenced the security environment in 2011. International

terrorism remained one of the most serious threats. The world economic and financial crisis
continued to exert negative influence.

Regionally, the relatively stable security environment in the Western Balkans was due to the

international community’s commitment to settle the problematic issues. It was also due to the
ongoing NATO and EU operations and to availability of common priorities - the development of
regional cooperation and willingness on part of the Western Balkan nations towards NATO and EU
integration. Nevertheless, ethnic confrontation, difficulties in building statehood and religious
radical structures’ activities exerted negative influence upon the security environment.

The Black Sea Region security environment was formed, among other, under the influence of

its growing geo-strategic importance, the presence of “frozen” conflicts, the activities of terrorist
and paramilitary structures, ethnic and religious confrontation, the availability of prerequisites for

2 Promulgated in State Gazette on 09.03.2011


-----

radiological and chemical weapons proliferation, etc. The overall security environment in the region
was favourably influenced by the efforts of the Black Sea countries, including the Republic of
Bulgaria to develop a better regional cooperation and cooperation with NATO and the EU.

The national security of Bulgaria, although indirectly, was also influenced by the ongoing

processes in the region of Central Asia, primarily - the spread of radical religious ideas, illegal drug
trafficking and other trans-national risks.

In Afghanistan, the threat levels remained high due to rebel groups’ terrorist activities whose

actions were directed towards discrediting the Central Government of Afghanistan and to
counteract the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan’s (ISAF) efforts to stabilize the
country. The successful handing over the responsibilities for maintaining public order to the Afghan
national security forces and implementation of the National reconciliation and reintegration
program remain to be challenges to the successful stabilization of the country. The risks and
potential threats to ISAF security, including to the Bulgarian expeditionary contingent remain high.

The security environment in the Middle East and North Africa throughout the year was

influenced by the existence of different conflicts, unstable political system changes in a number of
countries and radical terrorist and extremist group’s activities. The crisis processes in the region
established prerequisites for an increasing influence of organizations sharing Al Qaeda’s ideology
and the legitimatization of different Islamic movements on the political scene. The regime changes
in a number of countries in the Middle East and North Africa and the difficulties in restructuring
their political system, the terrorist and extremist group’s activities, as well as the emerging refugee
flows increased the risks to the security and the interests of Bulgaria and its citizens.

As a whole, the developments within the overall security environment indicate that new
conflicts and crisis situations in different parts of the world could arise in the future which may
threaten the security and national interests of Bulgaria. This requires the maintenance of defence
capabilities consistent with the risks and threats to the national security.

As a member of NATO and the EU, the Republic of Bulgaria contributes to the international

efforts to maintaining peace and stability in the crisis regions. Due to its consistent good neighbourly
policy, Bulgaria continued to play an active role in developing the regional defence cooperation.


2.2. DEVELOPMENT AND FUNCTIONING OF THE MOD AS A MODERN INSTITUTION OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE


The improvement of the defence management process continued to be among the leading

priorities for the MoD throughout the year. The legal base for management of the Integrated
Ministry of Defence (IMoD) and of the Armed forces was improved by the implementation since
March 2011 of the amended Law on defence and the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria. The
MoD Rules and regulations (in force since 1[st] August 2011) removed any duplication of functions and
tasks and restored the synchronization between the military and civilian expertise. The adoption of
the Law on the Military Police and the Law on the Reserve of the Armed Forces created the legal
base framework for conducting the reforms. A draft Law on Military Intelligence was elaborated as
well.

The “Ministerial Guidance on Defence Policy 2011-2014” document issued in April 2011

focused on the transformation of the Armed Forces and the defence capabilities. The document
aims to achieve the stated defence Level of Ambition with respect to the missions and tasks of the
Armed Forces.

During the year a reorganization of the operational level command structure encompassing

the newly created Joint Forces Command, the Services Commands and the structures directly
subordinated to the Minister of Defence was carried out. Transforming the mentioned structures


-----

into second-level budget spenders and giving them a
legal status of independent juridical actors created
better conditions for providing the daily activities of
the Armed Forces and for managing real estate
property.

A significant decrease in the MoD

administrative burden and improvement of the C2
system was also achieved.

(Diagram 1)

In order to increase the efficiency of the

defence decision making process, a Risk Management
Model in Planning of Defence and the Armed Forces
was developed as well.

2.3. MOD TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY


POLICY


2.3.1. EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT AND ELIMINATION OF CONDITIONS FOR CORRUPTION

The MoD Standing Committee on Anti-Corruption[3] concentrated its efforts on preventing the

corruption practices by introducing means to increase the defence policy transparency and
accountability to the Bulgarian society. In 2011 the Standing Committee adopted a MoD Action Plan
aimed at introducing measures for elimination of any conditions for corruption practices throughout
the defence establishment levels where defence policy is formulated and implemented. All MoD
structures and the structures directly subordinated to the Minister of Defence were tasked to apply
the measures set out in the Action Plan.

In compliance with the Action Plan a pilot course on prevention and countering corruption

was conducted in “G.S. Rakovski” Defence Staff College. From 2012, the course will become an
integral part of the College’s curriculum.

The Standing Committee approved and adopted an “Integrity Pact” document which was

signed by the MoD and by all participants in the MoD’s public procurement tenders. By doing so the
sides declared that they shall not allow any conflict of interests or cases of abuse of position-inoffice.

The MoD Inspectorate developed a “Corruption risk assessment methodology” to be used by

the MoD itself, the structures directly subordinated to the Minister of Defence and the Armed
Forces. After conducted inspections and checks in accordance to the Methodology, the corruption
risk during the period was assessed as “LOW”, the exception being the Military Medical Academy
(MMA) where the risk was assessed as “HIGH”. In this view the Minister of Defence approved seven
specific measures for prevention of “high risk” corruption and measures on non-admission of
violations of the financial discipline.

The MoD continued to issue monthly reports comprising established irregularities, facts and

conditions for generation of corruption. These reports were included in the Reports on the
“Fulfilment of the Government and Judiciary schedule of urgent measures and activities on the
implementation of progress indexes in judiciary reform, the struggle against corruption and
organized crime”. No violations with respect to conflict of interest and no cases of corruption were
established.

3 Established in September 2009


-----

A policy of transparency and accountability regarding the actions and activities of the MoD

leadership was consistently implemented. Full public access was constantly provided with respect to
the MoD procurement and tenders procedures. The information on opening public procurement
procedures and their implementation was updated on a daily basis. This allowed equal
opportunities for all companies willing to participate and introduced transparency throughout the
whole process.

In July 2011, the beginning of an active bilateral dialogue between the MoD and different

non-governmental organizations (NGOs) was initiated by issuing of Regular Standing Committee on
Anti-Corruption Bulletins. These Bulletins informed the general public about the anti-corruption
measures taken and the results achieved after their implementation.

The MoD published on its website the “Annual report on the implementation of the

established policies and programs in the Ministry of Defence for 2010”, the “Report on the first six
months of 2011”, information on the fulfilment of the MoD budget for 2011 and the quarterly
“Reports on the activities of the Ministry of Defence”.

2.3.2. INFORMATION POLICY

The MoD information policy was implemented in three dimensions - (1) relations with

central and regional media, (2) spreading of internal information and (3) contacts with NGOs, local
public and individual citizens. The basic principle of the information policy was to provide timely and
objective information about the Bulgarian Armed Forces activities.[4] All approved, adopted or
endorsed strategic documents, concepts, plans, reports and legislative acts were published on the
MoD website. Sociological studies conducted in 2011 showed that the Armed Forces preserve their
traditional leading place with respect to trust among the institutions in Bulgaria. For merits in the
field of providing information, in September 2011 the MoD was awarded a Certificate of Honour for
its contribution in the sphere of freedom of information coinciding with the International “Right to
Know” day. The awarded prize was for the provided information about the conducted activities at
the Central Artillery Technical testing range “Zmeiovo” and was in the category “Institution, which
had organized in the best way the provision of information to the citizens”.

2.3.3. CONTROL AND AUDIT ACTIVITIES

In 2011, the MoD Inspectorate conducted a total of 130 inspections. Seventy eight reports

on the results of the conducted inspections comprising 128 suggestions on ways to eliminate
different system weaknesses and flaws were presented to the Minister of Defence.

During the year 16 signals on MoD or the Commission on Prevention and Counteracting

Corruption to the Council of Ministers websites were registered. Additionally four signals were
registered by the MoD Inspectorate via telephone. All signals were related to different violations
and irregularities concerning abuse of power, incompetent management of state property, irregular
activities of individuals and corruption. Nine of the signals were sent to corresponding competence
structures for undertaking actions, whilst one was suspended due to lack of relevant and concrete
information. The inspection results in two cases were submitted to the Sofia Military District
Prosecutor’s Office and one to the Sofia Military Prosecutor’s Office of Appeals. The results of the
inspections on two signals concerning conflict of interest turned unfounded.

In 2011, the MoD “Information Security” Directorate conducted seven inspections. The

Classified Information Protection System functioned stably and prevented any unauthorized access
to classified information.

4 More than 650 news reports were published on the MoD website and more than 150 written responses were sent to
journalists’ inquiries.


-----

During the period the MoD “Internal Audit” Directorate conducted 31 planned audit

commitments, 5 unscheduled audit commitments aimed at bolstering confidence and 16 Minister of
Defence assigned consultations commitments. The main conclusions stemming are:

     - The Integrity Pact signed by the MoD and the participants in public procurement

tenders considerably decreased the corruption risks;

     - In order to apply the recommendations set in the report of the Peer Review on the

self-assessment of Bulgaria within the framework of the NATO Building Integrity
Initiative, precise and measurable activities with concrete deadlines were
undertaken;

     - Due to delayed procedures on assigning public procurement, several payments were

made to expired terms of validity contracts referring to guarding of real estate
property. Parallel to this, it was necessary to pay for ineffective guarding of property,
with the amount of funds spent on this exceeding the value of the guarded buildings
and facilities themselves.


2.4. FINANCIAL RESOURCES


Based on the Law of the State budget of the Republic of Bulgaria for 2011 and Government

Decree №334/29.12.2010, the MoD defence budget for planned for 2011 was 1 012 240 thousand
BGN, or 1,31% of the GDP.

During the year, the actual MoD budget expenditures amounted to 1 065 987 thousand BGN.

The state subsidy, transfers, etc. were 1 035 623 thousand BGN and MoD generated revenues
amounted to 30 364 thousand BGN, thus reaching 1,42% of the GDP.
The transfer of funds to the Higher Education State Military Schools under the provisions of

function “Education” amounted to 26 186, 7 thousand BGN.
The funds related to financial support of the MoD central administration, distributed within

the framework of the basic sector expenditures were:

  - Personnel - 23 255 thousand BGN/ incl. indemnities - 2 471 thousand BGN.

  - Operations and maintenance - 71 124 thousand BGN.

  - Investment - 7 257 thousand BGN.

The MoD spent funds related to international activities and upkeep of the Bulgarian

Delegations and Representations abroad amounted to 6 552 thousand BGN. The expenditures for
the Armed Forces participation in multinational military formations, coalition operations, NATO, EU
and UN-led operations, joint training and international exercises amounted to 55 803 thousand
BGN. The expenditures for military infrastructure, primarily for security and taxation were 18 940
thousand BGN.

All expenditures were on the basis of the approved limits and priorities, and were in

conformity with the MoD budget for 2011.
Diagram 2 shows the distribution of the expenditures in 2009, 2010 and 2011.

**Diagram 2**


-----

The diagram shows the changes in expenditures directed towards improvement of the

internal distribution of costs and approaching the goal set in the White Paper – balanced budget and
distribution ratio 60%:25%:15%. As a result of the reforms, the percentage of the expenditures for
personnel in 2010 and 2011 has decreased, compared to 2009. The relative share of operations and
maintenance expenditures incl. training has increased, as has increased the relative share of
expenditures related to investment. The twofold investment expenditures figure in 2010 (18%)
compared to 2011 (9%) was due to the additionally allocated funds for payments to old acquisition
contracts.

In accordance with the White Paper adopted by Parliament, the plans and schedules for the
development of the Armed Forces were elaborated on the basis of a defence budget of 1.5% of the
GDP, estimated to 1 128 980,3 thousand BGN. The 2011 MoD budget amounted to 1,42% of the
GDP (incl. funds for the Higher Education state military schools - 29 331,2 thousand BGN). The
limited financial resources and the payments to previous obligations limited the build-up of new
operational capabilities, influenced the maintenance of the existing ones and resulted upon the full
fulfilment of the NATO Force Goals. The situation with the defence budget for 2012 is equivalent.
The current year MoD budget amounts to 1 002 240, 4 thousand BGN, or 1,24% of the GDP. This is
some 210 000 thousand BGN less than required. This fact necessitates the delay of some of the
activities set in the Plan for development of the Armed Forces, delay in the start of key MoD IPP
2020 projects and respectively – delay in the build-up of the necessary operational capabilities of
the Armed Forces.

The following activities were not fully funded by the 2011 MoD budget:

    - operations and maintenance expenditures – for spare parts, lubricants and fuels necessary

to conduct flight training of the Air Force in accordance with NATO Standards, for contract for
regular maintenance of armaments and equipment and for contracts for reconstruction and repairs
of buildings;

    - implementation of the MoD IPP 2020 in its part about the Battalion Battle Group supplying

with armaments, instruments and equipment;

   - implementation of the “Strategy for introduction of Universal mobile telecommunication

systems” and the “Plan for induction of ground digital television broadcasting in the Republic of
Bulgaria” - necessary funds to complete the optimized contracts whose execution has already
started in order to achieve most effectively the necessary capabilities and to harmonize the
frequency spectrum in the Republic of Bulgaria;

    - renewal of the L-39, L-410 aircraft and Mi-24 helicopter flights;

    - conducting AS-532AL “Cougar” helicopters flight activities;

   - further refurbishment and modernization of armaments and equipment under

modernization projects (“second hand” ships);

    - disposal of excess ammunitions;

    - repairs and security of the basic infrastructure;

    - funding of the Military Medical Academy under function “Healthcare” in fulfilling its tasks

of national importance – the funding has not been fully provided for, which lead to the
accumulation of considerable amount of unpaid obligations,

The MoD responded by implementing strict control and pursued efficiency in spending of the

financial resources. In 2011, the Program Council to the Minister of Defence examined on a monthly
basis all issues related to the distribution of the defence resources with respect to the main
programs within the sector policies. Thus the transparent management in the spending of financial
resources and the necessary flexibility in the fulfilment of the MoD Unified Financial Plan for


-----

Materiel Provision for 2011 was guaranteed. Constant control was exerted over the payment limits
in line with the received documentation for accomplished deliveries and services.

A balanced system of efficiency parameters in the implementation of the defence programs

was developed with the aim to apply modern management methods. A continuous analysis and
control through the elaboration of periodic reports on the implementation of the MoD policies and
programs was conducted during the year.

A Defence Programs Risk Management Committee was established in the MoD, the

structures directly subordinated to the Minister of Defence and the Bulgarian Armed forces. Its task
is to conduct monitoring, reporting and control over the overall risk management process of the
defence programs.
A cost evaluation of the whole life cycle of the investment projects from the MoD IPP 2020,

and included in the programs was conducted as well.


2.5. POLICY BUDGET PROGRAMS EXECUTION


**Диаграма 3**


1.


With the adoption of the White Paper, the National Security Strategy, the National Defence

Strategy and the Ministerial Guidance on Defence Policy 2011-2014, for the first time in many
years, in 2011 the processes of planning, programming, budgeting and execution were
conducted within a completely provided strategic framework, defined national interests, aims,
goals and Level of Ambition in defence. In accordance to the Ministerial guidance, since last year
the MoD sector policies were decreased from four to two, namely - sector policy “Defence
capabilities”, and sector policy “Alliance and international security”.

2.5.1. SECTOR POLICY “DEFENCE CAPABILITIES”

The major aim of sector

policy “Defence Capabilities’ is to
build a single set of interoperable
Armed Forces, capable of fulfilling
the whole range of tasks, under a
single C2 system both for peacetime
and in times of crises, with adequate
organization, size, armaments,

equipment and training. This goal is
being implemented by fulfilling
concrete measures and activities,
envisioned to be completed by
2014.

The financial resources spent

under this sector policy amounted
to 975 079 022 BGN, which is 94, 06
% of the total MoD expenditures.

**Диаграма 3**

These resources were allocated
among Main Programs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
and 9, which support the policy, as
exemplified in Diagram 3 and Table

**Table 1**

2.5.2. SECTOR POLICY “ALLIED AND

INTERNATIONAL SECURITY”

The major aim of this sector policy is to actively
participate in formulating NATO and EU security
and defence policies and to adequately contribute
to their implementation. This means increasing the
effectiveness of consultations and decision-making
processes, asserting the Bulgarian interests and
positions during the elaboration of Allied decisions
and documents, in current and future operations,
in defence initiatives and in the processes of
transformation and reforms.


The financial resources spent under this sector policy amounted to 61 587 010 BGN or 5,94 %

of the MoD expenditures. These resources were allocated among main programs 4 and 10 as
exemplified in Diagram 4 and Table 2:

**3.** **ARMED FORCES AND DEFENCE CAPABILITIES**


In 2011 the training, exercises, preparation and

education process in the Bulgarian Armed Forces was
conducted within the limits of the allocated financial
resources. It was aimed at keeping and developing
the existing as well as acquiring new defence
capabilities. The process was in conjunction with the
adopted standards and the established scenarios for
building up of interoperable HQs and formations,
necessary for fulfilling the missions and tasks of the
Armed Forces. An emphasis was laid on the acquiring


-----

of special skills, new techniques, tactics and procedures, and achieving and maintaining the
capabilities necessary for the fulfilment of the full spectrum of tasks, both in peacetime and in
crises. The effective mastering of the planned combat tasks led to an increased professionalism and
high personnel skills.

During the year, the Armed Forces planned 201 exercises of which 197 (98%) were

conducted.

training both as an absolute value and as a percentage of the initially planned. This tendency is most
evident in the cases of battalion level training and exercises.
Diagram 5 shows a comparison of the main training activities in 2010 and 2011.

**Diagram 5**

Due to the restoration to a great degree of the balance between the types of expenditure,
the necessary conditions for increasing the allocated resources for combat training were
established. The available resources are still insufficient but the focus was shifted again to the true
priorities and tasks of the Armed Forces.

3.1. LAND FORCES


The main efforts were directed towards organizing the process of building up of the Land
Forces’ priority capabilities related primarily to the build-up and training of the Battalion Battle
Groups. In 2011 the process of building, manning and training of the Battalion Battle Groups in
accordance with the Vision for development of the Land Forces, the White Paper and the NATO
Force Goals commenced.


-----

The Land Forces also elaborated projects for re-arming with main types of armament and

equipment, projects on exemption of excess armament, equipment and military areas (grounds) and
carried out transition towards a new Land Forces organizational structure which took place in some
units. Challenges before the Land Forces were the decreased budget and the unchanged volume of
tasks. Other challenges were the increased number of units participating in missions and operations,
modernization, build up and training of the Battalion Battle Groups, etc.
A Battalion Battle Group Doctrine was elaborated. This Doctrine brings to a common

understanding the Battalion Battle Groups’ mission, tasks, necessary capabilities, principles of
building up, deployment, employment and sustainment and their role in participating effectively in
the full spectrum of operations.

The Land Forces training, exercises, preparation and education was directed towards

improving the interoperability with NATO and
EU forces. Five inspections and assessments
of the combat capabilities of the declared
units were conducted. The certification
process of the HQs and the units was
conducted implementing NATO ACO

standards.

Last year the Land Forces planned 127

exercises total, of which 124 (97%) were
conducted.

**Diagram 6**

The Land Forces also participated in 14 international joint training exercises and activities .


3.2. AIR FORCE


In 2011, the Air Force directed its efforts towards (1) conducting a quality educational
training process, aimed at effective fulfilment of the main tasks set in the “Commanders,
headquarters and Air Force Troops Training Plan”, (2) fulfilling the Force Goals and (3) modernization
under limited resources.

The year can be characterized as being one with strong dynamics in the process of
transformation and structural changes. The aim was to achieve new quality in the functioning, the
effective management and the interaction with the other services of the Land forces.

Under the conditions of limited resources, the acquired level of training and the available

working equipment allowed the Air Force to fulfil their missions and tasks while preserving the bond
between the flight crews and the ground personnel. The Air Force Command and the units’ HQs
proved to be composite C2 bodies, able to plan and organize the activities by using the available
capabilities and resources. Flight activities were conducted under the conditions of “admissible
risk”, employing new organization of planning, conducting, control and support of the flights. The
Air Force successfully fulfilled the tasks for protecting and assisting the population in cases of
natural disasters as well as in resolving crisis situations, both in country and abroad.
Within the available resources the Air Force

continued to preserve and further develop the
operational capabilities in conformity with the Armed
Forces missions and tasks with respect to NATO and in
fulfilling generally Bulgaria’s international commitments.

Executing the PDAF, the Air Force continued the

process of transformation on operational and tactical
level. An emphasis was put on the preliminary work
regarding the planned for 2012 reorganization of the
tactical units.

The Air Force fulfilled its tasks on protecting and defending Bulgaria’s air space and critical

infrastructure.

Ten exercises were planned and successfully conducted (100%). Due to the conducted joint

Bulgarian – US training exercises, the planned parachute jumps were over fulfilled.

**Table 5**

Air Force personnel participated in 11 international exercises and joint training exercises.
Of the total planned flight hours, the Air Force executed 72%, which as an absolute value, is

equal to the total planned flight hours for 2010. Of the planned combat training flight hours the Air
Force executed 64%. The non-fulfilment of the planned total annual flight hours was due to spare
parts shortage, limited remaining platforms flight resource and delays in fulfilling aviation equipment
repairs and refurbishment contracts.

In 2011 “flight safety” was a paramount imperative in the work of the Air Force Command

and the Air Force unit commanders. Aircraft aviation incidents were 7% less compared to 2010. The
tendency of the past years was preserved: approximately 64% of the aviation incidents were due to
failures of aviation equipment. Main reasons for these were the use of aviation equipment at the
end of its technical life cycle or in a period of an extended life cycle as well as the process of
mastering new materiel resources. The second in number were the incidents due to subjective
reasons (incorrect flight crew actions) – comprising 26% of the total number, which as a result of the
limited training and available resources mark an increase compared to 2010.

In 2011, the Bulgarian military aviation 100[th] anniversary, Air Force base “Balchik”’s 70[th]

anniversary, Air Force base “Graf Ignatievievo” and Helicopter Air base “Krumovo”’s 60[th] and the
50[th] anniversary of the Air defence missile brigade were commemorated.


3.3. NAVAL FORCES


The Naval Forces conducted training, exercises, preparation and education for participation

in the whole spectrum of missions and tasks, for guaranteeing the sovereignty and security of the
Republic of Bulgaria and protection of its territorial integrity, protection of the national interests in
the maritime space, participation in the NATO collective defence and support to the international
peace and security.

The insufficient financial resources allocated for materiel, services, repairs and spare parts

hampered the maintenance of the armament and equipment and the Navy’s normal functioning as
a whole.

One of the main goals of the Naval Forces during the past year was to achieve and maintain

within the available resource framework, the necessary defence capabilities of the NATO and EU
declared units. In fulfilling this goal, the NATO and EU declared units were kept in a state of
readiness to fulfil their specific tasks. Notwithstanding the financial and resource insufficiency, the
coalition and international commitments were fulfilled.
The state of the Naval Forces permits them in cases of natural disasters to provide assistance

to the population. The personnel is trained, has appropriate certificates and the platforms and
equipment are in good working condition.

The main training efforts were directed towards improving the operational capabilities,
increasing the efficacy and interoperability of the Bulgarian naval forces with the Navies of the Allies
through implementation of the Armed Forces Force Goals. Necessary efforts were undertaken to
carry out the planned tasks and combat exercises. Due to the limited financial resources, priority was
given mainly to training of the declared units and their participation in international exercises.


-----

From April through May 2011, a Bulgarian naval forces frigate “Drazki” and a special

operations group took part in the NATO operation “Unified Protector” in support of the arms
embargo against Libya.
During the year the Naval Forces planned 60 exercises of which 59 were conducted. (Table 6)

The Naval Forces participated in 9 international and joint training exercises.

During the “Breeze/Certex 2011”

exercise, maritime multinational joint

operational forces component level staff
procedures were trained. Different

techniques, tactics and procedures for
participation in crisis response operations in
an asymmetric threats environment were
trained as well. The interoperability and
interaction among the other participating
NATO member states’ Navies, NATO Standing
Maritime Group 2, and the partners from
other participating state bodies and

institutions was greatly improved. During the

exercise, the Bulgarian naval forces frigate “Verni” was certified and was assessed as “Mission
ready”.

The preparation for certification in 2012 of the MHV “Tzibar” continued throughout the year.

The Bulgarian naval forces frigate “Verni” and the MSV “Priboi” took part respectively in the

first and the second activation of the Black Sea Naval Cooperation Task Group “BLACKSEAFOR”.
In 2011 a priority goal for the Navy was to maintain capabilities for maritime surveillance and

early warning in case of emerging crises by
gathering information via the Coastal

surveillance system for shipping and maritime
border control - EKRAN. The mentioned system
provides unified maritime situational awareness
information which is passed to the Naval
Sovereignty Operations Center.
The Naval forces received three AS 565

MB “Panther” helicopters. Pilots, technicians
and avionics experts attended training courses
at the “Eurocopter” training centre.

3.8. ARMAMENT AND EQUIPMENT


3.8.1. POLICIES AND APPROACHES TO ARMAMENTS AND EQUIPMENT

A key priority for the Ministry of Defence was the timely sustainment of the Bulgarian

contingents deployed in missions and operations abroad.

The M1117 “Guardian” Armored Security Vehicles (ASVs) continue to perform their tasks in

Afghanistan and Bulgaria. Through the US Foreign Military Financing (FMF) Programme a procedure
was launched for signing a three-year maintenance contract through which Integrated Logistic
Support will be provided for a period of 36-month .

The contingent in Afghanistan was equipped with modern vision devices which improves

safety in the operation zone.

For the implementing the decision for the participation of the Naval forces frigate “Drazki”

in the NATO led operation “Unified Protector”, the MoD signed contracts for service and repair
which were performed to the fullest in a very short period of time.

A 4-year Framework Agreement was signed for the provision of MiG-29 aircraft

airworthiness which envisages repairs to be performed by Bulgarian enterprises possessing the
necessary technological capacities.

The Ministry of Defence signed a 10-year Framework Agreement and the first contract for

Integrated Logistic Support of the Bulgarian Air Force C-27J “Spartan” aircraft. The contract signed is
for 5 years and includes repairs on the damaged aircraft, delivery of spare parts and consumables,
logistics support, training of flight crews and technical personnel.

Three AS565 MB “Panther” helicopters were delivered to the Naval Forces with the flight

crews’ basic training completed. Spare parts for the helicopters and the engines were delivered as
well

The third contract for procurement of “Mercedes-Benz” military wheeled vehicles was

completed. Pursuant to the Amendment to
the Contract and the Contract itself, 137
vehicles were delivered to the Armed Forces,
including off-road ground transportation

vehicles (armoured and non-armoured),

general utility trucks, buses, minibuses and
specialized vehicles. The disposal of the
exploitation equipment and technologies,
software and hardware for technical service
and repair of the vehicles contributed to cost
reduction of the maintenance of the vehicles.

In 2011 a challenge was the

implementation of the Armed Forces modernization projects due to the financial crisis and defence
budget which was below 1,5% of GDP.

There were obstacles concerning the timely goods and services public procurement award

procedures. Despite this fact, the number of procedures launched and signed contracts have
increased. Of all 151 goods and services public procurement award procedures, 132 contracts were
signed including 16 Framework Agreements, while 21 procedures were cancelled. In comparison, in
2010, 12 of the conducted 68 procedures were cancelled.


-----

The commitment to public access and openness of public procurement procedures to

support competitiveness and prevention of corruptive practices remains an important priority of the
MoD. All procedures were publicly released, including the special-purpose public procurements.
Information on all procurements was published on the MoD website. In 2010 and 2011 over 70% of
the procedures were open public procurements while in 2008 and 2009 - about 50%.

3.8.2. MINISTRY OF DEFENCE INVESTMENT PLAN-PROGRAMME - 2020

The main goal of the MoD Investment Plan-Programme 2020 (Mod IPP 2020) is to provide

and acquire the capabilities set out in the Armed Forces Development Plan. The Mod IPP 2020
formulates a unified integrated framework of capital expenditure involving acquisition, integrated
logistic support, disposal of and/or modernization of armaments, materiel, equipment and defence
infrastructure through implementation of investment and infrastructure projects. The Plan
contributes to the achievement of balance between the Armed Forces capabilities needs and the
available resources.

To reduce the misbalance between the declared needs of the Armed Forces and projected

resources for their provision, prioritization of the projects in accordance with the defined
capabilities in the Plan for the Development of the Armed Forces was conducted in 2011. Following
this, three main lists of investment projects were elaborated.

    - List of priority Investment Projects (13 projects amounting to 2 billion BGN);

    - List of Investment Projects with already concluded contracts (29 projects amounting 0.471

billion BGN);

    - Indicative list of other Investment Projects (40 projects) which could be implemented in

the future.

The Priority Investment projects are aimed at providing support to the main defence

capabilities of the Armed Forces and lay the foundation for their development in a way reflecting
the current realities.

The main studies and analyses for Investment project “Acquisition of a new base fighter and

supply of integrated logistics support” were conducted in 2011. A project team was established. In
January 2011, Letters of Inquiry for information for the acquisition of new or second hand multirole
fighters were sent to manufacturing countries and the received responses had been analysed.

3.8.3. DEVELOPMENT OF CAPABILITIES IN COOPERATION WITH ALLIES AND PARTNERS

    - STRATEGIC AIRLIFT CAPABILITIES PROGRAMME

The participation in and use of NATO Strategic Airlift Capability, (SAC) С-17 Program

continued in 2011. The Bulgarian expeditionary contingents’ airlift was organized and carried out
mainly using SAC C-17 Programme and US Central Command provided airlift transportation. In 2011,
the full quota of flight hours pursuant to SAC C-17 for our country was used. 1383 personnel and
264 tons of material were transported throughout the year. Training of personnel for performing C17 loading and unloading activities along with passengers and cargo processing at local air bases was
also conducted. C-17 loading devices were delivered via US FMF Programme financing.

The effective use of the due flight resources proved the financial effectiveness of the SAC C
17 Programme. As a result of the reduced rotation time of the Bulgarian contingents abroad a
considerable financial resources savings were achieved.

    - NATO’S GROUND SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMME (AGS)

NATO’s Ground Surveillance Programme (Alliance Ground Surveillance – AGS) is designed for

the acquisition of international capability with Bulgarian participation to provide surveillance in
NATO led operation area. The acquisition of such type of capability will dramatically improve the
information giving a comprehensive picture of the situation on the ground where during


-----

contingents’ involvement in NATO operation and will considerably reduce the risk for the personnel
participating in them. The Program further envisages participation of the Bulgarian industry
proportionate to the financial commitment of our country.

    - NATO SECURITY INVESTMENT PROGRAMME (NSIP) FUNDED PROJECTS

NATO Security Investment Programme (NSIP) is an initiative to which Bulgaria has been an

active partner and since becoming an Alliance full-fledged member. This Programme invests into
NATO collective needs in order to achieve the necessary operational capabilities and to create the
needed environment for Allied Commands to fulfil any tasks standing before them.

The MoD uses the resources provided through this Programme to invest in building and

modernization of the existing national air Bases and naval ports infrastructure, to modernize of the
Armed Forces’ communication and information systems and for logistics needs. The projects from
this Programme contribute to the achievement of new and upgrade of the existing Armed Forces
defence capabilities. In 2011, the implementation of two projects through the Programme was
finalized whilst procedures and coordination activities on the launching of another two projects
were launched.

    - US FOREIGN MILITARY FINANCING (FMF) PROGRAMME PROJECTS

In 2011, using US Foreign Military Financing (FMF) Programme, priority was given to

implementing subproject “Provision of Battalion Battle Group with Material Resources for Logistic
Support”, which is part of the MoD IPP - 2020 Project 1 - “Build-up of a Battalion Battle Group within
a mechanized brigade”.

Another project that focused substantial efforts was Project 10 - “Further build-up of the

Special Operations Forces” aimed at modernizing the SOF communication and information system
and refurbishment with accoutrements, gear, parachutes and air-drop equipment.

During the year the priority for the Navy “EKRAN” - Coastal surveillance system for shipping

and maritime border control” project was accomplished the major part of which had been financed
by the FMF. The EKRAN system can be technically connected with similar navigation control systems
of other national institutions within the National security unified system and with other similar
systems within NATO. The implementation process was executed by separating the Project into
three sub-projects. Two of them were financed by FMF Programme and have been finalized.
Approximately 10 million USD had been invested for their implementation.

In 2011 the work on the preparation for implementation of Phase 3 of the Armed Forces

“Logistics information system” Pilot project, directed starting the exploitation of the system also
commenced. The main efforts were focused on accrediting the system for processing, transfer and
storage of data. The building of the necessary infrastructure was launched in order to open user
working stations in ten new formations of the Armed Forces.

    - EUROPEAN AIR TRANSPORT FLEET PROGRAMME (EATF)

Bulgaria joined the European Air Transport Fleet Programme Agreement in May, 2011.[9]

Under the leadership of the European Defence Agency the elaboration of a Programme
Management Plan (PMP) is under way along with a Roadmap for its implementation.

3.8.4. DISPOSAL OF EXCESS AMMUNITIONS

A “Plan-schedule for Excess Ammunition Disposal Activities in 2011” had been endorsed.

Based on a Minister of Defence decision, a procedure was launched for the disposal/demolition of
ammunitions. The MoD signed contracts with two companies to perform these activities.

9By order №324/19.05.2011 of the Council of Ministers


-----

By decision of the expanded session of the Programme Council to the Minister of Defence, a

“Disposal and/or demolition of expired Exocet MM 38 anti-ship missiles” position was opened in the
MoD Unified Plan for Material and Technical Supplies. Forthcoming is a public procurement award
procedure.

3.8.5. OFFSET PRACTICE POLICY

With the conclusion of an additional agreement to Contract UD 03-3/28.01.2005 for the

acquisition of AS 532 AL “Cougar” and AS 565 ML “Panther” helicopters, the terms and volume of
the Offset compensations had been renegotiated. Under this agreement the necessary helicopter
infrastructure, incl. hangars will be built.


3.9. TECHNOLOGY, RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS


The Defence Institute is the main technological, research and development centre within

the defence system. In 2011, high priority was placed on activities related to the implementation of
the Armed Forces Force Goals. Efforts were concentrated on three projects:

     - Non-lethal capabilities and weapons;

     - Improvement of combat armoured vehicles capabilities, and

     - Defence capabilities against High-Energy weapons.

In 2011 the Defence Institute Financial resource framework was 2 602 697 BGN, of which the

budgetary subsidies were 2 401 147 BGN and generated own revenues - 201 451 BGN.
Scientific, research, applied, testing, experiment and design work, support and studies on

246 different themes and working projects were performed in 2011. Technical specifications,
tactical and technical assignments, analyses, opinions, methodology and programs for range and
army testing of 570 different defence products were conducted. Quality assurance activities on 100
defence products were conducted. For over 50 armaments, equipment and property, laboratory
specialized and acceptance tests were conducted throughout the year.
The Defence Institute significantly contributes to the effective transition from scientific

research and development to manufacturing, acquisition and operation of defence products, to
their whole life cycle quality assurance in accordance with national and international standards.


**4.PEOPLE IN DEFENCE**


Human Resources management policy was in unison with the Defence System

transformation processes and the goals and priorities set in the White paper on Defence and the
Armed Forces.

Considerable attention was paid to the status of military conduct and discipline. The 2011

analysis reveals that military conduct and discipline performance meets the requirements of the
different laws, Armed Forces rules and regulations and the Standard Operating Procedures.

In the course of the daily military routine, the efforts of the Armed Forces HQs and different

level commanders were focused on activities aimed at prevention of incidents and improvement of
the discipline. As a result, compared to 2010, the incidents within the Armed Forces have been
reduced by 20%.

Among the registered incidents in the course of performance of professional duties those

referring to physical injuries, penetration in guarded facilities and accidents with military equipment
predominate. Incidents occurring during non-working hours also drove quite a lot of public
attention, but it should be taken under consideration that these incidents occurred out of direct
commanders’ control. Such incidents refer primarily to traffic accidents with privately owned
vehicles and to different injuries due to recklessness. The prevailing cases of military equipment


-----

misappropriation were caused by civilians out of military premises perimeters such as training
ranges and firing areas which are not permanently safeguarded.

Missions and operations related incidents in 2011 have decreased by 45% in comparison

with 2010. Their character remained relatively unchanged and was related mainly to loss or damage
of military property, traffic accidents and physical injuries. The reduction in the number of incidents
was due to the improved work of the commanders, the good preliminary and immediate training
and preparation of the personnel for participation in operations as well as to the accumulated
experience from previous missions and operations.


4.1. STATUS OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE AND THE ARMED FORCES MANNING


As of 31 December 2011, the manning of the MoD, the structures directly subordinated to

the Minister of Defence and the Armed Forces was 89,08% of the permanent full-time positions
(87,24% for the military and 95,84% for the civilian personnel).

The breakdown by structures was:

  - Ministry of Defence - 95,6%, (96,21% for the military and 95,2% for the civilian personnel);

  - Structures directly subordinated to the Minister of Defence - 89,52% (83,3% for the military

and 94,96% for the civilian personnel);

  - Bulgarian Armed Forces - 88,77% (87,83% for the military and 97,56% for the civilian

personnel).
The current manning of the Armed Forces allows the fulfilment of the assigned tasks and

missions.

In view of the Armed Forces ongoing reform, the necessity to establish a new operationally

ready Reserve force, with new organization, flexible manning and modern rules and regulations
emerged. The Law on the Reserve of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria will contribute to
the establishment and sustainment of a usable, armed and capable Reserve force, with agile
organization and at a lower cost. On July 1, 2011 a Centralized Military District Authority was
established as a separate unit directly subordinated to the Minister of Defence and as a second-level
budget spender. The aim is to exert centralized control over the resources of the Reserve. Currently
work for elaboration of Draft Rules for Implementation of the Law on Reserve and two other
documents – “Ordinance on military register” and a “Mobilization Ordinance” is under way.

Throughout the year and with assistance from the US FMF Programme work continued on

developing the Project “Human Resources Management Automated System”. New system modules
on “Reserve Resources Accountability”, “Candidates” and “Labour Safety Regulations” were
developed as well.


4.2. NATO, EU AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HEADQUARTERS POSITIONS


The effective manning of positions within headquarters and steering bodies of different

organizations and of the Bulgarian Representations to them contribute to the adequate
participation of Bulgaria in the elaboration of the defence and security policies of NATO, EU and the
other organizations to which it is a member. Following the conducted competitions held in 2011,
total of 34 international positions were seconded by military and civilian personnel. The slow-down
in rotating the Bulgarian seconded personnel in 2010 had been fully overcome by the end of 2011.
The percentage of manning of the NATO command structure positions by Bulgaria is relative to that
of the other member states. Of the total of 118 international positions, 101 have been manned
which counts for 85%.

In 2011, for the first time the position of Deputy Director “Cooperation and Regional

Security” Division of NATO International Military Staff was taken by a high ranking Bulgarian officer.
For the first time a Bulgarian expert was seconded to the European Defence Agency.


-----

|Col1|4.3. RECRUITMENT AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT|Col3|
|---|---|---|


In 2011, the total of 1507 military personnel was discharged from active duty, of which 1095

were by own request. From those discharged from active duty and entitled to pension were 816
military personnel, of which 185 due to age limit; entitled to pension pursuant to Article 69 of the
Social Insurance Code and by their own request - 616, and 15 were released by the Minister of
Defence or by an authorized person after submission of a 6-month notification.

The vacancies for military positions in the course of 2011 were filled after decisions taken by

the MoD Career Development Committees. All candidates applied through the periodically
published by the MoD Vacant Positions Registers. This procedure ensured transparency and
objectivity during the appointment process.

All alumni of “G.S.Rakovski” National Defence Academy, “V.Levski” National Military

University and “N.Vaptsarov” Naval Academy along with the cadets of the Sergeant College were
appointed to positions in the Armed Forces and in the structures subordinated to the Minister of
Defence.

There was weak interest towards the announced competitions for doctors and nurses’

positions at the Military Medical Academy. Additional competitions were required in order to man
soldiers’ positions in some units.

All military personnel underwent employment attestations[10] pursuant to the elaborated

Attestation and Testing System according to which the set of competences should fully cover the
requirements for the personal and professional profiles to perform duties and differentiates these
requirements in accordance with the different hierarchical levels. Software “surveillance” was
developed to monitor unfair performance within the “Employees Appraisal” sub-system of the
Human Resources Management Automated System.

During the past year, the system for selection and approval of candidates for work in the

Military Information Service was improved. The procedures guaranteeing transparency in the
selection of personnel for out of country education and participation in missions and operations
were also optimized.


4.4. MILITARY EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM


Basic normative documents required for the implementation of the tasks set in the Plan for

the Development of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria in the sphere of military education
were developed in 2011:

    - Regulations on the State Requirements for recognition of the Higher Education in

“Military Sciences” profession as a basis for new curricula and qualification characteristics for cadets
and trainees.

    - Regulations on the terms and conditions for the admission of trainees in Higher Military

Schools which gave the military personnel – privates, sergeants, warrant officers and officer
candidates the opportunity to acquire higher education at Bachelor and Professional Bachelor
educational and qualification degree in Military Studies profession and to acquire junior military
officer ranks;

    - Amendment and supplement to the Regulation on the Conditions and Order for

Admission of Students in the “G.S. Rakovski” National Defence Academy in order to stipulate a new
method of academic year organization;

10 „Regulation for establishing the criteria, means and ways for attestation of the military personnel of the MoD, the
structures directly subordinated to the Minister of defence and the Bulgarian Armed Forces” printed in State Gazette,
№92/23.11..2010, amended in State Gazette№ 90/ 15.11.2011г.


-----

    - Sub-legislative normative act ensuing from the Law on the development of the academic

staff in the Republic of Bulgaria on the award of scientific degrees in military academies and higher
military schools;
A Report-Analysis was elaborated to plan the measures for admitting cadets in the higher

military schools until 2014.

4.5. SOCIAL STATUS AND MOTIVATION


The main efforts of the MoD social policy were aimed at preserving the social status and

motivation enhancement of the military and civilian personnel and towards the improvement of the
normative regulations for social policy and cooperation.

Based on analysis of the state and implementation of the activities providing healthy and

safe working conditions, labour accidents and occupational diseases, the normative base was
improved. Projects on the improvement of the working conditions were conducted in 17 units.
Safety and health measures absorbed 353 605 BGN, which is 53 000 BGN more compared to 2010.

In 2011 the Regulations on the conditions and order for the provision of material assistance

at the MoD, the structures subordinated to the Minister of Defence and the Armed Forces was
adopted. Thus the number of people entitled to material assistance was enlarged, including war
veterans. In 2011 during 12 sessions of the Material Assistance Committee 1306 application for
material assistance allotment were considered, of which 1215 were satisfied. The total amount of
assistance reached 408 380 BGN.

“One-time” assistance to meet the expenses in cases of disease, death and accidents were

granted to 817 military disabled persons to the amount of 203 880 BGN, 19 retired servicemen
received 8630 BGN, 38 military personnel received 31 110 BGN, 39 civilian personnel were
supported with the total of 34 540 BGN, 20 war veterans – with 2 650 BGN and 117 servicemen
injured while fulfilling their duties were given “one-off” sums totalling 73 230 BGN.


-----

The efforts in the area of social adaptation were directed at providing support to discharged

servicemen on their transition and adaptation to civilian life. 727 group and individual counselling
and discussions took place. In order to support the discharged from military service, in May 2011 a
Cooperation agreement was signed between the MoD and the National Employment Agency under
the Minister of Labour and Social Policy and with a document called “Joint Guidelines” aimed at
easing the implementation of this Agreement. 184 meetings with employers’ job fairs were
organized for 250 discharged military persons. The new job seekers were provided with information
on 1264 vacant positions. 13 officers from the structures subordinated to the Minister of Defence
and the Bulgarian Armed Forces were trained as “adaptation coordinators” and 25 employees were
trained as “adaptation consultants” to the Central Military District Command.

Regarding the MoD housing policy, after 01 August 2011, 973 different types of property of

which 383 public-private owned and 273 public owned by state were transferred to the Central
Military District Command for management. Regulatory activities were performed for 29 properties.
The housing fund was also transferred to the Central Military District Command. 7307 employees
were indexed for housing of which 1857 were accommodated.

The number of functioning kindergartens under the management of the MoD was 7 in which

military and civilian personnel children were taken care of.


4.6. SOCIAL COOPERATION POLICY


During the year, in the framework of the social dialogue, five regular sessions between the

MoD leadership and the leadership of the officially represented Trade Unions and one special
session of the Specialized Branch Council of Social Cooperation were carried out. The discussions
were focused on the status of the social dialogue, the income policy, the provision of safe and
healthy labour conditions, additional month remunerations for work in harmful or specific working
conditions, on staff and structural changes and following civilian personnel layoffs, the status and
perspectives of the higher military schools and on provision of health and safety funds.

Active work continued on the improvement of the interaction between the MoD and public

organizations working in the area of defence. A new stage of cooperation was the unification into a
Public Council on Defence Issues of 19 NGOs working on different defence issues which promoted
the interface among them.


**5. INTERNATIONAL AND EURO-ATLANTIC SECURITY, INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND STABILITY**


The efforts of the MoD regarding the implementation of the defence policy in the context of

the NATO membership were focused on the provision of relevant contribution to the fulfilment of
the ambitious agenda of NATO Lisbon Summit.
A key point at the EU agenda continues to be the defence capabilities development through

the “pooling and sharing” initiative[11].


5.1. THE EUROPEAN UNION – COMMON SECURITY AND DEFENCE POLICY


The efforts of the EU and its member states were directed towards increase and

enhancement of the operational capacity in order to tackle with the contemporary security
challenges. In a situation of serious defence budgets pressure, the member states reinforced their
commitment to build up adequate to the EU Level of ambition capabilities for effective and
independent actions in crisis management.

An important direction of the MoD activities was the determination of the national

contribution parameters to the “pooling and sharing” initiative and respectively to develop the
industrial and technological defence basis at national and European level. As a result of the national

11 Pooling and Sharing – EU initiative for pooling of capabilities and sharing defence costs.


-----

defence capabilities analyses were specified those bearing the potential for joint development
through “pooling and sharing”. Due to the signing of the Programme Agreement on cooperation for
the development of European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) in May 2011, the opportunities for possible
participation in the development of Maritime Surveillance Network and Commercial Satellites
development programmes have been examined.

The Weimar Initiative promoting a comprehensive approach to the EU Crisis-response

planning missions and operations, development of the European defence capabilities, increased use
and effectiveness of the EU battle groups, and enhancement of the cooperation with NATO was
supported by the MoD.

Main dimensions for a possible future development of the EU battle groups are integration

of the civil-military expertise, sharing the strategic resources (strategic airlift, satellite
communications, _etc.) and synchronization with the NATO Response Forces. The activities in the_
“Athens” mechanism review, aiming at the enlargement of the possibilities for common financing,
were of a great importance.

After successful training and certification, since July 1, 2011 a Bulgarian contingent and staff

officers took a 6-month period of duty within the EU multinational battlegroup HELBROC. Besides
the representatives of Bulgaria, Greece, Cyprus and Romania, for the first time - in this year’s
schedule - Ukraine was also participating.

The MoD was actively participating in the discussions on the establishment of permanent EU

capabilities for planning and conducting civil-military crisis response operations which led to the
decision of the Council of the European Union to activate the EU Operations Centre for coordination
in the Common Security and Defence Policy activities, and counter piracy in the Horn of Africa’s
region, in particular.


5.2. NATO – COLLECTIVE DEFENCE AND ALLIED SECURITY POLICY


Significant political events during 2011 were the conducted in May NATO Parliamentary

Assembly Spring Session in Varna, with the active participation of the MoD, and the visits of NATO
Deputy Secretary General and the Supreme Allied Commander Transformation.

On September 27, 2011 at an official ceremony, a Declaration on the implementation of the

Plan for Integration of the Bulgarian Armed Forces in NATO was signed. The Declaration states that
the goals set in the Plan for Integration of the Bulgarian Armed Forces in NATO were achieved and
the criteria for its accomplishment were fulfilled.
A key point was the adopted by the Ministers of Defence Political Guidance on

transformation of the defence capabilities and the military implementation of the NATO’s New
Strategic Concept. During the meeting of NATO Ministers of Defence in June 2011, decisions on the
Alliance’s reform and its adaptation to the new security environment were made, including the
introduction of NATO Agencies’ new model of organization and the new Alliance Command
Structure. A New Cyber Defence Concept and working Regulations for NATO Deterrence and
Defence Posture Review were adopted.

In an environment of an increasing pressure on the defence budgets and high requirements

to the defence capabilities, the efforts supporting NATO’s Smart Defence Concept[12] were among the
main guidelines in the efforts of the Ministry of Defence. On the basis of the adopted Plan for the
Development of the Armed Forces and the Investment Plan-Programme of the Ministry of Defence,
opportunities for participation in building defence capabilities projects through multinational
innovative approaches were analysed and those of interest for participation were declared.

We envisage participation in six of the 12 declared so-called “first group” projects of the

“Smart Defence” initiative – the group of the highest degree of readiness for practical

12Smart Defense


-----

implementation, and Bulgaria is a leading nation on one of these projects, namely - Female
Leadership Security and Defence Platform. Another significant project reflects the ambition to
establish NATO Crisis Management and Disaster Relief Centre of Excellence.
Our participation in already existing multinational initiatives for the development of Allied

defence capabilities such as the Strategic Airlift Capability-SAC C-17 Programme, the Air Ground
Surveillance programme and the initiative for the establishment of C-27J Spartan User group was
still in progress.

NATO’s operation in Afghanistan remains one of the main foreign policy priorities and also

the most extended large-scale military commitment for our country. At the beginning of the year, a
key issue was the situation in Libya and the role of NATO.


5.3. USABILITY OF THE ARMED FORCES


Key criteria among the criteria for usability of the Armed Forces are the percentage of

deployability and the percentage of sustainability. Regarding the Land Forces the criteria must cover
50% deployable and 10% sustainable forces engaged in operations. In 2010 were also introduced Air
Forces criteria – 40% and 8% respectively.

Up to the present date, the fulfilled sustainability criterion for the Land Forces is defined to

be 7,5%, while the ambition is to reach 10% of the personnel. Intensive efforts are invested in the
achievement of 50% “usability” of the Land Forces personnel to be deployable. The level reached
until now is 34%.

Regarding the Air Forces, indexes were reported to be 20% and 0% respectively, whereas

the ambition is to reach the required standards until 2016.

The past two years witness a positive trend of increase in the Armed Forces usability

criteria. In 2011, considerable increase in our NATO, EU and UN operations participation was
reported.


5.4. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION


In 2011, the focus of the bilateral and regional cooperation was on the enhancement of the

integration processes, trust, transparency in the relations and further peace and stability promotion.

The strategic cooperation with the USA was developed in the framework of the Agreement

between the two Governments on Defence Cooperation and played a leading role. In June 2011, a
Memorandum of Intent for enhancement the cooperation between the Ministry of Defence and the
United States European Command for the training of the Bulgarian Land Forces components and
future participation in NATO missions was signed.

High level meetings and political-military consultations were held with leaders and

representatives of the Ministries of Defence and the Defence Staffs of Armenia, China, Germany,
Georgia, Israel, Italy, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Sweden, Turkey, the
United Kingdom and the United states. Approved by the Council of Ministers, coordinated or in a
coordination process are agreements and protocols in various aspects of defence with China, Israel,
Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Turkey.

A significant step in the enhancement of the bilateral cooperation was the signed between

the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania Agreement on Trans-border Air Policing within the Integrated
NATO Air Defence System. In a process of negotiation is such agreement with Turkey. In progress is
the establishment of DANUBE Functional Airspace Blocks between Bulgaria and Romania which is
part of the formation of Single European Sky. Draft “Memorandum of Understanding between the
Government of the Republic of Bulgaria and the Government of Romania on the mutual support
provision by the host country” was also elaborated.


-----

Highly evaluated was the traditional joint tactical exercise with combat firings at Shabla anti
aircraft range with the participation of military formations of the Serbian Armed Forces. The
exercise considerably contributed to the promotion of the military operational aspects of the
cooperation and the high level politico-military dialogue.

At its final coordination phase are a Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministries

of Defence of the Republic of Bulgaria and the Republic of Iraq on defence cooperation and also an
Agreement of free of charge provision of learning materials for the training of the Iraq Security
Forces. The work on coordinating a Cooperation Agreement with Pakistan was continued. A
Memorandum on defence cooperation between Bulgaria and Israel regarding trainings was also
coordinated.

A significant part of the regional cooperation was the South-Eastern Defence Ministerial

Process (SEDM) which rotational Chairmanship was held by Bulgaria until June 2011. Our country
further developed its proposal to host the permanent location of SEEBRIG Headquarters. Bulgaria
was approved to be the leading nation in the implementation of two important projects: “Building
Integrity in Defence”, regarding anti-corruption activities and transparency in order to avoid
possible corruption practices and “Female Leadership in Security and Defence Platform”.
Due to the implementation of the commitments coming from the Vienna Document 1999,

inspections by Belarus and Russia were organized and conducted in our country. Observer missions
by Ukraine and the Russian Federation pursuant to the Treaty on Open Skies were held along with
inspections by Ukraine in the framework of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. A
Bulgarian assessment visit to Serbia took place due to the bilateral agreement with our western
neighbour.
The implementation of the obligations pursuant to the regulatory documents regarding the

proliferation of weapons of mass destructions (WMD) and the export control were of a high public
importance tasks during the last year. Experts from the Ministry of Defence took part in meetings in
the country and abroad reiterating the state-led policy on these issues. The implementation of the
commitments in the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention
and the Export Control Law was done.
On October 1, 2011 the Convention on Cluster Munitions went into force. In order to

implement its requirements, a preparation of national report to the UN Secretary General was
initiated, regarding the existence of armaments and munitions in the country that should be
demolished within the specified terms.


**6.** **DEFENCE SUPPORT AND PROVISION**


6.1. INTELLIGENCE


The main efforts of the Military Information Service were directed towards: provision of

information on the development, the regulation and the management of politico-military, political
and economic crises and the prevention of local and regional conflicts; timely and reliable
information support of the Government and the Armed Forces for effective participation in the
process of NATO and the EU defence policy shaping and control of the national military contingents
participating in NATO, EU and UN missions and operations; leadership of the intelligence structures
of the Service within the contingents participating in missions abroad; Bulgarian Armed Forces’
intelligence coordination; cooperation and information exchange between Bulgarian and NATO and
the EU intelligence structures and partner services; supporting the Ministry of Defence in the
implementation of the military diplomacy and cooperation; improvement of the managerial
practices in a situation of increasing needs and resources deficit.

Priority subjects were the politico-military changes and the development of the situation in

the Western Balkan states, Northern Africa and the Middle East, and Afghanistan; the tangible


-----

changes in the situation of the countries with deployed Bulgarian contingents; the activities of the
terrorist organizations and other asymmetric risks and threats.

For the needs of the Government and the military leadership were developed thematic

bulletins, a relevant information was provided and inquiries on current issues were made. In order
to update the directions of the Bulgarian Foreign Policy, on request by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and the State Agency for National Security, analyses, reports and inquiries on the situation in crisis
regions, and the asymmetric security threats were done.

Of a special value is the Military Information Service activity on the provision of intelligence

information to our contingents participating in missions and operations abroad. Training
documentation was elaborated and implemented in the Land Forces which enhanced the quality of
the trainings, synchronization, interaction and the use of the Bulgarian Army intelligence structures
in missions and operations. The quality of the reports, the informative documents, the references
on the situation in the operation areas; the special reports on the direct threats against security of
the Allied and National Forces participating in operations; and the newly established sources of
information in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo was greatly improved.


6.2. COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION PROVISION


The goals set in the communication and information provision were achieved under the

conditions of financial constraints and reorganization of the communication and information
support units. Due to the newly improved structure of the units for communication and information
provision of the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces which enter in force on 01.07.2011, the
functions of the relevant units were redistributed. From a structure model orientated to the support
of the existing systems, transition took place to a model orientated at functional competence. The
responsibility for the use of the newly built System for exchange of military communication was
taken by the Stationary CIS.

The efforts were directed to finding ways of cost reduction of the information technologies

maintenance in the Ministry of Defence and the Bulgarian Armed Forces and to consolidation of the
basic applicable systems used by the Bulgarian Armed Forces aiming at reduction of the
maintenance costs of the used databases and optimization of the use of hardware. NATO
Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) delivered systems for joint and operational
planning, simulation and cyber defence, some of which are in a process of negation.

In 2011 the communication and information system of the Joint Forces Command and the

contingents of the Armed Forces worked properly, met the requirements of the Command and
Control System and provided the necessary constant information exchange. The active collaboration
with state and ministerial agencies on classified information protection continued to develop
actively.

The automated exchange of classified information was guaranteed through the use of the

accredited cryptographic networks and the automated information systems.


6.3. LOGISTIC SUPPORT


Logistic support in 2011 continued to operate in financial and material resources’ shortage

environment. Despite that, the main tasks of the training plans were successfully implemented. The
efforts of the logistics at all levels were focused on the provision of training and participation of our
contingents in missions abroad, the training of the military formations on the territory of the
country and optimization of the functions, tasks and the interface in logistics after the performed
organizational, personnel and structure changes since July 1, 2011.

There was a certain delay in the implementation of procurement procedures on the

provision of the contingents with materials due to the sub-legislative basis regulating the
relationships in products and services delivery. In this sense, updating the legal regulatory basis on


-----

logistics and maintenance of the Armed Forces was our priority. Joint Guidelines of the Chief of
Defence and the Permanent Secretary of Defence were elaborated.

Key task was the formation of logistics capabilities for provision of Battalion Battle Groups.

Draft Concept for formation and employment of National Support Element for battalion battle
group provision was developed.

Main task was the disposal of the surplus amount of material resources within Armed

Forces military formations and structures directly subordinated to the Minister of Defence.
Additional lists of excess material resources of general utility and surplus weapon systems,
ammunitions, explosives, pyrotechnical products of the Bulgarian Armed Forces as of June 25, 2011
were developed and approved.

In 2011 Bulgaria was the leading Nation of the NATO Movement Control Multinational

Integrated Logistic Unit. The accession procedure of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, the
USA and the Czech Republic was finalized. Poland accession to the unit was launched. A procedure
for obtaining a mandate in order to be declared the unit participation in NATO’s operation in Kosovo
was initiated.

Successfully implemented were the planned tasks on medical provision, annual medical

examination of all categories of military and civilian personnel, assessment and improvement
proposals of the health status of the personnel.

The Military Medical Academy participated in the medical support of 130 events organized

by the Ministry of Defence and the Defence Staff to the interest of the troops. A key task was the
provision of medical support for the Bulgarian units participating in peacekeeping operations in
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Afghanistan – Role 1 (Level 1) – 4 doctors and 3 sanitary instructors. 89
medical experts participated in missions during the period.

There is a tendency for an increasing number of medical personnel in Afghanistan and

development of the variety of the courses due to the enlargement of the scope of tasks set. The
Bulgarian medical contingent implements its tasks at the necessary level; still, due to the lack of
experts within the Military Medical Academy, it will be necessary to perform an expanded selection
of personnel from the Reserve in the future.


6.4. DEFENCE INFRASTRUCTURE


Management of state properties in operational military areas and excess properties,

investment policy regarding construction and construction services, and housing policy were the
directions in which the activities in the area of Defence Infrastructure were carried out.

During the last year successfully accomplished were tenders for the sale of 26 properties

for 7 419 508,40 BGN, with the initial tender price of 4 581 900,00 BGN. In comparison, the
revenues from the property sale in 2010 were 3 992 639, 21 BGN which means that in 2011 the
amount is 3 426 869,19 BGN more.

The acceleration of the process of releasing the surplus property by the Ministry of Defence

is a priority but the unfavourable situation on the real estate market delays the process. This
situation necessitated placing the properties at agencies’ and municipalities’ disposal.

The Council of Ministers adopted resolutions on granting 37 properties of the MoD. There

was an agreement to place 14 of the properties in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2 of the
State Servants Act. Decisions of the Council of Ministers were also made on the status change of 59
public state properties which were turned into private state properties, and also on the execution of
sales, in accordance to which 194 private state property tenders launched to the amount of
73 727 453,00 BGN initial price.

The investment policy in the construction and construction services was implemented on

the basis of a Property list for construction and construction services of the Ministry of Defence for
2011, which was further amended and approved. Accordingly the construction of 12 buildings was


-----

accomplished and visa for the design of another 15 objects was issued. 48 construction
authorizations were given to buildings with approved investment projects; 16 buildings were
approved by draft protocol, while 14 properties obtained letting licenses.

The normative basis regarding housing policy was improved. The Ordinance on property

renting from the MoD housing fund and the Ordinance on selling properties, studios and garages in
populated places with lacking MoD and Armed Forces’ structures was updated. A Concept for
management, control, and exploitation of housing fund properties was also developed. Main task
was the sale of the housing fund properties in populated places with no MoD structures.
Preparation for the sale of 184 properties was conducted, 46 of which were sold.


6.5. MILITARY STANDARDIZATION, CERTIFICATION AND CODIFICATION


371 draft projects of NATO standardization documents were entered into the STANDARD

system. National responses for the ratification of 57 NATO Standardization Agreements (STANAGs)
were sent along with national responses confirming the application of 70 STANAGs. 68 STANAGs
were sent for ratification to the competent structures of the Ministry of Defence and the Armed
Forces. The distribution of 290 NATO Standardization Agreements through STANDARD Information
System was organized.

Certification and supervision of two defence products was performed. Certificates for 25

quality management systems in accordance to the requirements of NATO Allied publications were
issued. Certification of the airworthiness of 31 military aircrafts and 3 aircrafts of the Ministry of
Interior was implemented.

Agreements on the use of BULCODE software codification instrument in the Republic of

Serbia and in Montenegro were concluded in 2011 along with training of their experts. Moreover,
an agreement with the Republic of Albania for the use of BULCODE software has being coordinated.
The quality of the software is recognized as one of the best in the Alliance.


**7.** **CONCLUSIONS**


Based on the presented status on Defence and the Armed Forces the following conclusions

could be made:

1. The Armed Forces are able to implement their constitutional commitment to

guarantee the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country and contribute to collective
defence system, support international peace and security and assist the population in disaster relief
and crises management.

2. Due to the effective prioritization of the limited resources, the military formations

accomplish the main tasks on defence, undergo combat trainings in accordance with the set
timelines, maintain the existing and build up the planned capabilities, and successfully participate in
NATO, EU and UN missions and operations.

3. Due to the passed laws, the defence legal and normative basis was improved, which

enables the transformation of the Armed Forces.

4. The tasks underlying in the Armed Forces Development Plan were successfully

conducted. The reorganization of the strategic and operational level of the Command and Control
System was accomplished. Conditions for unified control of the troops and forces in peacetime and
crisis time and conditions for the conduction of the reforms on tactical level reforms in 2012 were
established.

5. The anti-corruption activities maintain a steady trend towards generally low risk

level. The achievements in this area are stable while the comprehensive control of the activities of
all structures is broadened and deepened. Transparency is indispensably adhered as a principle and


-----

instrument for civilian control and for informing community on important political and resource
decisions made in the area of defence.

6. Dissatisfactory are the results in the following areas: procurements and deliveries;

disposal of excess real estates, properties, armaments and equipment, and disposal of the excess
munitions.

7. The results in 2011 bring us forward to the implementation of the desirable goals, set

in the White Paper on Defence and the Armed Forces and the Armed Forces Development Plan. The
provision of defence subsidies below the level of 1,5% of GDP, however, is a serious challenge for
key projects laid in the Investment Plan-Program of the Ministry of Defence until 2020.


**8.** **WHERE TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS**


The dynamic and difficult to predict strategic security environment with prevailing

asymmetric risks and threats and the steady defence budget constraints for the Euro-Atlantic
community states will continue. In order to improve its defence capability, Bulgaria should
integrate, augment its defence capacities and be adequate for the risks and threats of the 21[st]
century.

Drawing on the results achieved in 2011, 2012 will be year of “upgrading” the defence

capabilities through the development of all of their imperatives.

The structures of the integrated operational level are scheduled to achieve full operational

readiness in 2012. At the same time, these structures should control the units’ transformation at
tactical level and provide the defence level of ambition.

The Land Forces reorganize the light infantry brigade and the mechanized brigades, and a

United Centre for Initial Preparation is being formed. The size of the mechanized brigades has being
considerably increasing. Under reorganization are also artillery and reconnaissance, engineering and
CBRN units. Five units within the Air Forces have been reorganized, as a result of which has been
established a Command, Control and Surveillance Base and six anti-aircraft units have been
disbanded. Reorganization in the Air Bases has also been envisaged. Three formations from the
Navy have been reorganized.

In order to implement the planned transformations in the tactical units, it is important to

organize and apply the Law on the Reserve of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria.

A key task is the training of the battalion battle groups. They implement the new

conceptual approach to warfare. In accordance to the White paper on Defence and the Armed
Forces and the Armed Forces Development Plan in 2012 have to be certified the first battalion battle
group and a battalion battle group in accordance to the NATO Armed Forces’ Purposes.

Regarding the doctrines, 2012 is devoted to the elaboration and the practical

implementation of the main doctrines, to the work on the supportive doctrines and the tactical
documents. Until 2014, the Armed Forces will avail of fully developed doctrinal basis and working
process for their support.

In the area of education and training NATO Crisis Management and Disaster Relief Centre

of Excellence holds a central place. This year the centre is planned to take an active role in training,
courses conducting and international education. The Centre is part of the “Smart Defence” projects.

Bulgaria is a leading nation in the “Female Leadership in Security and Defence”, part of the

first group “Smart Defence” initiative projects and in 2012 will held the first conference with broad
international participation.

In the area of Regional cooperation should be emphasized on the Sixth Conference of the

Chiefs on Defence of the Balkan countries which will be hosted by Bulgaria.

In the main focus of our attention is the comprehensive provision of the contingents

abroad, the rotations and the immediate resolution of arising equipment issues in mission areas.
The practice of sending to operations permanently employed personnel and units manning in


-----

accordance with long-term schedule will continue. On equal basis this includes, the military
personnel of the MoD and the HQs participating in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo
and the regions where contingents are needed. This approach improves the selection and the
trainings.

In 2012 starts the implementation of the Strategy of transforming the contribution to the

NATO operation in Afghanistan until 2014 which envisages gradual decrease of our ISAF contingents.

The care for the people in defence will remain crucial to our efforts as they are the most

important capabilities’ imperative. Commanders and HQs will have to direct their work at the
improvement of the military service, preventive actions to avoid accidents and recurrent security
control, access regime, military conduct and discipline. Special attention will be paid to the
selection, motivation, provision, education and training, career development and the professional
realization of the personnel. Our goal is to keep the social status despite the limited resources, and
looking for opportunities for better it/improve it.
