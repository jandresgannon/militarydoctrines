##### Message by Prime Minister

The citizens of Pakistan are its greatest wealth and asset. The security and safety of
citizens has remained the top most priority of my government. Over the past five years,
we adopted and implemented a number of concrete and radical measures to promote
peace and stability in the country. As a result of these efforts, the law and order situation
in the country has improved significantly. Terrorism-related violence has declined
sharply. The economy is back on track and set to grow at an impressive rate of 5.8%
during the fiscal year 2018-19—the highest growth rate in a decade. The armed forces,
police, political parties and resilient people of Pakistan deserve credit for this huge
success.

Pakistan takes immense pride in being the leader and partner in fighting the war against
terrorism. We have conducted the world’s most complex, successful and largest military
operations against terrorism. Moreover, the gains made through security measures have
been consolidated through socio-economic development. Moving forward, we shall
continue to contribute to peace and stability in the region and the world at large.

Today, Pakistan is developing at a very rapid pace. The China Pakistan Economic
Corridor (CPEC) has changed the landscape of the country and made previously
inaccessible areas open to trade and development following the extension of basic
infrastructure. CPEC is not only opening up economic opportunities domestically but
also contributing to promoting regional trade and connectivity. In coming years, this is
likely to lead to peace, stability and prosperity in Pakistan and the region.

The National Internal Security Policy 2018 builds on our counter-terrorism experience of
the past years and reflects the emerging security challenges faced by the country. I
appreciate the broad focus and depth of the 6-Rs strategy chosen for this policy. In
particular, the focus on inclusive and sustainable development and strengthening of the
state-citizen relationship is commendable and likely to go a long way towards bringing
lasting and sustainable peace.
The Ministry of Interior under the able leadership of Prof. Ahsan Iqbal deserves
felicitations for formulating this policy which will guide the internal security paradigm
of the nation for the next five years.

May Allah Almighty be with us in our efforts to make Pakistan a more peaceful, inclusive
and prosperous country.

#### Foreword

The security of Pakistan and its citizens remains the first and foremost duty of the
Government of Pakistan. Since 2013-14 internal security has improved significantly.
Incidents of terrorism have seen a marked decline and overall improvement in law and order
situation has been noted all around the country. These Improvements in security environment
are also reflected by the gains made by Pakistan in economic sphere in last 5 years by
recording highest economic growth rate in a decade. This was made possible only by the
range of hard and soft security measures that the government adopted over the past five
years. Notable measures included the launch of the country’s first-ever National Internal
Security Policy (NISP) 2014, kinetic operations such as Zarb-e-Azb, Raddul Fasaad and
Karachi operation, numerous counter-terrorism legislations and adoption and implementation
of the National Action Plan (NAP).
Notwithstanding the gains, the internal security situation is continuously evolving and new
challenges are emerging. In order to consolidate the hard-won gains made over the past few
years and address the emerging challenges, the government in consultation with all major
stakeholders devised a comprehensive framework for dealing with the multi-faceted threat of
violent extremism and terrorism along with other security challenges. Recognising the
successes of the hard measures introduced in the wake of the adoption of the NISP 2014 and
NAP, NISP 2018 prioritizes effective undertaking of soft interventions to consolidate the
gains made in last 5 years.
Promotion of inclusive and sustainable development and re-imagining and strengthening of
the state-citizen relationship lie at the heart of the new security approach
underpinning/informing the NISP 2018. It places special emphasis on the promotion of
democracy, rule of law, inclusive growth and respect for diversity for achieving sustainable
peace and security. The policy draws upon the tolerant teachings of Islam, vision of Quaid-eAzam and Constitution of Pakistan to foster a counter-narrative against extremism and
terrorism.
Pakistan is a country of strong and resilient people who aspire to build a peaceful, democratic
and inclusive society. The history of Pakistan is a testimony to the fact that its people have
always rejected the forces of extremism, terrorism and authoritarianism and always sided
with the forces of peace, development and democracy.

###### Acknowledgements 

The National Internal Security Policy 2018 is a collective effort of multiple
stakeholders. Its conceptualisation and formulation required consultation and input from a
diverse group with different areas of expertise. As such, numerous stakeholders, institutions
and individuals have played crucial roles in bringing this policy document to fruition, and we
would be amiss not to mention at least some of them here.

The Minister for Interior Prof. Ahsan Iqbal gave his full and unequivocal support as
well as intellectual leadership in the conception and formulation of this policy. That he took a
bullet and survived an assassination attempt at close quarters during the time this policy was
being formulated brought home the challenge facing Pakistan in ways no one in the team
responsible for this document could have anticipated was possible. But, his is also the story
of Pakistan, demonstrating resilience in the face of seemingly unsurmountable odds.

Mr. Arshad Mirza, Secretary Interior, took the reins and provided leadership when the
ship needed steering to its port. He was assisted by Special Secretary Mr. Rizwan Malik who
also headed the committee formed to formulate NISP 2018. Key members of the committee,
Mr. Siddique Sheikh (Additional Secretary 1), Mrs. Farah Hamid Khan (Additional Secretary
2) and Mr. Imran Ahmad (Additional Secretary 3), along with other senior officers of their
divisions showed tremendous commitment by keeping the process firmly on course.
Moreover, Technical Lead Dr. Adnan Rafiq and his team worked untiringly and diligently
throughout the process to develop and formulate the policy.

The Ministry of Interior has been fortunate to have the guidance and support of the
National Security Advisor Lt. General (r) Nasir Khan Janjua and National Coordinator
NACTA Mr. Ihsan Ghani during this process. NACTA played a leading role in policy
formulation by hosting the consultation sessions and providing critical input at every stage of
the process. Without unwavering commitment and leadership shown by Mr. Ghani and his
team, this process could not have completed.

We also commend and thank all the contributors who belonged to Pakistan’s political
leadership, religious scholars and leaders, academia, media, civil and military bureaucracy,
civil society organisations and non-governmental organisations. Their participation,
productive engagement and valuable input in the process went a long way towards
developing and supplementing the long-term vision envisaged in the NISP 2018.

It is also important to acknowledge the contribution and input of various state
institutions such as the Parliamentary Committees on Interior, Law & Justice Commission,
Federal ministries, provincial governments, NADRA, Pakistan Armed Forces and other law
enforcement agencies in the formulation of NISP 2018. The holistic vision and coverage of
NISP 2018 would not have been possible without the institutions mentioned above with their
intellectual and experiential experiences feeding into the policy. The sacrifices rendered by
our security forces and LEAs during the past two decades provided us with the inspiration
and resolve to continue and see this work through to the end.

Finally, and most importantly, NISP 2018 is dedicated to the spirit, sacrifice, and
perseverance of the people of Pakistan. It is the people of Pakistan who have withstood
resolutely the wave of insecurity, intolerance and terrorism which has swept our homeland in
the last two decades. It is their love, generosity, and sense of duty which provides the real
inspiration for a new and reformulated NISP.

The NISP 2018 aims to replace fear in everyday life with the hope of peace and
prosperity for our state and society. This is only possible through the state, society and
various stakeholders joining hands in the service of broader goals of an inclusive, democratic
and peaceful Pakistan.

###### Executive Summary

Extremism and terrorism in their multiple manifestations pose a severe threat to the
internal security of Pakistan. Over the years, the Government of Pakistan has adopted hard
and soft measures to deal with the hazard of terrorism and extremism. The country’s firstever National Internal Security Policy was announced in 2014, followed by the adoption and
implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) in December 2014. These measures
combined with military operations against terrorism led to a remarkable improvement in
internal security, indicated by a marked decline in incidents of terrorism throughout the
country.

Although significant progress has been made, the security landscape of the country
has evolved considerably since the announcement of NISP 2014. The threat of transnational
terrorism is rearing its head again. TTP militants have relocated to Afghanistan. Daesh is
establishing a footprint in Afghanistan near the Pakistani border with a very real potential of
spillover into parts of Pakistan. This situation has been compounded by the return of battlehardened militants from Syria and Iraq. Moreover, educational campuses have seen a rise in
incidents of violent extremism. Lastly, the threat of cyber-attacks has grown in volume and
has become more sophisticated. Besides these new challenges, traditional threats to internal
security in the form of acts of violence committed by religious, sectarian, ethno-political and
sub-nationalist outfits persist.

NISP 2018 identifies youth alienation and frustration; exclusionary identity
narratives; a lack of social justice and the rule of law; regional disparities; lack of
accountability and inclusion; and foreign linkages as significant drivers of insecurity.
Furthermore, lack of quality research to understand the pathways to and causes of religious
and ethnic militancy have impeded the development of evidence-based programming and
policies.

The National Internal Security Policy (NISP) 2018 provides a comprehensive
framework for dealing with internal security challenges. It builds on NISP 2014, incorporates
the lessons learnt during the implementation of NAP and proposes a way forward based on
the current situation in Pakistan. NISP envisions a peaceful, democratic and inclusive society
forged by the promotion of the rule of law, inclusive growth, political stability, and respect
for diversity. It, therefore, sets forth establishing the rule of law, the creation of a shared
vision, providing social justice and ensuring political stability as its strategic goals and
objectives. NISP draws inspiration from the teachings of Islam, Quaid-e-Azam’s policy
statements, the Constitution of The Islamic Republic of Pakistan and Pakistan Vision 2025 to
promote the aforementioned values and goals.

The NISP 2018 is based on an expanded notion of security that defines peace not
###### simply as the absence of violence, but as the presence of conditions necessary for enhancing social cohesion and resilience. It integrates development measures with efforts to promote security and peacebuilding as outlined in the Pakistan Vision 2025.


-----

Moreover, it adopts a ‘whole of the nation’ approach and proposes recommendations to
reshape both the ‘state’ and ‘society’ for achieving sustainable peace. These
recommendations fall into three key domains:

**_Administrative Domain: While the Law Enforcement Agencies and the Military have_**
played a critical role in dealing with the menace of terrorism, there is a need to
address and further enhance the capacity of both military and civilian LEA's to deal
with non-traditional threats. This also calls for enhancing coordination and strategic
planning between different institutions and government departments. Measures have
been included in this regard which need to be implemented on a fast track basis.
**_Ideational Domain: The heart of the extremist movement is their narrative which_**
operate in the ideational domain. The terrorists increasingly rely on different modes of
communication which include cyberspace to influence the masses, gain sympathy,
recruit and obtain funding for their operations – all of which requires immediate
attention. This Policy addresses these critical issues and challenges the ideological
underpinnings of extremist narratives that create a mind-set prone to violence and
terrorism.
**_Socio-economic Domain: Security challenges cannot be resolved entirely through_**
administrative actions, or a counter-narrative alone unless the deeper, structural socioeconomic drivers are also addressed. The Policy identifies the need to bridge gaps in
society through critical interventions that will build trust and a harmonious
relationship between state and society leading to a more peaceful Pakistan.

The NISP 2018 establishes a multi-pronged strategy encompassing what we categorize as
the 6Rs to meet the goals and objectives indicated earlier. These include to: Reorient,
Reimagine, Reconcile, Redistribute, Recognize, and the adoption of a Regional Approach.
The six R’s are briefly elaborated upon below:

**Reorient: Reorientation of the Security Apparatus**
The state security apparatus must modernise not only its infrastructure and capacity but also
by redefining its raison d'état and adopting a people-centric approach. Key priority areas
included in this regard include improving strategic cooperation & coordination, intelligence
gathering and sharing, criminal justice system reforms (legal reforms, police & LEAs,
prosecution, judicial reforms, prison reforms, parole and probation), securing cyber spaces,
combating financing of terrorism.

**Reimagine: Reimagining the Society**
Reimagining the society as a tolerant, inclusive and democratic polity will be pursued to
strengthen a shared vision for the nation. Key areas in this regard include building a National
Narrative; reforming the education system; initiating madrassa, mosque & media reforms and
increasing tourism and cultural activities.


-----

**Reconcile**
The incentives for shunning of violence and militancy and for re-integration have to be made
greater than the continuation of militancy and anti-societal discourse and practices.
Moreover, a process of reconciliation will be started especially in regions affected by subnationalist and ethno-political militancy. Key areas in this regard include uplifting FATA,
Balochistan, Karachi and areas of KP that have been worst affected by violence, establishing
an incentive structure to provide a way out to militants stuck in the cycle of violence, deradicalization and rehabilitation programs and an outright ban on the use of violence for
achieving political goals.

**Redistribute**
Promotion of alternative values, narratives, and discourses only gain power and effectiveness
in a context where they are connected with real and shared material improvements in general
social life. Therefore, it is imperative that the state recognises and protects the marginalised
sections of society through redistributive measures focusing on the provision of social
protection safety nets. A key priority in this regard includes the social, economic and political
uplift of marginalised groups such as youth, women and minorities. It is also equally
important to expand social safety nets for the most vulnerable sections of society and
prioritise underdeveloped areas of the country in development plans to reduce regional and
sub-national disparities.

**Regional Approach**
Some security issues such as terrorism are transnational and require collaboration at the
regional and international levels. Promotion of peaceful neighbourhood environments and
close cooperation with neighbouring countries are crucial for efforts to establish durable
internal peace. Key priority areas in this regard include working actively for regional peace
through meaningful collaboration with neighbouring countries and a shift from geopolitics to
geo-economics.

**Recognize**
Critical research on various security challenges is required for designing policy interventions
that address their causes. Promotion of quality research in academia and universities is
essential in identifying the causal factors which push social actors towards extreme
viewpoints and actions. Key priority areas are to bring research in social sciences and
humanities at par with that in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)
areas, move towards evidence-based policy making and enhance analytical capacity within
the Ministries of Interior and Information and Broadcast as well as NACTA to improve
decision/policy making.

The NISP 2018 has a robust implementation and oversight plan with timelines,
budgetary processes and indicators to measure progress. As such, it is an outcome of rich and
exhaustive efforts by the most prominent members of our state and civil society, who gave
their input and time in formulating a policy which has both wide-ranging acceptance and a
similarly wide-ranging vision with regards to our nation’s security and future.


-----

This policy is meant to be a federal framework for internal security and will guide the
security policy at all levels of governance. Recognizing the enhanced role of provinces in
policy implementation in the wake of the 18[th] amendment to the constitution of Pakistan, the
input of all provincial governments through respective home departments was obtained to
formulate this policy. Many of the recommendations proposed in the policy fall within the
domain of provincial governments, and as such, provincial governments are expected to
devise their detailed strategies on various elements of this framework by adapting it to their
specific needs, requirements and priorities.

#### A. Introduction 

On 12th January 2018, a high-level meeting chaired by the Minister for Interior Mr.

Ahsan Iqbal and attended by all key stakeholders within the security apparatus of Pakistan

unanimously approved the roadmap for the formulation of National Internal Security Policy

(NISP) 2018. Following this meeting were three days of extensive stakeholder consultations

from January 16-18 2018, as well as a National Conference on Internal Security on 27th

March 2018 to obtain policy input from a variety of stakeholders. These stakeholders

included parliamentarians, current and former government officials and members of civil

society. A number of government departments at both federal and provincial levels, as well

as civilian and military institutions, participated in the process right from inception to the

revision of the drafts and in finalising the official policy.

The NISP 2018 builds on the first-ever NISP announced in February 2014 to provide a

comprehensive policy framework to deal with key aspects of internal security. The timeframe

envisaged for the implementation of NISP 2014 ended in 2018 and the evolving security

landscape requires a fresh look at the policy paradigm. A new policy document is, therefore,

necessary to incorporate both the lessons learned over the past four years and to respond to

the current security environment. NISP 2018 has consequently been formulated after an

extensive consultative process as an integrated federal framework to overcome internal

security challenges. It is based on the accumulated security assessments, evaluations of

critical initiatives and thought processes within various state institutions as well as that of

civil society to articulate a security vision that represents the collective wisdom of the nation.

At a time when Pakistan is set to achieve another transition from one elected civilian

government that completed its full tenure to another for a record second time in its history, it

is essential that the current government passes on its cumulative experience, knowledge and

recommendations in a unified document to the incoming government in order to ensure

continuity of policies in the realm of internal security. A refreshed security policy will

provide the incoming government with a head start on the broad contours of domestic

security policy while providing an opportunity to fine tune it according to its manifesto. The

priority list of NISP 2018 has therefore been kept flexible and subject to an annual review by

the implementation committee. The significant strength of the document is the extensive

input provided by all key state institutions, representatives of political parties from across the


-----

political spectrum and members of civil society which will enable it to shape the internal

security paradigm by being the overarching framework for the next five years.

**A1. Background**

The security landscape of the country has changed considerably since the announcement

of NISP in 2014. The changes include, most notably, the formulation of National Action Plan

(NAP) against terrorism on 24th December 2014 after the tragic Army Public School (APS)

incident in Peshawar. NAP was supported with unprecedented consensus by all stakeholders

and has since guided the security paradigm of the country. It included priority measures

immediately required to reverse the tide of terrorism, many of which were derived from NISP

2014. An extensive implementation mechanism including ministerial committees as well as

provincial apex committees was established to oversee the implementation of NAP. Many

significant achievements made under this strategy are reflected by the considerable reduction

in the incidences of terrorism throughout the country (as shown in figure 1).

Figure 1: Decline in Incidence of Terrorism in Pakistan (Source: NACTA)

The abatement in incidents of terrorism from its peak in 2014 has been made possible

through concerted efforts and active collaboration between various state institutions and the

use of both hard and soft measures. Military operations such as Zarb-e-Azb and Radd-ul
Fasaad were launched to eliminate militant outfits of all hue and colour and establish the writ

of the state in areas that had become hubs of terrorism. Intelligence based operations (IBOs)

were conducted across the country from rural hinterlands to urban metropolises to apprehend


-----

miscreants as well as their facilitators, abettors and financers. Special trial courts under the

supervision of Pakistan Army were established to compliment Anti-Terrorism Courts.

National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA) was revitalised as the strategic co
ordinating body while dedicated counter-terrorism forces have been created, trained and

deployed in all federating units. Stringent curbs against hate speech have been enforced at

public spaces as well as in print, electronic and social media. A number of steps have been

taken to choke terror financing, including the establishment of a National Task Force on

Combating Financing of Terrorism, a coordinating body of over 20 federal and provincial

organisations. Moreover, 66 organisations were proscribed with 7,966 individuals placed

under watch as of March 2018.

Over 90% geo-mapping of religious seminaries (madaris) has been completed across

the country while efforts to introduce wide-ranging madrassa reforms are underway. Steps

were taken to accord special protection to places of worship in general, and especially for

those belonging to minority communities. Interfaith and intra-faith dialogue has been

facilitated while sacrilegious literature and speeches preaching hate against other faiths have

been curbed. There has also been a very considerable success in reducing sectarian violence

(as shown in Figure 2).

Security has drastically improved in Karachi, the financial and trading heart of the

country. The evidence for this is a 97% decrease in target killings, 87% in the murder rate,

84% in business extortion and 72% in bank robberies. Steps have been taken to facilitate the

dignified return of Afghan refugees to their homeland. Over 1.38 million Afghan refugees

have been registered under the Tripartite Agreement for Voluntary Repatriation, the most

extensive voluntary repatriation program recorded by the UNHCR. Rehabilitation of

internally displaced persons and revival of economic activity in conflict-affected areas such

as FATA is being prioritised. The constitutional amendment for the merger of FATA with

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been approved. Despite sporadic incidents of violence, the overall

security situation has improved in Balochistan. The government has allocated additional

funds for the uplift of the province and to bring it at par with other federating units.

These achievements are a testament to the courage, grit and determination of the civil and

military law enforcement agencies (LEAs) as well as the resolve of the political leadership

and most importantly the people of Pakistan to establish peace and harmony. This policy is a

tribute, therefore, to the LEA personnel and citizens from across the country who sacrificed

their lives, limbs and property to ensure the safety of the nation. Security, however, remains

the top priority of the government and continued efforts need to be made to achieve

sustainable peace. This policy, therefore, reflects the resolve of the government to provide a

forward-looking, holistic and comprehensive framework to ensure that every citizen of

Pakistan can live with peace, freedom, respect and dignity.

**A2. Domains of Interventions**

The gains made through following a mix of kinetic and soft prong interventions

mentioned above need immediate consolidation through structural reforms and further soft

measures aimed at countering extremism and other security challenges at the administrative,

ideological, socio-economic and political levels. National Internal Security Policy 2018,

therefore, adopts a ‘whole of the nation’ approach and envisages key interventions to reshape

both ‘state’ and the ‘society’ for an inclusive, democratic and peaceful Pakistan.

The following vital domains have been conceptualised to effectively deal with the

security challenges that Pakistan faces.

infractions. These are then combined with more proximate “pull” factors such as the material

and financial benefits of joining extremist groups, perceived social status, and appealing

ideologies and recruiters.

The Policy identifies the need to bridge gaps in society through critical interventions that

will not only build trust and a harmonious relationship between the state and its people but

also lead to a progressive, tolerant and peaceful Pakistan. It, therefore, not only provides a

diagnosis of the critical security challenges but also envisages an integrated, holistic,

comprehensive and cohesive Federal framework for effectively dealing with these.

**Federal-Provincial Domains:** This policy is meant to be a federal framework for

Internal Security and will guide the security policy at all levels of governance. Recognising

the enhanced role of provinces in policy implementation in the wake of the 18th amendment

to the constitution of Pakistan, the input of all provincial governments through respective

home departments was obtained for the formulation of this policy. Many of the

recommendations proposed in the policy fall within the domain of provincial governments.

Provincial governments are expected to devise their detailed strategies on various elements of

this framework by adapting it to their specific needs, requirements and priorities. 5-year

provincial ‘rule of law’ roadmaps, for example, are already in the making and will

supplement this policy. In order to ensure effective implementation and facilitate smooth

coordination between the federal and provincial governments, an Inter-Provincial

Coordination Committee headed by Interior Minister will be formed at the level of Chief

Ministers and Home Ministers to oversee implementation of those postulates of this policy

that provinces are required to implement (these have been specified in the Implementation

Plan detailed in Annex A). Furthermore, Apex Committees established to coordinate the

implementation of the NAP in provinces will continue as a platform for high-level decision

making at the intra-provincial level. It is hoped that such mechanism provides a template for

inter-provincial and federal-provincial coordination going forward.

#### B. Process of Policy Formulation 

The Policy has been drafted after extensive consultations with key stakeholders. The

vision and objectives of the policy-formulation process were informed by the need to

incorporate the inputs and feedback of stakeholders in various domains of state and civil


-----

society. In keeping with the holistic vision of policy-making above, three key stakeholder

groups were consulted for the National Internal Security Policy 2018.

1) **Parliamentarians: Since they are at the forefront of legislation, policy formulation**

and oversight, it is only natural to consider parliamentarians and associated

committees as crucial stakeholders in the consultation process. The representatives of

all major political parties from treasury and the opposition benches in both Senate and

National Assembly were consulted. These also include the members of Parliamentary

Committees on Interior in both upper and lower houses.

2) **Government departments and key LEA personnel: Different arms of the state and**

especially the Law Enforcement and Security Agencies play a critical role in policy

implementation. Personnel in these agencies are responsible for delivering results and

have the most direct, day-to-day interaction with citizens. As such, they are in an ideal

position to provide feedback and recommend improvements on various security

initiatives. Both serving and retired government officials at both federal and

provincial levels as well as from civil and military institutions were extensively

consulted.

3) **Civil society representatives: Civil society groups are vital to ensure political and**

social stability and act as conduits between citizens and different spheres of the state.

Moreover, as globalisation has made the relationship between state and society more

sophisticated and clearly articulated, there is an increased importance of various

institutions of civil society in observing, analysing and directing processes of social

change. As such, CSOs, NGOs, academics, and religious leaders are vital

interlocutors in understanding the drivers of insecurity and in the identification and

implementation of appropriate and holistic solutions.

The NISP 2018 formulation process included eight roundtable consultation sessions as

well as a national conference on internal security. An extensive literature review comprising

of Internal Security Policies of relevant countries as well as critical reports, documents,

academic papers and books was conducted (Annex B). This desk research was complemented

by one-to-one interviews with senior members of state and civil society organisations.

Institutional input was also sought from key state institutions, and the policy draft was shared

for their detailed feedback. Over 120 experts have been directly involved in the formulation

of NISP 2018. Care has been taken to ensure that not only experts from all relevant fields of


-----

life but particularly representatives of religious and ethnic minorities, marginalised groups

such as women, youth and the differently abled as well as junior ranked government officials

were also included in the process. Indirectly, the document also incorporated

recommendations of detailed consultations conducted by the likes of NACTA, Law and

Justice Commission, provincial home departments, various federal ministries, NADRA and

military institutions. The idea was not to reinvent the wheel but to integrate findings of

multiple initiatives aimed at shaping policy and incorporate these in an over-arching

framework. The institutions mentioned above deserve credit for their valuable efforts in

helping shape this policy.

#### C. An Overview of the Security Landscape

Many severe security challenges persist in Pakistan that affect the lives of its citizens.

Although terrorism and extremism continue to be the most daunting challenges that Pakistan

must overcome today, the internal security landscape is continually evolving and has become

increasingly complex.

Over the years the form, tactics and nature of terrorism has changed. To begin with,

the threat of transnational terrorist groups has grown significantly in the past few years. The

emergence of Daesh in close proximity to Pakistan has raised new internal security

challenges. Recent reports suggest that Daesh is establishing a footprint in the Afghan

provinces bordering Pakistan. The potential for spill over in Pakistan with the support and

collaboration of TTP and its offshoots is not a possibility to be ignored. This situation has

been compounded by the return of battle-hardened militants from Syria and Iraq. Secondly,

there is adequate evidence that radicalisation and militancy is no longer limited to Madrassas

alone. Young people from relatively affluent and middle-class backgrounds, educated in

mainstream universities and schools, are also vulnerable to extremist ideas and narratives.

Thirdly, terrorism is as much an urban phenomenon as rural, and needs to be tackled as such.

Lastly, cyber space has emerged as a key domain for the spread of extremist ideas.

Notwithstanding the broad spectrum of security challenges, this policy deals mainly with

the following:


-----

**C1. Terrorism**

Pakistan has seen terrorism being used as a tool to pursue a variety of interests under the

garb of religion, sectarianism and ethnicity. While sporadic political violence has occurred

throughout the history of the country, terrorism surged in the aftermath of September 11

attacks in the US followed by the war in Afghanistan. Post-9/11 Pakistan saw the rise and

growth of terrorism at an unprecedented scale. Al-Qaeda and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan

emerged as significant threats to the security of the country. The internal security situation

was further exacerbated by the persistence and augmentation of the conflict in Afghanistan.

According to official estimates, Pakistan has lost thousands of lives and suffered a loss of

$123 billion over the past 15 years. The government of Pakistan has adopted a range of soft

and hard measures to deal with the menace of terrorism including the National Action Plan,

military operations, multiple counter-terrorism legislation and de-radicalisation programs.

As a result of these efforts, the incidents of terrorism have considerably reduced during the

period between 2014 to 2018. The threat of four critical types of terrorism, however,

remains active:

1) Terrorism in the name of Religion: Many terrorist groups remain active in the

country with the stated aim of imposing their interpretation of religion and

establishing a global caliphate while discrediting democratically elected governments,

civil and military institutions as being un-Islamic. Most of these terrorist outfits stand

either proscribed or eliminated already by Pakistan, but comprehensive action is

required to remove their traces entirely and choke any financing that they may draw

from the country.

2) Sectarian Terrorism: Several sectarian outfits originated in Pakistan and continue to

have a presence. They belong to various sects and denominations and often use

violent means to target prominent personalities, festivals, and places of worship

belonging to the other sects.

3) Ethno-Political Terrorism: The confluence of ethnic identity and politics has

resulted in violence along racial lines to achieve specific political and economic ends.

Karachi, the largest and most ethnically diverse city in the country, has suffered

immensely due to such turf battles. Often, these battles are linked to conflicts over

real estate, territorial control, and constituency gerrymandering.


-----

4) **Sub-nationalist terrorism: Sub-national conflict in Balochistan remains a persistent**

challenge for peace and stability in Pakistan. Sub-national militants have used

violence to pursue their goals.

**C2. Extremism**

The diffusion of violent ideologies in a cross-section of society has given rise to

intolerance and extremism that provides a breeding ground for a new generation of terrorists.

Despite success in curbing terrorism, little has been done to eradicate extremism. Admittedly,

extremism is harder to fight given that it is a mindset and can only be defeated by the

inculcation of an alternate value system in society. Steps, however, are urgently required to

deal with prevalent extremism to realise the dream of a tolerant, peaceful and harmonious

Pakistan.

**C3. Cyber Crime**

Cyber threats pose a serious challenge to internal security. Cyber-attacks have grown in

volume and become sophisticated over the years. These can range from hacking of critical

government or financial data to virtually paralyzing the country through attacking its

communication network or energy infrastructure. Equally challenging and damaging is the

spread of violent and extremist ideologies using cyberspace. Recently, terrorist groups such

as Daesh have used social networking sites to spread their poisonous ideology and recruit

people. The internet has enabled them to rapidly disseminate their messages and reach out to

a much bigger audience circumventing the barriers imposed by geography and distance.

**C4. Organised Crime**

The prevalence of organised gangs involved in criminal activities remains a key security

challenge. These range from gangs engaged in drug trafficking and smuggling to those

involved in extortion, kidnaping, money laundering and land grabbing. Often these gangs are

integrated into transnational circuits of arms and drugs, drawing sustenance through these

linkages.

In recent years, there has been a confluence of different terrorist and violent outfits with

groups involved in organised crime. Revenue generated through criminal activities have been


-----

used to fund terrorism. These linkages help to build capacities (concerning access to

weapons, funds, expertise, and strategies) for various terrorist outfits. The collection of funds

for charitable purposes and its potential use to fund terrorist activities, infrastructure and

armed groups has also complicated the security landscape. These linkages lead to the blurring

of lines between different types of security challenges, thus further complicating and

thwarting the success of “law and order” approaches to security. As a result, the social factors

which accrue to the building of these networks of criminality and violence must be addressed

for any sustainable security strategy.

**C5. Sub-National Variations**

Internal differentiation of the security landscape can be divided as follows:

**Punjab** is most populous province of Pakistan and has seen the least violence in the

country (in terms of overall fatalities), however average death toll per terrorist attack in

Punjab remains the highest in the nation. This figure can be attributed to the deadly nature of

terrorist attacks in the province which are targeted at rush areas for inflicting maximum

damage. Some sectarian organisations have their origins and presence in the province. Inter

and intra-sect rivalries, ideological exploitation of sentiments by raising a false plea for jihad,

pan-Islamic appeals, religious & international terrorist organisations, propagation of violent

narratives over social media, and issues in both mainstream/religious education system

remain vital issues. Some instances of religious riots as well as the majority of blasphemy

accusations have also occurred in the province.

**Sindh is ranked as the second most violent region after KP and FATA in terms of**

casualties on a per capita basis, although in absolute numbers, the province has been conflict
prone since the mid-1980s. Karachi has been the theatre for much of the violence in Sind

province. The largest city, as well as the economic hub of Pakistan, has seen bitter ethnic

conflict between various communities. The ethnic strife and politicisation along ethnic lines

as well as the geographic concentration of these fault lines have given rise to the phenomena

of target killings, turf wars, extortion as well as organised crime.

**Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and FATA have been affected by the war in neighbouring**

Afghanistan and its spillover. Between 2005 and 2012, the region recorded approximately

11,862 casualties involving civilians, security forces, and militants, primarily as a result of


-----

terrorist-related activity. FATA and adjoining regions, in particular, have seen religiously

motivated attacks with a number of militia forces vying for control over territory. The

militants briefly also controlled settled districts of Swat and Buner, merely 100 miles away

from the capital Islamabad. Most of the incidents of terrorism have also been tracked to this

region. Various successful military operations have been able to clear the area and re
establish the writ of the state.

**Balochistan has traditionally seen violent ethnic conflict threatening the integrity of**

the State. It is Pakistan’s largest province in terms of its geographic size, comprising about 42

percent of the national territory. Concerning extremism and violence, it is ranked fourth

among other provinces. In recent years, sectarian conflict has also affected the province with

minority communities, especially the Hazaras, being targeted in Quetta, the provincial

capital.

**Gilgit-Baltistan has remained largely peaceful, however some violence along**

sectarian lines has been witnessed. Azad Jammu and Kashmir have seen violence mostly

due to cross-border firing on the Line of Control; however, the region has otherwise remained

relatively peaceful.

The above-mentioned security challenges represent symptoms of several social, economic

and political conflicts that, if not addressed, will continue to fuel instability and violence. It is

therefore essential to go beyond traditional threat assessment and understand the structural

drivers of insecurity in society so that tailored policy interventions can be formulated to

address the root causes of extremism, violence and terrorism in the country.

#### D. Drivers of Insecurity 

In terms of understanding the sources of insecurity in a society, there is a tendency among

policy circles to reduce the complexity of an issue to a single or few determinants. In

epistemological terms, this approach is deemed a reductionist method as it ignores the

embedded complexity in society. The guiding methodology of this policy is anti
reductionism and anti-essentialism. From the outset we would like to acknowledge the fact

that social reality is quite complex and cannot be reduced to one or two determinants. Social,

political, economic, cultural, religious and all other spheres of social reality are theoretical

constructs that help us simplify analysis. But we should not forget the fact that in the real


-----

world we do not have well defined and demarcated social spheres, instead everything is

interconnected and overlapping in nature. Therefore, in social totality, a change in one factor

is simultaneously a cause and an effect. Being cognizant of this complexity of our social

reality, the policy framework developed in this policy appreciates intersections and over
determination among various social phenomena.

Keeping above in mind, some of the key sources of the continuance of security challenges in

the country are as follows:

**D1. Youth Alienation and Frustration**

Pakistan currently has the most significant percentage of young people ever recorded in

its history, which is approximately 60% of its total population. A vast majority of these

young people expect access to quality education, decent jobs, meaningful engagement and

participation opportunities. Scholars have associated the existence of large cohorts of youth

with social unrest and conflict. Evidence suggests that large groups of young people are more

likely to experience economic exclusion and barriers to social mobility. This is compounded

by the lack of meaningful social and political participation opportunities which create

perceptions of helplessness and loss of social status and control over their lives and destinies

among young people. All these factors increase the chances and motives for engaging in

violence, extremism and terrorism as a shortcut to achieve recognition, social status, money

and perceived power over a group of people.

**D2. Exclusionary Identity Narratives**

The growth of exclusionary identity discourses around gender, religion, sect and ethnicity

has also contributed to the rise of extremism and militancy in Pakistan. This is integrally tied

to a lack of shared values and vision which different strata and social groups can subscribe to.

The spread of these discourses is explained by a range of domestic and external factors.

Internally, a lack of societal consensus over the role of religion in politics and a flawed

education system lies at the heart of the problem. Our education system encourages rote

learning and has been ineffective in promoting critical thinking and challenging exclusionary

narratives of religion and society. These narratives have also been reinforced by the surge in

populist identity politics across the world including South Asia. Based on restrictive notions


-----

of citizenship and cultural harmony, such ideologies have strengthened exclusionary

narratives within Pakistan.

**D3. Regional Inequality**

The presence of large disparities among groups or regions and the existence of weakly

governed pockets offer an enabling environment where extremist narratives and militancy

can thrive easily. Research evidence shows that regional inequalities increase the risk of

internal conflict. Conflict is more likely when cultural or linguistic differences among groups

coincide with economic and political disparities. The presence of group inequalities along

multiple dimensions can easily be interpreted as a consequence of deliberate discrimination

against the group. This holds true in case of Pakistan where the most deprived and

underdeveloped regions—i.e. Balochistan and FATA—also have the highest incidence of

militancy. Today, FATA (74%) and Balochistan (71%) respectively have the highest rates of

multidimensional poverty followed by KP (49%), Sindh (43%) and Punjab (31%).

Similarly, weakly governed spaces often become fertile breeding grounds for local,

national and transnational terrorist groups. Most such areas are governed by

alternative laws and justice systems rooted in tribal codes and customs. Terrorists exploit

these alternative social and political orders in their favour and promise service delivery and

speedy dispensation of justice. FATA is a classic example of this. FATA’s unique

administrative status and governance rules—i.e. the FCR system combined with the porous

border with Afghanistan enabled Taliban, Al-Qaeda and other international terrorist groups to

gain a foothold there, in the past.

**D4. Lack of Social Justice and Rule of Law**

Drivers of violence are often rooted in the social and political fabric of states. Routine

experiences of injustice, discrimination, corruption and abuse create legitimate grievances.

Extremist and militant groups exploit and capitalise on these genuine grievances to offer

alternatives that are often violent and based on the dangerously simplistic binary of “us vs the

other”. A lack of social justice also leads to perceptions of hindered aspirations and the

breakdown of traditional structures of support and community. As a result, it becomes

difficult to forge a shared national vision and values which can counter the rise of militancy

and extremist/exclusionary ideologies.


-----

**D5. Lack of Accountability and Political Inclusion**

Exclusions do not only act at the level of discourse or the economy. The lack of

mechanisms for transparency and participation in the spheres of state and civil society also

leads to alienation and a groundswell suitable for cultivation of violence and insecurity. Such

lack of accountability and participatory mechanisms extend all the way from neighbourhood,

universities, police and lower bureaucracy, up to the very highest levels of the state and

federation. An absence of the institutional mechanisms for addressing and negotiating

differences leads to hardening of social attitudes and identities, which in turn work against a

diverse, pluralistic, peaceful polity and society.

**D6. Foreign Linkages**

Some security challenges such as terrorism, drug and human trafficking and the

movement of other contraband items have a transnational dimension. Unchecked movement

of people in the presence of terrorist sanctuaries across the border poses a serious threat to

internal security. Tension with – and interference from – neighbouring countries have also

contributed to the undermining of a key source of tackling insecurity, i.e. the devising and

implementation of joint strategies against transnational groups and drivers of insecurity and

violence through regional and international cooperation.

In addition to the above drivers, specific other factors have facilitated the growth of

terrorism in Pakistan e.g. availability of small arms. Clamping down on terror financing

continues to be a critical task given the social, political and economic realities of Pakistan.

There has been a general dearth of quality social science research with regards to issues

and problems facing Pakistan. In case of extremism and terrorism, the lack of quality

research has meant that our current understanding of the subject is informed less by empirical

evidence and academic analysis and more by personal experiences, ideological leanings and

intuition. Much of this is due to historical neglect of the social sciences, perverse incentive

structures which promote mediocre and unoriginal research (especially in public sector

institutions), and a general lack of academic and intellectual freedoms. The absence of quality

research on the social drivers of extremism and insecurity has, in turn, meant that translation

into policy has been weak and of limited efficacy.


-----

#### E. Inspirations for Policy Formulation 

A key function of the internal security policy is to define and provide a strategy to protect

the core values of a nation. NISP 2018 identifies inclusivity, democracy and dignity as

crucial values that must be protected and promoted to ensure peace and harmony in the

country. It aspires for a pluralistic society that celebrates diversity, where the fate of the

people is in their own hands and where everyone is guaranteed a dignified life.

The following sources provided inspiration for the creation of such a society and have

guided the formulation of National Internal Security Policy 2018.

**E1. Teachings of Islam**

The teachings of Islam call for tolerance, forbearance and peaceful coexistence. Islam

aims to develop harmony and congruence among diverse communities and promotes mutual

respect and accord between them. In verse 99 of Sura Younus the Holy Quran explains that if

it had been God’s Will to not grant free will to humankind, He could have made all

humankind alike and all would then have Faith. Thus the men of Faith must guard against the

temptation of forcing Faith by any means of compulsion. Hence the Holy Quran upholds

diversity and tolerance as part of the Divine Will. The Holy Quran sees disputations in the

matter of religion as futile and urges its adherents to find common grounds of belief through

civility, compassion, sincerity, and a genuine concern for the good of others.

As Qur’an states clearly:

“Had God willed, He would have made you a single community, but He wanted to test you

regarding what has come to you. So compete with each other in doing good” (Surat al
Ma’ida, 48)

“There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion.” (Holy Quran 2:256)

Moreover, there are several examples from the practices and sayings of the Prophet

Muhammad (SAW) which stress the importance of diversity and pluralism. The Agreement

of Medina between the communities of Muhajireen, Ansar and Jewish residents of the city is

often considered to be the first constitutional document in the history of state-making. The


-----

very basis of the Constitution was based on the recognition of diversity and the promotion of

peace between different communities. In fact, the Prophet (SAW) was once asked, “What is

Eemaan (belief/faith)?”, He (SAW) replied: “Eemaan (faith) is patience and tolerance.” On

another occasion He (SAW) said: “Do you know what is better than charity, fasting and

prayer? It is keeping peace and good relations among people” (Muslim & Bukhari).

**E2. Quaid-e-Azam’s Policy Statements**

The life, practices and policy statements of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah point

to his vision for a tolerant, diverse and forward-looking country. The Quaid-e-Azam valued

religious and cultural diversity very highly among his circle of close friends and confidants.

The presence of two very strong women in his life – his wife Ruttie Jinnah and his sister Ms.

Fatima Jinnah – impresses upon us his views about women’s role in society. Moreover, from

his very first days as a trade unionist with the All India Postal Workers’ Union to his

vigorous defence of the anti-colonial freedom fighter Bhagat Singh in the courts, Quaid-e
Azam espoused a vision of social justice and equality in society. His statements and vision

with regards to the direction of the new state and the place of religious diversity did not

change despite numerous tragic incidents during partition. Thus, it is crucial to revive and

implement anew the Quaid’s vision of a socially just and tolerant Pakistan for us to build a

new shared vision and equitable society where all citizens are equal irrespective of caste,

creed, gender or religion. Some of the Quaid’s quotes which point irrevocably towards a

vision based on democracy, social justice and equality can be seen below:

“Minorities to whichever community they may belong; will be safeguarded. Their

religion or faith or belief will be secure. There will be no interference of any kind with their

freedom of worship. They will have their protection with regard to their religion, faith, their

life, their culture. They will be, in all respects, the citizens of Pakistan without any distinction

of caste or creed.

Islam and its idealism have taught us democracy. It has taught equality of man, justice

and fair play to everybody. We are the inheritors of these glorious traditions and are fully

alive to our responsibilities and obligations as framers of the future constitution of Pakistan.

In any case Pakistan is not going to be a theocratic State to be ruled by priests with a divine

mission. We have many non-Muslims --Hindus, Christians, and Parsis --but they are all


-----

Pakistanis. They will enjoy the same rights and privileges as any other citizens and will play

their rightful part in the affairs of Pakistan”. (Broadcast talk to the people of the United States

of America on Pakistan recorded February, 1948)

“I have always maintained that no nation can ever be worthy of its existence that cannot

take its women along with the men. No struggle can ever succeed without women

participating side by side with men”. (Speech at Islamia College for women March 25, 1940)

“Our object should be peace within, and peace without. We want to live peacefully and

maintain cordial friendly relations with our immediate neighbours and with the world at

large” (Lahore, August 15th, 1947)

**E3. The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973**

The constitution provides the sacred covenant between and among the people of Pakistan

and the State. It guarantees fundamental human rights including that to the life and property

for all citizens of the country irrespective of their religion, sect, caste, gender or ethnicity.

The Constitution provides guarantees for the safety and protection of religious minorities in

the country. Moreover, there are also guarantees for the institution of local government and

the provision of basic necessities of life such as food, housing, clothing and medical facilities.

It is therefore the primary responsibility of the state to serve all citizens without

discrimination. Some of the salient features of the Constitution which are especially relevant

for the internal security policy and its wider vision are given below:

**Protection of minorities: Principles of Policy ensure the protection of interest and**

legitimate rights of minorities including their due representation in national and provincial

services.

**Promotion of local government: The state is responsible to establish and maintain local**

government institutions so that a locality is served at their doorsteps. Elected representatives

elected by the general public run local governments. This is another step taken under

principles of policy.


-----

Promotion of social justice and eradication (prevention) of social evils: Article 37 of constitution

under Principles of Policy provides a long list of relevant domains including the eradication of

uneven social and economic development. As such, the state is liable to provide facilities for

education and economic activities in under developed areas so that they come up to the level of

rest of the country.

Social and economic well-being: The Principles of Policy has also provided under Article 38 of

constitution, provisions of the social and economic well-being of the people. Article 38 provides

six provisions on the topic, some of which are as below:

1. State shall ensure the due compliance of social contracts, which is meant between

government and people and employers and employees. State shall also ensure equitable

distribution of wealth and means of production.

2. These principles bind the state to provide facilities for work and adequate livelihood with

reasonable rest and leisure. This is for all citizens within available and limited resources.

Minimum wages have been defined. Medical, casual, and annual leaves are provided under

labour laws.

3. State is responsible to provide sufficient social security by compulsory social insurance or

other means.

4. State is also obliged to provide necessities to its citizens either in service or not. These

necessities include food, clothing, housing, education, and medical relief. No distinction is

allowed with relation to age, sex, creed, tribe, caste, and race.

5. Equitable distribution of wealth within territory of Pakistan is ensured under Principles of
Policy.

**E4. Pakistan Vision 2025**

Pakistan Vision 2025, launched by the Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform in 2014

puts forward a new integrated approach to Development Planning that aims to put Pakistan on

an accelerated development path while preparing society for emerging global changes in modes

of wealth creation and growth. The document laying down the future vision for Pakistan’s

development identifies five key enablers. Peace and Security, finds its place, along with Social

Justice, Rule of Law, Political Stability & Continuity of Policies and Shared Vision among key

enablers which would have to be in place for Pakistan to grow and prosper.

This is the first time that state-level planning process has acknowledged Peace and


-----

Security as a critical requirement for growth and development. These key enablers form the

basis for the Vision and Objectives outlined in the National Internal Security Policy 2018.

This also tackles the shortcoming and fears expressed around the current security paradigm

by creating space for those societal processes which create a sustainable environment of

peace and security.

Pakistan Vision 2025 also envisages a strategy for developing a united and equitable

society through balanced and rapid economic development to ensure social uplift of

marginalised and underdeveloped sections/regions of the nation. It mainly focuses on

governance, institutional reforms and modernisation of the public sector to create a flat, agile,

streamlined and tech-enabled public sector. This includes enhancing efficiency, transparency

and effectiveness of the public sector through the development of a skilled, motivated,

results-focused and ‘high performance’ civil service. Above all, the document focuses on

‘putting people first’ by providing every citizen with the ability to improve his/her choices

and quality of life. This requires rapid increase in investments in education, health and social

development, generating jobs and prospects for the youth bulge, harnessing the rising power

of a socially aware population, gender equality and women’s development, inclusion of

vulnerable segments, interfaith harmony and acceptance of religious diversity, promotion of

art, culture and heritage, expanding sports facilities and moving towards a knowledge-based,

ethical and values-driven society. This Policy argues that the socio-economic uplift envisaged

under Vision 2025 is directly linked with establishing peace and harmony in the nation where

both mutually reinforce each other.

#### F. Vision – NISP 2018

The NISP 2018 is centred on the promotion of peace, security and development in

Pakistan as envisaged in the Pakistan Vision 2025. It advocates an expanded notion of

security that defines peace not simply in terms of absence of violence but the presence of

conditions necessary for socio-economic and political development of the people of Pakistan

which will lead to a resilient, tolerant and peaceful society. As such, it emphasizes on the

promotion of rule of law, pluralism, inclusive growth, social and economic justice as basic

ingredients for achieving sustainable peace and security within the country.

**F1. Vision Statement**

_NISP envisions a peaceful, democratic and inclusive society by establishing rule of law and_

_promoting shared prosperity, tolerance and respect for diversity._


-----

#### G. Strategic Goals & Objectives

Pakistan Vision 2025 provides a multifaceted framework to establish peace and security

as a prerequisite for sustainable peace and development. NISP 2018 has adopted the critical

enablers identified in Pakistan Vision 2025 as its key strategic goals and objectives. These

include the following:

**G1. Establishing Rule of Law**

The Policy aims to protect the life, property and fundamental rights of the citizens of

Pakistan by establishing the rule of law. This requires enforcement of state laws/regulations

in letter and spirit through an effective coordination between various constituents of the

criminal justice system. Violation of human rights can become a crucial driver for extremism

and radicalization, and it is therefore, essential to establish the rule of law and deliver justice.

This entails the following concrete steps:

**_G1.1 Extending Writ of the State_**

Terrorism and extremism can thrive due to inadequate application of the writ of the

state. The extension of the writ of the state to all parts of the country, especially in the form

of effective policing and the jurisdiction of courts, is a crucial objective for the National

Internal Security Policy.

**_G1.2 Institutional Reforms_**

Institutions which exist as the interface of state and civil society can play a key role in

creating conducive conditions for security. The policy, therefore, aims to enhance the

efficiency and effectiveness of the security apparatus along with making them more

transparent and accountable to prevent, deter and transparently contain threats to internal

security.

**_G1.3 Improving Governance and Service Delivery_**

Negligence and lack of capacity concerning governance and service delivery create an

environment where insecurity and violence can thrive. This may be due to the lack of

extension of the welfare arm of the state or just due to lack of capacity even when the


-----

requisite institutions and departments are present. Thus, the welfare arm of the state must be

extended and its ability enhanced as a competent provider of service in all parts of the

country.

**G2. Creation of a Shared Vision**

Creating a shared vision based on core values that define the kind of society ours ought to

be is essential to ensure social cohesion. This requires various arms of the state and segments

of society to come together to create a minimum common consensus on shared values that

must be preserved and promoted.

**G3. Ensuring Social Justice**

Re-formulating the role of critical social and state institutions such as community

organisations and social safety nets providers is of crucial importance in promoting an

inclusive vision of state and society. Extending the welfare arm can help reverse the socio
economic conditions that create a breeding ground for violence.

**G4. Political Stability**

Political stability is a key prerequisite for national cohesion and sustainable development.

Experiences of various countries around the world show that political instability and unrest

can have severe implications for national integration and social cohesion. Furthermore,

policies can only generate desired results when political stability is provided. Therefore,

consensus on a shared national agenda centred on the continuation of democracy and

ensuring political stability remain important objectives of the internal security policy.

#### H. National Internal Security Strategy 

On the basis of the vision articulated earlier, challenges and their causes identified in the

preceding sections, a comprehensive policy along with a multi-pronged strategy/Action Plan

is geared to achieve the objectives set above. The National Internal Security Strategy,

therefore, consists of what we categorize as 6Rs that include: Reorient, Reimagine,

Reconcile, Redistribute, Recognize and a Regional approach. The aim here is to acknowledge


-----

the variety and complexity of circumstances that lead to security challenges and provide a

multi-pronged framework (as shown in figure 3) that allows synchronised interventions in

various domains (such as administrative, ideational and socio-economic) to reshape social

reality. Furthermore, all of the prongs mentioned above represent policy directions and

provide a set of interventions that directly correspond with and contribute towards achieving

strategic goals and objectives of this policy. ‘Reorient’ for example lays down the plan for

establishing the rule of law, ‘Reimagine’ addresses the creation of a shared vision,

‘Redistribute’ provides guidance for ensuring social justice whereas ‘Reconcile’ (along with

other prongs) provides a roadmap for ensuring political stability.

While efforts have been made to provide a comprehensive and tailored list of

interventions under each pillar mentioned above, priority areas have also been identified to

help government focus its efforts given time and resource constraints. Furthermore,

interventions have been categorised as short, medium and long-term steps in the

implementation plan to help divert resources accordingly. Lastly, the idea was not to reinvent

the wheel but to integrate the recommendations already compiled after extensive

deliberations by various state institutions, government departments and members of civil

society. This ensures broader ownership of the policy and reduces duplication of effort. The

six pillars of the national internal security strategy are detailed below:


-----

**VISION**

**SECURITY = PEACE &**

**DEVELOPMENT**


**RULE OF LAW**


**REGIONAL**
**APPROACH**


**SHARED**
**VISION**


**STRATEGY**


**RECOGNISE**


**REIMAGINE**


Figure 3: National Internal Security Framework

**H1. Reorient**

Reorientation of the Security Apparatus will be undertaken for achieving the vision

and strategic objectives envisaged in this policy.

**Rationale: The state security apparatus must modernise not only its infrastructure and**

capacity but also by redefining its raison d’etre. The State Institutions exist for the service of

the people of Pakistan, and this should be manifested in letter and spirit by all the State

institutions. This reorientation will require strengthening of the relationship between the state

institutions and the citizens through the adoption of people-centric approach in governance


**SECURITY = PEACE &**

**DEVELOPMENT**


**SOCIAL**
**JUSTICE**


**REDISTRIBUTE**


**RECONCILE**


-----

and improved service delivery with greater accountability. All organs of the state, civil and

military leadership will continue to work towards that end. Reorientation of the Security

Apparatus will be undertaken for achieving the vision, and strategic objectives envisaged in

this policy.

The following sets of interventions are designed to help reorient the security apparatus to deal

with contemporary challenges effectively.

**Key areas of focus: Improving Strategic Cooperation & Coordination; Intelligence**

Gathering and Sharing; Criminal Justice System Reforms (Legal Reforms, Police & LEAs,

Prosecution, Judicial Reforms, Prison Reforms, Parole and Probation with a view to provide

speedy and transparent justice with a people-centric approach), Securing Cyber Spaces,

Combating Financing of Terrorism, human trafficking, drugs and crime, and responding to

disasters (man-made or natural).

Following steps will be taken to reorient the security apparatus:

**_H1.1 Strategic Cooperation & Coordination_**

1. Interprovincial Coordination Committee on Internal Security headed by Minister of

Interior will be established at the levels of Chief Ministers and Home Ministers.

2. NACTA will continue to be the key federal organization responsible for ensuring

coordination among LEAs against terrorism and extremism along with other

functions specified in NACTA ACT 2013.

3. It will be ensured that meetings of BoG of NACTA are held as per the provision in

NACTA Act 2013.

4. NACTA will develop strong analytical capability at its Joint Intelligence Directorate

(JID) to analyse the intelligence reports and ensure that critical information is shared

with relevant stakeholders in a timely fashion.

a. To this end, NACTA will provide a threat assessment in light of intelligence

received from multiple agencies/sources.

5. A comprehensive National Terrorism Database synchronized with the police

departments of the country, NADRA, FIA and State Bank of Pakistan and other


-----

relevant departments and agencies will be established at NACTA. The Database will

have the following features:

a. A synchronized red book containing updated information about wanted,

suspected and arrested terrorists and their affiliated groups.

b. The Databank will also include among other elements deemed appropriate,

details about activities, bank accounts details, financial transactions, property

and other assets of suspected and active terrorists whose names have been

placed on the fourth schedule. Adequate human and financial resources will be

provided to run the National Terrorism Database.

**_H1.2 Intelligence Gathering and Sharing_**

6. Intelligence gathering capacity of the Police and CTDs will be further enhanced

through continued funding and training.

7. Intelligence Based Operations (IBO’s) will be prioritized over other measures such as

combing operations, stop & search and check points that lead to public resentment

and at times further radicalization.

8. All intelligence agencies will devise a uniform system of grading the intelligence

reports with respect to their credibility and urgency.

**_H1.3 Criminal Justice System Reforms_**

Improvements in the criminal justice system (CJS) are the most crucial part of

reorienting the security apparatus to provide justice, establish the rule of law and maintain

law and order. It is important however to recognise that improvements in the civil justice

system is also critical in preventing crime. It is often the failure of the civil justice system to

dispense speedy and affordable justice that gives rise to increased criminal activity. Modern

concepts of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), swift enforcement of contracts and

improved system of land titling need to be introduced.

Shortcomings in the CJS necessitated the establishment of military courts as a short
term solution. It is essential however that CJS is improved on urgent basis during this time so

that the accused (including those charged with terrorism-related crimes) can be prosecuted

and tried under the civilian dispensation. This policy, therefore, makes it a point to provide a

comprehensive set of measures in this regard. These have been adapted from

recommendations compiled by NACTA and the Law and Justice Commission after months of

consultation with all relevant stakeholders and therefore have across the board backing. The


-----

CJS reforms include improvements in the legislative framework, law enforcement agencies,

investigation, prosecution, and judicial system, prisons and parole and probation system.

**_Legal Reforms_**

9. Legal amendments and reforms will be introduced in coordination with Judiciary

through Law and Justice Commission and Ministry of Law and Justice. These

include:

a. Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 will be amended to simplify procedure and

ensure easy access to courts.

b. Amendments in Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 will be made to prevent its abuse.

Moreover, clauses that overlap or conflict with other laws, such as Pakistan

Penal Code 1860 and Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 should also

be amended.

c. Anti-money laundering laws and operations will be strengthened.

d. Evidence law (qanoon-e-shahadat) will be amended/expanded to allow for

recording of evidence through video link, Skype, video conferencing, use of

screens or curtains to hide the identity of the witness as provided in Anti
Terrorism Act.

e. Provinces will be encouraged to introduce and implement witness protection

programs in accordance with Witness Protection Act.

f. Anti-hate speech laws will be strengthened and implemented.

**_Police & LEAs_**

10. State institutions must ensure that they uphold the law in order to inspire society to

do the same. Accountability mechanisms will therefore be enhanced to ensure that

laws and regulations are applied in a non-partisan, independent and transparent

manner.

a. Police Oversight Bodies consisting of the Provincial Government (which has

the ultimate responsibility of Superintendence of Police), members of civil

society and Professionals (retired Judges, lawyers and/or Citizen-Police

Liaison Committees) will be constituted to ensure overall institutional

accountability at the Provincial level. For the purpose of internal


-----

accountability, each provincial police department shall create an internal

affairs branch.

b. Public complaints shall be facilitated through measures such as online

complaint registration; police helpline and the use of SMS for routing

complaints. Public Facilitation Centres shall be established to address public

queries.

c. LEAs will set up dedicated desks to provide information under the ‘Right to

Information’ Act.

d. LEAs will establish strategic communications units to improve citizen liaison,

dissemination of information and responsiveness to various stakeholders.

11. Policing needs to be improved significantly in Pakistan in terms of performance,

accountability and effectiveness for the NISP to be successful. The Police is the

primary law enforcement agency that provides the first line of defence against all

unlawful activities. The para-military forces and armed forces provide second and

third lines of defence and must only be used as the last resort.

a. Coordination mechanisms will be introduced to bridge the communication gap

between the police and other actors of the criminal justice system.

b. Capacity building and training programs for the CTD will be enhanced to

incorporate international best practices to avoid mishandling or

mismanagement of sensitive issues.

12. Digital and Electronic record keeping systems will be established in all segments of

the police organization.

13. Collection of forensic evidence in all cases will be made mandatory by amending the

Police rules.

14. Police stations will be digitized and made accessible through electronic means.

Systems will be established to facilitate online FIR registration and electronic

submission of challans to the prosecution and courts. Such systems have already been

established in Punjab and KP. Other provinces will be encouraged to established

similar system.

15. Compensation structure of LEAs will be amended to incorporate working hours,

risks and stress level.


-----

16. Completion of forensic science laboratories will be prioritized in all provinces.

Highly qualified scientists will be appointed to head the forensic science laboratories.

Recruitment will be open to the private sector with competitive salaries. Forensic Lab

data in provinces will be interlinked for data sharing and accessing facilities.

17. Community Policing will be expanded to foster trust, open communication and

engagement between the police and local communities. Existing Community policing

initiatives will be appraised and used to inform the development of a new National

Community Policing Plan (NCPP).

18. Integrated national database comparing CNIC, Driving License, Finger prints,

Immigration Entry/Exits, Toll Plaza Entries, Vehicle number plate, Arms License,

mobile SIM details etc. will be set up. Criminal Record database will be unified at

national level with the access available to all the law enforcement agencies.

19. Recently established Cyber Patrolling Unit at FIA will be resourced and empowered

to monitor Social Media including Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter etc. to curb their

misuse for unlawful activities.

20. The existing video surveillance system will be upgraded through early completion of

safe city projects and integrating the video surveillance systems of private

establishments with that of public areas.

21. In consultation with provinces, National Police Bureau will bring all training

institutions under uniform minimum standards of training.

22. Efforts will be made to give Police Department full financial autonomy.

###### 23. Cost of investigation will be reviewed and rationalized on yearly basis.

**_Prosecution_**

24. An independent office of Prosecutor General will be established in all provinces.

This will include mechanism to enhance accountability for failure of prosecution and

curtail low conviction rates.

25. All Information Systems (Police, Prosecution, Forensics, Prisons and Courts) will be

integrated.

26. A robust and closely interlinked system based on modern technology connecting

Police Stations, Investigation, Forensic Science Laboratories, Bomb Disposal Units,

Prosecution, Courts and Prisons will be established.


-----

40. Reforming the sentencing structure for non-violent petty crimes will include

alternatives to imprisonment such as fines, probation and community confinement,

community services and psychological treatment of drug addicts.

41. Technical training center with the capacity of various technical trades and all

recreational facilities/games will be provided at each prison for the welfare of

prisoners.

42. Prison Management Information Systems (PMIS) will be installed in all prisons.

43. Family quarters will be established for conjugal rights.

44. Under trial prisoners, who are expected to stay longer than six months in the prisons

will be involved in skills development courses. Prisoners under imprisonment

extending up to 14 years will be provided an opportunity to improve their educational

qualification.

45. More prisons at District level, Central Prison, Juvenile and women prisons at division

level will be established.

46. Biometric System will be established at prisons linked to NADRA.

47. Wages for convict labour will be at par with market / minimum wages.

**_Parole and Probation_**

48. Parole and Probation risk assessment templates will be formulated.

49. The provincial governments will devise and implement a comprehensive workable

M&E framework to regulate and monitor the affairs of the probationers/ parolees for

their reintegration in the society as law-abiding citizen.

50. The government will notify rehabilitation standards to enhance the effectiveness of

probation and parole laws.

51. Probation and Parole registers/records will be computerized, including particulars of

probationers.

###### H1.4 Realizing Technological Potential

Information/data management is key to public service delivery in the 21[st] century.

Modern technology will be leveraged to improve processes, enhance efficiency and

effectiveness, increase transparency and institutionalize new ways of delivering public

services. Already, the Integrated Border Management System, Safe City project and the


-----

biometric SIM registration system are successful examples of using information technology

to achieve these objectives. New initiatives will also be launched along the following lines:

52. A number of new information systems will be developed and deployed. NADRA will

be empowered to take a lead on the development/implementation of these systems.

These include:

a. Information Systems proposed under the criminal justice system reforms

(already mentioned in preceding section).

b. Pakistan Visa processing system designed to streamline visa applications.

c. National centralized vehicle database.

d. National criminal database and fingerprint identification system.

**_H1.5 Securing Cyber Spaces_**

Militant organizations use cyberspaces for propagating their messages, recruitment and

generating funding. Many individuals and organizations also launch attacks on critical

infrastructure that is supported by IT such as financial, communication or energy sectors, etc.

It is envisaged in this policy that:

53. A National Cyber Security Strategy shall be developed to secure services and

infrastructure from cyber-attacks. A combined civil-military cyber command force

shall be established to ensure intra and inter agency coordination.

54. Cybercrimes Wing at FIA and Cyber Security Wing at NACTA will be strengthened

and their capacity enhanced to curb cybercrimes and monitor misuse of cyberspaces

for extremist or proscribed organizations in collaboration with PTA.

55. Public campaigns will be launched to promote awareness about cyber security

threats.

**_H1.6 Combating Financing of Terrorism_**

56. Anti Terrorism Act (1997) and Anti Money Laundering Act (2010) provide strict

laws in Pakistan against financing of terrorism. Steps are being taken to improve

enforcement of these laws by establishing an effective CFT (Combating Financing of

Terrorism) regime in the country with investigative, analytical, deterrent and

preventive roles. A National Task Force on Choking Financing of Terrorism – a


-----

coordinating body of over 20 Federal and Provincial Organisations has already been

established to improve inter-agency coordination in this regard. Stringent controls on

cross-border movement of money and branchless/internet banking have been

enforced in collaboration with the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) at SBP. FMU

has already prepared its own AML-CFT (Anti Money Laundering – Combating

Financing of Terrorism) strategy in this regard. The following steps will be taken on

an urgent basis to further enhance the CFT capability:

a. Facilitation and Regulation of Charities Act will be enacted to ensure that

every penny donated into charity is accounted for. Existing laws will be

reviewed and amended where necessary to bring them at par with international

standards. An INGO policy has already been enforced by the Ministry of

Interior to regulate the registration, working, funding, monitoring and other

related aspects pertaining to all types of INGOs functioning in Pakistan.

b. Fully trained and equipped CFT units are being established at federal and

provincial counter-terrorism departments to investigate money laundering,

terror financing, asset tracing and financial investigation. Similarly,

specialized training will be provided to the prosecution and judicial branches

of the criminal justice system to improve conviction rates.

c. All necessary steps will be taken to implement international agreements with

regards to acting on funding sources of terrorism and proscribed organisations.

Regional and international collaboration in tackling militant networks will be

enhanced.

d. Efforts will be made to enforce an arms embargo, impose travel restrictions,

freeze movable and immovable property and curtail the fund raising ability of

Proscribed organisations.

**_H1.7 Management of Western Zone_**

57. As a result of exalted pressure exerted through Operations Zarb-e-Azb and Radd-ul
Fasaad, a number of wanted terrorists have fled to safe heavens across the border in

Afghanistan. In order to accrue full dividends of these initiatives and curb the threat

of transnational terrorism, the management of western zone will be prioritized. This

includes the following:


-----

a. Construction of required forts, fencing and posts along the Afghanistan
Pakistan border will be completed.

b. Raising of additional FC Wings will be continued in three phases. First phase

has already been completed in Financial Year 2016/17 and the next two

phases will be completed by 2020.

c. Operationalisation of formal crossing points along Pak-Afghan and Pak-Iran

Border is also being carried out to promote trade, prevent illegal movement of

persons, human trafficking, narcotics and other contraband items while

facilitating movement of citizens across the countries.

**_H1.8 Miscellaneous_**

58. No armed groups of any hue or colour will be tolerated in the country. The

government will continue to use all means necessary to eliminate all militant

organisations and ensure the State’s lawful monopoly over violence. The ongoing

Karachi and Radd-ul-Fasad operations will therefore be taken to their logical

conclusions. The capacity of Civilian Armed Forces will be enhanced so that they can

play more active role in combating terrorism.

59. Efforts will be made in coordination with provincial government and other

stakeholders to develop a plan for phased conversion of ‘B’ areas in Balochistan to

‘A’ areas. This is particularly needed along China-Pakistan Economic Corridor in the

short term.

60. Continued support will be provided to Special Security Division (SSD) of Pakistan

Army tasked with providing security to CPEC. All necessary steps will be takento

enhance the security of CPEC.

61. Laws related to a ban on unauthorized production, illicit trafficking, and possession,

use and display of weapons will be strictly enforced. A comprehensive de
weaponization strategy will be developed to recover illegal arms and place strict

controls over licensed weapons.

62. Efforts will be made to take effective steps towards curbing religious persecution in

Pakistan. These shall include preventing the abuse of existing laws, curbing forced

conversions, the continued protection of religious sites of minorities and enacting

specific anti-discrimination laws in line with Article 27 of the Constitution.


-----

63. Special security arrangements will be made during disasters whether manmade or

natural disaster. Proper educational and health facilities will be provided to IDPs in

case of such disasters and separate SOPs may be devised by Ministry of Interior on

handling of such situations and dealing with IDPs in consultation with NDMA and

relevant provincial authorities with a view to ensure safety and security of the

citizens of Pakistan from further damages.

64. Security of critical infrastructure including commercial, economic and

communication network, airports, railways, bridges, oil and gas pipelines, energy

projects, motorways and other installations will be reviewed and upgraded along

modern lines.

**H2. Reimagine**

Reimagining the society as a tolerant, inclusive and democratic polity will be pursued in

order to strengthen a shared vision for the nation.

**Rationale: Reimagining of the State-Society relationship entails responsibilities for the state**

and its citizens to promote practices and values which are shared and deep rooted in our

culture, heritage, religion, political consciousness and vision of our founding father. This

shared vision has been evident abundantly in our art, cultural and religious practices,

festivals, quest for democracy and lifestyle which though diverse in character - pulsate with a

unified force as a rich Pakistani Identity. These shared values of acceptance of diversity,

debate and tolerance will be promoted by the State and its institutions. This includes tasks

ranging from the re-imagining nationhood and citizenship to the promotion of practices that

build societal resilience against extremist and violent narratives

**Key areas of focus: Building a National Narrative; Reforming the Education System;**

Initiating Madrassa, Mosque & Media Reforms and increasing Tourism and Cultural

Activities for a safer, secure and stable Pakistan.

The Policy builds upon an inherent tolerance, forbearance and acceptance of diversity

underlying our religious and cultural values to propose a set of measures for a national

narrative that weaves people together for a peaceful, democratic and prosperous future. Key


-----

recommendations of the work done at NACTA of the National Counter Extremism

Guidelines and work done by Committee of Experts established by NACTA for developing

National Narrative against terrorism and extremism have been found instructive in this

regard.

**_H2.1 National Narrative_**

65. A comprehensive National Narrative against extremism and terrorism predicated on

the celebration of diversity and acceptance of plurality of thought and ideas is direly

needed. Aiming to ensure the primacy of the constitution and rule of law, this

narrative must draw strength from the teachings of Islam, values espoused by the

Constitution, the founding father Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and our rich

cultural heritage, art and literature to foster a fair, tolerant, inclusive and peaceful

society. NACTA will prepare a national narrative which encompasses all aspects of

Pakistani society and its values as a holistic and implementable document with the

following themes:

i. Religious harmony,

ii. Political stability,

iii. National and regional security,

iv. Education for tolerance and peace,

v. Culture for peace and social harmony,

vi. Inclusive economic development,

vii. Responsible Media,

viii. De-radicalization, Rehabilitation and reconciliation.

66. Celebration of cultural and religious diversity will be one of the most important

pillars of the new national narrative. A National Cultural Plan (NCP) will be charted

to celebrate cultural activities and festivals of all faiths and ethnicities. The plan will

involve the following activities:

a. Organisation of cultural festivals in each province to celebrate local cultures

and support for the preservation of folk music and poetry.

b. Recognition of local artists, unsung heroes and role models.

c. Preservation of cultural heritage sites and monuments of all faiths and cultural

groups.


-----

67. Civil society will be actively involved as a key partner and stakeholder in the process

of development of the new narrative and its dissemination to the wider society and

grassroots level.

68. A national interfaith harmony day will be celebrated annually to promote peaceful

coexistence and acceptance of diversity.

**_H2.2 Education System Reforms_**

Efforts have been made in last five years to substantially improve the provision of

education in all federating units of the country. In particular, enrolments and retention rates

have increased on an overall basis. Much however, still needs to be done, especially with

regards to education content and delivery, to build learners’ resilience to violent extremism.

Some of these reforms will be as follows:

69. Government will continue to increase resource allocation on education to bring it at

par with at least 4% of GDP. Additional funds will be used to bridge the gap in the

standard of education between public and private institutions.

70. Minimum national standards will be set for Madrassas, public and private education

sectors.

71. Curriculum reforms will be one of the most important components of education

system reforms. Across the board curriculum reform in both mainstream institutions

and madrassas will be initiated to bring it in conformity with the new national

narrative proposed above. In collaboration with the provinces, curriculum guidelines

and standards will be developed to ensure that textbooks are free of hate content,

racial, gender and regional stereotypes/prejudices and glorification of war and

violence. Content on the modern concept of citizenship, which stresses

commonalities among all people, irrespective of their backgrounds, and which

derives its values from the basic fundamental rights enriched in the Constitution, will

be developed. In this regard, a review of the curriculum of Pakistan studies and

Islamic studies shall be prioritized.

72. The subjects of social studies and civic education shall be introduced as mandatory

subjects at high school and college level. These subjects will help students develop a

basic understanding of different religions and social issues before they embark on the

path of specialization in their respective fields.

73. Teachers need to be trained on how to prevent the growth of violent extremism in

classrooms and campuses. The federal government shall design and deliver a teacher


-----

training program on preventing violent extremism in collaboration with provincial

governments and development partners.

74. Child safety education will be mandated at all schools to prevent child abuse and

bullying.

75. Inter-province teacher and student exchange programs will be introduced to promote

social cohesion and harmony.

76. Access to education will be improved in rural areas and deprived regions of the

country. In militancy-affected areas like the tribal areas, physical infrastructure of the

schools destroyed by militants shall be laid. Girls’ education shall be prioritized too,

especially in areas where militants have threatened girls attending schools.

77. Career and general counselling units shall be created at all educational institutions to

provide much-needed guidance and mentorship to students.

78. Debating societies will be established at educational institutions to help students

develop critical thinking skills and reconcile difference of opinion. The ultimate

purpose of such activities will be the creation of safe spaces for students at university

campuses.

79. Higher Education Commission will devise guidelines for the implementation of the

interventions that fall in their domain. Furthermore, it will be mandated with

ensuring continued improvements in the quality of research increasing the number of

world class research institutions in the country.

**_H2.3 Madrassa Reforms_**

80. Registration and regularization of madrassas in a uniform manner in all provinces

will be ensured. In this regard, all provinces will be encouraged to develop legislation

for mainstreaming madrassas and undertake madrassa reforms.

81. Conditional state funding in return for a financial audit, adoption of national

curriculum, teaching of science subjects and examinations system will be

institutionalized.

82. Avenues to switch from madrassa to the mainstream education system will be created

at a level equivalent to years 5 and 10 of schooling. This will allow students currently

enrolled at madaris a chance to join mainstream education system at various stages of

their educational career.


-----

83. Increased collaboration will be promoted between madrassas, public and private

educational systems, including student and teacher exchange programs as well as

joint academic and co-curricular events. This will not only reduce mutually
harboured misconceptions and distrust but must also lead to shared research and

insights into the drivers of and solutions for insecurity, militancy, and extremism.

**_H2.4 Mosque Reforms_**

84. Federal government will work with provinces and religious leaders to initiate wide
ranging reforms aimed at making mosques centres of learning and religious guidance

for people. A phased program, to be initiated from Islamabad Capital Territory, will

be launched along the following lines:

a. A committee of religious scholars (with representation from all schools of

thought) will be established for the formulation of a recommended syllabi,

examination and training for Imams.

b. Specialized training will be offered to Imams under the supervision of the

committee of religious scholars and administered by Ministry of Religious

Affairs. Standardization of training and expertise of Imams will be ensured

through state-conducted exams leading to specific qualifications.

c. Qualified Imams will be incentivized through a monthly stipend paid by the

government.

d. Recommended guidelines and narrative for Friday sermons will be prepared

by the committee of religious scholars in collaboration with government. Civic

values will also be promoted as part of religious sermons. Some progress has

already been made in this regard in the ICT.

e. Funding will be offered to set up libraries at mosques and centres for Islamic

studies under the supervision of Ministry of Religious Affairs assisted by the

committee of scholars. Mosque committees will be reviewed and reconstituted

to ensure effective management. All funds raised for setting up, maintenance

or expansion of mosques will be audited by the government to ensure

transparency.

**_H2.5 Media Regulation_**

85. Steps will be taken to ensure the strict implementation of Pakistan Electronic Media

Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) regulations pertaining to hate speech, fake news,

racial prejudice and the glorification of terrorism and terrorist organisations. 10% of


-----

the content earmarked for public service messages will be used to share messages

against extremism.

86. Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), which regulates the internet, shall

secure online spaces to curb provocative statements and hate speech.

87. Religious publications and other print media will also be regulated and monitored to

ensure that no material preaching hate or glorifying terrorism is published.

**_H2.6 Tourism and Cultural Activities_**

88. A National Cultural Plan will be developed to reflect national, provincial and local

cultures that exist in Pakistan. Cultural diversity including traditional festivals will be

celebrated so as to engage youth in constructive activities.

89. Departments dealing with culture, such as the censor board, will be restructured by

engaging professionals. The government will continue to support Pakistani cinema

and film industry by offering tax rebates as well as reduced sales tax and customs

duty on import of film and drama production equipment.

90. Tourism will be promoted in the country and tourist friendly policies will be adopted.

Religious tourism will also be enhanced, reducing fears of people to visit shrines,

temples etc.

**H3. Reconcile**

Reconciliation with individuals/groups willing to shun the path of violence will be

pursued through a transparent mechanism established within the ambit of constitution.

**Rationale: The incentives for shunning of violence and militancy and for re-integration have**

to be made greater than the continuation of militancy and anti-societal discourse and

practices. Many Muslim countries (such as Indonesia and Bangladesh) have formulated

effective programs for re-integration and reconciliation with regards to former militants,

which draws upon the militants and victims’ families, and the authority of respected

community and religious figures.

**Key areas of focus: Key priority areas in this regard have to be the worst affected areas due**

to insecurity and terrorism. In this regard, FATA, Balochistan, and areas of KP and Karachi

have to be paid particular attention. Due to social and political contestation, these areas have


-----

been hotbeds of unrest and targets of subsequent security operations. An incentive structure

to provide a way out to militants stuck in the cycle of violence, de-radicalization and

rehabilitation programs and an outright ban on use of violence for achieving political goals

are key to improve security.

Following steps will therefore be taken to achieve these objectives:

91. Efforts will be made to build consensus on offering incentives for militants under

clear and transparent terms to shun violence.

a. A mechanism will be developed to review cases of militants who agree to

cooperate with the law enforcement agencies.

b. De-radicalisation and rehabilitation programs will be used to enable former

militants to join the mainstream. Professionals and moderate scholars will be

engaged for the said purpose.

c. Alternative livelihoods either by providing jobs, vocational trainings or other

means will be provided to former militants once they are certified not being a

security risk.

d. As experimented with successfully in Indonesia, family members of foot

soldiers who submit to surrender and rehabilitation programs, will be provided

livelihood by the state in the meanwhile.

e. Children of suspected and caught militants must be taken care of. This is

important as leaving the next generation without support and viable guiding

figures has been proven to increase vulnerability towards extremism and

violence.

f. Former militants, designated terrorists and members of armed gangs will be

barred from political activities for a specified number of years depending on

the nature of their activities by the commission.

92. No armed group must be allowed to operate a political wing and participate in

electoral processes and vice versa.

93. NACTA will compile data on Pakistani individuals linked with terror organizations

involved in war theatres abroad. Appropriate action will be taken to deal with

returning fighters.

94. Physical infrastructure such as educational institutions, healthcare facilities,

communications networks as well as other public and private dwellings damaged or


-----

destroyed as a result of terrorist activities or during military operations will be

reconstructed. This includes a fair assessment of losses and adequate compensation

of those affected.

95. Compensation Package for the personnel/people who lose their lives and limbs will

be made uniform across the country.

**H4. Redistribute**

Redistributive mechanisms will be enhanced and expanded to provide social protection to

marginalized groups in order to provide social justice.

**Rationale: Marginalization, poverty and political deprivation among several other reasons**

have been identified as the major causes of the development of feelings of alienation and

disgruntlement among the population and have led to breakdown of state and society

throughout history. The promotion of values, narratives, and discourses in the absence of

inclusive political, economic and social development with equal opportunity for all to

progress will not bear fruits unless real and shared material improvements in the life of

citizens is made. This all-encompassing vision for security of Pakistan holds true for ensuring

internal security of the country as well. And hence, NISP cannot remain oblivious to the

challenges posed by unequal socio-economic and political development of the country.

Moreover, a reoriented and expanded notion of security also entails a greater focus on the

welfare function of the State. Therefore, it is imperative that the state recognizes and protects

the marginalized sections of society through various interventions including redistributive

measures that provide for social safety nets with a focus on education, health and skill

development facilities to the poorest of the poor on priority. This will help improve state
society relations, reduce alienation of those at the bottom of the pyramid, and provide them

means for subsistence and upward social mobility.

Besides supporting the economically marginalised segments of society, the State must

also create an enabling environment for the economic and political empowerment of young

men and women to make them resilient against extremist narratives and help them become

active citizens. This will go a long way in fostering a new diverse, inclusive, and

participatory vision of Pakistani citizenship and nationhood.


-----

**Key areas of focus: Key priority areas in this realm will therefore be the social, economic**

and political uplift of marginalized groups such as youth, women and minorities. It is also

equally important to expand social safety nets for the most vulnerable sections of society and

prioritise underdeveloped areas of the country in development plans to reduce regional and

sub-national disparities.

Following steps will be taken to achieve these objectives:

96. Building resilience within society, especially youth, against radicalization will be

prioritized. This involves taking the following steps:

a. Creating more space for young people within various tiers of government

including local bodies. This includes involving youth in policy making

processes of the state and creating opportunities for them in the public sector

through internships and fellowship schemes. In the long run, the government

can consider undertaking legislation to introduce youth quota in national and

provincial assemblies.

b. Making public spaces women friendly to increase their participation in public

life. This includes strict enforcement of Women Protection Act and

affirmative action to enhance their participation in all spheres of life as well as

measures to reduce sexual harassment and discrimination.

c. Young people of the marginalized areas shall be uplifted by providing

preferred access to colleges and universities as well as vocational training.

d. Expanding vocational and technical training to provide skills to unemployed

youth. In this regard, special schemes shall be designed for young people from

underprivileged backgrounds and remote areas.

e. Catalysing job creation by incentivizing investment in productive sectors of

the economy e.g. manufacturing, encouraging the establishment of Small &

Medium enterprises, providing entrepreneurship training and easing access to

credit for youth.

f. Enacting laws to ensure gender equality and creating a safe work environment

for women to increase female participation in the labour force.

g. The government will create an enabling environment to help young people

become job creators rather than job seekers. In this regard, government will

introduce credit and loan schemes to give young people easy and affordable

access to finance. Moreover, bottlenecks in regulation regimes will be


-----

removed to encourage and incentivise young entrepreneurs to register

businesses.

97. Social safety nets (e.g. BISP) and health schemes for the most vulnerable sections of

the society will be expanded and continued to include the following:

a. Supporting marginalized groups to access basic amenities of life such as basic

nutritional needs including macro and micro nutrients, clean drinking water,

low cost housing as well as health and education facilities.

b. Supporting vulnerable groups stuck in modern slavery including (but not

limited to) child labour, unregulated brick kiln workers and sharecroppers.

98. The sub-national and regional disparities in economic development will be reduced

by prioritizing less-developed areas to bring them at par with relatively developed

parts of the country.

a. Government will ensure higher expenditure in infrastructure and the social

sector in less developed districts of the country.

b. Inhabitants of less developed areas will be given priority in public sector jobs

through affirmative action and local development initiatives will be focused

on highly productive sectors to generate employment.

c. Government will remain committed to the implementation of Khushhal

Balochistan program for provisioning of additional funds for socio-economic

uplift of the province.

99. In the wake of constitutional amendment to merge FATA with KP, the Federal

Government will retain substantive responsibility for the security and development of

FATA during the transition period. Government through the Ministry of SAFRON

will coordinate with the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and FATA Secretariat

to:

a. Ensure the rapid development of FATA through additional resources for a

period of at least five years.

b. Ensure the timely development of the administrative infrastructure required

for transition to the new dispensation.

c. Build the capacity of the administrative and legal institutions under the new

arrangements

d. Build the capacity of Law Enforcing Agencies (LEAs) to enable them to

perform normal policing functions.


-----

100. Marginalized groups such as women, transgender and differently abled

persons will be mainstreamed by facilitating their inclusion in educational

institutions as well as public and private sector workforce through affirmative action.

Vacant seats on quotas under these categories (where available) will be filled on

priority basis.

101. Economic value of domestic work by women who sacrifice their careers to

take up the responsibility of managing households and child rearing will be

acknowledged. Family Laws will be amended to take their in-kind financial support

to the family into consideration.

102. Anti Honour killing Act, Anti Rape Bill and Acid and Burn Crime Bill will be

strictly enforced/approved and further strengthened by including modern scientific

investigative methods such as DNA sampling to curb gender-based violence.

103. An audit will be done to review enforcement of labour laws and the working

conditions of labourers.

**H5. Regional Approach**

A regional approach will be pursued to promote a peaceful neighbourhood and

collaborate with the global community to deal with common challenges that may threaten

Pakistan’s internal security including extremism and terrorism.

**Rationale: Pakistan finds itself in an extremely volatile neighbourhood and a careful**

consideration of a number of factors such as the situation in Afghanistan, an unsettled agenda

of Kashmir and the turmoil in the Middle East and their potential spill over in the country

demands a serious and well-coordinated response by various governmental institutions.

Given that the security challenges posed by terrorism and extremism are transnational in

character, Pakistan needs to collaborate at the regional and international levels to tackle this

peril. Also, recent focus by various countries in the region on increasing trade, enhancing

connectivity and cooperating in the fields of energy and environment present important

opportunities that Pakistan must take advantage of. In this regard, a regional approach will be

pursued to promote a peaceful neighbourhood and collaborate with the global community to

deal with common challenges that may threaten Pakistan’s internal security and to maximise

benefits from improved economic linkages.


-----

**Key areas of focus: Key priority areas in this regard will be to actively work towards**

regional peace through meaningful cooperation with neighbouring countries and a shift from

geo-politics to geo-economics.

The following steps will be taken to address the country’s internal security challenges:

104. Pakistan will continue to work with the global community to ensure peace and

stability. Security and economic cooperation will be enhanced with developed as

well as emerging countries through bilateral as well as multilateral channels such as

the UN. International agreements and treaties will be implemented to fulfil country’s

international commitments.

105. Pakistan will continue to pursue regional peace and enhance diplomatic and

economic relations with all neighbouring countries. In particular, Afghanistan
Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and Solidarity will be implemented to achieve the

common objectives of eliminating terrorism and ensuring regional peace.

Mechanisms will be developed for intelligence sharing to evolve a joint approach to

common threats.

106. Focus will be placed on geo-economics and regional cooperation. Pakistan

will continue to actively engage with countries in the region bilaterally and through

regional forums such as SAARC, ECO, SCO and others. Similarly, brotherly

relations with Islamic countries will be further enhanced through bilateral and

multilateral channels such as OIC, GCC and Arab League.

107. Neighbouring countries will be encouraged to be a part of CPEC. Gwadar port

will be made a hub of regional and international trade, Pakistan will play a crucial

role as a regional pivot capitalizing on its strategic location at the crossroads of Asia

with China as its neighbour in the north, India in the east, and Iran and Afghanistan

in the west.

108. Pakistani soil will not be allowed to be used by any non-state actor to launch

attacks outside the country. Monopoly on violence of the Pakistani state (strictly in

accordance with the law) will be ensured and no militant group of any hue and colour

will be allowed to operate in the country irrespective of its ideology, scope, scale and

area of operations.


-----

109. Counter-intelligence efforts to expose foreign connections of militant groups

operating in Pakistan will be enhanced.

110. Efforts will be expedited to facilitate safe and dignified return of Afghan

refugees to their homeland in coordination with all relevant stakeholders. Steps will

be taken to ensure the registration of unregistered Afghan refugees.

**H6. Recognize**

Research capacity within the state and society will be enhanced to develop better

understanding of security challenges and inform policy in this area.

**Rationale: Critical research on various security challenges is required for designing policy**

interventions that address their root causes. High quality, nuanced, and localized research is

required to design policy interventions that work at multiple levels and through multiple

agencies of state and civil society. Very little serious academic research has gone into

investigating the social drivers of insecurity and extremism. Thus, the promotion of quality

research in academia and universities is essential in identifying the causal factors which push

social actors towards extreme viewpoints and actions. Moreover, research collaboration also

needs to be undertaken at the interface of the different educational systems in the country

(private, public, and madrassas), in order to identify shared problems and solutions, which

draw upon the diverse expertise and legitimacies of these diverse spheres. Finally, the

different outputs of these research activities have to be incorporated into policy-making and

state practices through integrated and institutionalized mechanisms.

**Key areas of focus: Key priority areas in this regard are to bring research in social sciences**

and humanities at par with that in STEM areas, move towards evidence-based policy making

and enhance analytical capacity within the Ministries of Interior and Information and

Broadcast as well as NACTA to improve decision/policy making.

The following steps will be taken in this regard:

111. Security Analysis & Research Cell (SARC) at Ministry of Interior run by

professionals will be established to provide research and analysis capability to

develop deeper understanding of security challenges. The Cell will work closely with


-----

think tanks, research centres, universities and other stakeholders to analyse cause and

effect mechanisms of security issues and provide tailored solutions and policy

recommendations.

112. The Counter Terrorism and Counter Extremism Centres of Excellence will be

established at NACTA run by professionals to provide research, analysis and training

support to various arms of government.

113. Pakistan Peace Collective (PPC) at the Ministry of Information will be

upgraded as the Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence to provide research,

analysis and training support to various government departments.

114. The proposed Centres of Excellence at MoI, NACTA and MoIB will liaise

with various national and international partners to share experiences and develop

research collaborations.

115. Centres of research excellence – operating with wider definitions of security –

will be established at the major varsities in each province and each major city with

funding from state and private donors to promote research on aspects of extremism,

insecurity and securitization from critical political economy, social, humanitarian,

and anthropological perspectives.

116. An annual conference will be held in Islamabad or in one of Centres of

Research Excellence which gathers experts from all centres along with

representatives from various arms of the state (executive, judiciary, LEAs,

parliamentary representatives etc.). This will help in corroborating research and

practical findings orienting future research and action goals, and increase synergies

between academia and policy-making/implementation.

117. Funds will be provided to each public university to invite scholars working on

Pakistani and South Asian history and society abroad to come and give lectures, lead

discussions and study circles with local students. This will increase the next

generation’s exposure to diverse viewpoints and ameliorate binaries which promote

extremism such as “East-West”, “traditional-modern” etc.

118. The proportion of HEC MS/MPhil/PhD scholarships for social science and

humanities will be brought at par with those provided to scholars pursuing STEM

fields. Social science and humanities scholars trained abroad should be provided

special incentives to come back and teach in public varsities in Pakistan. This will

help develop plural discourses and research cultures with regards to societal issues in

Pakistan.


-----

119. Bi-weekly, student-led study circles will be instituted on various issues of

history, society and philosophy in all major departments of public and private

universities. This will help students in getting exposure to multiple narratives of

society and history and equip them to become more conscientious and active citizens

in the future.

a. Government functionaries, especially those of local government, police etc.,

should regularly join these circles to increase civic and democratic

engagement of students with prevailing state structures.

120. Student societies, fully managed by students through elected councils will be

promoted on campuses along with ensuring their adherence to non-violence. These

will provide training grounds for students to learn the deliberative mechanisms of

democracy, and a focus on resolving outstanding issues through debate, negotiation

and concession. This can provide an effective antidote to prevailing alienation which

increases vulnerability and susceptibility to violent narratives.

#### I. NISP Priority List 

While the policy comprehensively covers all key aspects of internal security, it is deemed

necessary here to identify areas that need immediate attention. A shorter list therefore

containing areas representing top national priorities at the onset of the NISP 2018 has been

provided below. The list however can be reviewed and updated annually after thorough

review by the implementation committee.


-----

#### NISP Priority List


**Reorient:**

1. Interprovincial Coordination Committees on Internal Security headed by Minister for

Interior will be established at the levels of Chief Ministers and Home Ministers. An

executive Committee chaired by Minister for Interior will be established to oversee

the implementation of NISP 2018. It will be assisted by an Advisory Committee

comprising key members from civil society to independently report on the status of

implementation.

2. Criminal justice system reforms are essential in establishing rule of law, shortcomings

of which necessitated the establishment of military courts as a short term solution. It

is important that CJS is overhauled on urgent basis so that the accused can be

prosecuted and tried under civilian dispensation.

3. Ongoing military operations will be taken to their logical conclusion. Capacity of

LEAs, CAF and civil administration will be enhanced to consolidate gains made

through kinetic measures.

4. Comprehensive measures will be taken to combat financing of terrorism through an

effective CFT regime.

**Reimagine:**

5. A comprehensive National Narrative against extremism and terrorism predicated on

acceptance of plurality, diversity and tolerant teachings of Islam will be prepared and

disseminated.

6. In today’s competitive world soft image and brand of a country play an important role

in economic and security domains. All stakeholders will therefore cooperate in

building the brand Pakistan as a democratic, peaceful and responsible state.

7. Across the board curriculum reform in both mainstream institutions and madrassas

will be initiated to bring it in conformity with National Narrative, adopting some level

of standardization of education, having certain common goals and objectives.

8. Registration and regularization of madrassas in a uniform manner in all provinces will

be ensured and provinces will develop legislation for undertaking madrassa reforms.

Wide-ranging reforms to make mosques centres of learning and religious guidance for

people will be introduced. Guidelines and narrative for Friday sermons will be

prepared by the government in consultation with the Ulema.

9. A nation-wide Cultural Action Plan will be charted, to celebrate cultural activities and


-----

traditions of all faiths and ethnicities including the organization of cultural festivals in

each province to celebrate local cultures, folk music, film, poetry, recognition of local

artists, unsung heroes, role models and preservation of cultural heritage sites and

monuments.

**Reconcile:**

10. Efforts will be made to build consensus on offering incentives for militants under

clear and transparent terms to shun violence.

11. De-radicalisation and rehabilitation programs will be incorporated to enable former

militants to join the mainstream.

12. No armed group will be allowed to operate a political wing and participate in electoral

process and vice versa.

**Redistribute:**

13. Social, economic and political uplift of marginalized groups such as youth, women

and minorities will be undertaken.

14. Social protection safety nets and health schemes for the most vulnerable sections of

the society will be expanded and continued to include the marginalized and

vulnerable groups.

15. The sub-national disparities in economic development will be reduced by prioritizing

less-developed areas to bring them at par with relatively developed parts of the

country.

**Regional Approach:**

16. Pakistan will continue to promote a peaceful neighbourhood in the region

17. Monopoly on violence will be the sole prerogative of the state and no armed groups of

any hue and colour will be allowed to operate in the country

18. Focus will be placed on geo-economics and regional cooperation, neighbouring

countries will be encouraged to be a part of CPEC.

**Recognize:**

19. Research in social sciences and humanities will be brought at par with that in STEM

areas in terms of funding and importance.

20. The Counter Terrorism and Counter Extremism Centres of Excellence will be

established and run by professionals to provide research, analysis and training support

to various arms of government.


Table 2: NISP Priority List

#### J. Implementation & Oversight

A robust implementation mechanism will be established to oversee the implementation of

NISP 2018. This will include the following:

**NISP Implementation Committee**

A high-level committee will be established to periodically oversee the implementation of

NISP 2018. The committee will be chaired by the Minister for Interior and include the

following:

Minister of Interior (Chairperson)

Committee will be empowered to invite representatives from other state institutions,

government ministries, departments and LEAs as and when required.

**Advisory Committee on Internal Security**

The implementation committee will constitute an advisory committee that will prepare and

submit quarterly report to the implementation committee on progress made. This may include

members of the civil society, former members of law enforcement agencies, judiciary and

bureaucracy, legal experts, academics, youth, women and minority representatives and

security experts. The Committee will have representation from all federating units of the

country. Information required to prepare progress report will be furnished by the relevant


-----

government departments when requested by the committee. A dedicated secretary will be


appointed to provide administrative support to the committee.
